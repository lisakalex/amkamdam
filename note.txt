The main difference is in this example:

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Yandex</title>

</head>
<body>
    <a href="((http://yandex.ru))">Яндекс</a>,
    <a href="((http://yandex.com))">Yandex</a>
</body>
<script>

var elems1 = document.getElementsByTagName('a'), // return 2 lements, elems1.length = 2
    elems2 = document.querySelectorAll("a");  // return 2 elements, elems2.length = 2

document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("a"));

console.log(elems1.length, elems2.length);  // now elems1.length = 3!
                                            // while elems2.length = 2
</script>
</html>
Because querySelectorAll returns a static (not live) list of elements.
