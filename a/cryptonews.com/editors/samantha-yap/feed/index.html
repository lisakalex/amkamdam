										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This space wasn&#8217;t a focus for most law firms until last year.</p><p>The meteoric rise of startups still looking to launch Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), despite market setbacks, has led to a surge in demand for lawyers with expertise in this space. </p><p>Especially at a time when the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a probe into cryptocurrency businesses, cryptocurrency startups are going to want to make sure they have the right legal teams to help them legitimize their projects to participate in this fundraising method. </p><p><i>Cryptonews.com</i> speaks with Lee Schneider, Partner at McDermott, Will &amp; Emery, and Nick Abrahams, Partner and Global Head of Technology and Innovation at Norton Rose Fulbright who both have experience advising clients on business activities relating to cryptocurrencies, ICOs and blockchain technology.</p><p>&ldquo;Right now we are in a situation where there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. We&rsquo;re trying to give guidance to people about their token sales while regulators are still trying to learn about tokens&rdquo;, said Schneider, who was one of the lawyers who helped write the securities law that the crypto exchange Coinbase open sourced in December 2016.</p><p>&ldquo;Legal compliance is a critical investment and a major differentiator,&rdquo; said Abrahams who has been advising clients on blockchain and cryptocurrency projects well before experiencing the sharp spike in cryptocurrency activity last year, which led to more clients. </p><p>Finding the right lawyer, getting creative about laws and keeping watch on emerging regulation are all steps cryptocurrency startups should be taking this year.  </p><p><b>Finding the right legal team</b></p><p>The first piece of advice that Schneider gives startups in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t commit fraud.&rdquo;</p><figure class="left"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5aa/4d522abde5.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 300px, 300px" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5aa/4d522abde5.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5aa/4d522abde5.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5aa/4d522abde5.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5aa/4d522abde5.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Lee Schneider</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;They should talk with a lawyer before they do anything so that they can at least understand what the legal implications are,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>What they want to avoid happening is being in the situation the founders of the Tezos tech project are in with a class-action lawsuit against them filed by US regulators that alleges they deceptively sold unregistered securities in violation of both federal and state law after their record-breaking USD 232m ICO in July, 2017.</p><p>However, cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation is still a very niche area so there are not many lawyers who have the expertise and experience in this field. </p><p>&ldquo;This space wasn&#8217;t a focus for most law firms until last year,&rdquo; said Abrahams.</p><p>As for what to look for in a lawyer, startups need to find one that will help them understand the regulatory regime, and to keep them informed of what they&rsquo;re getting their business into. </p><p>&ldquo;I would advise startups to look for law firms that have a deep understanding of the sector and if applicable, strong financial services regulatory and securities law capabilities,&rdquo; said Abrahams. </p><p><b>Striking the right balance </b></p><p>Navigating legal processes in an area that is still severely unregulated doesn&rsquo;t just require experience and knowledge but also a &lsquo;dash&rsquo; of creativity. </p><p>Cryptocurrency startups are having to strike the right balance in adhering to emerging regulation but also ensuring they&rsquo;re growing their startup in an innovative way.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;being presented with a series of interesting mental puzzles,&rdquo; says Schneider. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having to take existing concepts that we know and try to fit new ways of doing things into those concepts. Sometimes we even try to reshape those boxes,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He goes on to explain that people who are trying to come up with easy answers are not doing their job. </p><p>&ldquo;People are going to be grappling with these complicated legal issues for a long time,&rdquo; he said. </p><figure class="left"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5aa/4d57705821.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 300px, 300px" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5aa/4d57705821.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5aa/4d57705821.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5aa/4d57705821.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5aa/4d57705821.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Nick Abrahams</figcaption></figure><p>Abrahams, who has been involved in a wide range or projects in this field from advising issues of ICOs to advising financial institutions and venture capital firms on investments in crypto and blockchain businesses, recommends startups choose the right law firm for their business.</p><p>&ldquo;The spectrum of law firms include small boutique single jurisdiction firms to large multinational law firms,&rdquo; he said. </p><p><b>Keeping watch on Regulation &amp; Guidelines</b></p><p>Being on top of what financial regulators around the world are doing to regulate cryptocurrencies and ICOs is of interest to anyone working in the industry. </p><p>Switzerland&rsquo;s finance watchdog FINMA, for example, is the most recent jurisdiction to issue guidelines stating that payment tokens will not be deemed securities, but asset backed tokens will be. </p><p>On a global scale, while countries like Japan are seen to have a well functioning virtual currency regulation, the world is also seeing China and South Korea going in the opposite direction. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;If you do a token launch, it is probably going to be a global event,&rdquo; said Schneider. </p></blockquote><p>If companies are opening up their token sales to anyone in the world they need to be sensitive to the laws in all jurisdictions.</p><p>&ldquo;I often advise clients on the more conservative side. For example, it is important to know your investors and where they are from,&rdquo; explains Schneider. </p><p>Schneider also reminds startups about the &ldquo;tax man&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s important to understand what the tax implications are in the jurisdictions the startups are located. </p><p>With respect to securities transactions the ultimate aim is to protect people from fraud. </p><p>Abrahams warns that, &ldquo;countries will increase their regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Regulatory outlook for 2018</b></p><p>With talk about how 2018 is going to be the year cryptocurrencies will become regulated, Schneider encourages regulators not to stifle innovation by overly regulating the industry.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a temptation to say that the technology should be regulated in a particular way as a whole. I would flip it around and say sometimes these new technologies actually help us change the way we think about regulation,&rdquo; said Schneider.</p><p>For example new technology could help regulators think about the first principles of new legislation. In the case of cryptocurrencies, that would be anti-fraud. </p><p>As the hype of ICOs stabilizes, there will still be a continuous stream of startups seeking to do things the right way to avoid future legal implications.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>
</p><p>&ldquo;Activity in the crypto space will stay strong as long as there is not a complete collapse in the price of cryptocurrencies,&rdquo; said Abrahams.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>In addition to that, activity and investment by financial institutions and large corporates in blockchain technology will not be affected by crypto prices. </p><p>&ldquo;This activity is already strong and will continue to grow steadily across 2018,&rdquo; said Abrahams.</p>

The &lsquo;wonder woman&rsquo; in tech is not very visible and this needs to change,&rdquo; she said in an interview with <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p><p>As a modern day tech &lsquo;wonder woman&rsquo; Dr Thomason advises several blockchain startups with applications that solve global problems meanwhile acting as CEO of Abt Associates Australia, a social impact research and consulting service for global companies. </p><p>Thomason is also currently co-developing blockchain technology proof of concepts (POCs) that will help financial inclusions, identity, government services and microgrid solar energy in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Indonesia.</p><p><b>Tech for women</b></p><p>In all the work she does, she wants to get more women to see that there is a place for them in the tech world. </p><p>&ldquo;We have a subconscious shaping of girls into the social sciences rather than the hard sciences but women need to see that they too can start a tech company or join a tech team,&rdquo; said Dr Thomason. </p><p>As an advocate for the education and empowerment of women in blockchain, she is part of the founding team for the World Blockchain Academy for Girls which addresses the issue that 130 million girls around the world do not go to school and only a third of all university students are female.</p><p>The goal of this academy is to achieve gender parity among technologists globally.</p><p>Dr Thomason&rsquo;s motivation to encourage girls to pursue hard sciences such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects comes from her own personal education journey. </p><p><b>Heart for social impact</b></p><p>She studied community development at university in Queensland, Australia, and her first job out of university was on an Australian Volunteers Program in Indonesia. </p><p>&ldquo;I realized at the time that this was youthful zealotry and that I needed to get a discipline so I went back and studied public health,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>This lead her to focus on Papua New Guinea (PNG) as part of her research in her Masters degree in Tropical Public Health. </p><p>Dr Thomason lived with the villagers in PNG, where she had to go to isolated parts of the island  to understand the patterns of parasitic diseases such as malaria and filariasis.</p><p>&ldquo;There was no electricity, no telephone, no infrastructure  and no basic services there. In some places, the villagers had also never seen a white woman,&rdquo; said Dr Thomason.</p><p>Following her masters Dr Thomason later worked in the public health sector in PNG and other poor Asia Pacific countries on and off across 30 years and developed an intimate understanding of how difficult it is for citizens to access public healthcare.</p><p><b>Blockchain for emerging economies</b></p><p>In recent years Dr Thomason said she began writing several peer reviewed articles about blockchain technology. </p><p>Now, Dr Thomason has began to connect the dots and started to realize the technology is going to be really important for emerging economies. </p><p>It was through this experience that her focus turned to blockchain applications, particularly in enabling people to access healthcare, in emerging economies like PNG. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that PNG villagers have nothing, they have land, handicrafts and crops, but they are isolated and not connected to the economy. But if you can get them an identity and a digital wallet they can access financial services, microgrid solar power trading, healthcare, and this could even extend to voting one day&rdquo; she said.</p><p>In her work Dr Thomason realized the governor of the central bank of PNG is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/a-blockchain-lesson-from-papua-new-guinea-1273.htm">particularly interested in financial inclusion and has personal ambitions of legacy</a>. </p><p>Through this, Dr Thomason facilitated for the central bank of PNG to visit the London Blockchain Week in 2017, which resulted in the bank sponsoring the Hackathon this year as part of their mission to have full financial inclusion in the country by 2020.</p><p>Dr Thomason&rsquo;s ultimate goal for this year is to find out who is doing blockchain projects in developing countries and push for funding for them to accelerate the uptake of this technology.</p>

Picture by IDBox</figcaption></figure><p>The central bank of the Pacific Island Nation of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is implementing blockchain-based solutions, moving ahead of many startups whose ideas still exist only in white paper-form.</p><p>&ldquo;As a central bank, we want to make sure all citizens of Papua New Guinea have access to financial services, and as a regulator, we want to know and understand blockchain,&rdquo; Elizabeth Genia, assistant governor of the PNG central bank, said. </p><p>The state of 8 million people located on the northern tip of Australia is on a mission to solve its financial inclusion problem by 2020. PNG is currently lacking in infrastructure, when compared to countries with more developed economies. Genia envisions her country leapfrogging its developments with the help of blockchain tech.  </p><p>One of their initiatives this year is sponsoring the hackathon at London Blockchain Week in January &#8211; not something the public might expect the central bank of a Pacific Island from the other side of the world to do. </p><p>&ldquo;It is a central bank&rsquo;s duty to understand how all these emerging technologies might impact their citizens,&rdquo; said Genia. </p><p>The geography of PNG is mainly mountainous with deep valleys, so villages are often remote and isolated with no main roads from the capital city to connect them. PNG seeks to deliver transparent government services and support to a nation of people who speak 800 languages and have unique cultures.</p><p>&ldquo;In PNG, you are starting from scratch,&rdquo; Genia said. Blockchain piqued the interest of the central bank of PNG in 2016, when they saw more commercial banks looking into fintech and mobile money. </p><p><b>A Memorable Pitch</b></p><p>When bank representatives attended London Blockchain Week in early 2017, Genia was &ldquo;blown away&rdquo; by the winning pitch of the hackathon. As in this year&rsquo;s hackathon, 2017 participants were tasked with solving problems for a village in PNG with no electricity, internet or infrastructure. </p><p>The winning idea came from Julien Bouteloup, an entrepreneur and blockchain technology developer with a background in studying electrical engineering and AI machine learning. </p><p>&ldquo;Everyone in the competition was trying to build a fantastic application of a smartphone app, but people in PNG do not have a smartphone or access to the internet,&rdquo; Bouteloup quickly realized. </p><p>With the aim of addressing the worldwide issue of people lacking a secure ID, he founded IDbox: &ldquo;a cost-efficient device that enables people in developing countries to create a unique identity.&rdquo;</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a9/10e4510d36.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a9/10e4510d36.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a9/10e4510d36.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a9/10e4510d36.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a9/10e4510d36.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5a9/10e4510d36.jpg 4608w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Julien Bouteloup demonstrates IDbox. 
Picture by IDBox</figcaption></figure><p>Bouteloup built a working prototype of the device, which would enable people to create a unique identification and also personally access grid electricity via an analog phone. </p><p>With the help of Jane Thomason, CEO of Abt Associates Australia, who facilitates global partnerships for the central bank of PNG,  the Australian Government granted funding for Bouteloup to travel to PNG to test his prototype. </p><p>&ldquo;If we can get this working at scale, it&rsquo;s going to change the lives of poor people in the world in the way we have never seen,&rdquo; said Thomason, who has worked in the public health sector in PNG for 30 years. </p><p>She also said if all Papua New Guineans can get an ID and access to a digital wallet, it will significantly improve the lives of the poor because they will be able to do things such as own their own land and get better access to health care. </p><p><b>Incentivization Is Key  </b></p><p>Bouteloup&rsquo;s journey to PNG opened his eyes to how isolated the villages are and how difficult it is for people to travel from one to another. His first trial took place in a village called Lalaura, just east of Port Moresby, the capital city of PNG. </p><p>&ldquo;When we left from Port Moresby to Lalaura village, it took us six hours to drive there on a massive pick-up truck,&rdquo; he said of his journey on bumpy roads filled with big potholes. </p><p>&ldquo;The entire trip changed my life; going to one of the most remote area in the world and seeing how technologies like blockchain can change people&rsquo;s lives on a daily basis,&rdquo; said Bouteloup. </p><p>Trialing a new piece of technology like the IDBox, which requires fingerprints, in a developing economy takes time. Time and patience are also required to create cultural understanding through education and training. During the trial, Bouteloup mainly dealt with the women in the village because they were the ones interested in the tech. According to Genia, in PNG, women are more engaged with managing finances in the family. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a9/10f53d49c5.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a9/10f53d49c5.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a9/10f53d49c5.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a9/10f53d49c5.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a9/10f53d49c5.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5a9/10f53d49c5.jpg 2112w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>A villager is using device at a shop. 
Picture by IDBox</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;Before implementing the device, we had to explain to the villagers that it is not attached to anything,&rdquo; said Bouteloup, who was wary of disturbing the established culture. </p><p>One of the main challenges he said he faced was that the village residents did not understand what they might need or how they might benefit from the IDs.</p><p>&ldquo;If you go there and tell people you want to give them access to a unique identification system, they will say &lsquo;what identity?&rsquo;&rdquo; he explained. So, Bouteloup focused on how to incentivize the project for the locals. </p><p>&ldquo;The only way to scale up a project in every part of the world is to provide incentivization for people to actually start using your device,&rdquo; he said. In the case of the PNG villagers, they were motivated by the incentive of trading electricity. Bouteloup designed a solar energy device to work with the IDBox, which generates free power and enable villagers to sell surplus power to others. </p><p>The IDBox  provides each villager with a unique identity they can use to access voting systems, health care and remittance services. IDBox could also reduce customary land ownership disputes, as it will provide a traceable ledger of property ownership. With an ID and blockchain technology, people could even tokenize their land assets on the public ledger. </p><p><b>The Future of Blockchain in PNG</b></p><p>One of the winning pitches of the hackathon this year was from a startup called GroundBlocks, which aims to solve the issue of land registration in countries like PNG by storing GPS boundary information with a distributed ledger of land ownership. </p><p>&ldquo;We hope that we can get more funding from the Australian government or the central bank of PNG [to carry out more blockchain trials],&rdquo; said Thomason. She encourages everyone to see blockchain not as just a &ldquo;cool new thing&rdquo; but as technology with the potential to transform the quality of life for people in developing economies. </p><p>Genia sees blockchain technology as a tool to empower the women in PNG, especially in areas with high rates of domestic violence.</p><p>&ldquo;With blockchain and IT technology, women, children, girls and students can be part of financial inclusion,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>Bouteloup said the potential for building blockchain-based solutions for developing countries is huge &ndash; unlike in developed economies, where existing infrastructures resist disruption. </p><p>In the case of PNG, there is no middle-man to disrupt. &ldquo;Blockchain is the new infrastructure,&rdquo; said Bouteloup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global blockchain players are urged to grow their businesses in China to help develop its fast growing economy and feed hungry Chinese investors. </p><p>Bo Ji, Assistant Dean to China&rsquo;s elite Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business (CKGSB) founded by Li Ka Shing, a Hong Kong business magnate, has asked European blockchain startups to consider capitalizing on the lucrative emerging Chinese market instead of going to the US. </p><p>&ldquo;Please do yourself a favor. Don&rsquo;t just innovate here. Go to China because they will love you,&rdquo; said Bo Ji to a room full of blockchain industry leaders at London Blockchain Week 2018 at the end of January. </p><figure style="max-width: 570px"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a8/bb55fdd78b.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 570px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a8/bb55fdd78b.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a8/bb55fdd78b.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a8/bb55fdd78b.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a8/bb55fdd78b.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Picture: Fintech Worldwide</figcaption></figure><p>Part of his mission as the Chief Representative to Europe for CKGSB, which boasts Jack Ma of Alibaba Group as part of its alumni, is to connect European blockchain startups with high profile and top-tier Chinese institutional investors such as Tencent Holdings, JD.com and Sequoia Capital via the school&rsquo;s &lsquo;China Start&rsquo; program. </p><p>&ldquo;Most foreigners particularly from the West are much loved in China. They think your technology is more superior and they think that you have something that they can trust more,&rdquo; said Bo Ji to <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. </p><p>The annual one week China Start program set to take place in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing in June this year, is tailored for ambitious startups and growth companies to learn, network and pitch their ideas in China.</p><p>For those interested in knowing what it takes to gain investments in China, Bo Ji offers <i>Cryptonews.com</i> three key tips on how blockchain startups can best pitch to Chinese investors. </p><p><b>1. &lsquo;Face-to-Face meetings cannot be replaced&rsquo;</b></p><p>Building the credibility of a business is the most important first step. </p><p>As China&rsquo;s society is built on relationship building, founders and entrepreneurs seeking investment, basically need to sell themselves &ndash; who they are and what they do.  </p><p>Chinese investors &ldquo;usually invest in people and in teams, so you need to show them that you have a great team and you are trustworthy,&rdquo; said Bo Ji. </p><p>He also adds that startups are not going to receive investments unless you have a face-to-face meeting with the investor not just once but a few times. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for you to go to China and also to invite Chinese investors to the UK,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>Bo Ji strongly advises startups to encourage investors to spend time visiting the UK or Europe to see their projects. </p><p>He said investors will be more likely to consider a deal when they have invested time and energy in learning about a startup. </p><p><b>2. &lsquo;The Chinese do business because we like each other&rsquo;</b></p><p>Entrepreneurs and founders need to have a connection with Chinese investors because likeability has a big role to play in building a working professional relationship.  </p><p>&ldquo;We [like to] feel comfortable with each other, not just because it is a good investment, but because it feels comfortable,&rdquo; said Bo Ji. </p><p>CKGSB&rsquo;s China Start program wants to help startups secure substantial funding from Chinese investors as well as develop commercial partnerships with China. </p><p>Startups essentially cannot gain investments if they have not established a comfortable working relationship with the investors.</p><p><b>3. Solve a big problem </b></p><p>Content is always king and so blockchain startups must show the investors what problem they want to solve and the scale of the problem. </p><p>&ldquo;Start with what kind of problem or issue you are trying to solve through blockchain,&rdquo; said Bo Ji.</p><p>&ldquo;Secondly, [address] how big the problem is, which means the market size and the potential value creation,&rdquo; he adds. </p><p>Chinese investors want to see tangible results and deliverables; therefore, demonstrating the methodology, use of technology, and the business model of the project will also contribute to killer pitch. </p><p>And finally when discussing how much money to ask for, it is essential to set out clearly what the intended resources will be used for. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to spend the money and at the end have no deliverables and have nothing good come out of it,&rdquo; said Bo Ji. </p><p>And with these three tips blockchain startups &ldquo;will make a winning pitch to Chinese investors.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want your blockchain story to be heard by the world, you&rsquo;ll need to work even harder this year. Soon, it won&rsquo;t be enough to use &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; or &ldquo;ICO&rdquo; as buzzwords in order to make it into the news. </p><p>Cryptonews.com speaks to two PR professionals with expertise in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, Ayelet Noff, Founder and CEO of Blonde 2.0 from Tel Aviv, Israel and Nicole Jordan, CEO of Radix Collective from Los Angeles in the US. Hear their insights on what PR firms can expect in the industry in 2018. </p><p>&ldquo;Crypto PR is a different animal to &ldquo;traditional PR&rdquo; approaches. It is a lot of work requiring an integrated marketing campaign and not just rote &lsquo;media relations practices,&rdquo; explained Jordan. </p><p>&ldquo;The crypto PR market has grown tremendously and we are facing huge demand,&rdquo; Noff added.</p><p>Both executed media strategies for startups launching Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) at the time the craze took off in June/July last year with Noff working on Stox&rsquo;s record-breaking raise of USD 33m in 34 hours and Jordan helping MetaX, a blockchain advertising agency raise USD 10m in 23 seconds. </p><p><b>Look for new angles </b></p><p>This is going to be a busy year for cryptocurrency and blockchain startups from a maturing of the ICO market to emerging regulation. </p><p>&ldquo;Right now, there is a saturation of ICOs, so we are going to see a survival of the fittest. It will also be harder for companies in 2018 to raise funds via ICOs&rdquo;, warns Noff, as the market has seen investors being inundated with investment requests. </p><p>There will also be a new wave of stories on product releases from startups that raised money via ICOs in 2017. </p><p>Jordan adds that the media will see &ldquo;news cycles focus on consumers increasingly adopting and being comfortable with day-to-day cryptocurrency usage.&rdquo;</p><p>When Noff helped Stox announce their ICO in mid-2017, launching an ICO was still a story. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;Today the fact that you are launching an ICO is not a story. Now, the story has to be around the technology the company is developing, its vision and what it is doing that is different to any other company out there,&rdquo; said Noff.</p></blockquote><p>While the world is still learning about blockchain, Jordan adds that the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain is far beyond reality. </p><p>&ldquo;Mainstream business and tech reporters joke all the time that they delete any email that has the word &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; in it because they&rsquo;re already burnt out. This is largely because everything is still a lot of vaporware,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>Moreover, in 2017, the majority of media attention in the space was devoted to the rise in prices for cryptocurrencies and ICOs, and less attention was given to the technology that underpins it all. </p><p>According to Jordan, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s high awareness among the press, but the deficit in the public&rsquo;s understanding of blockchain is disproportionate to the coverage it&rsquo;s getting.&rdquo; </p><p>Eventually, she sees blockchain startups joining the bunch of general tech companies without being singled out solely due to the technology. </p><p>&ldquo;Blockchain&rdquo; is the shiny new object &ndash; much like artificial intelligence is in other industries. Eventually, we&rsquo;ll stop leading with blockchain as the hook and focus more on the service the offering provides,&rdquo; said CEO of Radix Collective.</p><p><b>Huge Pressure</b></p><p>Finding the right story is only one of the challenges blockchain startups and PR agencies face in this fast-changing landscape. Managing a crypto company&rsquo;s profile in the press, on the other hand, is a different ball game to that of other technology companies due to the impact that one story can have on the price of the cryptocurrency. </p><p>Noff, who manages IOTA, one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in the world by market cap, said she has to be very immediate and responsive to any mention of the company in the media. For example, in early December, the value of IOTA jumped from 9th to 4th largest by market cap when they did their PR launch. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;With crypto, it is more instant. You are dealing with money, and the market is very volatile. I can see the instant effect that our PR activities have on the market cap of the cryptocurrency companies we handle,&rdquo; said Noff.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>Also, in order to minimize the risk of a misunderstanding, PR professionals need to find the right words for each channel.  </p><p>When pitching a crypto story, Noff shares that her team creates two press releases, one for crypto publications and one for the mainstream press. </p><p>Noff adds that if a mainstream journalist receives a crypto technical pitch, they probably won&rsquo;t look at it because it will be too difficult for them to decipher, whereas crypto journalists understand the terminology.</p><p><b>Evolving fees and filtering clients</b></p><p>Noff states that her firm&rsquo;s total revenue doubled last year due to crypto clients. They also began to &ldquo;put [their] money where [their] mouth is by accepting cryptocurrency as payment&rdquo;. </p><p>Blonde 2.0 was founded in 2006 and has always specialized in tech PR. But Noff has recently launched a separate section of her company called Blondechain to take care of the specific needs of cryptocurrency companies, which now make up 50% of her clientele.</p><p>For Jordan, fee prices have stayed the same at Radix Collective, where every PR professional has an hourly rate. While she said opportunities to take less cash in exchange for tokens has been presented to her, it is not a model that her firm subscribes to at this stage. </p><p>&ldquo;As one independent said &ndash; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pay my rent with tokens,&rdquo; Jordan recounted. </p><p>Also, Jordan and Noff quickly found that in fielding requests from new blockchain clients they needed to first assess the legitimacy of the startup before onboarding them. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;The teams that aren&rsquo;t innately familiar or involved with crypto were always the ones thinking they could turn around a white paper in two weeks and then pump out a token sale four weeks later and &ndash; BOOM! &ndash; have their USD 20&ndash;40 million,&rdquo; said Jordan. </p></blockquote><p>Entrepreneurs with little understanding of the community and the work it takes to gain credibility, were an immediate conversation non-starter for Radix Collective. </p><p>&ldquo;It comes across as less about building something big, life-changing or sustainable, and more about quick money without VC bullshit. We&rsquo;ve certainly turned away our share of business but I am A-OK with that,&rdquo; said Jordan.</p><p>The top three elements of a crypto startup that Noff assesses before onboarding them as a client are the credibility of the team, the legitimacy of their whitepaper and the uniqueness of their story. </p><p><b>Get versed and keep up</b> </p><p>In order to protect their clients from the tough questions, it is crucial that PR consultants stay on top of the ever evolving market trends and the impending regulations in this industry.  </p><p>When Jordan signed on her first blockchain client, MetaX in 2016, she soon realized that the impending wave of innovation with blockchain technology was soon going to lead to a hiring boom for PR and communications professionals across verticals, speaking from experience dealing with &ldquo;.com&rdquo; pitches in the late 90s. </p><p>&ldquo;At this point I had been telling all the independent PR pro&rsquo;s in the Radix Collective network to get versed in blockchain tech,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>Jordan&rsquo;s Radix Collective firm has an agile and flexible business structure consisting of independent senior PR professionals that have their own shops. If a client is a fit, Radix Collective will assemble a team of professionals to suit their needs, program and budget, rather than have the client work with an existing team as in traditional agencies. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve started creating education opportunities for PR professionals in the Radix network so they can understand the culture around crypto, emerging media outlets, the type of content that resonates, and how exactly you go about structuring a media campaign,&rdquo; Jordad added.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>&ldquo;Everyone [in the team] is educating themselves about blockchain and exactly what it means. I spend every spare moment I have just reading up about what Blockchain is and the various industries that are utilizing blockchain technology. No matter how much time I spend reading and learning about it, I realize I still have a lot more to learn,&rdquo; said Noff, who runs a team of 30 and is constantly recruiting. </p><p>One thing that will not change in 2018 is the increasing demand for PR experts to help crypto startups tell their stories better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain media experts support Facebook&rsquo;s decision to ban all ads that promote cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs). </p><p>&#8220;Facebook banning ICO ads is good for the industry in the long run. The ability to promote potentially scammy ICOs with ads that the general public may get duped by would ultimately hurt ICOs as a whole,&rdquo; Margaux Avedisian, executive vice president of Transform Group, a U.S.-based PR firm with a focus on blockchain companies, told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. </p><p>In its new advertising policy, Facebook outlines that it will prohibit ads that &ldquo;promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.&rdquo; </p><p>Katie Olver, founder of UK-based Cryptoland PR, reiterated that the ban of ICOs ads was a much-needed measure. </p><p>&ldquo;It is intended to help reduce the number of scams and protect unsophisticated investors from losing a lot of money,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>Amy Karr, co-founder of blockchain and cryptocurrency firm Ventus, also fully supports Facebook banning ICO ads to protect the growing cryptocurrency community. She thinks the new regulation will make it much harder for cryptocurrency and blockchain scams to thrive and will only have positive results for the industry as a whole.</p><p>&ldquo;It encourages more investors to do their own research and invest in blockchain projects they truly believe in,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>While this ban may impact the advertising industry, Avedisian says it will not harm the PR and journalism industries because of the checks routinely made on each featured company.</p><p>&ldquo;In PR and journalism, we have checks to try and prevent advocating for scams. The PR firm does due diligence as well as the reporter writing the story,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><b>Unacceptable Headlines</b></p><p>&ldquo;Use your retirement funds to buy Bitcoin!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Click here to learn more about our no-risk cryptocurrency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world,&rdquo; are examples of misleading headlines given by the Facebook advertising page.</p><p>&#8220;If your knowledge on cryptocurrency is low, you tend to get influenced by these articles [on Facebook] on a daily basis,&#8221; Jeff Park, consumer trend research professional at Seoul based LG Science Park R&amp;D Center, told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p><p>According to Park, when people see a short post on Facebook with a screen capture of a successful investor who&rsquo;s made six figures on a single trade, they can be easily convinced to jump into the crypto-arena.</p><p>&#8220;It is not easy for young millennials to stop and think that rash investment is wrong when you have someone in your office boasting that he or she has made serious money through Ethereum or Ripple. It&rsquo;s like tobacco or alcohol. You know that they are bad and could cost you a pretty penny, but you just can&rsquo;t help yourself,&#8221; Park added. </p><p>Park said the Facebook ban will have less impact in South Korea than in the U.S. because Koreans rely more on word-of-mouth and primary sources. He points out other platforms that can still be used for advertising crypto projects:</p><p>&ldquo;If Facebook is for fun, earned media such as online communities and mobile messenger app platforms are the real deal in Korea. <i>DC Inside</i>, originally a harmless online blog community dedicated to photography, has so many members that it has content for almost all topics. Same for dating apps, professional apps, game apps and many others. They all have sections for Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European government and industry leaders have urged jurisdictions around the world to manage the pace of emerging regulation around blockchain technology. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>
</p><p>&ldquo;What we all want to avoid is for a country to declare cryptocurrencies as a security just out of the blue,&rdquo; said Willem-Jan Bruin, Director of Western Europe of BitFury Group on a panel at London Blockchain Week 2018. </p></blockquote><p>BitFury is one of the largest Bitcoin miners outside of China and provides software and hardware solutions for governments, businesses, organizations and individuals to move assets across the blockchain. </p><p>Bruin instead calls for more of a steady dialogue between commercial industry and government leaders to better educate regulators about the technology. </p><p>Joining Bruin on the panel were European Union Parliamentarian, Antanas Guoga of Lithuania and Ashley Fox of the South West of England and Gibraltar, who also spoke against regulating the technology now. </p><p><b>Observe and monitor, not regulate</b></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a proponent of the sandbox environment, no regulation, [just] observe and monitor [developments] because any regulation would make it hard&rdquo;, said Guoga, popularly known as Tony G.</p><p>The best way to facilitate the growth of the blockchain technology adoption into jurisdictions is to &ldquo;let people in an with open arms, give leeway, allow them to develop, not interfere and [just] advise,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>A good example of this was the move by Luxembourg&rsquo;s regulators to grant Japan-based bitcoin exchange operator bitFlyer with a licence to enable them to convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency in the EU. </p><p>The payment institution license was granted by Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), and the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology Foundation (LHoFT) this month (January 2018). </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;The momentum in Europe is different to China. It&rsquo;s an open environment&rdquo; said Guoga. </p></blockquote><p>This momentum is signaled in Gibraltar&rsquo;s move to launch the world&rsquo;s first bespoke license for fintech firms using blockchain distributed ledger technology at the end of 2017. </p><p>Fox who represents Gibraltar in the EU, shared a more practical point of why he does not want to see the EU putting out a vast number of regulations surrounding blockchain technology.  </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just impossible for politicians to draft a law that is going to deal with every eventuality in the future,&rdquo; he said. <br>
<b>
</b></p><p>Future in the hands of the community</p><p>At this current stage blockchain focused companies are left to navigate the existing regulation when trying to develop their projects. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;I think it would be helpful if the government and regulators at least give direction&rdquo;, said Bruin, seeking opinions and predictions from where the regulators want to go to avoid surprises. </p></blockquote><p>The main challenge for blockchain startups in this phase is to manage the over hype and risks associated with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, said Guoga. </p><p>&ldquo;All the government action will happen when there is pain and there is blood on the floor and the action can be extreme,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>Fox sees Gibraltar approaching blockchain applications as they have with providing other types of companies with giving out licenses. </p><p>&ldquo;If you get a Gibraltar licence, that&rsquo;s a sign that you are a serious player, but if you don&rsquo;t behave yourself that license will be taken away. That will then be an example to the world and you probably won&rsquo;t do much business again,&rdquo; said Fox. </p><p>Fox also recommends blockchain startups to have codes of conducts, statement of principles and most importantly operate with &ldquo;integrity and honesty&rdquo; &#8211; if they do this, they will keep their license. </p><p>***<br>

Following that email, Dr Green soon found herself &ldquo;having lunch with the Mayor of Perth, figuring out where this eco village was going to be.&rdquo;<br>
As part of this process, she became elected Independent Councillor for the City of Perth in October 2015 and was recently elected Deputy Lord Mayor of Perth and acting Lord Mayor of Perth in the interim.  </p><p>All this took place before she discovered what blockchain could do for the energy industry. </p><p><b>The Blockchain solution</b></p><p>To add to Dr Green&rsquo;s trailblazing achievements, she had just given birth to her baby daughter a month before she got introduced to two blockchain developers in January 2016. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;It was like another language,&rdquo; Dr Green recalling the conversation she had with them in her home. </p></blockquote><p>At the time she returned to Perth, Dr Green did a PHD in disruptive innovation for low-cost and low-carbon housing, modular construction as well as battery and solar systems for apartments.</p><p>She found that energy seemed to be the largest contributor to unsustainability in the built environment, so she set out to build a solar and battery microgrid within an apartment building.</p><p>In search of software that can allocate electricity to each apartment, so that if you were not home to consume your allocation you could trade it with your neighbours, she could not find a solution, until she heard about blockchain. </p><p>Thus, in May 2016, Power ledger was formed with her co-founders, David Martin, John Bulich, Govert Van Ek and Jenni Conroy. </p><p><b>&ldquo;Never a dull moment&rdquo;</b></p><p>Dr Green&rsquo;s journey to building Power Ledger has been nothing short of a wild ride. </p><p>For one period, China and Korea banned ICOs, and the cryptocurrency market experienced a flash crash at the same time Power Ledger launched their token sale, putting Dr Green and her team in an intense pressure from their community.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;I was in the bathroom on the floor with my thumbs for nine hours on [Telegram] trying to defend ourselves, because people were worried that the main sale wasn&rsquo;t going well,&rdquo; recounts Dr Green. </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was really unclear which way it was going to go,&rdquo; adds Dr Green. </p><p>To their relief at the end of their Token Generation Event on 6 October, 2017, the company raised a total of USD 27 million from over 15,000 buyers. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re kind of still shocked&rdquo;, said Dr Green, at the success of their ICO launch. </p><p>Following the ICO, the Australian government put AUD 8.25 million of taxpayers money into an energy project lead by Power Ledger that will look at how cities can use blockchain technology and data analytics to integrate distributed energy and water systems. </p><p>&ldquo;Every day is different and that&rsquo;s what I enjoy about the work I do. I could be at meetings about the city of Perth, answering &lsquo;Ask-Me-Anything&rsquo; questions in the Power Ledger Telegram channel or watching my daughter chase the dog around the coffee table,&rdquo; Dr Green told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. </p><p>This is just the beginning of what is in store for Dr Green in 2018. </p><p>Dr Green has made it to the Top 3 for the Extreme Tech Challenge competition (XTC) which took place at the consumer electronics show CES 2018 in Las Vegas. This means she will be able to head to Necker Island to pitch Power Ledger to Richard Branson and other venture capitalists in his network. </p><p>As blockchain is gaining more and more media coverage and exposure, Dr Green&rsquo;s word of advice to fellow blockchain businesses is to be prepared for the tough questions. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;Exposure also comes with criticism so I think blockchain businesses have to prepare for that,&rdquo; she said. </p></blockquote><p>As for speculation about the price of Power Ledger&rsquo;s POWR tokens, Dr Green chooses not to think about that. </p><p>&ldquo;I just think about projects we are really focused on deploying,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>&ldquo;It used to be that saving the planet was very expensive and didn&rsquo;t make commercial sense, but it&rsquo;s different now. It&rsquo;s exciting that we&rsquo;re in a world where you can be low cost and low carbon,&rdquo; said Dr Green.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More power and smaller bills for energy consumers
Blokchain based solutions disrupts the energy industry
Trials are underway already</p><p>The rise of distributed clean energy supplies like solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries is changing the energy power balance between consumers and centralised power authorities. </p><p>More citizens are seeking to move away from the grid to control the cost of their power bills and be more socially-responsible and sustainable in their energy consumption, reducing the need for central energy providers.  </p><p>In Australia alone, as of 30 September 2017, there were over 1.746 million PV installations, covering 21% of suitable rooftops, which is the highest penetration of rooftop solar in the world. As Australia&rsquo;s total solar power capacity has reached 6.5 GW, the Australian Photovoltaic Institute expects that figure to double by 2020. </p><p>In another case, 2017 Mckinsey study of sunny Arizona residential energy consumers found that by 2020 it would make more economic sense for homeowners to generate and store 80% to 90% of their electricity, via solar and battery storage, and use the grid only as a backup. By 2028, a full grid defection would make more economic sense.</p><p>Peer-to-peer energy trading will break up the traditional energy market and if the incumbent players do not realise this disruption is inevitable then someone else will do it, warned Dr Jemma Green, Chair and Co-Founder of the Perth-based blockchain company Power Ledger, which POWR token almost tripled in price in the last two months.</p><p>The energy trading startup is not the only one trying to disrupt the market with a help of blockchain. UK-based Electron, and Gibraltar registered WePower are among participants in this energy trading on the blockchain race.</p><p>Meanwhile, Power Ledger claims it helps traditional energy providers stay relevant by empowering them to co-create a better energy future with their customers via a blockchain energy trading platform. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;Network operators need to find a way to keep people from defecting from the grid and retailers need to find ways of connecting with their customers &#8211; so we&rsquo;re helping them achieve that,&rdquo; said Dr Green. The goal of Power Ledger is to disrupt the energy industry, not destroy its value, she added.</p></blockquote><p>In order to facilitate longer lasting relationships between central energy providers and their customers the company already offers its peer-to-peer energy trading platform.  </p><p>In December 2017, Power Ledger announced a deal with Thai energy company BCPG to develop a Bangkok based microgrid which will see between 6 to 10 multi-storey apartment buildings trading between 1&ndash;2MW of embedded solar generation.</p><p>Power Ledger&rsquo;s platform will enable building managers to trade renewable energy from solar panels installed on each building with an autonomous financial settlement enabled via the use of a banking interface.</p><p><b>Trials underway</b></p><p>The startup has begun partnering with energy retailers in Australia and India to test its peer-to-peer energy trading platform. </p><p>In September 2017, Power Ledger partnered with Australia&rsquo;s leading energy retailer, Origin Energy to carry out a trial that involved using anonymised historical customer data to explore the benefits and challenges of peer-to-peer energy trading across a regulated network. </p><p>While the digital trial is due to wrap up soon, the team have hopes that this would demonstrate the use of blockchain to unlock the value of consumer-owned distributed energy resources. </p><p>The startup is also collaborating with Tech Mahindra a digital transformation, consulting and business re-engineering services firm based in India, on a village-to-village energy trading trial.</p><p>The trial is aimed at bringing the benefits of energy microgrid developments to India&rsquo;s booming urban population. </p><p>&ldquo;[The trial] will see Microgrids-as-a-Service (MaaS) enable building owners, campuses, smart cities and communities to produce and manage their own electricity affordably and trade in cases of excess generation,&rdquo; said Dr Green. </p><p>Power Ledger performed the live demo of the platform at Tech Mahindra&rsquo;s Mission Innovation 2018 conference in Hyderabad in December 2017. </p><p>The company will also be participating in an Australian government funded AUD 8m blockchain trial which will test how cities can use blockchain technology and data analytics to integrate distributed energy and water systems. </p><p>The trial is set to take place in Freemantle, Perth and will involve the orchestration of solar power panels, batteries, an electric vehicle charge station and a water treatment capture system to demonstrate the interconnected infrastructure of future smart cities.</p><p>As blockchain capabilities are evolving and Bitcoin and blockchain are becoming more mainstream, Dr Green said that there is a lot of room for growth when it comes to practical real world applications of Blockchain. </p><p>&ldquo;Democratising power is just the one we decided to focus on&rdquo; she said. </p><p><b>Education as first step</b></p><p>As many other startups in the blockchain world, Power Ledger also faces common challenges in educating their partners and users on their platform. </p><p>Dr Green said the technology can still be complex for the average person to comprehend. </p><p>&ldquo;I was at an event recently and someone flatout said &lsquo;blockchain is a fad and your project isn&rsquo;t sustainable&rsquo;&rsquo;, she recalls. </p><p>In these situations, Dr Green said she often takes the time to hear people&rsquo;s concerns and educate them on how the Power Ledger platform is going to work. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important in these situations to hear the person out &#8211; they&rsquo;re more likely to come around if you listen and answer their questions in a measured way rather than getting defensive straight off the bat,&rdquo; she said.</p></blockquote><p>*** </p><p><b><u><b>POWR currency </b></u></b><br>
<i>In order to efficiently trade energy on the Power Ledger ecosystem the company has created its own cryptocurrency &#8211; POWR tokens. <br>
&ldquo;POWR tokens were designed to create a platform of interoperable applications rather than one business model, targeting one market,&rdquo; it states on their Medium blog post.<br>
To distribute POWR tokens to users, Power Ledger launched a token generation sale in October 2017 and raised USD 27m, making it the first Australian startup to raise money through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in the country.<br>
The PowerLedger platform also requires the use of Sparkz, a token pegged to the lowest denomination of the local currency. It acts as an efficient model for ensuring the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies does not affect the price of the energy that is being exchanged.<br>
Following the PowerLedger token generation sale, the third largest US digital currency exchange Bittrex, began listing the POWR token.  <br>
As of 16th of January, the market capitalization of the token was more than USD 400, after the price of POWR increased more than fourfold in the last two months, according to the coinmarketcap.com data.  </i></p>
