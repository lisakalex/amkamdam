<p>Altcoins are moving higher in a catch-up play on Thursday as Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates below $44,000 following its impressive recent performance.</p>
<p>Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), XRP (XRP) and Ether (ETH) were all up 2-3% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, with Ether hitting fresh highs for the year in the mid-$2,300s as bulls eye a near-term push higher towards the next major long-term resistance area around $3,500.</p>
<p>Generally, amid ongoing expectations for near-term approvals of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in the US and for an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/inflation-cools-fed-officials-signal-rate-hikes-likely-done-2023-11-30/">imminent dovish policy pivot from the Fed</a>, market sentiment looks set to remain net bullish, with dips likely to continue to be bought into.</p>
<p>Friday’s US jobs data release could trigger some choppiness in the market, especially if it comes in weak and amplifies bets that the Fed will start cutting interest rates in early 2024.</p>
<p>In the meantime, traders looking for explosive volatility and the possibility of booking quick exponential gains will continue to turn to the highly illiquid shitcoin/meme coin market.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers on <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum">Uniswap</a> on Thursday.</p>
<h2><strong>Virtual Player Points ($VPP)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The native token of poker protocol Virtual Poker, called Virtual Player Points ($VPP), has seen a strong pump in the past 24 hours, with gains last in the region of 90% as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x5eeaa2dcb23056f4e8654a349e57ebe5e76b5e6e">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>The token last had a market cap of around $6.6 million, with around $1.3 million having changed hands in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xa24501a910e7930148445bcf1fb601a4304e4551">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>$VPP has over 12,500 holders, but has relatively thin liquidity of around $230,000, so large orders could trigger large price swings.</p>
<p>The token has five concerning aspects to its smart-contract, as per DEXTools’ security audit.</p>
<h2><strong>HYPR ($HYPR)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Game development-focused Hyper Network’s HYPR ($HYPR) token was last up around 50% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x31adda225642a8f4d7e90d4152be6661ab22a5a2">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>The token last had a market cap of around $10.6 million, with close to 1,500 holders and just over $750,000 in partially locked liquidity, as per DEXTools.</p>
<p>The token has a 5% sell tax, but also has three other smart contract alerts as per DEXTools’ security audit, so investors should tread with caution.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>For those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<p>Ether (ETH), the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, was last up close to 5% on Thursday and just hit fresh highs for the year in the mid-$2,300s.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> remains the dominant blockchain used by Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">DeFi</a>), Non-Fungible Token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-news/">NFT</a>) and broader <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">web3</a> industries, accounting for around 70% of the crypto industry’s $107 billion in total value locked (TVL) as per <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum">DeFi Llama</a>, which refers to the total value of all crypto locked in smart contracts.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">Ether</a> has been pumping in recent weeks amid a broader resurgence in risk appetite across the crypto market that saw Bitcoin this week surge to fresh yearly highs above $44,000.</p>
<p>That pump has come amid optimism about expected <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> and about a potentially <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/inflation-cools-fed-officials-signal-rate-hikes-likely-done-2023-11-30/">imminent dovish monetary policy pivot from the US Federal Reserve</a>, which could lead to a more favorable liquidity environment.</p>
<p>But with major asset managers like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-files-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">BlackRock also moving to create spot Ethereum ETFs</a>, with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ether</a> supply having recent switched back to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereums-deflation-rate-hits-new-yearly-highs-heres-where-eth-price-headed-next.htm">deflationary</a> thanks to improving on chain activity and with Ether having substantially lagged Bitcoin’s rally this year (ETH is up 96% year-to-date versus BTC’s 164% gain), the case for strong near-term Ether price gains strong.</p>
<p>Recent technical developments also support the case for further upside, with near-term price predictions likely to remain bullish as a result.</p>
<h2><strong>Price Prediction – Can Ether (ETH) Reach $3,500 By December 31<sup>st</sup>?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
ETH recently broke above and then found strong support at key long-term resistance in the $2,150 area.</p>
<p>Chart analysis shows that there aren’t many key resistance levels now going all the way until 2022’s highs in the $3,500 area, meaning quick potential upside of around 50% in the near future.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-140235" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701968521-eth.png" alt="" width="942" height="630" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701968521-eth.png 942w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701968521-eth-300x201.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701968521-eth-768x514.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701968521-eth-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px" /></p>
<p>Whether ETH could cover such distance to the upside prior to the 31<sup>st</sup> of December (i.e. in just over three weeks) seems unlikely but isn’t be unheard of in ETH’s price history.</p>
<p>In late July 2020, ETH rallied 57% in two week, followed by a more than 80% in the final week of 2020 and into the first week of 2021.</p>
<p>The last week of April into the first week of May 2021 then saw a more than 70% gain for ETH.</p>
<p>With technicals and fundamentals lining up at a typically strong time for the crypto market (i.e. a strong possibility of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-analyst-says-santa-claus-squeee-will-shoot-prices-higher-time-to-buy.htm">santa rally</a>), investors shouldn’t bet against ETH hitting $3,500 this year.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While ETH offers strong upside potential for the weeks ahead, those looking to diversify into an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy should consider getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>

<p>Major cryptocurrencies are consolidating following a Bitcoin (BTC)-led pump that saw Bitcoin hit fresh annual highs above $44,000 earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Crypto markets have been pumping on optimism that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-talks-have-advanced-to-key-details-report.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> will soon gain approval, accelerating institutional adoption and amid <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/inflation-cools-fed-officials-signal-rate-hikes-likely-done-2023-11-30/">hopes for a near-term dovish policy pivot from the US Federal Reserve</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of the big coins, here are some of the best altcoins cryptos to buy now on the 7<sup>th</sup> of December.</p>
<h2><strong>BitTorrent (BTT)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BitTorrent (BTT) token was one of the biggest gainers in the market on Wednesday, pumping up more than 75% to hit new year and a half highs aboe $0.0000011 per token following optimism amid the news that the Tron network on which it is issued had surpassed 200 million users.</p>
<p>The token has since pulled back around 30% from these highs to trade under $0.0000008.</p>
<p>Bulls may be eyeing the recent pullback as a good time to add to long positions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-140226" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701966071-btt.png" alt="" width="947" height="621" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701966071-btt.png 947w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701966071-btt-300x197.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701966071-btt-768x504.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701966071-btt-150x98.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
An exciting new decentralized Bitcoin cloud mining protocol called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> has been generating huge hype and recently surpassed $5 million in funds raised from presale investors.</p>
<p>With interest in Bitcoin surging as a new bull run begins, old hands and new entrants into the crypto markets are searching out ways to gain exposure to the Bitcoin melt-up that doesn’t require either waiting to buy a spot Bitcoin ETF or purchasing the coin directly.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix has been raising funds to power protocol development via a presale of its native $BTCMTX token.</p>
<p>Investors who buy $BTCMTX can then stake their tokens to start earning non-transferable Bitcoin Minetrix mining credits.</p>
<p>These credits can then be burnt by their owners, and in exchange, they will get a share in Bitcoin Minetrix’s Bitcoin mining revenues.</p>
<p>$BTCMTX token holders will also earn $BTCMTX rewards, with a portion of the token supply already set aside to reward early stakers.</p>
<p>$BTCMTX staking rewards current sit at around 120%, according to <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/en/dashboard">the project’s official dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix’s protocol is governor by smart contracts built on top of the decentralized Ethereum blockchain, which is also where its token is issued.</p>
<p>The protocol thus offers better transparency and security versus other centralized cloud mining services.</p>

<h2><strong>Helium (HNT)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Helium (HNT) has been pumping in the past two days amid optimism following the news that Helium has launched a nationwide US unlimited mobile data plan for $20 per month.</p>
<p>The token of the crypto connectivity project was last trading around $5.50, up nearly 90% in the past two days.</p>
<p>As risk appetite in the broader market continues to pick up, Helium could continue to outperform, as traders pile back into the project thanks to its exciting new product launch.</p>

<h2><strong>TG.Casino (TG)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
An exciting Telegram-based crypto gambling upstart called TG.Casino has been taking web3 by storm.</p>
<p>2023 has been a big year for crypto gambling, with protocols like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-rollbit-rlb-price-stays-green-and-the-latest-telegram-casino-just-raised-2-8-million.htm">Rollbit</a> seeing explosive user growth, and the platform’s native token also seeing big upside.</p>
<p>And TG.Casino is experiencing similar early success.</p>
<p>As per a recent update on the project’s X account, a staggering more than $38 million has now been wagered in the platform by over 2,450 players, with crypto deposits last at an impressive $3.7 million.</p>
<p>That’s despite the fact that the platform hasn’t even finished conducting its presale, which has raised over $3.5 million in just a few months thanks to the protocol’s exciting value proposition.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But what is TG.Casino’s unique proposition?</p>
<p>Well, arriers remain high for non-crypto native users to bet using platforms such as Rollbit, given they need to navigate complicated concepts such as setting up, connecting and working with crypto wallets.</p>
<p>TG.Casino intends to do for crypto gambling what <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/telegram-based-crypto-trading-bot-unibot-hacked.htm">Unibot</a> did for advanced crypto trading – simplify things with Telegram automation, whilst putting crypto gambling at the fingertips of Telegram’s 700 million (and rapidly growing) userbase.</p>
<p>TG.Casino also offers an exciting passive income opportunity.</p>
<p>Early investors are already making yields in the region of 170% (thanks to rewards specifically set aside for $TGC token stakers – all tokens bought in presale are automatically staked).</p>
<p>While this yield will fade over time as more money pours into the presale, $TGC holders will also benefit from TG.Casino’s planned token buyback scheme, which will provide passive income to $TGC token stakers and raise the token’s price through token burns.</p>

<p><strong>Beam (BEAM)</strong></p>
<p>BEAM, the token that powers the game development-focused beam network, has been pumping in recent weeks.</p>
<p>BEAM was last up around 7% in the past 24 hours at nearly $0.017 per token, taking its gains in the past month to around 300%.</p>
<p>The token’s strong uptrend may continue in light of the recent news that Beam network creator Merit Circle is bringing Immutable zkEVM into its gaming ecosystem.</p>

<p>BTT, the token that powers BitTorrent’s suite of decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing applications, saw an explosive more than 75% move higher on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The move was driven by the time by an announcement that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tron/">Tron network</a>, upon which the BTT token is issued as a TRC-20 token, had reached 200 million users.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>The lates BTT price pump saw it reach highs above $0.0000011 on Wednesday, its highest level since May 2022.</p>
<p>But the token has since dropped around 30% from these highs and was last trading around $0.0000008 and remains a highly risky potential investment.</p>
<p>Questions around the BTT token’s utility (it claims to aim to power a healthier BitTorrent protocol) may continue to deter potential investors.</p>
<p>Those looking to get into an alternative high-potential coin, but with a more convincing value proposition should check out a the token of a new Telegram-based crypto casino protocol called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-tg-casino-token.htm">TG.Casino</a>.</p>

<p>Digital asset trading focused layer-1 blockchain Sei (SEI) has seen its token price pull back over 12% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Sei, whose token <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sei-price-prediction-as-binance-listing-sends-price-soaring-new-airdrop-coming.htm">debuted on major exchanges in August</a>, was last trading just under $0.28 per token, down from the multi-month highs in the upper $0.31s it hit earlier this week.</p>
<p>Despite the recent pullback, SEI’s bullish trend remains very much intact.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is still up around 200% from its October all-time lows under $0.10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEI has been pumping alongside a surge in risk appetite in the broader crypto market, thanks primarily to optimism about near-term <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-could-attract-3b-on-first-day-and-up-to-55b-over-five-years-analysts.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> in the US (which is expected to accelerate institutional adoption of crypto) and amid hopes for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/inflation-cools-fed-officials-signal-rate-hikes-likely-done-2023-11-30/">near-term dovish pivot in the Fed’s monetary policy</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Is SEI Going to Zero?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As per a dashboard created Sei Daily on <a href="https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/tkvresearch/%F0%9F%94%B4-sei-network-the-layer-1-for-trading-sei-network---the-layer-1-for-trading-QR99ld">Flipside</a>, the Sei network has been experiencing solid growth in weekly transactions since May, which could also have helped fuel the recent rally.</p>
<p>However, the same dashboard shows weakness in the number of unique weekly active users interacting with the blockchain, a sign these high transactions are being driven by a small number of participants.</p>
<p>That could suggest a lack of notable adoption of the blockchain since its launch earlier this year, and could also suggest that weekly transaction counts are being artificially inflated by so-called “wash trading”.</p>
<p>As a result, while recent SEI price growth has been impressive, investors should remain cautious of the token.</p>
<p>If the blockchain fails to achieve any lasting adoption, then this means its token will essentially have no utility apart from speculation.</p>
<p>SEI remains at risk of going to zero.</p>
<p>Investors may want to check out an alternative project called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a>, a new decentralized Bitcoin cloud mining protocol that has been generating huge hype and recently surpassed $5 million in funds raised from presale investors.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Bitcoin Minetrix?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin Minetrix has been raising funds to power protocol development via a presale of its native $BTCMTX token.</p>
<p>Investors who buy $BTCMTX can then stake their tokens to start earning non-transferable Bitcoin Minetrix mining credits.</p>
<p>These credits can then be burnt by their owners, and in exchange, they will get a share in Bitcoin Minetrix’s Bitcoin mining revenues.</p>
<p>$BTCMTX token holders will also earn $BTCMTX rewards, with a portion of the token supply already set aside to reward early stakers.</p>
<p>$BTCMTX staking rewards currently sitting at around 120%, according to <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/en/dashboard">the project’s official dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix’s protocol is governor by smart contracts built on top of the decentralized Ethereum blockchain, which is also where its token is issued.</p>
<p>The protocol thus offers better transparency and security versus other centralized cloud mining services.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><strong>Why Are Investors Piling Into $BTCMTX?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With interest in Bitcoin surging as a new bull run begins, old hands and new entrants into the crypto markets are searching out ways to gain exposure to the Bitcoin melt-up that doesn’t require either waiting to buy a spot Bitcoin ETF or purchasing the coin directly.</p>
<p>There are currently many eye-watering price predictions to pick from for Bitcoin. They range from $120,000 by the end of next year, according to Standard Chartered, to as much as $1.48 million by 2030 according to Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood.</p>
<p>However, savvy investors know there are other ways to secure returns on investment that could be multiples of both of those example Bitcoin target prices.</p>
<p>Although a crypto bull run typically begins with Bitcoin leading the way, as its dominance of the market begins to top out, market participants start to focus on the value differential offered by alternative coins with arguably more tempting risk-reward profiles.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is one such coin.</p>

<p>Dogecoin (DOGE), the first major meme cryptocurrency that powers the decentralized layer-1 Dogecoin blockchain, hit eight-month highs above $0.095 on Tuesday, with sentiment rising on the news that Elon Musk’s X.AI company is set to raise $1 billion via an equity offering, as per a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2002695/000200269523000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">filing with the SEC</a>.</p>
<p>X.AI is Musk’s new artificial intelligence start-up, which he announced earlier this year at the same time as he rebranded Twitter into X Corp.</p>
<p>Musk bought Twitter back in 2022 and has promised to turn the social media platform into an “everything app”, while he said he created X.AI to “understand the universe”.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a> is sensitive to news regarding Elon Musk, X and now seemingly his company X.AI because Musk has been a vocal supporter of the meme coin for more than two years, frequently tweeting about it, whilst also hinting that Dogecoin could play a role in powering future financial services on the X platform.</p>
<p>DOGE is also benefitting right now from strong sentiment in the broader crypto market, with Bitcoin hitting its highest levels since April 2022 on Tuesday above $44,000.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is already up over 12% this month and more than 60% versus October&#8217;s lows.</p>
<p>With Dogecoin technicals strong – DOGE has found consistent support at its 21DMA in recent weeks and broke above a long-term pennant structure in early November – and with sentiment in the broader market so strong amid optimism for near-term <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> and for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-policy-pivots-are-taking-longer-mcgeever-2023-12-01/">dovish Fed policy pivot next year</a>, it seems only a matter of time until Dogecoin hits $0.10.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139602" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701823671-doge.png" alt="" width="951" height="622" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701823671-doge.png 951w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701823671-doge-300x196.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701823671-doge-768x502.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701823671-doge-150x98.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-elon-musks-doge-1-moon-mission-launch-approaches-will-doge-reach-1.htm">Price predictions</a> are likely to remain bullish but can Dogecoin rally all the way to $1.0 per token.</p>
<h2><strong>Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Hit $1.0?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Dogecoin currently has a market cap of around $13.4 billion.</p>
<p>Some would argue that’s way to much for a cryptocurrency that was originally designed as a joke, but sometimes Dogecoin’s critics miss the fact that 1) the cryptocurrency has a huge, avid base of highly engaged supporters and 2) unlike all other major meme coins, Dogecoin is its own independent layer-1 blockchain, rather than a token issued on the Ethereum or other blockchain.</p>
<p>Dogecoin is arguably very decentralized and whilst its blockchain has scaling issues (as does Bitcoin’s), the cryptocurrency stands a better chance of seeing real adoption than any other meme coins, in no part thanks to Elon Musk’s ongoing support.</p>
<p>So could it hit a price of $1 per token, more than 10x higher than current levels.</p>
<p>Given the current supply of around 142 billion tokens, that would imply a market cap of around $142 billion.</p>
<p>That’s a lot, but if Bitcoin is to hit a market cap of $10 trillion or higher to rival gold, as many expect, then there is no reason why Dogecoin couldn’t hit a market cap of above $100 billion, 100 times less.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin (BTC) melt-up has continued on Tuesday, with the BTC price briefly hitting $44,000 before pulling back to the upper $43,000s, taking its run of gains since last Friday to around 15%.</p>
<p>Investors continue to panic buy amid bets that 1) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-drops-update-on-gbtc-spot-bitcoin-btc-etf-approval-get-ready-for-ethereum-eth-and-everlodge-eldg-price-surge.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> will soon gain approval in the US, driving a wave of new institutional demand and 2) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-with-rates-peak-now-looks-hold-an-eventual-pivot-lower-2023-12-04/">bets that Fed policy will be more dovish in the coming months</a>, with rate cuts possible in early 2024.</p>
<p>And with Bitcoin having broken convincingly to the north of resistance in the $43,000 area in the form of the late-April 2022 highs, the pathway higher to a quick test of the 2022 highs at $48,000 is clear.</p>
<p>Major altcoins are mixed, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ether</a> (ETH) up around 2% in the past 24 hours and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a> (ADA) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a> (DOGE) up between 3-4%, while the likes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> (XRP), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> (SOL) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-to-delist-and-end-support-for-busd-in-december-bnb-gathers-momentum-amid-low-sentiment-nuggetrush-becomes-meme-enthusiasts-favorite.htm">BNB</a> (BNB) are slightly lower.</p>
<p>Dogecoin got an intra-day boost from the news that Elon Musk’s X.AI Corp will raise $1 billion in equity, perhaps related to speculation that Dogecoin may somehow feature in Musk’s future plans for his companies.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin is the star of the show in the blue-chip crypto market right now and its outlook remains very strong, traders looking to turn quick exponential profits will continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets, where tokens can routinely post gains of as much as 10x in one or two days.</p>
<p>Of course, these tokens can lose their value just as quickly as they gained it, given most are backed by projects of questionable or no utility.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers on the <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum">Uniswap</a> decentralized exchange (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm'">DEX</a>) on Tuesday.</p>
<h2><strong>Ordinal Doge ($ODOGE)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin that launched earlier this year called Ordinal Doge ($ODOGE) has seen a sudden more than 300% spike in the last 24 hours, as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x68b429161ec09a6c1d65ba70727ab1faa5bc4026">Uniswap</a>, making it one of the best performing low cap coins.</p>
<p>The sudden spike comes amid a surge in trading volumes to over $850,000 in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xa5c85f0b1ee0e40946545f62805465fd9cdd4d53">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>$ODOGE last had a market cap of around $133,000, liquidity of just under $120,000 and slightly over 1,400 holders.</p>
<p>Investors should exercise caution with the coin, not just because of its small market cap and low liquidity, but also as a result of two smart-contract alerts identified by DEXTools’ security audit.</p>
<h2><strong>ordinex ($ORD)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
ordinex ($ORD), which powers an all-in-one platform for trading Bitcoin-based NFTs, has seen an impressive near 200% pump in the past 24 hours, according to <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0xbe00734799a67a62af2819825580318ac1b1e4ec">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>The token last had a market cap of around $6 million as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x29a512b5947b5b36bcd3f294822cc3ff4fe2ab73">DEXTools</a>, which also shows that $1.5 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours, around $650,000 in liquidity and 1,450 holders.</p>
<p>The token has three concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools’ security audit,  so potential investors should be cautious.</p>
<h2>Antimatter.Finance ($MATTER)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The governance token that powers DeFi protocol Antimatter.Finance has been melting higher in recent days and was last up around 100% in the past 24 hours as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x9b99cca871be05119b2012fd4474731dd653febe">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>At current levels around $0.22 per token, $MATTER is up around 7x in the past five days, with its market cap last around $22 million, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xec7a1a2896d4b9d7014fa7be2aa936c8a76a8072">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The platform also shows the token to have experienced around $1.45 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours, around $640,000 in liquidity and around 5,500 holders.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<p>Blue-chip cryptocurrency markets are pumping on Monday led by Bitcoin (BTC), which just surpassed $42,000 for the first time since April 2022, taking its four-day run of gains to move than 10%.</p>
<p>A cocktail of bullish catalysts are being cited as supporting the BTC rally, including; 1) ongoing optimism for near-term <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> which is pumping optimism about institutional adoption, 2) an improving macro outlook as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-waller-increasingly-confident-policy-is-right-spot-2023-11-28/">investors bet a Fed rate cutting cycle is near</a>, 3) chatter about <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/qatars-sovereign-wealth-fund-dives-into-bitcoin-with-potential-500b-investment-confirmed-news-or-just-rumors.htm">Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund stepping in to buy BTC</a>, and other factors such as bullish technicals and the upcoming BTC halving.</p>
<p>Bitcoin bulls will be expecting a near-term test of the next major resistance level just under $43,000 within days, and possibly a retest of 2022 highs around $48,000 before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was last up 3% in the past 24 hours and at fresh yearly highs above $2,200.</p>
<p>While the near-term outlook for major cryptocurrencies is strong, investors looking to secure quick exponential gains will continue to turn to the highly illiquid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers as per decentralized exchange analytics website <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/gainers">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>10000X ($10000X)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called 10000X ($10000X) that was launched last week has seen an impressive 800% pump in the past 24 hours according to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x830590df97b5a181ecc665f94e5287b75692606c">DEXTools</a>, making it one of the best-performing shitcoins of the day.</p>
<p>$10000X last had a market cap of around $250,000, with over $175,000 having changed hands in the past 24 hours and the token having accumulated over 300 holders and nearly $300,000 in liquidity.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools’ security audit, the token has three smart contract alerts, so investors should exerice caution that the token might be a scam.</p>
<h2><strong>Baby Grok ($BABYGROK)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called Baby Grok has pumped up an impressive 500% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xf77c0c6d0484a7be578f5b7619bce92698e30dc3">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>$BABYGROK last had a market cap of around $4.4 million, with the token having accumulated over 900 holders.</p>
<p>Bulls should be aware that the latest price pump has been driven by just $265,000 in 24 hour trading volumes and liquidity is thin at just $110,000, so a few big sell orders could quickly see all recent gains reversed.</p>
<h2><strong>Safefloki ($SaFLok)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A new shitcoin called Safefloki ($SaFLok) has exploded up more than 300% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x5436e99b04cffd08fb20b2841c0485ee826a1c2a">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The token last had a market cap of around $165,000, locked liquidity of around $156,000, just under 250 holders and an impressive $670,000 in 24-hour trading volumes.</p>
<p>But investors should be wary of three concerning aspects to its smart contract, as identified in DEXTools’ security audit, including the potential that the token is a so-called “honeypot” scam.</p>

<p>So-called “scandal” tokens are seeing a massive pump as risk appetite in the broader crypto market amps up as Bitcoin (BTC) hits fresh highs for the year above $42,000.</p>
<p>Scandal tokens are cryptocurrencies/tokens associated with failed or defunct crypto projects/firms that were struck down by high-profile scandals.</p>
<p>While the failure of their associated project/firm renders these tokens pretty much useless and worthless, speculators still view them as potentially offering short-term trading opportunities.</p>
<p>One feature of such coins as that they are often heavily shorted, raising the prospect of a potential short squeeze.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the best scandal coins to buy now.</p>
<h2><strong>FTT Token ($FTT)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
$FTT, the utility token that used to offer its holders various trading benefits on FTX’s now failed and defunct exchange has been forming an ascending triangle in recent weeks.</p>
<p>These chart patterns tend to form ahead of bullish breakouts.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-indicates-ftx-revival-ftt-rallies.htm">Assuming FTT does break higher</a>, a more than 2x rally back towards $10 per token could be on the cards.</p>
<p>Of course, owning FTT remains highly risky, given the token has lost all of its original utility thanks to FTX’s downfall.</p>
<h2><strong>Terra Luna Classic (LUNC)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-lunc-becomes-best-performer-of-the-week-1-lunc-incoming.htm">Terra Luna Classic (LUNC)</a>, the cryptocurrency that powers the original Terra blockchain that experienced a spectacular blowup in May 2022, has been enjoying a spectacular resurgence in recent days.</p>
<p>At the current price of $0.00025, LUNC is up nearly 400% since its October lows.</p>
<p>Analysts have cited various factors such as plans to revive the Terra blockchain’s stablecoin UST to its 1:1 peg by buying up Bitcoin and continued support and burns from Binance as helping the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>However, it remains a highly risky bet as very few people or crypto market participants continue to use the blockchain in wake of 2022’s disaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Terra Luna (LUNA)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-re-enters-top-100-crypto-as-inqubeta-qube-smashes-5-6-million-presale-mark.htm">LUNA</a>, the cryptocurrency that powers the new Terra blockchain launched by Terraform Labs in the immediate aftermath of the original Terra ecosystem’s block-up but has since been wracked with scandal amid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-faces-fraud-charges-new-york-following-arrest-montenegro.htm">Terra creator Do Kwon’s arrest</a>, has also been pumping in recent days.</p>
<p>LUNA was last just above $1.0 per token, up around 2.5x since October.</p>
<p>Like the Terra Luna Classic blockchain, very few crypto market participants are using the blockchain, so it remains a highly risky bet.</p>
<h2><strong>Better Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While the possibility of a short-squeeze means the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies could offer good short-term gains, they remain highly risky.</p>
<p>Investors looking for an even better chance of making quick gains with coins that aren’t linked to high-profile scandals should check out some of the top presale projects.</p>
<p>Here are some of cryptonews.com’s favorite up-and-coming projects.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</strong></p>
<p>Despite only launching its presale a few weeks ago, Bitcoin ETF Token has already been able to pull in over $2.7 million from investors because of its audacious pitch into the lucrative Bitcoin ETF theme that underpins the current crypto rally.</p>
<p>$BTCETF is also garnering attention because of its DeFi attributes.</p>
<p>$BTCETF tokens can be bought in presale today and staked to earn an annual percentage yield currently sitting at 487%, as per the project’s official staking <a href="https://btcetftoken.io/en/dashboard">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Buy BTCETF Here</a></p>
<h2><strong>Meme Kombat ($MK)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another exciting new presale that has been generating a lot of hype recently has been for a crypto start-up called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a>.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat blend together the world of crypto gaming and gambling with its exciting platform were users are able to bet on the outcomes of exciting battles between characters based on some of the crypto world’s most popular meme coins.</p>
<p>Early $MK investors can also benefit from generous staking rewards, which are currently more than 100% annually.</p>
<p>The project has already raised close to $2.4 million, despite launching just weeks ago.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin (BTC) price, which briefly surpassed $42,000 on Monday for the first time since April 2022, has risen back above El Salvador’s average purchase price, putting the emerging Central American nation’s crypto bet back in the green.</p>
<p>El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele proclaimed via a tweet on X earlier on Monday that the nation’s BTC “investments are in the black!”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">El Salvador&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> investments are in the black!</p>
<p>After literally thousands of articles and hit pieces that ridiculed our supposed losses, all of which were calculated based on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>’s market price at the time&#8230;</p>
<p>With the current <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> market price, if we were to sell… <a href="https://t.co/gvl2GfQMfb">pic.twitter.com/gvl2GfQMfb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1731653743668572498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bukele hit back at the “literally thousands” of articles that had been written about El Salvador’s supposed paper losses on its BTC investments in the past, all of which had cited the current Bitcoin market price.</p>
<p>He noted that at the current market price (in the mid-$41,000s at the time of his tweet), El Salvador is now sat on a tidy profit of $3.6 million.</p>
<p>As per a screenshot shared by the president detailing the nation’s BTC portfolio, El Salvador current owns around $130 million worth of BTC, having bought the cryptocurrency at an average price of $40,479 over the past two years.</p>
<p>El Salvador is estimated to own around 2,750 BTC.</p>
<h2><strong>Will President Nayib Bukele Sell BTC Holdings?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“We have no intention of selling… that has never been our objective” Bukele was keen to emphasise.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware that the price will continue to fluctuate in the future, this doesn’t affect our long-term strategy”.</p>
<p>Bukele has long been an avid supporter of Bitcoin, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-as-legal-tender-el-salvadors-risky-financial-maneuver-struggles-to-pay-off.htm">introducing the cryptocurrency as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021</a> and offering technical support for Bitcoin integration into the country’s economy.</p>
<p>Bukele believes Bitcoin offers countries such as El Salvador a chance to escape from the dominance of the inflationary US dollar.</p>
<p>Assuming the Bitcoin bull run continues, which seems likely as a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-with-rates-peak-now-looks-hold-an-eventual-pivot-lower-2023-12-04/">dovish pivot in Fed policy</a> seemingly nears and as institutional adoption <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">optimism grows with spot Bitcoin ETFs expected to soon gain approval in the US</a>, other South American nations such as Argentina may be eyeing making a similar Bitcoin bet.</p>
<p>Libertarian Argentinian President-elect Javier Milei has promised to dismantle to country’s central bank as the nation experiences triple-digit annual inflation, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pro-bitcoin-javier-milei-wins-argentina-presidential-elections.htm">is a known fan of Bitcoin.</a></p>

<p>While the rumours around Qatar’s plans to enter the bitcoin market remain unconfirmed and have not been reported widely yet amongst by reputable crypto news outlets as fact, speculation that major sovereign wealth funds are looking to enter the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC market</a> is likely having a positive effect on the price action.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-breaks-through-42000-up-6-6-in-24-hours.htm">surpassed $42,000 on Monday for the first time since April 2022</a> and at current levels in the $41,600s, is up around 5% in the last 24 hours and more than 10% in the past four days.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">BTC’s</a> latest pump higher comes amid 1) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-waller-increasingly-confident-policy-is-right-spot-2023-11-28/">dovish bets that the US Federal Reserve will be cutting interest rates</a> within the coming quarters, 2) ongoing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">optimism that spot Bitcoin ETFs will soon gain approval in the US</a>, home to the world’s largest and most liquid financial markets.</p>
<p>Other bullish narratives, such as the upcoming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> next April and the fact that BTC appears to be following almost perfectly in the footsteps of its classic roughly four-year market cycle (which involves a one-year bear market followed by a three-year bull market), are also likely acting as tailwinds.</p>
<p>Bullish short-term technical developments add further weight to the bullish thesis – BTC recently broke convincingly to the north of an ascending triangle pattern, and the cryptocurrency has consistently held above its 21DMA in recent weeks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139123" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1.png" alt="" width="947" height="627" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1.png 947w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1-300x199.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1-768x508.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1-150x99.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" /></p>
<p>Late April 2022 highs close to $43,000 are the next notable level of resistance for the bulls to target, though BTC appears odds on to test 2022 highs in the $48,000 area within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s tone on the risks faced by the US economy just shifted in a dovish direction, spurring a pump in the price of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) to new yearly highs at $39,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/powell-says-fed-move-carefully-interest-rates-with-risks-more-balanced-2023-12-01/">Powell noted</a> that risks that the Fed doesn’t raise interest rates enough to combat inflation versus the risk that it over-tightens and unnecessarily weakens the economy have become more balanced.</p>
<p>His comments come after recent economic data has shown the US economy cooling and with a key metric of US inflation (the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-spending-slows-october-weekly-jobless-claims-rise-slightly-2023-11-30/">Core PCE Price Index</a>) averaging 2.5% annualized over the past six months.</p>
<p>Previously, Powell had been amongst the Fed policymakers warning that further interest rate hikes remained likely, and his shift in tone comes after his normally hawkish Fed policymaker colleague <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-waller-increasingly-confident-policy-is-right-spot-2023-11-28/">Christopher Waller</a> said earlier in the week that the argument for rate cuts in 2024 was building.</p>
<p>Powell’s remarks sent US stock prices higher and bond yields tumbling as investors ramped up bets on rate cuts to begin in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">CME’s Fed Watch Tool</a>, the money market implied likelihood of the Fed cutting interest rates back to 5.00-5.25% from 5.25-5.5% by March rose to over 60% on Friday from under 45% on Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a>, still viewed by many as a risk sensitive asset, has typically in recent years had a positive correlation to US stock prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has also benefitted in an environment of easing financial conditions, characterized by falling bond yields and rising liquidity.</p>
<p>A rate cutting cycle would be expected to trigger a substantial easing of financial conditions that could be a major bullish driver for the Bitcoin price.</p>
<h2><strong>Where is Bitcoin (BTC) Headed Next?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As rate cut expectations rise and, with it, expectations for a more Bitcoin-favorable liquidity backdrop, macro is a major tailwind for BTC right now.</p>
<p>But BTC continues to also benefit from crypto specific bullish narratives, such as an expected acceleration of institutional adoption and new buying pressure in the wake of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US, which are <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">expected to get the green light by early 2024</a>.</p>
<p>A sharp rise in the assets under management of Proshares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF, a Bitcoin futures-based ETF, to new all-time highs shows that institutions are already scrambling to gain bullish exposure to the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</p>
<p>Institution-driven elevated buying pressure in 2024 is expected to be coupled by a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s structural sell pressure from network validators (or “miners”), with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin issuance rate set to fall in half next April</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin miners need to constantly sell a portion of the Bitcoin they mine in order to pay for their operations.</p>
<p>This cocktail of bullish themes is likely to mean that Bitcoin remains a buy on the dips, as has consistently been the case in recent weeks.</p>
<p>After pumping 28.5% in October, Bitcoin was supported by an uptrend and its 21DMA throughout November.</p>
<p>With the cryptocurrency having new seemingly broken convincingly to the north of the prior resistance at $38,000, short-term bullish speculators will be eyeing an near-term move above $40,000 and on towards resistance in the form of the April 2022 highs just above $43,000.</p>

<p>Some might even be targeting a test of the 2022 highs at $48,000 before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is backing off after hitting fresh highs for the year in the $38,800s earlier in the session, but at current levels in the $38,300s, is still up close to 2% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Other major cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">Ether</a> (ETH), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> (XRP), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> (SOL) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cardano/">Cardano</a> (ADA) were all also trading with moderate gains over the same time period, with analysts citing a recent uptick in demand for Bitcoin futures ETFs as a sign that institutional demand for crypto continues to pick up.</p>
<p>Regulated crypto investment products have been enjoying inflows in recent weeks thanks to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-could-attract-3b-on-first-day-and-up-to-55b-over-five-years-analysts.htm">bets that spot Bitcoin ETFs will soon garner approval in the US</a>, which is widely viewed as bullish for the BTC price.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just released weaker than expected <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-manufacturing-stays-depressed-november-ism-2023-12-01/">US ISM Manufacturing PMI figures</a> for November strengthens the narrative that the US economy is cooling, just as Fed policymakers appears to be warming to the idea of interest rate cuts next year.</p>
<p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee on Friday remarked that US Core PCE inflation data released earlier in the week was in fitting with inflation falling back to the bank’s 2% goal, a viewpoint that could be used to argue in favor of a lowering of interest rates in 2024.</p>
<p>If the Fed does start lowering interest rates in 2024, this would result in a broad easing of financial conditions and injection of new liquidity into the economy, which has historically been bullish for BTC and the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>While the crypto market outlook subsequently continues to look bright, traders looking to turn even quicker profits will continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers according to decentralized exchange (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">DEX</a>) <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>MetaBlox ($MBX)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Gaming monetization token MetaBlox ($MBX) has seen an impressive 65% pump in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x144805be43c48ef85435c94e0da4cb4efb1ab4f3">Uniswap</a>, making it the best performing low cap coin of the day.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x8a70b86153d2293400df87ac328aa9b0304d7e90">DEXTools</a>, $MBX’s market cap was last around $3.8 million, with over $700,000 having changed hands in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The token last had liquidity of around $250,000 and just over 1,300 holders.</p>
<p>Despite its good reputation amongst crypto investors, with an upvote rating on DEXTools of around 90%, potential investors should be aware of MetaBlox’s 5% buy and sell tax and five other concerning aspects to its smart contract.</p>
<h2><strong>Morra ($MORRA)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Web3 game studio Morra Games’s native token $MORRA has seen an impressive 40% pump in the past 24 hours according to <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x144805be43c48ef85435c94e0da4cb4efb1ab4f3">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>Its market cap was last around $8 million, with just under $800,000 having changed hands in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xc56ec315db551315ed9857019fdb4c639ed9fd8c">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The token last had liquidity of around $340,000 and around 1,800 holders.</p>
<p>Potential investors should be wary of the token’s 4% buy and 6.06% sell tax, as well as eight other concerning aspects to its token contract, as identified by DEXTools’ security audit.</p>
<h2><strong>Agoras Currency of Tau ($AGRS)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called Agoras Currency of Tau ($AGRS) is up over 40% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x738865301a9b7dd80dc3666dd48cf034ec42bdda">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xaddd24a001243e6d446ed8d088c82aeff84073a3">DEXTools</a>, the token last had a market cap of more than $50 million, having pumped around 900% in the last week.</p>
<p>$AGRS has seen over $900,000 in trading volumes in the past 24 hours, has over $500,000 in liquidity and over 1,350 holders, but does have five concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools’ security audit.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

A shitcoin called Eternal AI ($MIND) that was launched on Thursday has seen explosive upside of more than 10,000% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xa3a0f67a1eb55988c3e3f1c36e4133d39a6312b3">DEXTools</a>, making it the best-performing shitcoin of the day.</p>
<p>The token’s market cap was last around $1.65 million, with 24-hour trading volumes of around $1.9 million and just over 900 holders.</p>
<p>The token also has around $225,000 in locked liquidity, but investors should be cautious given its 5% buy and sell tax, other smart-contract issues (as per DEXTools’ audit) and its downvote rating on the platform of around 43%.</p>
<h2>BABYFROGE ($BABYFROGE)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called BABYFROGE ($BABYFROGE) that was launched on Thursday has seen explosive upside of more than 7% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xcbf31a5bd3ee6398867fd1edd69cce845b9ea1c5">DEXTools</a>, making it one of the best-performing shitcoins of the day.</p>
<p>The token’s market cap was last around $400,000, with 24-hour trading volumes of around $400,000 and just over 350 holders.</p>
<p>The shitcoin also has liquidity of around $180,000, though it isn’t locked, so investors should be cautious of a potential rug pull attempt.</p>
<h2>Betrock ($BETROCK)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto casino token Betrock ($BETROCK) has pumped more than 300% in the last 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x5b8e7de9d5b3c793978d8f9816ef659983e2677d">DEXTools</a>, making it a top-performing shitcoin.</p>
<p>Its market cap was last around $235,000, with around $80,000 in locked liquidity and 24-hour trading volumes of around $200,000.</p>
<p>But investors should be aware of its 3% and 3.31% buy and sell taxes and a few other concerning aspects to its token smart contract, as identified by DEXTools’ audit.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has just received approval from a bankruptcy court to sell its stakes in digital trusts managed by Grayscale Investments, according to a <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MjYwMjgzNg==&amp;id2=-1">bankruptcy court document</a> filed on Friday.</p>
<p>This move is part of FTX&#8217;s strategic efforts to repay billions owed to creditors.</p>
<p>The assets, valued at about $744 million last month, form a key component of FTX&#8217;s plan to manage its bankruptcy.</p>
<p>These stakes in various digital trusts, devised by Grayscale and Bitwise, offer investors direct exposure to cryptocurrencies without the need to take self-custody of them.</p>
<p>FTX&#8217;s approach in selling these assets aims to maximize their value while minimizing market disruptions, as outlined in the court documents.</p>
<p>The fallen exchange got the green light to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-court-approves-ftxs-request-liquidate-crypto-assets-which-coins-will-impacted.htm">start selling its crypto holdings</a> in mid-September.</p>
<h2><strong>FTX on a Mission to Return Assets to Debtors</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since filing for bankruptcy last year amidst fraud allegations, FTX has been on a mission to recover assets and address a complex network of debts.</p>
<p>This includes obligations to customers who invested cash and cryptocurrencies on the platform.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-customers-may-see-90-asset-return-by-q2-2024-amended-proposal.htm">FTX&#8217;s administrators have successfully recovered around $7 billion in assets</a>, including $3.4 billion in crypto, highlighting the scale and complexity of the company&#8217;s financial entanglements.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s green light for FTX to proceed with these asset sales is a critical step in the company&#8217;s restructuring process. It underscores the challenges faced by cryptocurrency exchanges in balancing asset liquidation with maintaining stable market conditions.</p>
<p>This is particularly vital given the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the potential impact of such substantial asset sales.</p>
<p>As FTX embarks on this crucial phase of its asset liquidation and restructuring, the broader cryptocurrency community and market observers will be closely watching <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-crypto-asset-sales-will-not-crash-market-coinbase-report.htm">how these sales affect the market</a>.</p>
<p>The development comes after FTX unveiled a plan to kickstart a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-unveils-reboot-plan-for-new-offshore-exchange-under-new-leadership.htm">new offshore cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Blue-chip cryptocurrencies are consolidating close to recent highs, with Bitcoin (BTC) having once again challenged year-to-date highs earlier in the session in the $38,400s.</p>
<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was last trading in the $37,800s, roughly flat on the day as traders monitor commentary from a top US Treasury official, who warned that crypto firms and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/deputy-u-s-treasury-secretary-puts-bad-actors-in-crypto-on-notice-delivers-remarks-at-d-c-policy-summit.htm">USD-stablecoin issuers need to take action against bad actors</a> using their platforms to avoid regulatory action.</p>
<p>Crypto traders and investors fear that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">Tether</a>, the issuer of the world’s most widely used USD-stablecoin USDT, might be in the US government’s firing line and this could be keeping the market slightly nervous on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, the broader macro backdrop remains positive, with stocks and gold still in a multi-week uptrend and US bond yields still trending lower as macro investors bet on rate cuts from the Fed next year, with the latest bets provoked by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-view-usa-2023-11-29/">dovish commentary from Fed policymaker Christopher Waller</a> who is normally considered more of a hawk.</p>
<p>Buy-the-dip is likely to remain the best strategy for Bitcoin, with lows consistently getting shallower in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed, amid expectations of near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, the April 2024 halving of the BTC inflation rate and an improving macro backdrop, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-nears-38k-bull-run-etf-hopes-up.htm#:~:text=The%20pivot%20point%20stands%20at,cushions%20at%20%2434%2C419%20and%20%2433%2C140.">medium-term price predictions are likely to remain bullish</a>, as is likely also the case for major altcoins.</p>
<p>But traders looking to secure quick exponential gains will continue to turn to the highly volatile and illiquid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> market.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers as per the most widely used decentralized exchange (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">DEX</a>) <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x580e933d90091b9ce380740e3a4a39c67eb85b4c">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>KAP Games ($KAP)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Web3 game developer KAP Games native token ($KAP) has seen a stunning near 300% pump in the past 24 hours, making it <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x9625ce7753ace1fa1865a47aae2c5c2ce4418569">Uniswap’s</a> top-performing shitcoin.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x48200057593487b93311b03c845afda306a90e2a">DEXTools</a>, the token last had a market cap of $16.8 million, with nearly $900,000 in volumes having changed hands in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The token has close to 500 holders and over $200,000 in liquidity and two concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools’ security audit.</p>
<h2><strong>Satellite Doge-1 Mission (DOGE-1)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Satellite Doge-1 Mission (DOGE-1), a shitcoin that has sprung up in honor of Elon Musk’s space company SpaceX’s plans to launch a new satellite into space called Doge-1, has been pumping in recent days.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0xffe203b59393593965842439ce1e7d7c78109b46">Uniswap</a>, it was last up 200% in the past 24 hours, taking its market cap to around $2.4 million.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x4dad2532f1b6a8349ef0b7c08f4f4ac2d2870ef6">DEXTools</a>, the token has seen 24-hour trading volumes of around $1.1 million, has accumulated over 1,100 holders and has around $180,000 in locked liquidity.</p>
<p>The token has a very poor community trust rating on DEXTools of just 27% upvotes.</p>
<p>It also has three smart-contract security alerts, as per DEXTools’ smart-contract, so potential investors should be cautious.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) just punched through $38,000 to hit new highs for the year, with a near-term retest of $40,000 looking increasingly likely.</p>
<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation was last trading around $37,800 and with gains of around 1.5% on the day.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of most US market participants given the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, trading volumes are still elevated at over $21.5 billion so far for the session, above Monday’s $20.8 billion and Thursday’s $14.2 billion, as per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD">Yahoo data</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> bulls have regained control of the market following a turbulent week that saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">Binance settle dual lawsuits with the US Department of Justice (DoJ)</a> and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by paying fines in excess of $7 billion, with ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao also being forced to step down and plead guilty to one offence (he may face a year in jail).</p>
<p>By the end of the trading week, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-says-binances-record-4-3b-settlement-removes-systemic-risk-calls-it-positive.htm">analysts had largely agreed that Binance’s settlement removes systemic risk</a> (i.e. the risk of the exchanges collapse) from the crypto market and should also boost the odds of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-updates-bitcoin-etf-prospectus-after-discussing-with-sec.htm">near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals from the SEC</a>, which could explain <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC’s</a> breakout to fresh highs for the year.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Next for Bitcoin (BTC)?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin’s latest push higher has seen it tease a breakout to the north of an ascending triangle structure it has been forming over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>These structures are characterized by an asset price consistently finding resistance at the same level ($38,000 in Bitcoin’s case), but price lows consistently getting higher, as bulls buy the dip with increasing enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Technicians often view the formation of such a structure as a bullish indicator that buying pressure is building up, and a bullish breakout is coming.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s latest push above $38,000, whilst short-lived, could be a sign that a more convincing push towards $40,000 and break above this ascending triangle pattern is soon coming.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136392" style="width: 1787px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136392" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1.png" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Chart / Source: TradingView" width="1787" height="720" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1.png 1787w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1-300x121.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1-1024x413.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1-768x309.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1-1536x619.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1787px) 100vw, 1787px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136392" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin (BTC) Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>While Bitcoin did reach as high as the $38,400s earlier in the session, it remains too early to say the breakout is confirmed, given the quick dip back to the upper $37,000s.</p>
<p>Indeed, any bullish breakout for Bitcoin would need “approval” from US market participants who are largely absent on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders should closely monitor trading conditions on Monday when US markets reopen and the world’s largest liquidity source returns – a pump back above $38,000 amid high trading volumes would suggest US investors are aggressively buying into the bullish BTC story.</p>
<p>Traders should be aware that Bitcoin price risks remain very much titled to the upside – Binance’s settlement removes systemic market risk, spot Bitcoin ETF approvals seem close, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> in 2024 will soon reduce monthly sell pressure from miners and macro conditions have been trending in a bullish direction for Bitcoin recently, as US stocks rise and US bond yields dive on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-minutes-likely-anchor-careful-approach-policy-2023-11-21/">bets the Fed will start cutting rates in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of potential bullish narratives that could support the BTC price going into December, which is historically a strong month for Bitcoin anyway.</p>
<p>If everything plays out well (i.e. macro conditions keep improving and spot ETF approvals come in), a push towards 2022’s highs in the $48,000 region seems likely by early 2024.</p>

<p><i>Friday, November 24, 2023</i> – The Bitcoin price smashed through $38,000 door after BlackRock met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to talk about its ETF application as the odds on approval rise and new cryptocurrency the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> raises north of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token is the ideal investment vehicle for playing the exchange-traded fund (ETF) theme that is gripping the crypto market. Investors have poured $1,577,000 million into the ICO, currently priced at $0.0058. $BTCETF is at stage 5 of its 10-stage presale. </p>
<p>There are only three days to go before the price rises to $0.0060, although this stage could sell out sooner as there is only $500,000 to raise before stage 6 begins.</p>
<p>Although false starts on erroneous reports that a BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF had been approved and that the same asset manager was planning to issue a spot XRP ETF, were unwelcome reminders of the relative immaturity of the crypto market, it reminded everyone that the bulls are raring to go.</p>
<p>A meeting between BlackRock and the SEC earlier this week has also got the juices flowing, as Bitcoin trades as high as $38,250 today at an 18-month high. Then there was SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce who chimed in this week with more positive news flow, commenting, “&#8230;there is no reason for us to stand in the way of a spot bitcoin ETF.” </p>
<p>Add to that the $4.3 billion settlement of the criminal charges brought against Binance by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and erstwhile CEO CZ, and it feels to many like the digital asset sector is on the cusp of a new golden era, where regulators rule the roost and retail and institutional investors can trade easily and safely.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ETF Token is specially developed to ride the wave of ETF-induced Bitcoin FOMO</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As the number of spot Bitcoin ETF applications swells to 12, there are now ways of gaining exposure to the pre-launch excitement that doesn’t involve waiting for the applications to be approved: enter the Bitcoin ETF Token.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) has been specially developed to appeal to market participants who want to gain exposure to the spot Bitcoin ETF alpha returns story.</p>
<p>Running on the Ethereum blockchain, the $BTCETF Token has been fashioned in such a way as to benefit from each real-world milestone in the journey of the spot Bitcoin ETF from approval to launch.</p>
<p>A burn tax kicks in when the coin launches on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decreases by 1% as each designated milestone is reached. Running in parallel to that, there is a burn mechanism of up to 25% of the total supply in order to further bolster the deflationary scarcity of the coin. Every time a milestone is reached, the transaction tax is reduced by 1%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136379" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700848002-btcetf-2.png" alt="" width="512" height="129" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700848002-btcetf-2.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700848002-btcetf-2-300x76.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>These twin mechanisms mean that owners of the $BTCETF Token will have the most strongly aligned crypto portfolios with the spot Bitcoin ETF growth story.</p>
<p>Recent developments in the regulatory front, far from dampening spirits, have led to yet more optimism. Binance’s troubles signal to the rest of the market that the financial authorities in the US will no longer tolerate crypto exchanges operating outside of existing law.</p>
<p>At a stroke, the Department of Justice has signaled to the SEC and investors of all stripes that trading venues that in effect have been hives of possibly manipulative trading activity, despite denials, are facing extinction. Either exchanges register with the authorities and come into compliance, or they will be forced out of business.</p>
<p>It cannot be overstated how consequential this is for the future expansion prospects of the market. Going forward, and allied with the approval of an ETF, there will be an easy and regulated route for wealth managers and financial advisers to buy exposure to Bitcoin on behalf of their clients. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Buy Bitcoin ETF Token</a></p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETFs to become a $100 billion market says Bloomberg Intelligence</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the US, trillions of dollars of investment is directed by financial advisers on behalf of their clients. As such, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that it is only a matter of time before the spot Bitcoin ETF market is valued at $100 billion.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/spot-bitcoin-btc-etf-approval-seen-driving-money-managers-to-crypto">Bloomberg reports</a> that a number of managers and advisers it has spoken to have been receiving inquiries from their clients about spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>Jeff Janson of Florida-based Summit Wealth told Bloomberg, “I feel like we are now staring down the gun barrel of the SEC finally delivering approval,” Janson, whose firm manages about $550 million, said in an interview. “And my belief is that once you have access to it in that type of a wrapper, I think you’re going to have a significant amount of institutional-level interest.”  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Galaxy Digitals reports that it has fielded inquiries from 300 investment professionals asking about how to make allocations using a spot Bitcoin ETF vehicle.</p>
<p>Chuck Cumello, the CEO of Essex Financial Services in Connecticut, reinforces the point about the removal of trading friction, perceived or otherwise: “It would just be simple and easy to place a trade – to have it long in a client’s investment advisory account.”   </p>
<p>But if you are among the 99% of Americans who don’t have a financial adviser, then you might be more inclined to forgo paying a fee to such firms and instead make an investment in the Bitcoin ETF Token by simply connecting a funded crypto wallet to make your contribution.</p>

<h2>Is Tether the next shoe to drop… and another shot in the arm for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There could also be other shoes to drop after the Binance settlement, which will remove more gray areas from the marketplace. Investors hate uncertainty, so anything that removes it will be welcomed.</p>
<p>With that in mind, are the US authorities coming for Tether next? </p>
<p>If Binance was the top-dog exchange, Tether has been just as essential as the de facto settlement layer of the entire crypto trading system, in its role as the issuer of the most-used stablecoin. </p>
<p>For as long as crypto has been traded at serious volumes, USDT (Tether) has been the method for parking funds as an on- and off-ramp for entering and exiting crypto markets in a way that protects the value of funds not being actively traded. </p>
<p>Tether is backed 1:1 by cash or near-cash equivalents, but the extent of that backing has always been in dispute.</p>
<p>In October US Senator Cynthia Lummis said the DOJ needed to stop delaying with pressing charges against Binance and Tether, although she sees the SEC as the bad guy in all this, regulating through piecemeal enforcement actions. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SEC cannot continue ruling by enforcement. My statement on the Kraken lawsuit below: <a href="https://t.co/J3qhzU624N">pic.twitter.com/J3qhzU624N</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1726768494069354545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Well, the US government prosecutors have made their move with Binance, so is Tether next? </p>
<p>Tether has been able to get away with no official auditing of the assets backing its stablecoin. It is difficult to see how that position can be sustained. Also, issuing stablecoins is probably a business line that BlackRock, and others, would like to get into. </p>
<p>Could the US government be about to give BlackRock a helping hand in the same way that some claim they have done by getting Binance out of the picture?</p>
<p>Tether might want to do the smart and proactive thing and settle with the DOJ before they come knocking at its door.</p>
<p>Clearing up the ambiguities around the backing for the Tether stablecoin would see the removal of perhaps the last major regulatory uncertainty in the crypto markets, and, as with the demise of Binance, be a big plus for the healthy expansion of the crypto market into the mainstream. </p>
<p>It would be another major hurdle removed that’s standing in the way of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval and another indirect price booster for <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/">Bitcoin ETF Token</a>.</p>
<h2>Crypto YouTuber is “super bullish on $BTCETF” – buy today and earn 162% APY</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
$BTCETF tokens can be bought in presale today and <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/en/dashboard">staked to earn</a> an annual percentage yield (APY) of 162% at the time of writing. </p>
<p>There have been 164 million $BTCETF tokens deposited into the staking smart contract to date, in a testament to the popularity of this passive income route. Staking rewards are distributed in $BTCETF over a five-year period. Each ETH block produced generates a reward of 119 $BTCETF.</p>
<p>Crypto YouTuber Micheal Wrubel with 310,000 subscribers is <a href="https://youtu.be/-Kg6r3h7Ubs?si=F9gTFuQ2nOwxu6q1">super bullish on $BTCETF</a>, as he explains in his day-old video which has already amassed 21,000 views:</p>
<p>Austin Hilton with 235k subscribers on YouTube is another $BTCETF fan. He tells his audience that $BTCETF is <a href="https://youtu.be/xyKxJ5iotm4?si=k1nf_rqsVBb9vBT2">“like nothing you have ever seen,”</a> as he encourages viewers to find out more.</p>
<p>Another crypto analyst on YouTube is penciling in <a href="https://youtu.be/-1GkbrrS3k8?si=ITqO9Q5BRXpyXqob">10x returns for Bitcoin ETF Token</a>.</p>
<p>There is a price explosion coming for Bitcoin as a wall of money is about to flood into the markets thanks to the imminent spot Bitcoin ETF approval. </p>
<p>The new <a href="http://btcetftoken.com">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is one of the most attractive investment propositions in crypto today because it will directly benefit from the approval and launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF regardless of which of the 12 competing issuers wins the race.</p>

<p>Major blue-chip cryptocurrencies are trading with a positive bias on Friday despite a lack of trading volumes with US market participants away for the Thanksgiving holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) briefly hit fresh highs for the year above $38,000 and at current levels around $37,800 is currently trading up around 1.6% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Bitcoin bulls have noted that the cryptocurrency is probing a break above key resistance at $38,000 which could open the door to a swift move above $40,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ether</a> (ETH), meanwhile, recovered back to the north of $2,100, up 2.6% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The bullish bias could reflect optimism that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-us-guilty-plea-may-raise-complications-for-hong-kong-affiliates-crypto-license-application-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Binance’s recent settlement deal with US authorities</a> removes systemic risk to the market of a potential collapse of the exchange, as well as ongoing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/why-binance-and-cz-take-down-is-good-news-for-blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etfs-and-new-btcetf-token-thats-raised-1-4m.htm">optimism surrounding expected near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> and an improving macro backdrop.</p>
<p>Macro traders wills be monitoring US Core PCE Price Index Inflation figures, US ISM Manufacturing data and a speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell next week.</p>
<p>Recent US data has painted a picture of the economy cooling, leading markets to bet that the Fed’s rate hiking cycle is over and a cutting cycle is coming next year, despite still hawkish warnings from the central bank’s policymakers that further rate increases remain on the table.</p>
<p>While cryptocurrency markets could see big moves next week, volumes will remain low until US markets properly come back online.</p>
<p>Traders seeking quick exponential returns will thus continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets in the hunt for a quick profit.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/gainers">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>PEPEDAO ($PEPED)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A newly launched shitcoin called PEPEDAO ($PEPED), which appears to be attempting to masquerade as representing the decentralized Pepe Coin community, has seen a more than 8,000% pump since its launch earlier on Friday as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xce5a3d3a94edc6c758a882e49ffa9e4004a01603">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>$PEPED’s market cap was last around $700,000 amid just over $200,000 in 24-hour trading volumes, close to 300 holders and liquidity of around $250,000.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools’ smart contract security review, the token has one concerning aspect transfers are potentially pausable.</p>
<h2><strong>Bonsai3 ($SEED)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called Bonsai3 ($SEED) is pumping for a third straight day, having gained 45% in the past 24 hours as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x95d9e85a31ed4cfba8421488d295a25bc76b473f">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The token last had a market capitalization of around $3.43 million, close to $500,000 in locked liquidity and around 650 holders.</p>
<p>24-hour trading volumes were last at $700,000 suggesting interest in the token remains high.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools’ security audit, the token has a 4% buy and sell tax, as well as a number of other concerning aspects to its smart contract, so investors need to exercise caution.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<p>The surge in the meme coin’s price comes alongside a pump in recent weeks in the Solana (SOL) price amid a broader crypto market rally fuelled by optimism about institutional adoption with spot Bitcoin ETF approvals seemingly coming in the US very soon.</p>
<p>While BONK! is certainly a hot prospect right now, it’s far from the only meme coin attracting a lot of interest.</p>
<p>An up-and-coming meme coin called <a href="https://www.memekombat.io/">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK) has been generating huge hype thanks to its unique value proposition, given its token powers a fun platform that sits at the intersection of GameFi and GambleFi.</p>
<p>The token’s presale has already raised a whopping more than $2 million as top traders back the token.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Meme Kombat?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme Kombat is a web3 platform that blends together the world of crypto gaming and gambling with its exciting platform were users are able to bet on the outcomes of exciting battles between characters based on some of the crypto world’s most popular meme coins.</p>
<p>Given its strong appeal to meme coin investors and GameFi and GambleFi addicts, Meme Kombat is expected to have a wide appeal.</p>
<p>$MK is currently priced at $0.214, but will be rising 10% to $0.225 when the presale enters its next stage in just under 6 days.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MK</a> is now $0.214<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>Make sure you are ready for Kombat and have you <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MK</a> ready too! <a href="https://t.co/46vMGrXURU">pic.twitter.com/46vMGrXURU</a></p>

<p>It’s worth noting that while the site’s countdown shows that there are only just under seven days to go before the next price rise, the current stage could sell out much sooner than the time allocated if the $2.5 million mark is quickly hit.</p>
<p>In contrast to meme coins such as Pepe, Meme Kombat enables token holders to stake-to-earn to get a passive income stream.</p>
<p>Stakers earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of 466%. Such a high return is possible because the project has allocated 30% of token supply to staking and battle rewards.</p>
<p>Even better, presale buyers can choose to stake their coins immediately and start earning now.</p>
<p>There is a staking dashboard to show the real-time number of staked coins in the pool launching soon.</p>

<h2><strong>$MK the Next 100x Coin?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For degens focused on where to find the next 100x gem Meme Kombat has to be front and center. Put succinctly, Meme Kombat captures the latent value of arguably the top-valued sectors in crypto today – gaming and gambling.</p>
<p>Admittedly meme coins are all about virality and community engagement and have almost made it a badge of pride that they don’t actually have any utility.</p>
<p>There is of course value in networks of engaged individuals but as the market enters the next bull cycle, one feature of the maturing nature of the market is investors becoming more demanding in what they expect from a coin, and that includes memes coins.</p>
<p>Increasingly market participants want to buy into projects that are offering genuinely unique and potentially valuable use cases – there has to be a value differential.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat fits the bill perfectly. It not only hits on the two booming sectors of GameFi and GambleFi, it is also playing in the high-octane meme coin segment, where old and new money is sure to flow in powerful torrents as crypto winter recedes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t require much analysis to immediately see the value proposition in Meme Kombat and how it stacks up when compared to coins like Pepe.</p>
