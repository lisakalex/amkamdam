										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized exchanges help a trader to stay in control of his/her funds.
There is and will always be a place for centralized exchanges.</p><p>Andrew Gazdecki, CEO of Altcoin.io, has a lot to be excited about. Back in September of 2017, his team successfully completed the world&rsquo;s first atomic swap. And in January, they released their first beta wallet supporting such swaps. </p><p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what atomic swaps are, it&rsquo;s okay, they are pretty new. The first ever atomic swap occurred between cryptocurrencies Litecoin and Decred. Altcoin.io&rsquo;s bitcoin and Ethereum swap was the second ever swap, although this time it was between two totally different blockchains. </p><p>Here is how it works:</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/249200127" width="640" height="376" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/249200127">Atomic Swap Wallet &#8211; How It Works Tutorial (Beta Release)</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user74333054">Altcoin.io Exchange</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>Maybe you are starting to get the idea? Atomic swaps are a saving grace for DEXs, or decentralized exchanges; they allow two different cryptocurrencies to be traded without an escrow service or middleman. The word &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; comes from their speed: when the trade occurs, it actually happens instantly. Value is never lost during the trade. In other words, the wallet owner is constantly in control of his/her crypto. </p><p>This is entirely different from something like Shapeshift, an instant digital asset exchange. Yes, it allows automatic trading between certain coins, but there is a moment when both amounts being traded are in neither of the wallet holder&rsquo;s hands. Shapeshift acts as a trusted third party to make sure that nobody backs out of the deal. But the problem with trusting a third party is, well, you have to pay for that service&hellip; And that goes a bit against the idea of decentralization. </p><p>Shouldn&rsquo;t decentralized coins be run by decentralized services? </p><p>Atomic swaps, along with decentralized exchanges, do exactly this. They speak to the very essence of crypto because they cut out the middlemen. I asked Andrew what he thought about this:</p><p>&ldquo;I think the biggest opportunity for decentralized exchanges is giving power back to traders where you never lose ownership of your tokens. With a centralized exchange, you have to pre deposit tokens, and so if the exchange goes down or gets hacked &mdash; you&#8217;re putting valuable assets at risk.&rdquo;</p><p>Andreas Antonopoulos, one of the most respected minds in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi_jaw0dT9M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=aantonop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes too</a> that atomic swaps will let us see &ldquo;many more decentralized cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency exchanges.&rdquo;  </p><p><b>DEX</b></p><p>As soon as cryptocurrencies became popular, dozens of exchanges came out of the woodwork. Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, and Binance are among the most widely used. But because of the very nature of our society, we overlooked something: <i>all of these exchanges are centralized.</i></p><figure><a href="https://blog.altcoin.io/decentralized-exchanges-explained-and-why-we-need-them-more-than-ever-4ef9fbb9192d" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a8/fa3de9b82a.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a8/fa3de9b82a.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a8/fa3de9b82a.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a8/fa3de9b82a.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a8/fa3de9b82a.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption>Source: Altcoin.io</figcaption></figure><p>Just like Shapeshift, we give our money to a trusted third party. Just like banks, we are not 100% in control of our money. While we were all getting excited about leaving the current centralized institutions, some of them just disguised themselves to hold our cryptocurrency. </p><p>To be fair, DEXs just did not have the technology ready to compete with these exchanges. Escrow services have been in practice since the dawn of the internet, whereas decentralized, peer-2-peer services for finances have only been coming to light now. <br>
This is what is so great about atomic swaps. </p><p>If Alice wants 10 ETH for 1 BTC, the p2p network will find someone who wants 1 BTC for 10 ETH. The atomic swap is essentially a smart contract that binds the deal, and trades instantly. </p><p>Altcoin.io isn&rsquo;t the only DEX in the works. DEX Waves, Cryptobridge, Bisq, and EtherDelta are a few that are currently up and running. But when approached these companies were not willing to comment.</p><p>Currently, the greatest problem with DEXs is that they often have complicated interfaces and there are still no names that have built up a general level of trust. Most have only dealt with low volumes, and this makes it unattractive for users to participate. </p><p>But the interfaces are becoming easier, the DEX concept is becoming more popular and understood, and the tools are becoming more advanced. Andrew of Altcoin.io even mentioned that his DEX is mobile friendly and has its own wallet. So with this, you can keep all of your coins in this wallet, perform atomic swaps to trade between coins, while being in total control of your money. Kind of like Exodus, a desktop multi-asset wallet with ShapeShift built in, without all of the third parties. </p><p>One might expect that decentralized exchanges like this will thrive and become very popular in 2018. </p><p>And yes, there is and will still be a place for Centralized Exchanges.</p><p><b>What&rsquo;s next?</b></p><p>There is no way the entire world is going to flop over to using only cryptocurrency in the next 20 years. Understanding decentralization and why it&rsquo;s important also takes a lot of time. </p><p>Centralization is currently humanity&rsquo;s way of life. Everything is owned by humans. Everything is currently top-down. And to many, they do not mind a trusted institution handling their money. They are not paranoid that this institution will take their money. Even in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coincheck-hacked-more-than-500-million-xem-stolen-1093.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coincheck&rsquo;s hack</a>, the founders of the exchanges promised to reimburse everyone who lost their NEM funds. An exchange Crypto Robinhood is gaining momentum and has even found a way to not charge any taxes on crypto/fiat transactions. </p><p>Centralized exchanges will exist for the casual trader. For the people who don&rsquo;t want to think too deeply about the nitty-gritty details and do not want to feel the full weight of responsibility on their shoulders of being 100% in control of their money. </p><p>But for those who choose the decentralized exchange, they are rewiring their minds to understand decentralization. Blockchain is decentralized and its world will be decentralized in the end. It&rsquo;s like the case between Linux and Apple. You do not need to speak the language, but it sure helps if it is to become your world.</p><p><b>DEXs as the Future of trading Assets</b></p><p>While some may not know what atomic swaps are, many have probably heard of Sophia, the robot citizen of Saudi Arabia. Turns out that Sophia is also creating her very own decentralized exchange. Except this exchange doesn&rsquo;t trade currencies for other currencies: it trades AGI (SingularityNET tokens) for artificial intelligence. </p><p>This decentralized marketplace is going to allow developers and humanoids to buy and sell intelligence. It will become a global opportunity for anyone to take part in buying or selling artificial intelligence. </p><p>Decentralized marketplaces have been the dream of cypherpunks and Bitcoin fans alike. OpenBazaar, a decentralized marketplace, is looking to overtake giants like Ebay and Amazon buy letting users be in constant control of their wealth. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a8/fa13b6db42.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a8/fa13b6db42.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a8/fa13b6db42.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a8/fa13b6db42.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a8/fa13b6db42.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5a8/fa13b6db42.png 1024w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Decentralization is a fairly new concept that can finally be put into practice, thanks to inventions like smart contracts, blockchain, and the internet. While the aims of the internet from the beginning were to create a decentralized web, centralized giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google eventually took over. Now that Bitcoin has been around for 9 years, the world is ready to re-introduce decentralization to the web. This year we will see decentralization being introduced to the marketplace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be hard to write about this topic without offending anybody. Uttering the words &ldquo;Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin can coexist&rdquo; hurts both sides of the debate, like pressing on an open wound. This is not something that is getting any better. </p><p><i>(<b>Disclaimer</b>: I have no stake in either Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Cash)</i>. </p><p>Recently the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, said in its report that, &ldquo;technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain&rdquo;. (The Bitcoin Cash fork last August was caused by the Bitcoin Cash miners increasing the blocksize limit from 1 MB to 8 MB). The statement by the NIST gave the BCH community exactly the boost they needed to claim superiority. The general consensus of the BCH community is that this is their chance to rise to prominence. However, the NIST report also states that the public comment period would remain open until February 23.   </p><p><b>How does this war affect you?</b> </p><p>BTC and BCH hedge against each other. In other words, when BCH goes up dramatically, the chances are that BTC will be in the red, and vice-versa. This is because they are both essentially competing for the same thing: to become the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, proponents of BCH believe that they are carrying out the true vision of Bitcoin.  </p><p>Think of these coins as giants battling each other on a land shared with villagers. While BTC and BCH battle for dominance, the rest of the cryptoworld feels the ripples. Many skeptics see this battle as a harbinger of the &#8216;crash&#8217; that everyone who has not bought into crypto yet is waiting for. This instability is laughable by banks, because to them, it shows that teams cannot come up with simple answers to important decisions. To them, decentralization brings the prospect of instability, and diminishes investment potential. </p><p>To many blockchain believers, this is an opportunity for smaller coins to grow. Ripple, Ethereum, and Cardano have seen major growth since the drama between BCH and BTC began. And to many who have been involved with crypto for some years now, this is just another volatile moment for a never ending volatile coin.  </p><p>In the last year, events on the crypto exchange Coinbase, where there were accusations of insider trading during the release of BCH on the exchange, have really brought out the true colors of how people feel about this. There was a lot of heat on BCH when it was forked in August, but the news of another much more threatening fork, Segwit2x, drew the attention away for a bit. When the Segwit2x supporters decided to postpone, the heat drew back towards Bitcoin Cash.  </p><p><b>The Arguments</b> (as brief as they can be) </p><p><b><u>Bitcoin</u></b> is a movement of cypherpunks and activists; the aim of Bitcoin is to create the most decentralized form of money, one where it becomes almost impossible for one group to control the currency. This belief absolutely cannot be compromised, no matter what the conditions are.  </p><p><b>Most relevant supporter- Andreas Antonopoulos</b><br>
One of the most trusted and influential people in the cryptocurrency industry, Antonopoulos is known for his love, or possibly even obsession, with Bitcoin and what it could do to change the world. In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t until recently that he even became a millionaire; throughout most of his involvement with Bitcoin, he wasn&rsquo;t making much at all. Antonopoulos was just speaking and advocating, until one day the community donated over 100 Bitcoins to him. </p><p>Although Antonopoulos is a large supporter of BTC, his focus is not on trying to destroy BCH. He actually thinks they can coexist.</p><oembed url="https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/929547597592788994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></oembed><p>   </p><p>If you read through the comments, you can see that Antonopoulos does not think that BCH is even remotely close to taking over Bitcoin. He has no desire to be &ldquo;feeding into the drama, distracting from the important work that needs to be done.&rdquo; </p><p><b><u>Bitcoin Cash</u></b> is a movement that claims it wants to increase confidence in cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin has been criticized for slow transaction times, high mining fees and high energy consumption, factors that BCH&#8217;s supporters feel it combats.  </p><p><b>Most relevant supporter &#8211; Roger Ver</b></p><oembed url="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/943218973495107584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></oembed><p>Roger Ver is a long-time investor in cryptocurrencies and the cofounder of bitcoin.com. While some within the community believe he is playing unfairly, Ver fully supports Bitcoin Cash, and is trying to convince everyone that BCH is the true bitcoin. There is even a eatured page on bitcoin.com that supports his claims.  </p><p><b>Decentralization and scaling issues</b> </p><p>As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin Core roots from cypherpunks and activists. The people who have stayed true to Bitcoin want to see a truly decentralized currency. And they believe that they will get what they want, but it will take some time to do it the right way. </p><p>Those in the BTC camp believe that they have solutions for these problems, and that taking action such as forking will just prolong the inevitable. Sure, increasing the block size alleviates the pain now. But for how long, and at what cost? Increasing the block size makes for a more centralized coin. Larger blocks mean full nodes are more expensive to operate, which leads to fewer hashers running the nodes.  </p><p>Eventually Bitcoin Cash will also have to deal with the problems that BTC faces; BCH is nowhere near scalability (running at circa 23 transactions per second) when compared with processors like Visa, which can do up to 24,000 transactions per second. </p><p>Bitcoin has scaling solutions, they are just going to take some time (or maybe less time than you think). </p><p>The Lightning Network is coming, and it is Bitcoin&rsquo;s solution to many of the above problems. It&rsquo;s an off-chain solution, just like the Raiden network that is being rolled-out by Ethereum. The Lightning Network will allow for near-instant transactions, with very small transaction fees. Lightning creates micropayment channels that are off-chain, which means the transaction doesn&rsquo;t need to immediately broadcast to the blockchain. A simulation of 10 million users operating on the Lightning Network proved to be functional, yet still lightning fast. Three separate labs, ACINQ, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs, are independently working feverishly towards building a working network, and mainstream adoption is well underway. </p><p>***</p><p>No one knows, when or how this BTC v. BCH war will end. But this short introduction to the complex crypto drama ends with a few numbers (look for more details on bitinfocharts.com) and a tweet by Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder, a New York venture firm that specializes in cryptoassets.</p><p><b><u>Bitcoin v.
