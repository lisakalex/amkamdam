										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2024 Bitcoin Halving event has been in the cryptocurrency conversation for a while, and has long been earmarked as the event that could help to end the “Crypto Winter” and start the next bull run. But, for many, the Bitcoin Halving 2024 is still a phrase shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>In this post, we explain what a Bitcoin Halving is and look back at previous Bitcoin halving events to help us understand what might happen after the Bitcoin Halving in 2024.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>During a Bitcoin halving event, the rewards miners receive for mining Bitcoin blocks are cut in half.</li>
<li>Halvings are an integral part of Bitcoin’s economic structure and reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created.</li>
<li>Bitcoin Halvings take place every 4 years, and the last Halving will take place in 2140. At which time, the block reward will be just 0.00000001 BTC (it is currently 6.25 BTC).</li>
<li>The last Bitcoin Halving happened in May 2020, reducing Bitcoin rewards from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.</li>
<li>Historically, Bitcoin Halving events have been followed by bull market markets and new ATHs.</li>
<li>Due to multiple external factors, the Bitcoin Halving in 2024 is going to be different from all the previous halving events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Bitcoin Halving?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A Bitcoin Halving is when the reward received by miners for creating a block on the Bitcoin blockchain is cut in half. These are pre-planned events that are coded into the Bitcoin protocol. To properly dive into the mechanism of the Halving event, we first need to know how the Bitcoin blockchain operates.</p>
<h3>How Bitcoin Works</h3>
<p>The protocol that governs the Bitcoin blockchain was outlined in the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>, released in 2008. It is a decentralized network where cryptography (hence the term cryptocurrency) is used to confirm and verify transactions, and consensus on what has occurred on the network is achieved through a proof-of-work consensus algorithm.</p>
<p>In the Bitcoin protocol, a copy of all past transactions, called the ledger, is kept and verified by each node in the system. New transactions are added to the ledger in increments, called blocks. When a new block is added to the blockchain, all the nodes read it and verify the transactions. Blocks are created, also called mined, by miners. This process happens roughly every 10 minutes.</p>
<h3>The Process of Mining</h3>
<p>A network like Bitcoin cannot be built on trust alone— the whole goal of Bitcoin is to do away with the trusted middleman. It is for this reason that we have miners and the proof-of-work algorithm.</p>
<p>In a proof-of-work algorithm, miners must expend energy to solve a difficult mathematic computation to &#8220;discover&#8221; a Bitcoin block. The first one to find the answer to the mathematical computation—which is a hash of a number (called a nonce) that is included in each block—adds the block to the chain, locking the block in the process and collecting the reward for doing so.</p>
<p>The transactions in this block are verified by the nodes and other miners of the network—this is the decentralized part, because everyone else checks to make sure the miner is honest and not including any invalid transactions in their block.</p>
<p>As more miners join the network, it gets harder to mine Bitcoin, meaning that more energy needs to be expended to find the answer and create a block. If miners leave the network, it becomes easier to mine Bitcoin. This expenditure of energy is what helps to keep miners honest, and keeps anyone from spamming the network with incorrect blocks and transactions.</p>
<p><em>Note that the process is called mining as it is said to be akin to how an exceptional amount of work needs to be put in to mine precious metals from the earth. Except Bitcoin miners use electrical energy to extract Bitcoins.</em></p>
<h3>Why Halve the Bitcoin Block Reward?</h3>
<p>Bitcoin was designed to be a peer-to-peer digital cash, meaning that it is aiming to be used like we do any currency today.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Bitcoins vs Satoshis</h3>
<p>Even though 1 Bitcoin is currently worth tens of thousands of dollars, it actually has 8 decimal places, meaning you can buy as little as 0.00000001 of a Bitcoin. This 0.00000001 of a Bitcoin is 1 Satoshi.</p>
<p>For 1 satoshi to be worth 1 dollar, 1 Bitcoin would have to reach a value of $100m. There are some people who say we should actually be calculating things in satoshis, so, instead of saying, &#8220;I bought 0.01 BTC,” we should instead be saying “I bought 1 million satoshis.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The currencies we use today are issued by a central bank. They are also typically inflationary, meaning that the bank issues more currency, which, in turn, devalues the value of the pieces of currency already out there, meaning that prices rise.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin is decentralized, there needs to be a way of controlling the overall supply and the issuance of these coins. This is done by distributing them to the miners who create the blocks and secure the network.</p>
<p>The Halving mechanism is a factor in Bitcoin’s monetary policy and is built into the code. It serves many purposes in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controlled Inflation:</strong> Halving limits excessive inflation and ensures that the rate of Bitcoin inflation decreases steadily over time, essentially making it a deflationary asset. The final Bitcoin will be mined at some point in 2140. This is in complete contrast to the currencies we use today, which are inflationary assets.</li>
<li><strong>Capped Supply:</strong> Bitcoin was created with a finite total supply of 21 million Bitcoins. The Halvings allow it to issue this supply over an extended period of time, which enables it to achieve the other goals listed here.</li>
<li><strong>Market Forces:</strong> Each halving event reduces the profitability of mining Bitcoin, forcing miners to streamline their business models while removing less productive miners from the ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Extended Timeline for Adoption: </strong>Eventually, there will be no Bitcoin left to mine. After this point, sometime around 2140, miners will only earn from transaction fees. This requires enough transactions that only come from a high level of network adoption. Having new Bitcoins being distributed well into the future allows an adequate amount of time for that adoption to happen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Do Bitcoin Halvings Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Bitcoin halving cycle is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol. No one individual or group of people has to step in to make a network change; it is done automatically.</p>
<p>If we use a block explorer to look back at the blocks in Bitcoin’s history at the first Halving event at <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/210000">block 210,000</a>, we can compare this with <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/209999">block 209,999</a> and see the evidence of the Halving ourselves.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1130" height="634" class="aligncenter wp-image-122551" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660927-side-by-side-block-comparison-for-halving.png" alt="Side by side block comparison for Bitcoin Halving event" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660927-side-by-side-block-comparison-for-halving.png 1130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660927-side-by-side-block-comparison-for-halving-300x168.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660927-side-by-side-block-comparison-for-halving-1024x575.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660927-side-by-side-block-comparison-for-halving-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1130px) 100vw, 1130px" /></p>
<p>For block 209,999, the amount of minted Bitcoin was 50 BTC. For block 210,000, it was 25 BTC. This Halving of rewards can also be seen at blocks <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/419999">419,999</a> and <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/420000">420,000</a>, and again at blocks <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/629999">629,999</a> and <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/630000">630,000</a>, and again at the next Bitcoin halving in 2024, at block height 840,000.</p>
<h2>Does a Bitcoin Halving Affect the Price of Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Halving of Bitcoin is a protocol event on the Bitcoin blockchain that reduces the amount of rewards miners receive for mining a block by half, e.g., from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. It has nothing to do with the price of Bitcoin, and any price movements attributed to the Halving are, just that, an association.</p>
<p>There have, however, been observations made about a correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the occurrence of halving events. We cover these in detail in the section below, but the general observation is that a Bitcoin halving event has no direct impact on the price of Bitcoin at the time of the event.</p>
<p>It is also noted that the Bitcoin Halving event has implications for the price of Bitcoin in the months after the event. Previous Halving events have been followed by precipitous price rises of the following size:</p>

<h2>When is the Next Bitcoin Halving?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The next Bitcoin Halving event will occur in April. It is currently expected to occur in April 2024. Predictions range between April 13th and April 24th.</p>
<p>The exact date for the Bitcoin Halving is not set in stone because it occurs at a specific block height of the Bitcoin blockchain. Let’s explain.</p>
<p>A blockchain is exactly what it says on the box: a chain of blocks. A block is akin to a page on a ledger. It is filled with transactions and then added to the chain. It also contains a reference to the previous block, further cementing the factual proof of that block as the next block in the chain—it is also this reference that makes it impossible to alter transactions already recorded on the blockchain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="2398" height="808" class="aligncenter wp-image-123001" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669625-bitcoin-block-explorer.jpeg" alt="Bitcoin's stats on a block explorer" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669625-bitcoin-block-explorer.jpeg 2398w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669625-bitcoin-block-explorer-300x101.jpeg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669625-bitcoin-block-explorer-1024x345.jpeg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669625-bitcoin-block-explorer-768x259.jpeg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669625-bitcoin-block-explorer-1536x518.jpeg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669625-bitcoin-block-explorer-2048x690.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2398px) 100vw, 2398px" /></p>
<p>These blocks are numbered, as a page in a ledge would be. Instead of &#8220;go to page …&#8221; we would say &#8220;go to block …&#8221; or &#8220;go to block height …&#8221;. At the time of writing, we were at block 814,027. The current block height, and the content of all previous blocks, can be seen by looking at any <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer">Bitcoin blockchain explorer</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Each Bitcoin Halving event occurs every 210,000 blocks, and the next Halving is set to occur at a block height of 840,000, which is expected to be reached on April 24th, 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>Miners fill blocks with transactions and then need to compute a hash to mine the block. This requires solving a complex mathematical problem using computer power. This target time for solving this equation is 10 minutes. However, the more miners, i.e., the more computing power, that are working to try and solve this equation, the quicker it is solved.</p>
<p>Every two weeks, <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_difficulty">a parameter called the mining difficulty adjusts itself automatically to keep block times around 10 minutes</a>. If more miners have joined the network, and blocks are being produced in less than 10 minutes, then Bitcoin’s mining difficulty goes up so that it takes 10 minutes to make a block. The opposite is also true when miners leave the network. The delay in the change of mining difficulty is why Bitcoin block times vary slightly, and this is why we cannot predict the exact time when the Bitcoin Halving event in 2024 will occur.</p>
<h3>Calculating the Next Bitcoin Halving Date</h3>
<p>Because the Bitcoin Halving process is baked into the protocol to happen at regular intervals, every 210,000 blocks, we can use this information to determine when the next Bitcoin Halving event will occur. It takes approximately 10 minutes to mine a Bitcoin block, meaning that a halving event occurs once every 2,100,000 minutes.</p>
<p>This is 1458.33 days, which is 3.995 years, which is often rounded up to 4 years. Because blocks are created approximately every 10 minutes, these numbers will vary. But, using these figures, we can determine that the next Bitcoin halving date will fall in April 2024.</p>
<p>Most of the current estimates for the next Bitcoin halving date suggest that the next Bitcoin halving date is either the 24th or 25th of April 2024. However, there are others that place it around April 13th, 2024.</p>
<p>If we look more closely at the last 3 halving periods, we find the following:</p>
<figure class="table">
<table>

<td style="text-align: center">Period</td>
<td style="text-align: center">Time in Days</td>
<td style="text-align: center">Time</td>

<td style="text-align: center">2009–2012</td>
<td style="text-align: center">1,425 Days</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: center">1st Halving</td>
<td style="text-align: center">2012–2016</td>
<td style="text-align: center">1,319 Days</td>
<td style="text-align: center">3y 7m 12d</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center">2nd Halving</td>
<td style="text-align: center">2016–2020</td>
<td style="text-align: center">1,402 Days</td>
<td style="text-align: center">3y 10m 2d</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>We have to remember that this is a small sample, but if we average these out, we get a period of 1,382 days, which is 3 years, 9 months, and 11 days. When we add to the last halving date, May 11th, 2020, we get February 22nd, 2024. Very different from the above estimates.</p>
<p>As we get closer to block height 840,000, it’ll be much easier to zone in on an exact date and time for the Bitcoin Halving 2024. Until then, approximations are the best we have.</p>
<h2>A Look at Previous Halvings</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Bitcoin network launched in 2009. Since then, there have been three halving events, and 2024’s will be the fourth. If we’re to try and predict what will happen after the next one, we should look at history and the Bitcoin Halving dates that have been and gone.</p>

<p>On January 3rd 2009, someone with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto set the Bitcoin blockchain in motion with the creation of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/03/the-genesis-block-the-first-bitcoin-block/">Bitcoin’s genesis block</a>.</p>
<p>Between this and the first halving event, the miner of each Bitcoin block received a 50 Bitcoin reward.</p>

<p>Here, Bitcoin’s block reward is halved from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. This first halving event occurred at the point where exactly half of the total Bitcoin supply had been minted. At this time, there was not a lot of hype around Bitcoin, and the highest price it had hit was $31.91. However, in the year after Bitcoin’s first Halving, Bitcoin fitted itself with some rocket boosters and went <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25332746">flying through the price charts and the mainstream media</a>, with <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2013/11/29/investing/bitcoin-gold/index.html">CNN exclaiming that it is almost worth as much as gold</a>.</p>

<p>In April 2013, Bitcoin hit a high of $188.70, but the best was yet to come. On November 29th, 2013, one year and a day after the Halving event, Bitcoin hit a high of $1242.00. A 10,080% increase since the Halving.</p>
<p>After this November 29th high, the price of Bitcoin trickled towards over the next few years, to a low of $162.00 on August 18th, 2015—an 87% decrease from its high, but still a 1,228% increase on its value at the time of the Halving.</p>

<p>At Bitcoin’s second Halving event, block rewards were cut from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. In the months before the Halving event, maybe in speculation of the event, Bitcoin pumped 81% from $435 to a high $790. However, the best was yet to come, as seen on the below Bitcoin Halving chart.</p>

<p>One year after the Halving, Bitcoin was up 283%, to $2551.44. But it didn’t stop there. On December 17th, 2017, Bitcoin hit a new high of $19,785.22—a 2970.75% increase on its price at the time of the Halving.</p>
<p>After this high, the price of Bitcoin declined more dramatically, bottoming out at just under $6000 at the start of February 2018. From here, it trickled to lows of $3,125.90 in December 2019—an 85% decrease from its high, but still 369% up from its price at the time of the Halving.</p>

<p>Exactly 2 months after the <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Pandemic</a>, the Bitcoin code, unperturbed by the real-world situation, executed the last Bitcoin halving, its third in total. This time, block rewards were reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. It was already up 10% since the WHO’s announcement.</p>

<p>In December that year, Bitcoin broke through $20,000 and continued its journey upwards. One year after the Halving, May 11th, 2021, Bitcoin was trading at $55,873.74, and had recently hit a high of $64,898.56. These are, respectively, 540% and 643% above Bitcoin’s price at the time of the Halving.</p>
<p>Despite declining to almost half this value in June 2021, $28,804.40, Bitcoin again rose to hit highs of $68,997.75. After that, it fell into a steady decline, hitting lows of $15,479.42 on November 21st, 2022—a 78% decline from its high, but still 77% up from the price at the time of the Halving.</p>

<p>As noted, in this halving Bitcoin’s block rewards will be cut in half, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. What will happen post halving? From what we’ve seen above, we can infer that nothing will happen in the immediate aftermath of the halving event.</p>
<p>However, from the above, we can also see that it is very possible Bitcoin will hit new ATHs within 1 year to 18 months of the Halving event. We can also infer from the above that, while it might hit achieve new ATHs 12–18 months after the Halving event, it is likely to have decreased by 70%+ from these highs while still remaining 70% up from its price at the time of the Halving.</p>
<p>It is good to be able to draw conclusions from past events, but, so far, there have only been three halving events, which isn’t a large sample size to draw a strong conclusion from. On top of that, there are other factors that might make things different this time around.</p>
<h2>Should You Buy Bitcoin Before the Next Halving?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For a long time, especially since we’ve been in a prolonged Crypto Winter, price speculators and even <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/four-price-cycles-morgan-stanley-says-crypto-winter-may-over.htm">investment banks have pointed to the 2024 Halving as a time when Bitcoin and the crypto markets will rebound</a>. As we just saw, Bitcoin’s price seems to wait until a few months after the Halving has occurred before making any large swings in any direction, and once the dust settles, the Bitcoin price is typically up 70%+ from its price at the time of the Halving.</p>
<p>Judging by this historical data, Bitcoin should be a buy before the Halving, so long as you’re happy to hold onto it for 12–18 months and ride the waves of the market. However, since the last Halving a lot has happened:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin usd&amp;date=2009-01-01 2023-10-27">Bitcoin is growing in popularity and is probably more popular, and well known now than it ever has been</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-57398274">El Salvador has made Bitcoin legal tender</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/03/hashkey-wins-hong-kongs-first-crypto-exchange-license-to-serve-retail-customers/">Hong Kong has opened Bitcoin and crypto trading to retail investors</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Regulatory structures are being implemented around the world, fostering Bitcoin adoption</a>.</li>
<li>The SEC in the USA seems to be <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-keeps-quiet-on-bitcoin-etf-plans-after-grayscale-ruling-heres-the-latest.htm">being steered toward approving a Bitcoin ETF</a>, which would make Bitcoin available to institutional investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these advances in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies make this Halving event, and the months after it, a new one. There is more attention than ever on this Halving event, which, given that everyone is reading the historical data, means more expectation.</p>
<p>While this is all new for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Halving, this attention and expectation has the potential to make all talk of new all-time highs a self-fulfilling prophecy, meaning, again, that Bitcoin should be a buy before this halving event should you be happy to <a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/hodl">Hodl</a>.</p>

<h2>Future Bitcoin Halving Dates</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The next Bitcoin halving will take place in 2024, with most estimates placing it mid- to late April. A Bitcoin halving occurs once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every 4 years. From that, we can expect future Bitcoin halving to occur in the following years:</p>

<p>Bitcoin Halving events will keep happening every 210,000 blocks until all 21m Bitcoins have been minted. At the time of the Bitcoin Halving 2024, 96.87% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist will be in circulation. It took just over 15 years to mint this much of the supply, but it will take 116 years to mint the last 3.13% of the Bitcoin supply.</p>
<p>You can find a deeper dive into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12tR_9WrY0Hj4AQLoJYj9EDBzfA38XIVLQSOOOVePNm0/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true">the exact reward schedule for all future Bitcoin halving events here</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Bitcoin Halving is an integral part of how the Bitcoin protocol is designed to function and, arguably, as many believe, an integral part of how it is going to help reset the global financial system. These halving events are set to continue roughly every four years until they finally stop in 2140.</p>
<p>Looking at past data, from just three halving events, the time to buy Bitcoin is in the months leading up to, or just after, the Bitcoin Halving 2024. We recommend eToro as the best and easiest place to buy Bitcoin, and you can sign up and buy BTC in as little as 5 minutes, just in time to HODL it for the aftermath of the 2024 Bitcoin halving event.</p>
