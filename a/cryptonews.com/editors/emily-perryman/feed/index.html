The company had an office in Japan and tried to get a license to operate there, but decided to move to the European island to avoid a clash with local regulators. </p><p>Meanwhile, South Korea has put the brakes on its anti-crypto drive after regulations banning ICOs and trading for youths and foreign passport holders <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/opinion-why-south-korea-could-legalize-icos-1425.htm">sparked a backlash</a> against the government. </p><p><b>Emergence of ICO hubs</b></p><p>For smaller countries, there is a lot to gain from positioning themselves as the ICO hub of choice. </p><p>Alexander Larsen, president, Europe &amp; Middle East at Baldwin Risk Services, an enterprise risk management firm, told Cryptonews.com that several small countries are actively looking at how to attract ICOs. They include Malta, Slovenia, Estonia and Switzerland.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;Smaller countries are trying to attract crypto investment. They want to be an innovation hub that attracts digital companies and, with that, highly skilled migration that helps to improve GDP (gross domestic product) and unemployment,&rdquo; he said.</p></blockquote><p>Switzerland, for example, published guidelines earlier this year that aim to assist ICOs in navigating its &ldquo;principles-based&rdquo; regulatory framework. The country was home to the record-breaking USD 232 million Tezos ICO last year.</p><p>Other countries are encouraging investors by deciding not to tax income from cryptocurrencies. They include Germany, Denmark, Singapore, Belarus and Slovenia.</p><p>&ldquo;I think countries who have a tech hub that doesn&rsquo;t embrace ICOs will be questioning whether their tech will start lagging behind other, ICO-driven countries,&rdquo; Larsen said. &ldquo;In particular, I think all those countries who thrive on banking and their offshore status will be trying to attract ICOs because there&rsquo;s no doubt ICOs will provide a real financial gain for the country.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Avoiding the Wild West</b></p><p>Just because a country has extensive regulation, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it won&rsquo;t attract ICOs. Larsen pointed out that a country with no regulation could easily legislate the following year, thus hampering the ICO&rsquo;s plans.</p><p>&ldquo;As long as it&rsquo;s positive regulation that is robust and ICO friendly, with the right investor protections in place, that&rsquo;s a positive thing,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>Nenad Gregec, compliance officer at Etherum-based investment platform ICONOMI, which is registered in Malta, said his company leans towards countries where regulation exists but is not too strict.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;The industry is still in its infancy, so if regulation is too strict it could inhibit growth and innovation. However, somewhere with no regulation could put us in the territory of the Wild West,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We always strive towards regulation because it creates a level playing field and ensures safety for investors.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Gregec suggested that countries in Europe who lost out to Silicon Valley in the tech boom want to be early adopters of crypto so they don&rsquo;t miss out again. </p><p>He added: &ldquo;I expect more countries will follow Malta and Switzerland in setting up a legal framework. There might be competition, but eventually we will see harmonization. The European Union has a very good track record of harmonizing regulation in the financial sector.&rdquo;<br>
Waiting for the G20</p><p>It is likely regulation will continue to be fragmented until the G20 nations make a definitive decision on crypto and how to move forward. <br>
David Coker, lecturer in accounting, finance and governance at Westminster Business School, told Cryptonews.com, that the G20 has been &ldquo;bumbling around&rdquo; and still lacks a cogent view on the future of crypto.</p><p>He added: &ldquo;If ICO regulation is light-touch that would give crypto investing a degree of legitimacy. But if it goes down the US route, which treats crypto platforms like a security requiring authorization, ICOs wouldn&rsquo;t be happy because they are very fast-moving and don&rsquo;t want the additional costs.&rdquo;</p><p>For now, the future regulatory environment is uncertain, but one thing is for sure &ndash; smaller countries with a lot to gain will be keeping a close eye on the developments to ensure they stay ahead of the competition.</p>

One of those &#8211; Blockchain Banking Engineer, or a person who expands the infrastructure of blockchain technology, giving people access to secure banking. 
</figcaption></figure><p>Working in Bitcoin is officially the job du jour. Job boards have reported a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-careers-on-the-rise-in-the-uk-1142.htm">huge spike</a> in the number of people looking for careers in the crypto industry, and it has even been suggested that we could one day see the role of a &ldquo;chief Blockchain officer&rdquo; being advertised.</p><p>Given the enormous hype surrounding Bitcoin, it&rsquo;s no surprise that more people want to get a piece of the action. </p><p><i>Cryptonews.com</i> spoke to several recruiters to find out how wannabe crypto stars can get a foot in the door. </p><p><b>Starting the search</b></p><p>An obvious place to look for a job in crypto is a general jobs board like Indeed or totaljobs. If you want to narrow your search, you can also look at specialist crypto job boards and recruitment firms such as CryptoTalent, Cryptorecruit and Andromeda.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to connect with companies directly &ndash; for example via platforms such as Twitter, Reddit and Telegram.</p><p>According to Yavuz Karadag, co-founder of CryptoTalent, a lot of Blockchain start-ups have an &ldquo;open application&rdquo; policy, meaning they welcome proactive applications. </p><p>&ldquo;Candidates can directly approach founders and CEOs at meetup events or via LinkedIn without feeling intimidated,&rdquo; Karadag said. &ldquo;The online applications also tend to be much less gruesome. Additionally, a very high portion of jobs are remote, meaning that the entire screening and interview processes are carried out virtually.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Defining your skill set</b></p><p>It&rsquo;s vital to ensure your skills meet the requirements of the company you&rsquo;re applying to. The most sought-after employees in the crypto world are Blockchain engineers. </p><p>&ldquo;Both front-end and back-end developers that want to break into the crypto world must educate themselves on cryptography, distributed ledger technologies such as Solidity, and be able to work with languages including C++ and Python,&rdquo; said Karadag. &ldquo;Due to its extremely complex nature, companies have very high expectations for this type of role.&rdquo;</p><p>There are also opportunities in other areas. Neil Dundon, founder of Cryptorecruit, said good chief technology officers (CTOs) are in demand because a lot of projects are early stage and need CTOs to lead the tech side of their business. </p><p>Other non-technical positions include community/social media managers, PRs and marketing executives.</p><p>For all roles, language skills are a big plus.</p><p>&ldquo;As these communities are global, candidates must be skilled in multiple languages for the purpose of localization. This also implies creating high quality visual and written content, so these skills are essential,&rdquo; added Karadag.</p><p>As start-ups advance and go to market, demand for candidates with skills in business development, finance, strategy and HR is also likely to increase. </p><p><b>Standing out from other candidates</b></p><p>Regardless of which role you want to pursue, having an innovative flair is essential.</p><p>Tal Benno, Blockchain recruiter at Andromeda, said because the crypto world is fast-moving, candidates have to be able to demonstrate that they are innovative or, at the very least, open to innovation.</p><p>&ldquo;If you want a marketing role in a crypto company you need solid marketing experience and a good understanding of the Blockchain field. You need to be a self-learner and someone who is excited about working in the industry,&rdquo; she added.</p><p>Areas you&rsquo;ll be expected to know about include Blockchain technology, crypto-economic protocols, and the initial coin offering creation and token sale processes.</p><p>&ldquo;Employers want to see that you have taken the time to research and develop a very extensive knowledge about the crypto and blockchain space,&rdquo; explained Karadag.</p><p>It is also important for candidates to be engaged with the Blockchain community. </p><p>&ldquo;This means networking in the ecosystem, attending meetups, and actively creating and sharing interesting content through social media or personal blogs,&rdquo; Karadag said. &ldquo;For developers, community engagement also means that you actively contribute to open-source projects on Github.&rdquo;</p><p>When it comes to the interview, it&rsquo;s essential that you&rsquo;ve done your research.</p><p>Dundon said candidates should think about how they will fit into the project and be able to explain the value they can add.<br>
&ldquo;If you really want to work in Blockchain try to minimize the interviewer&rsquo;s downtime by doing your research on the project. These projects are so busy that they want you to be prepared,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>Above all, love and passion for all things crypto will put you in good stead for a career in the industry.</p>

A particular focus is infrastructure, for example around security and scalability.</p><p>Arianna spoke to <i>Cryptonews.com</i> about what really makes her tick.</p><p><b>When and why did you first become interested in bitcoin?</b></p><p>I first became interested in bitcoin in 2013, following a trip through southern Africa. I spent time in a few countries including Zimbabwe, which was just starting to recover from the extreme hyperinflation which had plagued it in the years prior. </p><p>When I came back to the US, I was thinking a lot about how things might have unfolded differently for the citizens of Zimbabwe if they&rsquo;d had access to an alternative financial system outside of their government&rsquo;s control. </p><p>When I stumbled upon the bitcoin whitepaper a few weeks later, everything clicked. I started spending a lot of time researching the technology, writing and speaking about it, and eventually joined BitGo, the first company to commercialize multi-signature wallets, in mid-2014.</p><p><b>What opportunities can blockchain bring and for whom? </b></p><p>I believe that we have the opportunity to reshape a lot of the current financial system, and potentially redistribute wealth and power in a major way. </p><p>That&#8217;s why I strongly encourage groups who have been underserved by the current system to learn about the technology and get involved as soon as possible &ndash; there&rsquo;s a lot to be gained from it. </p><p><b>What challenges need to be overcome for blockchain to be accepted more widely?</b></p><p>Right now we still have major challenges around things like security (how do you safely manage your private keys?) and scalability (how many transactions can the network process?). Until those are resolved, mainstream adoption will be a challenge. </p><p>Beyond that, we also need more user-friendly products and services. Design and user experience haven&rsquo;t been a focus for most teams, but in order to see consumer adoption <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/someone-please-make-crypto-exchanges-simple-1147.htm">we&rsquo;ll need to focus more specifically on those areas</a>. </p><p><b>What&rsquo;s your view on the cryptocurrency hype?</b></p><p>There&rsquo;s certainly a lot of hype right now, and at the end of 2017 the price was getting too far ahead of the fundamentals. </p><p>We&rsquo;ve since seen a healthy correction in the market, which I think is important and desirable. It is during the periods of relative quiet on the appreciation front that the work is actually done &ndash; without that, the industry won&#8217;t have a solid foundation. </p><p>I think we&#8217;re still in early innings, and it&#8217;s hard to forecast what the space is going to look like in 10 years, though I have no doubt blockchain is going to massively change a lot of the world as we know it. </p><p><b>What&rsquo;s your investment philosophy? </b></p><p>I tend to focus on two things: markets and people. I think little else matters. </p><p>I look for founders who are exceptionally hungry and who have deep domain expertise. On the market side of things, large and fragmented markets that are growing quickly are ideal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Income from cryptocurrencies is not considered an acceptable form of income. 
It might be possible to use your crypto income to pay for a house deposit.</p><p>News that a huge company in Japan is giving its employees the chance to get paid in cryptocurrency got us thinking &ndash; what happens when you try to apply for a mortgage or other type of loan?</p><p>Based on the responses <i>Cryptonews.com</i> received from several banks, it&rsquo;s not looking good. </p><p>Banks are extremely risk-averse and are only willing to lend money against currencies that are regulated in their own country.</p><p><b>Bitcoin is not an acceptable income</b></p><p>Westpac, one of Australia&rsquo;s &ldquo;big four&rdquo; banks, said income from cryptocurrencies &ldquo;is not currently considered an acceptable form of income for lending purposes&rdquo;.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a complete loss, though, as Westpac added that cryptocurrency income can be included as an &ldquo;asset&rdquo; as part of its home loan assessment process.</p><p>It would effectively be like owning a portfolio of shares. You can&rsquo;t get a loan based purely on how many shares you own, but the bank will take them into account when looking at your overall state of finances.  </p><p>Barclays, the UK bank, said it will only lend against income that is in British Sterling, although it might expand this to other currencies in the future. Either way, the loan would always be in Sterling.</p><p><b>Could crypto be used for a house deposit?</b></p><p>It might be possible to use your crypto income to pay for a house deposit, although it depends which bank you use.</p><p>HSBC in the UK said the permitted use of cryptocurrencies for a deposit will depend on the agreement with the seller and/or builder of the property being bought. </p><p>It added: &ldquo;Should a customer&rsquo;s mortgage deposit funds be accumulated from cryptocurrencies, the relevant source of deposit evidence would be required in line with other deposit sources. HSBC does not process virtual currency payments and we do not bank virtual currency exchanges.&rdquo;</p><p>It is already extremely difficult to satisfy banks that deposit funds have been built up in a legitimate way. It would probably be nigh on impossible to do the same with cryptocurrency, particularly given widespread concerns around money laundering.</p><p>Atom Bank, a UK challenger bank, explained: &ldquo;Cryptocurrency platforms are not currently regulated in the UK, and therefore verification of investor&rsquo;s identity may not have been completed to the standard followed by regulated financial sector firms. </p><p>&ldquo;We and our partners in the conveyancing industry are not able to assure ourselves of the source of funds on these platforms, which is a requirement under the Money Laundering Regulations 2017, and therefore we do not proceed with any mortgage sale involving cryptocurrencies.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/morning-news-telegram-ico-price-hike-cryptojackers-run-riot-1303.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Korean banks are also declining</a> to issue loans to the country&rsquo;s many cryptocurrency investors &ndash; as they refuse to accept cryptocurrency as collateral. </p><p><b>Small loans are also a challenge</b></p><p>Even getting a small loan to buy a car could prove to be a challenge. A peer-to-peer lender told us that while there is nothing in their terms and conditions that explicitly prohibits lending to borrowers who get paid in Bitcoin, &ldquo;it is not an income so the answer would probably be &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Receiving a salary in crypto is still extremely rare, but it&rsquo;s not unheard of for employees working in the blockchain space. It&rsquo;s also possible we&rsquo;ll see more companies following the example of GMO, the large company in Japan which started paying employees in crypto at the end of last year.</p><p>There will need to be a huge sea-change for banks to be willing to provide mortgages and loans based on a bitcoin salary.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are many examples of when successful crypto investors do not need a loan to buy a house or a luxury car. The profit they make from investing is sufficient enough not to bother traditional banks with a loan request.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past year has seen the launch of several platforms that claim to offer borrowers better rates by combining peer-to-peer (P2P) lending with cryptocurrencies. We spoke to the experts to find out the pros and cons of the new lending model.</p><p><b>What is P2P lending? </b></p><p>P2P lending enables individuals to borrow and lend money without using a financial institution as the middleman. Lenders can get higher rates of interest than they would with a savings account, with some P2P platforms offering projected returns of more than 10%. Equally, borrowers can get loans more easily and at more favourable rates than with a bank. On average, a borrower with a strong credit score could get a rate of 5.7% from a P2P lender compared with 9.5% from a bank. Borrowers and lenders are matched up via online platforms, such as Zopa, RateSetter and LendingClub.</p><p><b>How are blockchain providers getting involved?</b></p><p>Over the past year several P2P lending platforms have emerged that are built on blockchain technology. They include ETHLend, Celsius Network, Lendoit and Inspeer.</p><p>These platforms claim that introducing blockchain into P2P lending makes it more transparent, secure and traceable. In addition, people can join the platform from anywhere in the world, rather than being confined to platforms operating into their own country.</p><p>ETHLend is the most well-known crypto P2P platform. Borrowers set the terms of the loan contract, including the amount, premium and payment date, and lenders can fund the loan if they deem it suitable. Borrowers send ERC20 standard tokens or Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains as collateral, which is held within the smart contract. </p><p><b>Why is crypto P2P lending being criticised?</b></p><p>Critics argue that crypto-based P2P lending is extremely risky. Alex Kampa, founder of Sikoba, a blockchain-based IoU (an informal document acknowledging debt) platform, believes anyone who borrows via a crypto P2P lending platform is &ldquo;completely mad&rdquo;. He said cryptocurrencies are so volatile that someone who borrows GBP 10,000 could end up owing GBP 50,000. </p><p>&ldquo;By focusing on blockchain, these platforms are hiding the fact that the risk is still there. No amount of blockchain will resolve the risk of defaults. They are giving people a false sense of confidence,&rdquo; Kampa argued.</p><p>P2P lending marketplace Savy explored the option of transferring its loan contracts to Ethereum in 2016, but decided the technology was unsuitable. </p><p>Vytautas Zabulis, chief executive and co-founder of Savy, said in an ideal world blockchain would help to verify the client by supplying credit scoring information from blockchain-based registries, with smart contracts taking care of loan repayments.</p><p>In the real world, Zabulis said, regulated lending platforms must ensure the individual borrower&rsquo;s identity is verified, a credit check is done, money is transferred and, in the case of a default, there is clear process of litigation and/or debt collection. </p><p>&ldquo;Smart contracts are not very smart when the borrower does not pay. It is much more expensive to run a lending business on the blockchain than on regular data bases,&rdquo; he added.</p><p><b>Do the criticisms stack up?</b></p><p>The crypto P2P lending platforms argue that these criticisms are unfounded. Keith Baumwald, chief marketing officer at Celsius, said the volatility of cryptocurrency is not an issue because loans to coin holders on its platform will always be in US dollars. Cryptocurrency is merely being used as collateral. </p><p>&ldquo;Right now, if you&#8217;re a crypto holder and you need to make a large purchase like a car, your best option is to sell some of your coins. We want to provide an alternative. We will provide our community with the ability to use their cryptocurrency as collateral in order to secure a low interest loan in dollars, regardless of their credit score,&rdquo; Baumwald explained.</p><p>He claimed Celsius&rsquo; goal is to lend with interest rates at single digits, no matter what the person&rsquo;s credit score, adding: &ldquo;Most of our members have not been able to access sub 10% borrowing rates in their lifetimes.&rdquo; </p><p>Celsius pools lenders&rsquo; crypto in order to lend more dollars to other crypto holders and enable hedge funds to pay lenders for enabling them to short the crypto market. This aims to ensure members get higher borrowing limits.</p><p>&ldquo;In the Blockchain model all the value is created on the token side so members can enjoy the best borrow rates as the organisation does not have to focus on maximising profits. In addition, the profits made on the interest from the loans stays within the cryptocurrency community instead of being transferred back to Wall Street,&rdquo; Baumwald said.</p><p>He added that Celsius plans to follow all the relevant laws in the US and issue loans via licensed financial institutions. </p><p><b>How are lenders and borrowers protected?</b></p><p>Stani Kulecho, chief executive of ETHLend, said it has substantial measures in place to protect lenders and borrowers. It requires borrowers to submit 150% collateral and it will shortly introduce oracles &ndash; tools that show the market performance of the given coin. It has also introduced US dollar pegged loans that aim to stabilise the volatility of US dollars to ETH. </p><p>&ldquo;Practically it means that if a borrower has a loan for USD 100 worth of ether and 5% interest, s/he will repay USD 105 worth of ether back. We are constantly educating our users on all the aspects of the crypto volatility and encourage them to take informed and well-balanced decisions,&rdquo; said Kulecho.</p><p>He argued that at present borrowers and lenders are limited by their geographical location, which affects fair competition. </p><p>&ldquo;The ETHLend platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain has allowed us to connect interested parties from around the world into one, unified global lending market which is democratic and market driven in nature. More to the point, all transactions can be verified and audited and a full credit history can be shown,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Kulecho added that ETHLend is fully compliant with existing laws and working closely with European and national legislators.</p><p><b>Who are the platforms targeting?</b></p><p>So far the platforms are predominantly used by professional traders and technically-savvy people. However, Kulecho said ETHLend sees many use cases in the broader lending market, including household loans and business loans. </p><p>&ldquo;Due to the nature of the platform it is operational 24/7 and it provides endless possibilities to responsible lenders and borrowers,&rdquo; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teaching children about money is one of the most important lessons a parent can give. But what most parents haven&rsquo;t prepared for is their eight year-old asking: &ldquo;Mommy, what&rsquo;s bitcoin?&rdquo; </p><p>This question is likely to send most parents into an internet search frenzy, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s one area Google can&rsquo;t help you with. </p><p>Most explanations of cryptocurrency are far too complicated for children (and parents!) to grasp. In a lot of cases, you need to be a total tech geek to understand what on earth bitcoin is.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a great YouTube video where a child explains: &ldquo;Bitcoin is to cash what email is to paper mail.&rdquo; </p><p>Also, Square, a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company, made an illustrated children&rsquo;s story to explain bitcoin. </p><figure style="max-width: 532px"><a href="https://cash.me/bitcoin" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a7/e8ca1384b9.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 532px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a7/e8ca1384b9.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a7/e8ca1384b9.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a7/e8ca1384b9.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a7/e8ca1384b9.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5a7/e8ca1384b9.jpg 532w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption>Source: A screenshot of the Square&#8217;s illustrated story.</figcaption></figure><p>We also spoke to some of the industry experts to ask how they&rsquo;d approach the question. </p><p><b>&ldquo;Mommy, What is bitcoin?&rdquo;</b></p><p>Garrick Hileman, co-founder of asset-backed digital currency ARC, suggested describing cryptocurrency as &ldquo;invisible money&rdquo;. </p><p>He pointed out that the vast majority of money today is invisible to children because it&rsquo;s in our bank accounts and we predominantly buy things online. Cryptocurrency is essentially the same &ndash; it&rsquo;s digital cash. </p><p>You have your own digital wallet on your smartphone, and with the help of a wallet you can send cryptocurrency to another person.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Daddy, how is it different to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; money?&rdquo;</b></p><p>The key difference is that cryptocurrency is not legally recognised or controlled by the government. You can&rsquo;t pay taxes with it and you can&rsquo;t settle any debts in court with it. At least now.</p><p>Clem Chambers, chief executive of ADVFN, a financial market website, and author of Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide &#8211; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, said: &ldquo;Cryptocurrency is just a different kind of money that&rsquo;s not made by the government. You can transfer it backwards and forwards, and you can buy stuff immediately. It&rsquo;s no more different than when you buy and sell virtual objects in video games.&rdquo;</p><p>David Prais, chairman of blockchain platform Cofound.it, added that parents might want to explain that crypto is a global currency: &ldquo;When we go to America we have to change our pounds to dollars. But in time we won&rsquo;t need to do that. We&rsquo;ll be using the same currency all around the world.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Also, there are many other questions to be answered: <br>
&ldquo;Mommy, can I create my own cryptocurrency?&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;Daddy, is it safe to use Bitcoin?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Grandma, what is Bitcoin mining?&rdquo; </p><p>The list might go on and on.</p><p>Please check our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guides page</a> if you need an inspiration before talking to kids or want to understand the crypto world better. We are all learning here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Citizens could benefit from vastly improved levels of government transparency if central banks decide to introduce their own cryptocurrency, but there are fears ensuing regulation could curb innovation in the independent crypto space.</p><p>Central banks already issue digital currency to commercial banks, and many have been exploring the possibility of extending this to the general population.</p><p>Experts have suggested central banks, like the Federal Reserve in the US, could launch a cryptocurrency that is similar to bitcoin but with coins only being created by the bank.</p><p>Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain, the bitcoin wallet, suggested last August that we are only two years away from a major government issuing a central digital currency. </p><p>We spoke to several blockchain industry players to find out what impact this could have on the general public, the government and the wider crypto market. The Bank of Lithuania also shared its views on &ldquo;central coins&rdquo;. </p><p><b>The dark side</b></p><p>Marius Jurgilas, member of the board of the Bank of Lithuania, said recent developments in technology make it feasible to provide and access central bank liabilities in electronic form. But he added this would be &ldquo;no small development&rdquo; and would immediately reduce demand for commercial bank money. </p><p>&ldquo;Such a change would have fundamental implications on credit growth, financial intermediation, transmission of monetary policy, and role of (central) banks in general,&rdquo; he warned.</p><p>In addition to these economic concerns, people working in the blockchain industry worry that a central bank cryptocurrency would run counter to the philosophy of blockchain, where everything is decentralised. </p><p>Rob May, chief executive of Talla, which is behind blockchain platform botchain, said the &ldquo;crypto-purists&rdquo; are unlikely to use a blockchain that is controlled by the government. He also warned that it could lead to harmful legislation.   </p><p>&ldquo;I think it will definitely bring more regulation on independent crypto coins &ndash; probably in a negative way if governments try to make their own crypto more attractive,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;A move like that could do a lot of damage to innovation in the cryptocurrency space.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The bright side</b></p><p>But there are positive things to mention, also. Some experts think the launch of a central coin would help to legitimise cryptocurrency, whether it is centralised or decentralised.</p><p>David Prais, chairman of Cofound.it, a platform for blockchain believers, said: &ldquo;It would represent a recognition by governments that digital currency is here to stay. It will probably lead to governments bringing in a lot of regulation, but that is something which I fully support because there are still a lot of scams out there.&rdquo;</p><p>Cryptocurrency could even improve government transparency and accountability by enabling citizens to see where money is being spent, according to Talla&rsquo;s Rob May.</p><p>&ldquo;If you think about a government blockchain as a supply chain of where the money comes and goes, one possible benefit is that citizens could be better informed about where the government spends money,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Also, it might make it easier to pay taxes and receive refunds.&rdquo;</p><p>Scott Robinson, founder of start-up innovation platform Plug and Play FinTech, suggested transparency would be particularly beneficial during election campaigns. Citizens could pledge money on an escrow basis so that it only gets sent to the candidate if they follow through on their election promises.</p><p>Similarly, if someone donated money to charity they could track their payment all the way through to the recipient, thereby improving the transparency of the donations process.</p><p><b>Gaining momentum</b></p><p>The idea of a central bank cryptocurrency is certainly gaining momentum. Central banks in China, Japan, Sweden and Estonia have all revealed they are undertaking projects that involve transacting digital currencies with banks. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has reportedly stated it is beginning to explore whether it could adopt its own digital currency.</p><p>The Bank of England said allowing people to store value and make payments in digital currency could have &ldquo;wide-ranging implications&rdquo; for financial stability and is undertaking a multi-year research programme into the subject. </p><p>Smaller countries are also getting in on the action. Last autumn, Venezuela&rsquo;s President Nicolas Maduro announced he intended to launch a digital currency, called the petro, to combat the financial &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; by the US. The Central Bank of Uruguay has launched a pilot to transfer 20 million pesos (EUR 570,000) onto the blockchain network.</p><p>There is still a great deal of speculation about whether these pilots will result in a true centralised digital currency being launched.</p><p>Nicholas Gregory, chief executive of CommerceBlock, a public blockchain infrastructure company, argued that the reason bitcoin works so well is because it is decentralised. </p><p>&ldquo;You could also argue that central banks are already digitised &ndash; when was the last time you paid for something with cash? We will probably just end up with something that looks like bitcoin, but isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added.</p>

That&rsquo;s according to Cofound.it chairperson David Prais, who wants to shake up the way start-ups are funded. </p><p><i>Cryptonews.com</i> spoke to the blockchain expert to find out more about himself and the company&rsquo;s blockchain project.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a6/ae288e04fe.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a6/ae288e04fe.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a6/ae288e04fe.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a6/ae288e04fe.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a6/ae288e04fe.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5a6/ae288e04fe.jpg 826w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><b>When did you become interested in blockchain?</b></p><p>You could say it was when I took a computer science degree in the 1980s. That was all about computers replacing inefficient systems. Blockchain is not new but is simply an evolution &ndash; just as the internet was.</p><p><b>How has your life changed since entering the blockchain industry?</b></p><p>My whole world has gone mad &ndash; and I love it. This world is moving at hyper-speed and the goals and direction are all good. But we have a lot of young, bright, enthused, idealistic people working in the space, and we need to ensure the industry matures so fewer mistakes occur and trust grows. </p><p><b>What types of mistakes are happening?</b></p><p>There isn&rsquo;t enough due diligence on ICOs. Coins are being released that shouldn&rsquo;t be and there is a lot of hype around them rather than real facts. We&rsquo;re seeing deception occurring and that could give the industry a bad name.</p><p>Our goal at Cofound.it is to put in place proper processes so that people who invest can rest assured that a number of very bright individuals feel the investment is a good idea.</p><p>The space will mature, I&rsquo;m sure, but &ldquo;think&rdquo; and &ldquo;safety first&rdquo; have to be the watchwords.</p><p><b>What lessons have you learned?</b></p><p>Many: some great things about millennials; really good intentioned people on the whole. Whatever the UK, the US and even Europe does in terms of trying to create isolationist environments, we live in a global community and a global economy, and it is wonderful. </p><p>Governments will always try to control the people &ldquo;for their own good&rdquo;, but good people will overcome.</p><p><b>Are you investing in cryptocurrency? </b></p><p>I have a diversified portfolio that also includes cryptocurrency. I&rsquo;m making money out of it, but it&rsquo;s just a new way of living than trying to get rich quickly.</p><p>I&rsquo;m getting a preview of the future, but as time progresses we will all be part of this global community, and those that are not will be the poorer for not participating. Not poorer in money, but poorer in life.</p><p><b>What led to the launch of Cofound.it?</b></p><p>I guess a couple of things: one was that the time was right, but, fundamentally, the financing of start-ups has gone wrong. I see this from my role as a director within the Funding London organisation. </p><p>Some people have tried to rebalance the powers of funders and start-ups, but we really need a proper shake-up to try to get the balance right moving forward. </p><p>Cofound.it is an attempt to correct the imbalance so it works for all parties.</p><p><b>How does blockchain help?</b></p><p>Let&rsquo;s say I want to borrow money from a bank. I go to the bank and they have a whole load of rules, I have to fill in forms and my fate depends on one human making a decision. Bureaucracy and a single decision-maker gets in the way of the process working effectively. </p><p>With blockchain, businesses and individuals can feel certain that the right decisions and actions are being taken without bureaucracy getting in the way. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s give the example of Cofound.it. Our goal is to help start-ups raise enough funding to give them an 18-month runway to develop their business. This compares with the typical six-month runway that venture capital funding enables. </p><p>By seeking greater investment, and by crowdsourcing the assessment of companies, we get the best experts evaluating the best start-ups. And that attracts the best money. You end up in this lovely virtuous circle which increases the start-up&rsquo;s chances of success.</p><p>By putting that through an ICO process, we&rsquo;re democratising the investment so that everyday people can participate as well. It&rsquo;s not just the world&rsquo;s 1% who are involved.</p><p><b>Where else does blockchain offer opportunities?</b></p><p>In the long term the opportunities are massive. For individuals, blockchain means they can trust transactions and feel certain the right things are being done. They don&rsquo;t have to rely on one human bureaucrat making decisions over their life. </p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen the negative impact that bureaucracy has when friends of mine have gone through the immigration process. They&rsquo;re required to fill in numerous complex forms. If they make an error and get rejected, they have to spend thousands of pounds on an appeal. On top of this, some officials may have cultural bias towards certain applicants &ndash; they&rsquo;re not always acting in a neutral way.</p><p>When you put this on the blockchain it makes it significantly more efficient, removes any cultural bias and allows for far more honest and predictable responses.</p><p><b>What are the obstacles to the wider use of blockchain? </b></p><p>When you&rsquo;re replacing a bureaucracy, the first thing you can expect is for it to fight back. That is what we&rsquo;re seeing playing out at the moment. </p><p>At the end of the day, bureaucrats don&rsquo;t want to lose their jobs. There are systems in place that work for the people currently in charge, and they don&rsquo;t necessarily want changes to happen.</p><p>You can call their systems corrupt. Certainly, a sense of that corruption became visible in 2008 with the banking crash. I believe that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why the financial sector is the initial focus for blockchain, but I think we&rsquo;ll start seeing all sorts of other industries being affected as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The technology could be extended to the subscription markets
Evidence suggests blockchain can benefit the captive insurance market</p><p>People who claim on their insurance could be paid substantially faster if plans to launch a blockchain platform into the market get the go-ahead.</p><p>The Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative (B3i), a collaboration of insurers and reinsurers from across the globe, said it will seek to extend the use of blockchain beyond reinsurance to the wider insurance world after it launches its first smart contract in 2018.</p><p>The organisation is currently in the market testing phase of a smart contract for property catastrophe agreements, which provide protection for large-scale losses caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, fires and floods. </p><p>Ken Marke, a spokesperson for B3i, said it has been considering what will follow the development of the property catastrophe contract.</p><p>&ldquo;The logical next step will be to launch a couple more reinsurance contracts. But we want to appeal to primary insurers so we have put a lot of ideas on the table regarding this area. I can&rsquo;t say what is in it, but there will be a roadmap outlining what order we will do things in,&rdquo; Marke told Cryptonews.com.</p><p>The platform needs to attract as many users as possible so it can optimise its scalability and receive as wide a range of feedback as possible.</p><p><b>Opportunities</b></p><p>Antony Elliott, group head of business transformation at Zurich, a B3i member, suggested the technology could be extended to the subscription markets, where insurers join together to share risk; as well as binding authorities, in which the insurer delegates underwriting to another party. He said these areas have a lot in common with the reinsurance contract currently being tested. </p><p>It is also hoped blockchain could streamline and substantially speed up the payment of claims in the mass consumer insurance market, such as home and car insurance. This is because data can be shared and verified far more quickly via blockchain than a traditional manual process.</p><p>&ldquo;Currently the focus is exclusively on the reinsurance proof of concept. If successful, other use cases across the insurance industry will be considered and prioritised amongst the members,&rdquo; Elliott stated.</p><p>Sylvain de Crom, head of R&amp;D at Aegon and product manager for B3i, said blockchain is suitable for many types of insurance but is most efficient in situations where there is a relatively high level of standardisation.</p><p>De Crom added: &ldquo;Technically it would not be overly difficult to extend from reinsurance to insurance. The current focus of B3i is on reinsurance because there is a smaller number of participants and the contract sizes are much more substantial. This makes it easier to provide significant benefits to the industry as a whole &ndash; and therefore the policyholder &ndash; in the short to medium time-frame.&rdquo;</p><p>There is already evidence to suggest blockchain can benefit the captive insurance market &ndash; when a corporation sets up a subsidiary to operate as its own insurer. This is one of the most complex areas of commercial insurance. Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Speciality recently trialled a blockchain prototype for a captive insurance programme and found the technology accelerated and simplified transactions between each party.</p><p><b>Needs to raise capital</b></p><p>B3i is hoping to launch its property cat smart contract later in 2018, but Marke said it depends on how well the development goes. </p><p>The organisation also needs to raise capital and introduce a formal structure to manage the platform. </p><p>The 15 founding members of B3i are Achmea, Aegon, Ageas, Allianz, Generali, Hannover Re, Liberty Mutual Insurance, Munich Re, RGA, SCOR, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance, Swiss Re, Tokio Marine Holdings, XL Catlin and Zurich Insurance Group. </p><p>The group was joined by a further 23 insurers, brokers and reinsurers to engage with the market testing of the prototype in October 2017.</p>
