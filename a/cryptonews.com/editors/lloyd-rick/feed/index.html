However, it carries a deeper implication regarding the legal status of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">crypto assets</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The judge categorized the stolen stablecoins as property, extending the same classification to other digital currencies. The classification comes despite the fact that cryptos do not have a physical form.&nbsp;</p><p>To explain his stance, the judge compared crypto assets to naming a river, saying that the name of the river doesn&rsquo;t change, despite the fact that the water it contains is changing constantly.</p><h2>Court Cases are Contributing to Understanding Cryptocurrency&rsquo;s Legal Status</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Furthermore, Jeyaretnam said that cryptos are &ldquo;things in action&rdquo; under British common law.&nbsp;</p><p>This implies that cryptocurrencies are subject to personal rights, which can be enforced through legal action.&nbsp;</p><p>The decision also refers to the Monetary Authority of Singapore&rsquo;s consultation paper, which proposed segregation and custody requirements for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Pointing out the paper and its conclusions, the judge noted that assets that can be identified and segregated could be legally held in trust.&nbsp;</p><p>This ruling further strengthened the crypto industry&rsquo;s legal framework in Singapore.</p><p>A similar ruling was made in London in May last year, when a High Court of Justice <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-court-recognizes-nfts-as-private-property-what-now">found</a> that NFTs should be considered private property.&nbsp;</p><p>With the lack of clear rules by lawmakers, the crypto industry has been taking hints regarding the legal status of cryptocurrencies from cases like this, concluding that they can serve as proof that the courts will <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-secure-nfts-using-vpns-password-managers.htm">protect NFT property</a> rights.</p><h3>Related Articles:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-plans-safeguard-cryptocurrency-investments-with-new-trust-requirement.htm">Singapore Plans to Safeguard Cryptocurrency Investments with New Trust Requirement</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapores-monetary-authority-enforces-crypto-lending-staking-ban-for-retail-investors.htm">Singapore&#8217;s Monetary Authority Enforces Crypto Lending and Staking Ban for Retail Investors</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapores-investment-conglomerate-temasek-drops-crypto-investment-plans-citing-regulatory-uncertainties.htm">Singapore&#8217;s Investment Conglomerate Temasek Drops Crypto Investment Plans Citing Regulatory Uncertainties</a></li></ul>

The platform was compliant with the local regulations and designed to provide services to Japanese users.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the exchange also said that it would take some time before it can launch its full services in the country.</p><p>The company was able to enter the Japanese market thanks to its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-acquires-100-of-japanese-crypto-exchange-sakura-exchange-bitcoin-heres-why.htm">purchase of Sakura Exchange BitCoin</a> in November 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Acquisitions such as this one have been a common practice for companies to enter new markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Sakura Exchange BitCoin provided Binance with an entry point into the market, and the exchange took it.</p><p>The expansion into Japan represents the next step on Binance&rsquo;s road toward expanding its footprint in Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has made similar moves to enter markets such as Thailand and South Korea.</p><p>However, at the same time, the exchange has also been facing intense regulatory scrutiny in numerous countries, especially in the West.&nbsp;</p><p>The exchange saw a lawsuit in the US in early June, alongside <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-coinbase-sued-by-sec-just-day-after-binance-lawsuit-which-firm-next.htm">Coinbase</a>. The Netherlands and Belgium have also shut their doors to the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Even Germany, the largest economy in Europe, did not provide the exchange with a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-germanys-financial-watchdog-reportedly-decides-against-granting-binance-a-custody-license-binance-to-lose-support-of-its-euro-banking-partner-slovakia-reduces-crypto-taxes.htm">license to operate</a> as of yet.</p><p>Meanwhile, in France, the local prosecutors searched the exchange&rsquo;s office as part of an investigation of money laundering controls.</p><h2>Binance to attempt to launch a stablecoin in Japan</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>With the exchange struggling in the West, it stepped up the efforts to secure a foothold in the East.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://webx-asia.com/speaker/takeshi-chino/">Takeshi Chino</a>, the exchange&rsquo;s General Manager in Japan, revealed at the conference that Binance could also start a stablecoin in Japan.</p><p>Launching a stablecoin in Japan is no longer as simple as doing it in other parts of the world.

Torres sent, the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed a &ldquo;haphazard and heavy-handed approach to digital assets.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Congressman now wants qualified investigators to determine whether the SEC was doing its job adequately.</p><h2>The SEC&rsquo;s crypto crackdown caused many to start asking questions</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The US SEC&rsquo;s actions against the crypto industry have been rather harsh for years, but in the last several months, the regulator has been cracking down on the industry stronger than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>Dozens, if not hundreds, of companies that launched cryptocurrencies, were forced to pay fines for allegedly launching securities.</p><p>Some of the legal battles the SEC has been locked in have lasted for years, such as its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-lawsuit-summary-judgement-pepe-outperforms-doge-spct-nears-end-of-stage-1-presale.htm">Ripple lawsuit</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The SEC also filed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-coinbase-sued-by-sec-just-day-after-binance-lawsuit-which-firm-next.htm">lawsuits</a> against Binance, and even Coinbase, which has been regulatory compliant for years. However, SEC Chair Gary Gensler claims that Coinbase has been offering securities.</p><p>More than that, the regulator has been rejecting Bitcoin ETF applications for a decade now, despite ever-growing demand. It would always come up with a new excuse as to why the financial product proposals were not good enough.&nbsp;</p><p>It even rejected the proposals made by massive fund managers, such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-ceo-praises-bitcoin-for-digitizing-gold-says-btc-could-revolutionize-finance.htm">BlackRock</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-partner-with-fidelity-other-bitcoin-etfs-for-surveillance-heres-latest.htm">Fidelity</a>. An argument could be made that, if anyone knows how to put together a proper ETF proposal, it would be these firms.</p><p>However, the regulator rejected them like all others, and its actions have heavily disrupted the crypto industry in the United States.</p><h2>US SEC comes under the spotlight for its questionable decisions</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Rep, Torres sent two separate letters asking for two independent investigations &mdash; one to the SEC&rsquo;s Inspector General, Deborah Jeffrey, and another to the Government Accountability Office&rsquo;s Comptroller General, Gene Dodaro.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a> is acting like an overzealous traffic cop arbitrarily ticketing drivers while keeping the speed limit a secret. <br><br>It prefers to communicate by enforcement rather than by rules or guidance. But that&#39;s no way to regulate digital assets.<br><br>I&#39;m calling for an investigation. <a href="https://t.co/ZbiSk6oQ9F">https://t.co/ZbiSk6oQ9F</a> <a href="https://t.co/n0hijAREDC">pic.twitter.com/n0hijAREDC</a></p>&mdash; Rep.

Torres referred to a different decision made by the SEC in his letters.&nbsp;</p><p>The regulator recently issued a special-purpose broker-dealer license to a company called Prometheum. He called it a&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;trading digital assets platform that does not trade digital assets.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The government official found the circumstances under which the license was issued to be rather unusual. Furthermore, he argued that the regulator failed to create a rigorous but workable process for registering digital asset platforms.</p><p>The letters say:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The dubious decision to license a deceptive digital assets platform reflects the latest attempt by Chair Gary Gensler to politicize the registration process to an extent seldom seen in the SEC&#8217;s history. When it comes to trading platforms that operate in the real world, the SEC&#8217;s path to registration remains a bridge to nowhere.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>He also described the regulator as an overzealous traffic agent who arbitrarily tickets drivers for speeding while keeping everyone endlessly guessing about the speeding limit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Related Articles:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-congressman-proposes-bill-block-federal-reserve-from-creating-american-cbdc-whats-going-on.htm">US Congressman Proposes Bill to Block Federal Reserve from Creating American CBDC &ndash; What&#8217;s Going On?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-other-exchanges-relist-xrp-after-court-ruling-against-sec.htm">Coinbase And Other Exchanges Relist XRP After Court Ruling Against SEC</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-coinbase-knew-about-potential-securities-law-breaches.htm">SEC: Coinbase Knew About Potential Securities Law Breaches</a></li></ul>

Ken Griffin, another billionaire financier, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-04/griffin-sees-crypto-mania-as-jihadist-call-against-the-dollar">called</a> the crypto sectors a &ldquo;jihadist call&rdquo; against the USD as recently as two years ago.</p><p>These days, however, Citadel Securities, his electronic trading company, started backing a platform that allows institutional investors to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-make-money-with-cryptocurrency.htm">trade digital currencies</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Even Fidelity Investments, the largest 401(k) administrator in the US, is trying to get into crypto on several fronts.</p><p>Fidelity allowed workers to start investing a portion of their retirement savings in Bitcoin in 2022, while its subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets, started investing in EDX, a new crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Fidelity also filed for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bernstein-us-likely-approve-spot-bitcoin-etf.htm">Bitcoin spot ETF</a> less than two weeks after BlackRock.</p><p>Initially, the crypto industry players intended to try and break Wall Street and Washington&rsquo;s grip on the financial system in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, however, it appears that the crypto industry is going to assimilate Wall Street and allow it to join its ranks. While this is an impressive move, it also happened while the crypto sector was at its weakest.&nbsp;</p><p>It is far down from its peak due to a year-long crypto winter, and the US SEC renewed its efforts to disable the crypto sector in the country.</p><h2>Traditional finance is adopting the weakened crypto industry</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Due to the current situation in the US, the crypto sector&rsquo;s development finds itself at a crossroads in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>A year of price drops, company meltdowns and bankruptcies has had a negative impact on the interest in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fca-confirms-that-digital-assets-head-binu-paul-exited-less-than-a-year-after-assuming-role-search-for-replacement-to-begin-shortly.htm">digital assets</a>. The regulators cracked down on the industry, its companies, and their executives.</p><p>Entrepreneurs have been criminally charged, while celebrity endorsers have been publicly shamed. However, financial giants saw this as an opportunity to profit by allowing users a pared-back menu of crypto products and services.</p><p>What the companies have to offer is unlikely to come with the regulators&rsquo; ire, so many are willing to accept these offerings.</p><p>The question now is whether the crypto industry&rsquo;s ambition to democratize finance can survive this treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>VanEck&rsquo;s Matthew Sigel said that assets often move from weak to strong hands during <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/whats-bear-market.htm">bear markets</a>, and that this is seemingly happening to crypto, as well.</p><h3>Related Articles:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/argentinian-regulator-says-it-wants-adopt-fatf-crypto-regulations.htm">Argentina Looks Set to Adopt FATF Crypto Rules</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/belgium-burger-chain-accept-crypto-pay-adoption-rise.htm">Belgium: Burger Chain to Accept Crypto Pay</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-adoption-on-the-rise-examining-bitcoin-price-prediction-as-mining-difficulty-reaches-new-all-time-high.htm">BTC Adoption on the Rise?

This is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals, whereas regular phishing attacks are typically more general, targeting a specific group, such as any employee of a specific company.</p><p>During spear phishing attacks, the attackers typically try to present themselves as a trusted source, which is trying to contact the target regarding something urgent. Their real goal is to extract information that could lead to their financial or other benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>So, after falsely presenting themselves as Coinbase support, the two teens tried to obtain information that would allow them to compromise the victim&rsquo;s account and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-portfolio-allocation.htm">crypto portfolio</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, the teens were successful in robbing the US investor. After obtaining the money, some of it was used to purchase the Instagram handle &ldquo;@Zombie.&rdquo;</p><p>This is a username that is commonly sought-after in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/why-community-foundation-of-blockchain-gaming.htm">gaming community</a>. The teens used other aliases, including Felon and Gaze.</p><p>The local <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/crypto-teens-charged-1.6896349">report</a> states that the investigation started in June, and the massive amount in question was large enough for the FBI and the United States Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force to get involved. Working together, the two agencies identified the culprits, who were then arrested.</p><p>A deeper investigation discovered that this was likely not their first successful scam, as the two 17-year-olds had as much as $13.4 million in cryptocurrency.</p><h2>Authorities are fighting back against the rising crypto crime</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The increased adoption of the crypto market means that more and more people are handling crypto without taking proper security precautions. Sometimes, even taking the right precautions ends up being insufficient. Every month, there is at least one incident involving a multimillion-dollar crypto heist.</p><p>As the adoption continues, the crypto prices are expected to grow higher, which would likely incentivize more hackers and scammers to try their luck and skill by stealing some.</p><p>Of course, the authorities have also responded to this increase by launching several initiatives to stop them or at least identify the guilty parties.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, in February, the FBI <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-installs-new-fbi-crypto-crime-unit-11645129414">created</a> a Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit that joined forces with the Justice Department&rsquo;s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.</p><p>Together, they intend to focus on crypto-related crimes specifically due to their surge in number and severity.</p><p>Then, in June 2023, the US authorities established <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/hsi-arizona-us-attorney-and-federal-partners-announce-formalization-darknet">another task force</a> to investigate Arizona&#8217;s crypto and darknet crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>The new task force consists of no less than five federal enforcement agencies, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Arizona, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, the Office for US Attorneys, the Postal Inspection Service, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p><p>The agencies have been in tight cooperation in Arizona since 2017, and since then, they have busted multiple drug trafficking cases, some of which have been quite high-profile.</p><h3>Related Articles:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-partner-with-fidelity-other-bitcoin-etfs-for-surveillance-heres-latest.htm">Coinbase to Partner with Fidelity and Other Bitcoin ETFs for Surveillance</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbases-ethereum-layer-2-network-base-nears-mainnet-launch.htm">Coinbase&#8217;s Ethereum Layer-2 Network, Base, Nears Mainnet Launch</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-partner-with-fidelity-other-bitcoin-etfs-for-surveillance-heres-latest.htm">Coinbase to Partner with Fidelity and Other Bitcoin ETFs for Surveillance &ndash; Here&#8217;s the Latest</a></li></ul>

They even have references to fake complaint processing and dispute resolutions.&nbsp;</p><p>The included addresses also reference real locations, such as Buenos Aires-based Plaza de Mayo or London&rsquo;s Canary Wharf.</p><p>However, closer inspection reveals that the language used on the websites is unpolished, filled with syntax, grammar, or even spelling errors.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a common red flag that can be found in scammer-made emails and fake online pages.</p><h2>Authorities warn: This is not the full list</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The authorities advise investors &ndash; especially those interested in cryptocurrencies &ndash; to remember several key pieces of information.&nbsp;</p><p>First, none of the organizations on the list above are known regulators or real dispute resolution organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>Any entity claiming to be approved or regulated by the mentioned organizations is most likely fraudulent.</p><p>Furthermore, the fake organizations listed above are only the ones that Canadian authorities managed to identify so far.&nbsp;</p><p>It is possible that the list is not complete and that new ones might emerge now that the old ones have been identified.</p><p>Finally, many self-regulatory organizations and national regulatory agencies exist in the investment market. It can be difficult to spot the fraudulent ones among so many real ones.</p><p>However, one way to identify the legitimate ones is by checking whether they are <a href="https://www.iosco.org/about/?subsection=becoming_a_member">members</a>, associate members, or affiliate members of the <a href="https://www.iosco.org/">International Organization of Securities Commissions</a>.</p><p>This is a real organization that includes multiple CSA members in its ranks.</p><h2>Do your research for your own safety</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Those who wish to use crypto companies in Canada should try to independently verify whether the platform is regulated and then check whether the regulator is real.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities warn that users should not simply rely on the organizations&rsquo; websites.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, they should look for news articles, official documents, or anything similar issued by established, trustworthy sources referencing the crypto business.</p><p>Finally, those who wish to invest in cryptocurrencies should stick to legitimate trading platforms <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/">registered</a> with the CSA.&nbsp;</p><p>Fraudulent platforms often try to offer a better deal to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-struggles-attract-investors-despite-upcoming-shanghai-upgrade-healthy-network-fundamentals.htm">attract investors</a>, so if the deal seems too good to be true &mdash; it likely isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p><p>The mentioned measures cannot eliminate all the risks entirely, but they can at least help investors protect themselves from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spike-crypto-scams-targeting-young-korean-women-heres-how-fraudsters-strike.htm">crypto scammers</a> that employ this type of scam.</p><h3>Related Articles:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin-in-canada.htm">How to Buy and Sell Bitcoin in Canada?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-says-farewell-canada-following-new-guidance-implementing-restrictions-exchanges.htm">Binance Says Farewell to Canada Following New Guidance Implementing Restrictions on Exchanges</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bybit-joins-binance-exit-from-canadian-crypto-market-whats-going-on.htm">Bybit Joins Binance in Exit from Canadian Crypto Market &ndash; What&#8217;s Going On?</a></li></ul>
