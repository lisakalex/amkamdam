<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Read on to discover our comprehensive reviews. We cover everything you need to know about the best leverage trading crypto sites. This includes supported markets, tradeable instruments, fees, leverage limits, payments, and other important metrics.</p>
<h3><strong>1. MEXC: Get 200x Leverage on 100+ Cryptocurrencies With Low Trading FeesÂ </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/visit/mexc/">MEXC</a> is the best Bitcoin leverage trading platform in the market. In fact, not only does MEXC offer leverage on Bitcoin but some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a>. This includes everything from BNB, Ethereum, and Ripple to Cardano, Cosmos, and Arbitrum. MEXC also offers leverage on meme coins, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, FLOKI, and Pepe.</p>
<p>The maximum leverage is 200x, although smaller-cap coins come with smaller limits. In terms of tradable instruments, MEXC supports cryptocurrency futures. There are more than 100 perpetual futures, meaning the contracts never expire. You can also trade a selection of Coin-M futures, which use the underlying cryptocurrency as collateral.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139935" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701909092-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-31-14.png" alt="MEXC leverage trading platform" width="900" height="417" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701909092-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-31-14.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701909092-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-31-14-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701909092-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-31-14-1024x475.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701909092-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-31-14-768x356.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701909092-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-31-14-1536x712.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701909092-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-31-14-2048x950.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701909092-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-31-14-150x70.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>MEXC is also one of the best crypto leverage trading platforms for low fees. It charges just 0.02% per slide, which is based on the total value of the leveraged position. For instance, a leveraged trade worth $20,000 would mean a $4 commission. All that being said, one of the main drawbacks of MEXC is that it doesn&#8217;t offer options.</p>
<p>Moreover, the MEXC trading platform is more suitable for intermediate to advanced traders. Nonetheless, we like that MEXC allows users to trade anonymously when keeping below KYC limits. Put simply, unless you&#8217;re withdrawing more than 30 BTC per day, you won&#8217;t need to provide any personal information.</p>

<h3><strong>2. OKX: 100x Leverage on Crypto Options Markets With Fees of 0.03%Â </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/visit/okx/">OKX</a> is a tier-one crypto exchange that offers a huge range of leveraged trading products. In particular, OKX is popular with those who want to trade options. You can go long or short on Bitcoin and Ethereum options, and there are various strike prices and expiry dates to choose from. The maximum leverage limit is 100x when trading in partial liquidation mode.</p>
<p>MEXC charges 0.03% of the options contract value, inclusive of leverage. This needs to be paid when entering and exiting a trade. In addition, OKX also offers perpetual futures on dozens of cryptocurrencies. This includes some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">best utility tokens</a>, such as Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Aave.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139937" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701910125-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-48-33.png" alt="OKX options trading" width="900" height="528" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701910125-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-48-33.png 2268w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701910125-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-48-33-300x176.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701910125-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-48-33-1024x600.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701910125-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-48-33-768x450.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701910125-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-48-33-1536x901.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701910125-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-48-33-2048x1201.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701910125-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-07-48-33-150x88.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also trade delivery futures. These are settled every three months and only Bitcoin is covered. OKX charges 0.05% per slide when trading perpetual and delivery futures, which aligns with the industry average. OKX accepts many payment methods, including debit/credit cards. It also offers peer-to-peer funding.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Binance: Wide Range of Crypto Leverage Products Including Futures, Options, and Multiplier TokensÂ Â </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/visit/binance/">Binance</a> is one of the most popular trading platforms for leveraged markets. It offers many different tradeable instruments, including multiplier tokens. For instance, suppose you buy &#8216;ETH/USDT 5x&#8217; contracts. If Ethereum increases by 10%, your position will rise by 50%. Multiplier tokens don&#8217;t come with liquidation risks.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also trade crypto futures. There are two options here, perpetual or inverse contracts. The latter is settled in the underlying cryptocurrency. Binance charges 0.05% on multiplier tokens and futures contracts. It supports more than 600 cryptocurrencies, so you&#8217;ll never be short of opportunities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139938" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701911012-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-08-03-20.png" alt="Binance leveraged options trading" width="900" height="504" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701911012-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-08-03-20.png 2276w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701911012-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-08-03-20-300x168.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701911012-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-08-03-20-1024x573.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701911012-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-08-03-20-768x430.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701911012-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-08-03-20-1536x860.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701911012-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-08-03-20-2048x1146.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701911012-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-08-03-20-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>We also like that Binance supports crypto options. You&#8217;ll find a fully-fledged options chain with lengthy expiry dates. There are many different strike prices too. Binance charges 0.03% on crypto options and the only risk is the premium you pay to enter the market. Finally, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-became-the-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-without-licenses-or-headquarters-thats-coming-to-an-end-11636640029">Binance is the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange</a>, so you&#8217;ll benefit from premium liquidity 24/7.</p>

<h3><strong>8. PrimeXTB: Crypto Leverage of up to 1,000x on Contracts-for-Differences</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://primexbt.com/">PrimeXTB</a> is the best crypto leverage trading platform for high limits; you&#8217;ll get leverage of up to 1,000x when trading contracts-for-differences (CFDs). This means a $10 account balance would secure $10,000 worth of trading capital.Â However, do note that CFDs are regulated financial instruments in many countries, so leverage limits might be restricted.</p>
<p>For example, according to <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-renew-restrictions-cfds-further-three-months-1-may-2019">ESMA, EU clients can only trade crypto CFDs with leverage of up to 2x</a>.Â  XTB also offers isolated and cross-margin futures on some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-trade.htm">best cryptocurrencies to trade</a>. This includes Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ripple, Solana, Litecoin, and Ethereum.</p>

<h2><strong>How Does Crypto Leverage Trading Work?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a nutshell, leverage allows traders to &#8216;amplify&#8217; their positions, meaning you can trade with more than you have in your account balance. For example, suppose you trade $500 worth of Ethereum with 20x leverage. Your $500 trade is now valued at $10,000. Leverage appeals to traders who want to boost their trading profits without depositing higher amounts.</p>
<p>However, leverage will also increase your losses when things don&#8217;t go to plan. In most cases, the trade will be liquidated when it declines by the initial margin. This means the crypto trading platform will close the trade and you&#8217;ll lose your stake. For instance, suppose you stake $1,000 with 5x leverage &#8211; increasing the position to $5,000.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139957" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701920930-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-10-48-36.png" alt="MEXC leverage 200x" width="900" height="315" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701920930-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-10-48-36.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701920930-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-10-48-36-300x105.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701920930-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-10-48-36-1024x359.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701920930-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-10-48-36-768x269.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701920930-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-10-48-36-1536x538.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701920930-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-10-48-36-2048x718.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701920930-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-10-48-36-150x53.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;re putting up 20% worth of margin ($5,000/$1,000), so if the trade declines by 20%, it will be closed. In this instance, you&#8217;ve just lost $1,000. Therefore, you must consider the risks of leverage trading before proceeding. In terms of markets, leverage can be accessed in many different ways.</p>
<p>This includes perpetual futures, inverse futures, delivery futures, and options. Some platforms also offer &#8216;leveraged tokens&#8217;. These simply track the spot trading price of a cryptocurrency and multiply profits and losses. Another feature of leverage trading is that you can go long or short. This means you can look for trading opportunities in both bullish and bearish markets.</p>

<li>There are several different ways to short cryptocurrencies with leverage.</li>
<li>One of the easiest is to sell crypto futures on MEXC. You&#8217;ll have access to leverage of up to 200x and short-selling commissions are just 0.2%.</li>
<li>Another method is to purchase put options on OKX. You&#8217;ll need to select a strike price and pay an upfront premium. If your options trade doesn&#8217;t go to plan, only the premium will be lost.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Our Research Methods When Selecting the Best Bitcoin Leverage Trading Platform</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We followed strict criteria when reviewing the best crypto leverage trading platforms. Having selected the top 10 providers for 2023, here&#8217;s what we focused on:</p>
<h3><strong>Safety and Security</strong></h3>
<p>Many crypto leverage platforms operate without a license, even though they handle billions of dollars in daily trading volume. This is because, in most countries, leveraged cryptocurrencies are unregulated financial products. Nonetheless, you should tread carefully when selecting a platform, especially if it&#8217;s located offshore.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore when the platform was founded and how many people actively use it.</li>
<li>Check out CoinMarketCap to get an idea of trading volume and proof of reserves.</li>
<li>You can also research consumer reviews and browse Reddit for additional feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;d also advise seeing what security controls the platform offers. For instance, what safeguards are in place to prevent a remote hacking attempt?</p>
<p>Platforms like MEXC and OKX keep the majority of client funds in cold storage, meaning the cryptocurrencies are always offline. These platforms also have strong and audited proof of reserves, meaning they can cover 100% of client balances.</p>
<h3><strong>Supported Leverage MarketsÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;re satisfied with safety, the next step is to research what leverage markets are available. For example, MEXC offers perpetual futures, which are very popular with crypto traders. Just like futures, perpetuals support leverage and short-selling. However, perpetual futures don&#8217;t come with a delivery date, meaning they&#8217;re always active.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139961" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924726-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-51-56.png" alt="Dogecoin futures on MEXC" width="900" height="470" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924726-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-51-56.png 2272w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924726-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-51-56-300x157.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924726-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-51-56-1024x535.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924726-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-51-56-768x401.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924726-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-51-56-1536x802.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924726-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-51-56-2048x1069.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924726-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-51-56-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to trade delivery futures, then check out OKX. It offers many different delivery time frames and strike prices. Alternatively, you might also consider leveraged options markets. Although options come with huge upside potential, they&#8217;re considered low risk. This is because you can only lose the premium.</p>
<p>Another popular method is leveraged tokens. These amplify profits and losses like futures and options. However, there is no requirement to put up a margin, meaning you won&#8217;t be liquidated. Ultimately, make sure you choose a leverage platform that offers your preferred trading instrument.</p>
<h3><strong>Listed CryptocurrenciesÂ </strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top-10 cryptocurrencies; you&#8217;ll have no issues finding a leverage platform. But if you&#8217;re more interested in meme coins or DeFi tokens, you&#8217;ll need to do a bit of research.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, the best crypto leverage trading platform for smaller-cap cryptocurrencies is MEXC.</li>
<li>It supports more than 100 altcoins, including Gala, Pepe, and Internet Computer.</li>
<li>KuCoin is a great option for leveraged meme coins, including FLOKI, Bonk, and Shiba Inu.</li>
</ul>
<p>We found that perpetual futures are the best option for trading less popular cryptocurrencies. In contrast, most crypto option chains only support Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<h3><strong>Maximum Leverage LimitsÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Depending on your risk tolerance, you might want to trade cryptocurrencies with very high leverage limits. The highest limits that we found were 1,000x, available on PrimeXTB. However, this is offered via crypto CFDs, which aren&#8217;t available in the US or the UK. Moreover, although European and <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-082mr-asic-s-cfd-product-intervention-order-extended-for-five-years/">Australian retail clients can trade crypto CFDs, they&#8217;re capped at 2x</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139963" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924864-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-54-13.png" alt="MEXC 200x leverage " width="900" height="342" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924864-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-54-13.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924864-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-54-13-300x114.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924864-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-54-13-1024x390.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924864-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-54-13-768x292.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924864-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-54-13-1536x584.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924864-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-54-13-2048x779.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924864-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-54-13-150x57.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Therefore, the best platform for getting much higher limits is MEXC. It offers leverage of up to 200x and there&#8217;s no KYC process when withdrawing under 30 BTC per day. Binance and Bybit also offer high leverage limits at 125x. That said, you&#8217;ll only get 50x when trading on Kraken Pro.</p>
<h3><strong>Leverage Trading FeesÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Fees will vary depending on the leverage trading platform and the type of instrument being traded. On average, you&#8217;ll pay 0.05% per slide to trade leveraged futures. This is reduced to 0.02% on MEXC and PrimeXTB. Leveraged options average 0.03% of the total contract amount.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4><strong>How do Leveraged Options Fees Work?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>When you trade options with leverage, you&#8217;ll need to pay a commission. However, the commission is based on the total trade value, including leverage.</li>
<li>For example, suppose you trade $500 worth of options at leverage of 50x.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll pay 0.2% of the $25,000 ($500 x 50x) position, so that&#8217;s $50.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some crypto leverage trading platforms also charge financing fees. This will be charged each day the position remains open. On Kraken Pro, financing fees are charged every four hours.</p>
</div></div>
<h3><strong>Analysis ToolsÂ </strong></h3>
<p>We also explored what analysis tools were available when ranking crypto leverage platforms. For instance, Deribit offers an &#8216;Options Wizard&#8217; tool. First, Deribit will ask for your prediction. For example, you might believe that Bitcoin will be trading at $100,000 in April 2024. Deribit will then suggest the best options contract for this hypothesis.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139962" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924805-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-53-16.png" alt="Option Wizard on Deribit" width="900" height="414" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924805-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-53-16.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924805-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-53-16-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924805-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-53-16-1024x471.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924805-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-53-16-768x353.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924805-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-53-16-1536x707.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924805-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-53-16-2048x942.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701924805-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-11-53-16-150x69.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re more interested in leveraged futures, MEXC offers a wide range of analysis tools. This includes technical indicators like the MACD, Bollinger Bands, and RSI. It also offers custom chart patterns, multiple time frames, and drawing tools. Binance and Kraken Pro are also great options for advanced technical analysis.</p>
<h3><strong>Payment MethodsÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Payments are also important when choosing a crypto leverage platform.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>What deposit and withdrawal methods are accepted? Most traders prefer funding their accounts with fiat money. On MEXC and OKX, you can deposit funds with a debit/credit card or bank wire.</li>
<li>What is the minimum deposit requirement? Most platforms allow you to get started with a few dollars.</li>
<li>How long does the platform take to process withdrawals? You should prioritize platforms that offer same-day payouts &#8211; including weekends and public holidays.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check what payment fees apply too. Debit/credit cards, for example, can cost as much as 5% when using a crypto leverage platform.</p>
<h3><strong>Customer ServiceÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Customer service levels can vary widely from one platform to the next. For example, although Kraken Pro offers a live chat box, it&#8217;s very cumbersome. You first need to get past the &#8216;Bot&#8217; that you&#8217;re connected with. After requesting a human agent, we were told waiting times would be at least three hours.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should never assume that live chat offers instant assistance; so it&#8217;s worth testing out. Additionally, make sure the customer service department operates 24 hours per day. If it doesn&#8217;t, its operating hours should align with your local time zone.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h2><strong>Is it Legal to Trade Cryptocurrencies With Leverage?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Most countries do not place restrictions on leverage trading; not only for cryptocurrencies but other assets like stocks and ETFs. This means traders can access high leverage limits of 100x and more. However, some countries have installed leverage restrictions for retail clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, UK retail clients can&#8217;t legally access leveraged crypto projects, including CFDs, futures, options, and anything in between. These <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-bans-sale-crypto-derivatives-retail-consumers">crypto leverage restrictions were implemented by the FCA in January 2021</a> to protect reckless trading.</li>
<li>Although Europeans <em>can</em> trade cryptocurrencies with leverage, <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-renew-restrictions-cfds-further-three-months-1-may-2019">ESMA restricts retail clients to just 2x</a>.</li>
<li>Similar to the UK, Canadian retail clients are unable to trade leveraged cryptocurrencies. This is unless <a href="https://ca.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/0-606-9007?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true">Canadian traders are classed as &#8216;Permitted Clients&#8217;, which requires at least $5 million in net assets</a>.</li>
<li>US clients <em>can</em> legally trade cryptocurrencies with leverage, but only with regulated and approved providers. For instance, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-financial-markets-inc-secures-fcm-approval-to-bring-regulated">Coinbase recently secured approval from the National Futures Association</a> to offer crypto futures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although regulation is crucial when exploring crypto leverage trading, the industry still operates in a gray area. Many platforms offer anonymous accounts, meaning nationalities are not collected. As such, many traders in the US, Canada, the UK, and other restricted countries simply use a VPN.</p>
</div></div>
<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In summary, leverage is increasingly becoming popular with crypto traders, so there are many providers to choose from. We&#8217;ve explored the markets extensively and found that MEXC is the best crypto leverage platform.</p>
<p>MEXC offers 200x leverage on perpetual crypto futures. Long and short positions are supported and you&#8217;ll pay just 0.02% per slide. What&#8217;s more, MEXC supports a huge range of leveraged markets, including Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Ethereum.</p>

<p>Many cryptocurrency investors prefer layer 1 networks over secondary tokens, such as those following the ERC-20 or BEP-20 standards. After all, layer 1 blockchains determine their own consensus models, governance, and transaction processing.</p>
<p>This guide analyzes the 10 <strong>best layer 1 crypto projects</strong> for investors. We explore each layer 1 network in terms of performance, efficiency, scalability, use cases, and price action.</p>

<h2><strong>Analyzing the Best Layer 1 Tokens</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Read on for our analysis of the top layer 1 blockchain projects listed above.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Ethereum: Leading Smart Contract and dApp Network With Thousands of Secondary Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>In our view, Ethereum is one of the best layer 1 crypto projects to invest in. At its core, Ethereum is a smart contact network, enabling developers to build decentralized applications. ERC-20 projects benefit from Ethereum&#8217;s security, decentralization, and fast transactions. In turn, projects pay transaction fees in Ethereum&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, ETH.</p>
<p>There are thousands of projects operating on Ethereum, with new ones being launched every day. This includes leading stablecoins like Tether, USD Coin, and Dai, Ethereum is also the go-to network for metaverse experiences and play-to-earn games. Some popular examples include Axie Infinity, Tamadoge, the Sandbox, and Decentraland.</p>

<p>In addition, Ethereum is popular with decentralized finance projects. This includes everything from SushiSwap and Maker, Lido Dao, Uniswap, Yearn.finance, and SushiSwap. Ethereum has become so popular that it constantly faces network congestion. This is why layer 2 solutions have been developed, such as Arbitrum and Polygon.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ethereum is working on improving network efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Once this happens, layer 2 solutions might become irrelevant. In terms of valuation, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It has increased by over 70% in the past year. Since its inception, Ethereum is up over 1 <em>million</em> percent.</p>

<h3><strong>2. BNB: Deflationary Layer 1 Cryptocurrency Supporting dApps and a Burning Mechanism</strong></h3>
<p>BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain. It was created in late 2017 by Binance. The original BNB use case was for reduced commissions on the Binance exchange. Put simply, those paying fees in BNB will benefit from a 25% discount.Â BNB now supports a fully-fledged ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, the BNB Chain handles thousands of secondary tokens. The BNB Chain also supports smart contracts, so an increasing number of developers are choosing the network for their dApp creations. This includes play-to-earn games, staking protocols, and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges.htm">best no KYC crypto exchanges</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139203" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701750410-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-26-38.png" alt="BNB price chart" width="900" height="453" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701750410-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-26-38.png 2138w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701750410-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-26-38-300x151.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701750410-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-26-38-1024x515.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701750410-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-26-38-768x387.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701750410-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-26-38-1536x773.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701750410-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-26-38-2048x1031.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701750410-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-26-38-150x75.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Based on the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the BNB Chain is both efficient and cost-effective. What&#8217;s more, BNB offers exposure to Binance, the world&#8217;s largest exchange. BNB is trading at an attractive price right now. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/">CoinMarketCap, the BNB price is almost 55% below its all-time high</a>, which was hit in 2021.</p>
<p>We should also mention that Binance has developed a burning mechanism for BNB. Unlike other burning programs, Binance uses retained profits to repurchase BNB from public exchanges. This makes the burning mechanism sustainable. This will continue until the total BNB supply is reduced by 50%.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Ripple: Invest in the Future of Layer 1 Cross-Border FinanceÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Ripple is a layer 1 blockchain that was launched in 2012. It has an average transaction speed of under five seconds and fees cost just 0.00001 XRP (about $0.0000062). The Ripple network was created to revolutionize the trillion-dollar interbank market. In its current form, most cross-border payments go through SWIFT.</p>
<p>SWIFT transactions can be expensive and slow, especially when exotic currencies are being used. Ripple solves this through its layer 1 payments network. To streamline cross-currency transfers, Ripple uses XRP tokens as a bridge of liquidity. This makes corresponding banking networks redundant.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139204" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701751094-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-38-05.png" alt="XRP price chart" width="900" height="459" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701751094-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-38-05.png 2132w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701751094-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-38-05-300x153.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701751094-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-38-05-1024x523.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701751094-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-38-05-768x392.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701751094-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-38-05-1536x784.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701751094-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-38-05-2048x1045.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701751094-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-11-38-05-150x77.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Ripple is already being used by many financial institutions. This includes PNC Bank, Bank of America, Standard Chartered, and Cuallix. As more <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html">banks adopt the technology, this will increase demand for XRP tokens</a>. However, it&#8217;s important to note that XRP is only needed for liquidity purposes. Moreover, transacting parties only need to hold XRP tokens for several seconds.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ripple remains one of the best layer 1 crypto projects. In terms of valuation, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">XRP tokens have increased by over 10,400%</a> since they were launched over 10 years ago. In the past year, XRP tokens returned 58%. Although just under 54% of XRP tokens are currently in circulation, the balance is locked in escrow with strategic releases.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Sei: Newly-Launched Layer 1 Network Supporting 20,000 Transactions per SecondÂ </strong></h3>
<p>While Sei is one of the best layer 1 crypto projects around, it was only launched in mid-2023. This makes it the newest layer 1 network on this list. What&#8217;s more, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sei/">Sei also has the lowest market capitalization, currently valued at just over $600 million</a>. This will appeal to investors who want exposure to an up-and-coming layer 1 blockchain with plenty of upside.</p>
<p>That being said, Sei has already produced significant returns after launching just a few months ago. According to CoinMarketCap data, Sei has increased by over 3,400% since its August 2023 listing. Considering the bull market hasn&#8217;t <em>officially</em> started, Sei could have a lot more upside left in the tank.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Solana: Powering the Future of dApps and Web 3.0 Projects With Low Fees and High Scalability</strong></h3>
<p>For many investors, Solana is one of the best layer 1 crypto projects. It&#8217;s often called an Ethereum Killer, considering it facilitates smart contracts and dApps much more efficiently. In particular, Solana can handle thousands of transactions every second, making it ideal for Web 3.0 projects.</p>
<p>For instance, consider a decentralized finance project. Every buy and sell order requires a new transaction on the blockchain. This isn&#8217;t an issue for Solana, while Ethereum is limited to under 30 transactions per second. Solana is also cost-effective, transactions average a tiny fraction of a cent.Â Speed is also impressive; Solana achieves transaction finality in milliseconds.</p>

<p>Although the Solana ecosystem is small when compared to Ethereum, an increasing number of dApps are being developed. This covers payment solutions, NFT marketplaces, decentralized finance, and other Web 3.0 niches. Solana has a lot of price momentum right now, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">SOL tokens have increased by almost 330% since last year</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Bitcoin: The Original Layer 1 Blockchain With a Potential ETF Approval in 2024</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is the original layer 1 blockchain and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a>. Although Bitcoin was initially created as a medium of exchange, it now functions as a store of value. This is largely because of Bitcoin&#8217;s immutable and fixed supply. Every 10 minutes, 6.25 BTC tokens enter circulation. However, this will be reduced to 3.125 BTC when the next Bitcoin halving event takes place.</p>
<p>Expected in April 2024, Bitcoin halving events have historically resulted in prolonged price increases and new all-time highs. Another event expected in 2024 is an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sec-has-8-10-filings-possible-bitcoin-etf-products-gensler-2023-10-26/">SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF</a>. BlackRock, among other large-scale applicants, has a solid chance of getting the green light. This will provide exposure to Bitcoin for institutional investors.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been on a solid run since the turn of 2023. Year-to-date, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin has increased by over 150%</a>. However, Bitcoin is currently trading at just over $40,000, almost 40% below its prior all-time high. According to some analysts, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/04/bitcoin-price-at-100000-in-2024-crypto-execs-say-bull-run-has-begun.html">Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of 2024.</a> Ark Invest CEO <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/markets/bitcoin-price-will-pass-1-million-by-2030-says-cathie-wood-ark-invest">Cathie Wood believes Bitcoin could hit $1.48 million</a> by 2030.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Bitcoin Cash: Medium-of-Exchange Aiming to Become the De Facto Payment Currency</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin Cash is a layer 1 crypto project that spun off from the original Bitcoin in 2017. While Bitcoin is now considered a store of value, Bitcoin Cash functions as a medium of exchange. This means that BCH tokens are used primarily as a payment currency.<br />
When compared to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is a more efficient blockchain network.</p>
<p>Not only in terms of speed but scalability and fees too. This is because Bitcoin Cash increased the block size limit, making it more suitable for day-to-day transactions. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/">Bitcoin Cash has a market capitalization of over $4.8 billion</a>. Over the prior year of trading, BCH tokens are up 120%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139214" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754374-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-32-43.png" alt="Bitcoin Cash price chart" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754374-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-32-43.png 2102w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754374-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-32-43-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754374-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-32-43-1024x533.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754374-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-32-43-768x400.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754374-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-32-43-1536x799.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754374-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-32-43-2048x1066.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754374-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-32-43-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>However, Bitcoin Cash hasn&#8217;t recorded new all-time highs since late 2017. Right now, the tokens are trading at a 94% discount. Although the jury is out on Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s long-term potential, it&#8217;s still one of the most traded cryptocurrencies globally. For instance, in the past day, nearly $470 million worth of BCH tokens have been traded.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Stellar: Cheap Fiat Cross-Border Payments and Tokenization of Real-World Assets</strong></h3>
<p>Stellar is one of the most diverse layer 1 crypto networks. It has many use cases, including cheap and fast cross-border payments. Unlike other blockchains, this includes fiat money transfers. XLM, its native token, provides liquidity, meaning any currency can be used. According to Stellar, the average settlement time is currently just 5.8 seconds.</p>
<p>Another use case for Stellar is the tokenization of real-world assets. Anyone can create, issue, and store digital versions of currencies, stores on value, and much more. Stellar even enables users to implement KYC protocols, ensuring their tokenized assets remain compliant with global regulators.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139219" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754988-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-42-58.png" alt="Stellar price chart" width="900" height="457" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754988-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-42-58.png 2122w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754988-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-42-58-300x152.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754988-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-42-58-1024x520.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754988-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-42-58-768x390.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754988-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-42-58-1536x780.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754988-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-42-58-2048x1040.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701754988-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-42-58-150x76.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Stellar has worked with many recognized companies, including MoneyGram, Circle, IBM, BitGo, Fireworks, and Franklin Templeton. However, while Stellar continues to broaden its ecosystem, XLM tokens still trade at a fraction of their former all-time highs. Investors will get an 87% discount when compared to XLM&#8217;s peak of $0.93.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Polkadot: True Blockchain Interoperability Supporting All Forms of Digital Data</strong></h3>
<p>Polkadot is one of the best layer 1 crypto projects for &#8216;blockchain interoperability&#8217;. In a nutshell, interoperability allows two completely different blockchains to share data. However, unlike other interoperability protocols, Polkadot doesn&#8217;t <em>just</em> support cross-chain token transfers. On the contrary, it can handle all forms of digital data.</p>
<p>For example, Polkadot facilitates everything from smart contracts and dApps to NFTs. It can also connect decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), even those operating on different consensus models and network standards. DOT is the ecosystem token that bridges everything together.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139236" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701755849-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-57-13.png" alt="Polkadot price" width="900" height="450" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701755849-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-57-13.png 2134w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701755849-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-57-13-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701755849-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-57-13-1024x512.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701755849-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-57-13-768x384.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701755849-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-57-13-1536x769.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701755849-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-57-13-2048x1025.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701755849-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-12-57-13-150x75.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>DOT tokens are &#8216;bonded&#8217;, meaning they create a bridge for cross-blockchain transfers. This creates a solid use case, as Polkadot cannot be used without sufficient DOT tokens. In terms of price performance, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/">DOT tokens are up 18% in the prior month</a>. However, they&#8217;ve declined by 1% on a 12-month basis. Nonetheless, DOT is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">best utility tokens</a> to buy.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Blockchain Layer 1?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Layer 1 blockchains are the foundation of a decentralized network. The easiest way to understand layer 1 blockchains is to use Solana as an example. Solana is a layer 1 blockchain with a proprietary cryptocurrency, SOL. However, Solana also enables other cryptocurrencies to build on its network.</p>
<p>These are secondary cryptocurrencies, as they merely follow Solana&#8217;s underlying code. This is fundamental for several reasons. For a start, Solana-based cryptocurrencies must pay transaction fees in SOL, rather than their own native token. This is the case with similar layer 1 networks, be it Ethereum, BNB, or Cardano.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139240" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701757676-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-13-27-45.png" alt="Solana layer 1 ecosystem" width="900" height="573" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701757676-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-13-27-45.png 1980w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701757676-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-13-27-45-300x191.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701757676-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-13-27-45-1024x652.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701757676-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-13-27-45-768x489.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701757676-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-13-27-45-1536x977.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701757676-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-13-27-45-150x95.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Therefore, as more projects build on Solana, demand for SOL also increases. In addition, layer 1 blockchains have their own governance models. This means they determine which consensus mechanism to use, such as proof-of-stake or proof-of-work. Put otherwise, the best layer 1 crypto projects have proprietary technology.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4><strong>How do Layer 1 Networks Make Money?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Most layer 1 networks make money from transaction fees. These are settled in their native cryptocurrency token.</li>
<li>For example, Solana-based dApps pay fees in SOL. While dApps on the BNB Chain pay fees in BNB.</li>
<li>Not only does this create demand for the respective layer 1 cryptocurrency but it can increase its value over time.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<p>In contrast, projects built on a layer 1 blockchain have no say in governance, network proposals, transaction fees, or other network metrics. This is why layer 1 cryptocurrencies are so popular with investors. They&#8217;re generally viewed as long-term projects, as it often takes many years to develop a fully functional ecosystem.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the case with secondary cryptocurrencies. For example, anyone can build an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Although there are plenty of solid projects like Uniswap and Chainlink, most ERC-20 tokens have no utility or value.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h2><strong>Blockchain Layer 1 vs Layer 2</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Layer 1 <em>and</em> layer 2 blockchains can both play a vital role within a decentralized network. If you&#8217;re unaware of how the two terms differ, let&#8217;s start with a relatable example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin is a layer 1 blockchain. It uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which governs how transactions are verified and posted to the ledger. Put simply, transactions take around 10 minutes to reach finality.</li>
<li>Now consider a layer 2 solution like the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Although it can&#8217;t make changes to the original Bitcoin network, it can streamline transactions.</li>
<li>Going through the Lightning Network means that Bitcoin transactions are reduced to seconds, rather than 10-minute cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still confused? Now consider the Ethereum blockchain, which is a layer 1 network.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and fees must be paid in ETH tokens.</li>
<li>However, as Ethereum struggles with scalability, layer 2 solutions like Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum are widely used.</li>
<li>This enables Ethereum-based projects to increase efficiency, reduce fees, and amplify transaction throughput.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, layer 2 projects provide solutions for layer 1 blockchains. This can come in various forms, such as adding smart contract compatibility, increasing scalability, or simply reducing fees.</p>
</div></div>
<h2><strong>Why Invest in Layer 1 Blockchain Coins?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This section explains why layer 1 blockchain coins could be a great addition to your investment portfolio.</p>
<h3><strong>Invest in the Foundation of a Decentralized Network</strong></h3>
<p>A great analogy when exploring the layer 1 crypto projects is to consider &#8216;land&#8217; and &#8216;buildings&#8217;. For example, a layer 1 network like Ethereum is the &#8216;land&#8217;. While ERC-20 tokens are the &#8216;buildings&#8217; erected on Ethereum&#8217;s land. This means that Ethereum is the ultimate beneficiary.</p>
<p>It determines everything from network fees and consensus models to tokenized standards and circulating supplies. While ERC-20 tokens can build unique and innovative projects, they must adhere to Ethereum&#8217;s underlying code. From an investment perspective, Ethereum allows you to invest directly in its network, rather than opting for secondary projects.</p>
<h3><strong>Secondary Tokens Create Demand for Layer 1 CryptocurrenciesÂ </strong></h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve established that most layer 1 blockchains allow other projects to build on their respective networks. This is hugely beneficial, as secondary projects create demand for the native network cryptocurrency. This is because transaction fees must be paid in the layer 1 token.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139259" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701760028-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-14-06-58.png" alt="Uniswap requires ETH fees " width="900" height="547" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701760028-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-14-06-58.png 1940w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701760028-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-14-06-58-300x182.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701760028-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-14-06-58-1024x623.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701760028-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-14-06-58-768x467.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701760028-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-14-06-58-1536x934.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701760028-screenshot-2023-12-05-at-14-06-58-150x91.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>For example, consider a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, which is built on the Ethereum network. In the prior 24 hours, <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/">nearly $1 billion worth of trades have been conducted on Uniswap</a>. Every time a trader swaps a cryptocurrency, they&#8217;ll need to pay fees in ETH.</p>
<p>Now consider that thousands of dApps operate on Ethereum. That&#8217;s a significant amount of ETH required for the Ethereum ecosystem to function.</p>
<p>Similarly, consider Polkadot, which allows competing blockchains to share data and communicate without centralized providers. To engage in cross-blockchain transfers, DOT tokens are required. In other words, it&#8217;s mandatory for developers to &#8216;bond&#8217; DOT, should they wish to use the Polkadot framework.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4><strong>Layer 1 Networks and Decentralized GovernanceÂ Â </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The best layer 1 crypto projects have created a democratic ecosystem. For example, the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/">Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP)</a> provide a governance framework for ETH holders.</li>
<li>This includes the ability to make suggestions, ask for improvements, and even vote on key network changes. This is similar to stockholders voting in an Annual General Meeting, where the only requirement is to own at least 1 share.</li>
<li>Many other layer 1 cryptocurrencies have similar systems. This includes Polkadot, Solana, Avalanche, Cardano, Tezos, and Near Protocol.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In summary, the best layer 1 crypto projects offer a more favorable upside when compared to secondary tokens. Layer 1 ecosystems set their own rules, whether that&#8217;s consensus, transaction fees, or governance proposals.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, secondary tokens must pay fees in the respective layer 1 cryptocurrency. This creates long-term demand. Before investing in layer 1 projects, make sure you conduct your own research and consider the risks.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/">BC.Game</a> is a top-rated crypto gambling site that gives players access to nearly 100 roulette variations, among the most of the sites reviewed in this list.

<p>In terms of variations, BC.Game covers the three main roulette categories &#8211; European, American, and French.

<p>In addition to roulette, BC.Game offers access to thousands of other casino games and sports betting.Â When it comes to the welcome package, BC.Game offers new players four deposit bonuses. Each payment is matched by at least 270%, going up to 360% on the fourth deposit.Â </p>

<h2>How We Choose the Best Bitcoin Roulette Sites</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Players on the hunt for the best Bitcoin roulette sites can refer to the comprehensive reviews above, in addition to conducting independent research.Â </p>
<p>The main focus points when researching top crypto roulette sites should include payments, supported game types, bonuses, and house edges.Â </p>
<p>We discuss these important metrics and more in the sections below &#8211; which will help players make an informed decision when selecting the best Bitcoin roulette site.Â </p>
<h3>Bitcoin Payments</h3>
<p>When funding a Bitcoin casino account, the BTC tokens will be transferred from a private wallet. And as such, this ensures that the player can make safe and private transactions.Â </p>
<p>This is especially the case considering that the best Bitcoin casino sites offer anonymous accounts that are free of KYC demands. With that said, players should check the terms and conditions of their chosen Bitcoin roulette site to evaluate how quickly deposits are credited.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>The top providers in this space, inclusive of BC.Game, Cloudbet, and Bitslot, process Bitcoin deposits after just one network confirmation.Â </li>
<li>This ensures that after making the transfer from a private wallet, the casino account will be ready to use in around 10-15 minutes.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, withdrawals are another metric that should be assessed when choosing the best Bitcoin roulette site. Most providers discussed on this page process withdrawal requests in under 10 minutes.Â </p>
<p>Fees payable on the withdrawal will usually mirror that of the Bitcoin network at the time of the cashout request.Â </p>
<h3>Bitcoin Roulette VariationsÂ </h3>
<p>As we covered in our reviews of the best crypto roulette sites, the number of titles and types of variations will vary considerably from one provider to the next.Â </p>
<p>BC.Game, for instance, offers access to 96 different roulette games. Punt Casino, on the other hand, supports just 12.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Players should also determine the type of Bitcoin roulette that they wish to access.Â </li>
<li>Some players prefer roulette games that are backed by regulated software developers, such as Playtech and Evolution.Â </li>
<li>Others prefer the blockchain aspect of provably fair roulette games.Â </li>
<li>There are also players that prefer a real-world casino experience through live roulette dealers.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>Irrespective of the game type, players should evaluate whether or not their preferred roulette variation is supported before opening an account with the respective provider.Â </p>
<h3>Welcome Package Â Â </h3>
<p>With the exception of Metaspins, the best Bitcoin roulette sites offer a welcome package. This means that the casino will provide the newly registered player with an allocation of bonus funds.</p>
<p>The most sought-after welcome package in this regard is a matched deposit bonus. By joining BC.Game as a new player, the first four deposits will be matched by the casino.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95962/239126/screenshot-2022-11-25-at-11-19-22.jpg" alt="bc.,game welcome casino and promotions" /></figure>
<p>After claiming the BC.Game bonus, players might then consider moving onto Cloudbet, which offers a 100% matched deposit of up to 5 BTC.Â </p>
<p>When reviewing the welcome package, check the wagering requirements and any other important terms.Â </p>
<p>Lucky Block offers 15% cashback on losses for the first seven days as well as reload bonuses for high rollers, with no wagering requirements.</p>
<h3>Betting Stakes and Limits Â Â </h3>
<p>Most Bitcoin roulette casinos will have predefined minimum and maximum stakes. This can also vary depending on the specific roulette title, as stakes are often determined by the underlying developer.Â </p>
<p>For example, Evolution typically supplies crypto casinos with several different live roulette tables &#8211; each of which comes with its own betting limits.Â </p>
<p>Ultimately, the key point here is that players should check what stake requirements are in place when choosing a Bitcoin roulette casino site to ensure it aligns with their personal budget.Â </p>
<h3>Other Casino Games Â Â </h3>
<p>While roulette might be the main focus, players will often engage with other casino games. As such, the gaming suite should be researched when assessing the best Bitcoin roulette sites.Â </p>
<p>For example, Lucky Block offers thousands of other gambling products, including alternative table games like baccarat and blackjack. The aforementioned provider also offers slots, jackpot games, video poker, and more.Â </p>
<p>Lucky Block, BC.Game and Cloudbet also offer access to a sportsbook. This means that players can wager on live sports in conjunction with roulette and other casino games.Â </p>
<h2>How Does Bitcoin Roulette Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin roulette is essentially the same as the traditional version of this game. As such, players are required to place bets on which number they believe the roulette wheel will land on during the next spin. However, instead of depositing fiat currency into the respective online casino, players will fund their account with Bitcoin.Â </p>
<p>This means that players will benefit from anonymous, fast, and cheap payments &#8211; both in terms of deposits and withdrawals. In the vast majority of cases, the best Bitcoin roulette sites will display betting stakes in US dollars. The reason for this is that it can be challenging to assess stakes, winnings, and losses &#8211; when figures are denominated in BTC.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95962/239122/screenshot-2022-11-25-at-11-11-48.jpg" alt="bc.game crypto casino and sports betting" /></figure>
<p>The estimated conversion will be made in real-time to ensure the player has a firm grasp of how much they are gambling when playing Bitcoin roulette. When playing Bitcoin roulette online, players will often have access to multiple variations. At a basic level, this includes the likes of European, French, and American roulette.Â </p>
<p>These popular roulette games can often be played across software tables, with popular providers including Microgaming, Evolution, Netent, and Pragmatic Play. It is also possible to play Bitcoin roulette via live dealer tables. Most crypto-centric casinos also offer provably fair roulette. This means that the outcome of each roulette spin is determined by a smart contract.Â </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Roulette Bonuses</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While most Bitcoin roulette sites offer a welcome package to new players, the specific type of bonus can and will vary.Â </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of the main bonuses offered by Bitcoin roulette casinos.Â </p>
<h3>Matched Deposit Bonus</h3>
<p>The most common bonus sought by roulette players is a matched deposit. This is because the casino will match the deposit by a certain amount &#8211; meaning that the player will have more funds at their disposal when playing roulette games.</p>
<p>One of the most generous Bitcoin roulette sites in this regard is Cloudbet, which offers first-time players a 100% bonus of up to 5 BTC. This means that by depositing 5 BTC, the player&#8217;s opening balance will start at 10 BTC. Â Â </p>
<h3>Free Spins</h3>
<p>Free spins are linked to slot machine games as opposed to roulette. However, this bonus type is still worth considering, as any winnings generated from the free spins can subsequently be used to play at the roulette table.</p>
<p>The best option in this regard is Winz.io which, in return for meeting a $100 minimum deposit, offers new players 300 free slot spins.Â </p>
<p>Any winnings made from the spins are free of wagering requirements. This means the player can use the funds to play roulette without needing to risk any money.Â </p>
<h3>No Deposit Bonus</h3>
<p>Players will often search for online Bitcoin roulette sites that offer a no deposit bonus. This bonus type will credit the player&#8217;s account with free casino funds without there being a requirement to make a deposit.Â </p>
<h3>VIP RewardsÂ </h3>
<p>The best Bitcoin roulette sites offer VIP and loyalty programs. The main premise here is that the player will be rewarded with additional perks like bonuses and free spins by meeting certain wagering milestones.Â </p>
<p>For example, the player might get a $10 free bet for every $1,000 wagered. This is why it is often wise to remain on one Bitcoin roulette site, as VIP rewards can be lucrative. VIP players often get a personalized account manager too.Â </p>

<h3>Types of Bitcoin Roulette GamesÂ </h3>
<p>In this section, we briefly discuss the main types of Bitcoin roulette games that top crypto casinos offer.Â </p>
<h3>American Roulette</h3>
<p>American roulette is the most popular variation in the US. There are two green zeros on the wheel which, when compared to European and French roulette, actually means that the casino has a higher house edge over the player.Â </p>
<h3>European Roulette</h3>
<p>European roulette has just one green zero, which means players have access to a more favorable deal in comparison to its American counterpart.Â </p>
<h3>French Roulette</h3>
<p>French roulette possesses the exact same wheel as the European version of this game.Â </p>
<p>However, the key difference is that if the wheel lands on zero, players will receive 50% of their stake back on even money bets (e.g. red/black).Â </p>
<p>This means that from an odds perspective, French roulette is the best version to play.Â </p>
<h3>Provably Fair Roulette</h3>
<p>Provably fair roulette generates gaming outcomes via smart contracts. A hash seed will be taken from both the player and the casino and subsequently converted into a random roulette outcome. Each individual spin can be verified for its fairness via the blockchain ledger.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95962/239124/screenshot-2022-11-25-at-11-12-43.jpg" alt="bc.game virtual roulette game" /></figure>
<p>Provably fair is, therefore, 100% guaranteed for its legitimacy. On the other hand, provably fair roulette games are often basic in nature, at least in terms of graphics and in-play bonus features.Â </p>
<h2>Live Bitcoin RouletteÂ </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The best Bitcoin roulette sites offer access to live casino dealers. In turn, players can replicate a real-world casino experience without needing to leave their home.Â </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how live Bitcoin roulette games work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bitcoin live roulette game will be provided by a leading gambling developer &#8211; such as Evolution</li>
<li>In this instance, Evolution will have an actual roulette wheel and croupier that will physically spin the wheel</li>
<li>There will be a high-definition camera that records the action in real-time which can subsequently be viewed by the player at the respective Bitcoin roulette siteÂ </li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of placing bets, this works in much the same way as a software roulette game. That is to say, the player will select their chip denomination on their screen and choose their preferred numbers.Â </p>
<p>Once all bets are placed, the live croupier will then spin the roulette wheel.Â </p>
<h2>Where to Buy Bitcoin for Online Roulette Â </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To ensure that players have access to an appropriate account balance when playing roulette online, it is wise to buy Bitcoin from a low-cost provider that is also heavily regulated.Â </p>
<p>This will ensure that players can top up their Bitcoin gambling roulette balance without paying extortionate fees or needing to worry about the safety of their funds.Â </p>
<p>Our research points to eToro as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">best crypto exchange</a> to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-the-united-states.htm">buy Bitcoin</a> &#8211; not only in terms of regulation and fees, but the broker also offers a convenient crypto wallet that can be used with roulette gambling sites.Â </p>
<h3>eToro &#8211; Overall Best Crypto Exchange for Low Fees and Safety to Invest in Bitcoin</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/">eToro </a>is an online brokerage platform that is now used by over 27 million clients. The platform offers access to Bitcoin and over 70 other cryptocurrencies, with the minimum investment stake just $10. Fees are fair and transparent at eToro, with Bitcoin trades costing just 1% per slide in addition to the bid/ask spread. Opening an account at eToro usually takes about five minutes from start to finish.Â </p>
<p>Deposits are processed instantly when using a credit/debit card or e-wallet and the minimum funding amount is $10. Unlike Coinbase and Bitstamp, which charge 3.99% and 5% on credit/debit card payments respectively, at eToro, there are no fees if the payment is made in US dollars. If the payment card is funded in another currency, the fee is just 0.5%.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/89427/224557/screenshot-2022-10-02-at-21-23-39.jpg" alt="etoro cryptocurrency offerings" /></figure>
<p>When it comes to safety and security, this is where eToro really stands out in this crowded marketplace. The broker holds regulatory licenses with the SEC (US), ASIC (Australia), CySEC (Cyprus), and the FCA (UK). This ensures that eToro follows strict guidelines on the protection of client deposits and Bitcoin balances.Â </p>
<p>Another benefit of using eToro for the purpose of buying Bitcoin is that the broker also offers a convenient crypto wallet that is regulated by the GFSC (Gibraltar). The eToro wallet &#8211; which is free to download via an app for Android and iOS, can be used to transfer Bitcoin to any crypto roulette site.

<h3>TG.Casino &#8211; Best Bitcoin Slots Site for Rewards</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino/">TG.Casino</a> is a newly launched crypto casino and is among our best best Bitcoin slots site because of its variety of ways to generate revenue on top of its huge library of games.Â The casino has partnered with some of the top providers in the casino space to offer thousands of popular slots including crash favorites like Aviator and Spaceman, mines games and Plinko variations.</p>
<p>New players can earn a matched first deposit welcome bonus of 200%, up to 10 ETH, while those who play with native token $TGC &#8211; when it launches &#8211; will earn 25% weekly cashback on losses. As well as its wide selection of slots, TG.Casino also has virtual and live dealers for poker, roulette, blackjack and other casino favorites, as well as a competitive sportsbook with pre-game and in-play wagering on top competitions such as the NBA, NFL and Premier League.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/89427/333984/tg-casino-1-mil.jpg" alt="TG Casino token presale slots" /></figure>
<p>TG.Casino, like Lucky Block and Mega Dice, is powered by Telegram which allows for anonymous, instant, and secure account creation, as well as anonymous crypto deposits and withdrawals &#8211; with no fees, no limits and a minimum amount of $1 (or equivalent). Exciting is building around its native $TGC token, which has already raised more than $1 million and could have a similar effect on the casino that $RLB did on Rollbit. That token pumped 600% to a $70 million market cap after announcing a buyback earlier this year.</p>
<p>$TGC could go a step further &#8211; as well as enabling cashback on losses, there will also be a token buyback with 60% of purchased tokens being distributed to holders as part of a profit-share and 40% being sent to a burn address to make the supply deflationary. Early investors can also stake their tokens and earn a current APY of 450%, with $TGC available for $0.125 each.</p>

<h2>How to Pick the Best Bitcoin Slots Site for YouÂ </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Finding the best Bitcoin slots site can be an overwhelming process, especially when there are dozens of providers competing with each other.Â Below, we discuss a variety of factors that will help readers pick the right bitcoin slots casino to match their requirements.Â </p>
<h3>Safe and Secure Payment MethodsÂ </h3>
<p>Needless to say, it is important to ensure that the chosen casino has secure methods in place to handle payments. With crypto casinos, players&#8217; funds are held on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm"><u>blockchain</u></a>.Â However, if the casino is processing crypto payments via third-party platforms, be sure to check the credibility of the provider.Â </p>
<h3>Licensing and Regulation</h3>
<p>The best crypto casinos will have licenses and be regulated by gaming commissions from around the world, offering a high level of trust to players &#8211; those casinos also usually use games provided by developers that are also licensed and offer provably fair games. Casino sites without any form of regulation should generally be avoided given the number of sites that are licensed.</p>
<h3>Speed of Withdrawals</h3>
<p>When compared to traditional casinos, crypto gambling sites process deposits and withdrawals much more efficiently.Â For example, traditional online casinos will have to process the player&#8217;s withdrawal request before they release funds.</p>
<p>This is often after a lengthy KYC process. As such, it can take many days to receive the funds.Â In comparison, Bitcoin slot sites will often automate the withdrawal process, meaning that the tokens should appear in the player&#8217;s wallet in under 20 minutes.Â </p>
<h3>Slots Promotions &amp; Bonuses</h3>
<p>Of course, rewards are a huge attraction of Bitcoin casinos. As such, players should also take into account which platforms offer the<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casino-bonuses.htm"> <u>best Bitcoin casino bonuses</u></a> for slot games.Â For instance, some crypto casinos such as <a href="https://tracker-pm2.fortunejackpartners.com/link?btag=3667766_185789-b2c">FortuneJack</a> offer free spins as a bonus, which can make this platform more appealing for slot players.Â </p>
<p>On the other hand, for those who prefer welcome bonuses in the form of cash or crypto deposits, the likes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/">BC.Game</a> or <a href="https://www.cloudbet.com/en/landing/bitcoin-bonus/?af_token=ae4254b0cbbf0760d3442112d77a6748&amp;aftm_source=b2c">Cloudbet</a> are the better option.Â That being said, the best Bitcoin slots sites will regularly launch new promotions from time to time.Â </p>
<h3>Minimum DepositsÂ </h3>
<p>Players should also make sure that when researching Bitcoin slots casinos, they check the required minimum deposit.Â The majority of the sites we reviewed above let players get started with just $20 as an initial deposit.Â That being said, sometimes, players might have to meet higher requirements in order to unlock specific bitcoin slots free welcome bonuses.Â Â </p>
<h3>Supported Slots Games</h3>
<p>Players should also check out the variety of slots games available before choosing a platform. Some players might prefer a large library of games, while others might choose to stick with classic titles they know well. Players should also look for games that have been developed by reputable firms, as they offer provably fair results and higher Return To Player (RTP) percentages.</p>
<h3>Live Slots Betting</h3>
<p>Some might also prefer to play live slots rather than video games. In this case, make sure to choose the<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm"> <u>best Bitcoin gambling sites</u></a> that feature a live dealer games.Â From our list, <a href="https://go.thunder.partners/visit/?bta=35427&amp;nci=5502&amp;campaign=WELCOME">Thunderpick</a> and <a href="https://record.blizzaffiliates.io/_xQc_kVkGHTJHH6eEtUVc2GNd7ZgqdRLk/7/">Blizz </a>are two online casinos that support live slots games.Â </p>
<h3>Fiat vs Bitcoin Slots</h3>
<p>The main advantage of using BTC slots over fiat currency slot machines is that the games offer increased anonymity as they are built on decentralized casino sites that do not often require Know Your Customer verification to create an account and play. Using crypto can also increase the speed which players can deposit and withdraw funds, with crypto payments processed instantly and some tokens paying out in seconds. Crypto casinos often have much larger and more elaborate bonuses and promotions than traditional fiat casinos, as they seek to entice players into the new space.</p>
<h2>How did we Rank the Best Bitcoin Slots Sites?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We ranked the Bitcoin slots casinos based on a wide variety of criteria &#8211; many of which are listed above. Game selection is one of the first ports of call but is less about the number of games offered than the game developers used.Â </p>
<p>The best crypto casinos offer Bitcoin slot machines that come from highly trusted and respected developers that are often individually regulated across the world and provide provably fair games with high RTPs. However, after finding casinos with a good selection of BTC slots we then researched further into each site.</p>
<p>Player safety and security are paramount due to the number of bad actors in the space, so those sites that are regulated and licensed were heavily favored over those without. That included the ease and speed at which players can deposit and withdraw funds, the number of payment methods available, and if there were any fees or limits on transferring funds.</p>
<p>We also looked at the overall user experience, not just including the general layout and ease of using a particular site, but more the ease of creating an account and its anonymity &#8211; which is often a crucial part of players deciding to play with a crypto casino over a traditional one. This also included testing and verifying the customer services offered, with more weight placed on the sites that responded quickly and offered multiple methods of communication.</p>
<p>Our review then heavily considered the bonuses and promotions available on the Bitcoin slots sites. While most sites make huge claims and offer enormous percentages, the fine print can often reveal the offers are too good to be true and require huge wagering &#8211; sometimes as much as 80x &#8211; to secure the promised funds.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at if the crypto casino offered any other unique features that could mark it out over rival sites, with many offering similar experiences. For example, our top choice Mega Dice was the first crypto casino to offer functionality with Telegram &#8211; allowing players to instantly sign up and play via the app &#8211; while TG.Casino is offering a native token that comes with staking rewards, and a profit-sharing system.</p>
<h2>Types of Bitcoin Slots</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin slot machine games come in all shapes and sizes. There are tens of thousands of games on the market with various themes, difficulty, prizes, and playing methods, which can include Bitcoin jackpot slots and Bitcoin video slots, as well as classic slots, progressive, or multi-line.</p>
<p>However, whatever their window dressing, all Bitcoin slot machines are games of chance that do not require any skill to play or win. Unlike other crypto casino games, those playing BTC slots cannot employ strategies to use to their advantage.</p>
<h2>What are the Best Bitcoin Slot Games?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-slots-sites.htm">best crypto slots site</a> providers offer a universe of creative themes, complete with a high-quality immersive experience, while some also offer free Bitcoin slots. However, there is a huge selection of slot games out there, which can make it confusing to know which one to play. Below, we have listed some of the best games that are trending among slot players right now.Â </p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/89427/224545/screenshot-2022-10-02-at-17-52-31.jpg" alt="Grand Luxe slot game bitcoin slot machine" /></p>

Nevertheless, the gameplay is still enjoyable, especially for those who seek simplicity.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/89427/224556/screenshot-2022-10-02-at-21-04-32.jpg" alt="Classic Fruits slot game" /></figure>
<h2>Bitcoin Slots Bonuses &amp; No Deposit Free Spins</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Since crypto transactions do not involve middlemen such as banks, they are less costly to process.Â For this reason, online casinos that accept cryptocurrencies offer their clients huge bonuses.Â Below, we have included a list of popular bonuses offered by the best Bitcoin casino sites.Â </p>
<h3>Matched Deposit Bonuses</h3>
<p>Matched deposit bonuses are exactly as they sound. With this bonus, the player will receive an offer from the casino that matches the amount they deposit &#8211; up to a certain percentage.Â </p>
<p>So, for instance, suppose a casino offers a 100% matched deposit bonus, and the player adds $100. After claiming the bonus, the player will begin with $200 in their casino balance. The best Bitcoin slots sites will often offer a matched bonus of up to 200% or even 300%.Â Â </p>
<h3>Free Spins</h3>
<p>Bitcoin slots free spins are perhaps the most useful bonus for players. These spins can be used for slot games directly &#8211; meaning, players won&#8217;t have to risk their money in order to place a bet. Some sites even offer free crypto slots, where players can spin a reel for a prize without depositing funds.</p>
<h3>No Deposit Bonuses</h3>
<p>In rarer cases, casinos reward players simply for signing up and verifying their account. The no-deposit bonus could come in the form of an amount added to the account balance or as free spins.Â From our list, FortuneJack lets users play Bitcoin slots with no deposit. It does this by offering free spins as a welcome bonus.Â </p>
<h3>VIP Rewards</h3>
<p>The best crypto gambling sites have also set up loyalty programs to reward their regular players. The VIP rewards are offered based on the time spent by each player on the casino site, as well as the amount they wager.Â Almost all the Bitcoin slots sites discussed today offer some kind of loyalty bonus, which encourages players to return to the casino.</p>
<p>While there are many bonuses available, some players may have to enter a promotional code to access them. Below, we have listed the bitcoin slots bonus code should they need them.</p>

<h2>Why Play Bitcoin Slots?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Online casinos have accepted traditional fiat currencies for a long time. However, using cryptocurrencies as a payment method offers many distinct advantages &#8211; which we cover below.Â </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security</strong> &#8211; As outlined above, the most significant benefit of gambling with cryptocurrencies is that the player&#8217;s funds will always be held on the blockchain, making them more secure. Most crypto casinos are also anonymous so players can play without needing to dispel any personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Increased bonuses</strong> &#8211; Since crypto transactions are cost-effective, Bitcoin casinos can offer substantial bonuses, especially as it is a growing area with casinos keen to entice players away from traditional casinos.</li>
<li><strong>Instantaneous transactions</strong> &#8211; Crypto transactions are also processed near-instantly, which allows players to get started with Bitcoin gambling sites easily &#8211; without having to wait days for the funds to arrive.Â </li>
<li><strong>Decentralization</strong> &#8211; When using fiat currencies to gamble online, each transaction is routed via a central authority. On the other hand, crypto gambling sites eliminate the involvement of a third party &#8211; making it quicker and more efficient than conventional payment methods.Â As is clear, there are numerous advantages that make online Bitcoin casinos an attractive choice for players.Â </li>
</ul>
<h2>Are Bitcoin Slot Sites Safe &amp; Legal?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The legality of bitcoin slots sites primarily depends on the location of the player. While some countries have no regulations concerning online gambling sites, others have strict policies.Â For instance, in the US, online gambling sites are not legal in all states. As such, players might have limited access to online casino slots. However, at the same time, there are no specific laws that regulate crypto gambling. It is neither permitted nor prohibited officially.Â </p>
<p>On the other hand, in European countries such as Germany, Finland, Estonia, and Denmark, internet gambling with crypto is allowed &#8211; as long as the provider holds a license from the local regulator.Â In other words, players should check the regulations imposed by their country when looking to play crypto slots online.Â Â </p>
<h3>Are Bitcoin Slot Websites Available in All Regions?</h3>
<p>The simple answer is no, many crypto casinos are not allowed to operate in certain regions and nations because they will not be regulated and licensed in those countries. In the US, for example, the crypto space is under huge scrutiny and lawmakers have crypto companies and exchanges firmly in their sites.Â </p>
<p>Some casinos, therefore, choose to base their operations away from the US, where there is less scrutiny. Doing that does not always mean these sites are untrustworthy &#8211; they will just be regulated elsewhere. Most players can access crypto casinos by utilizing a VPN.</p>
<h2>Mobile Bitcoin Slots Apps</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Slot players might also be looking for Bitcoin casinos that can be accessed via their smartphone. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of slot games, many Bitcoin casino sites do not have their own mobile apps.Â The exception here is BC.Game which offers casino games via its app for iOS and Android. Nonetheless, all of the best bitcoin slots sites discussed on this page come with a responsive design.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/89427/224562/screenshot-2022-10-02-at-21-38-28.jpg" alt="Cloudbet crypto welcome bonus slots machine" /></figure>
<p>Meaning, the slot website can easily be accessed via a smartphone, using an internet browser &#8211; instead of an app.Â As slot games can adapt to smaller screens, the user experience is seamless, even via a mobile web browser.Â </p>
<h2>Free Bitcoin Slots SitesÂ </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>It can be challenging to find a casino that lets users play free Bitcoin slots. After all, casinos are online businesses in the game of making money.Â However, there are a couple of ways around this.Â For instance, players can look for casinos that feature a crypto slots no deposit bonus. Alternatively, there are also Bitcoin casinos that offer free spins as bonuses.Â With both options, players can try their luck with slots without having to risk their own money.Â </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This guide has discussed the numerous advantages of using Bitcoin casinos for the purpose of playing slots.Â The best Bitcoin casinos offer a high degree of anonymity, facilitate swift transactions, and offer a wide range of games.Â Although there are many online casino sites to choose from, we recommend Mega Dice as the top platform.</p>
<p>Players can access a range of slots along with other games such as sports betting, live casino tables and Poker.Â With a minimum deposit of just $1, players can begin accessing the Mega Dice casino, playing slots, casino games, or betting with the sportsbook. Mega Dice offers a 200% initial bonus to new players as well as a wide variety of cryptocurrency payment options.Â </p>

This new ERC-20 token is created to celebrate the expected arrival of Bitcoin Spot ETFs. While this project is not associated directly with any spot ETFs, it will burn 5% of its token supply upon reaching different Bitcoin-based milestones.Â </p>
<p>Since the presale started, Bitcoin ETF Token has raised more than $1.8 million in just three weeks.Â </p>

<p>A Bitcoin spot ETF (Exchange Trade Fund) allows investors to gain exposure to BTC, without directly purchasing the asset. With many global investment companies pushing for a Bitcoin spot ETF, a release may be around the corner.Â </p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token will be burning 5% of its token supply upon reaching five different milestones. For instance, a token burn will take place after $BTCETF crosses a $100 million market cap. Other milestones include the official confirmation of a Bitcoin spot ETF, the release of the first ETF, and BTC crossing the $100k mark.Â </p>
<p>Moreover, this deflationary cryptocurrency will charge a 5% tax on trading the token. The tax will drop by 1%, upon reaching each of the milestones. In the long term, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 25% of its total supply.Â </p>
<p>$BTCETF token holders can also access high staking yields by locking the tokens on a verified smart contract. At press time, you can earn over 140% annual staking yields with $BTCETF.</p>

<p>From a 2.1 billion token supply, 840 million tokens are being allocated across ten stages. By the final round, $BTCETF will be priced at $0.0068 per token.</p>
<p>Thus, the deflationary burning mechanism and the huge staking yields can make Bitcoin ETF Token one of the best cryptos in the coming years.

<h3>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Best Stake-to-Mine CryptoÂ </h3>
<p>Our next pick for the best cryptocurrency is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX). This is a stake-to-mine cryptocurrency that is reducing the entry barrier for cloud mining activities &#8211; over $4.5 million has been raised in the presale, which is also offering a staking APY of 130% and is our overall <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presale</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix will tokenize cloud mining through its ecosystem. By holding $BTCMTX, the native cryptocurrency, token holders can stake their assets and generate passive income. Bitcoin Minetrix will leverage cloud mining companies&#8217; equipment, saving costs for individual miners.Â </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1319" height="640" class="aligncenter wp-image-133412" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png 1319w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1024x497.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-768x373.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1319px) 100vw, 1319px" /></p>
<p>As your tokens are staked on the ecosystem, Bitcoin Minetrix will offer you cloud mining credits. These will be non-tradable ERC-20 tokens, which can be burnt on the ecosystem in exchange for Bitcoin cloud mining power. Once your credits are burnt, you receive an allocated cloud mining time through which you can collect a percentage of the mining revenue.Â </p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix came up with this solution due to the dubious scams that are prevalent among other third-party cloud mining companies. By giving autonomy via the $BTCMTX credits, users will easily be able to generate cloud mining credits.Â </p>
<p>This <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> platform has just started the token presale for $BTCMTX. From a total supply of 4 billion, 70% of the tokens have been allocated equally across twenty presale rounds. At the time of writing, $BTCMTX is priced at just $0.0119 during the ongoing presale round.Â </p>

<p>The price will hike to $0.0148 by the 39th and final presale stage.Â </p>

<h3>3. Meme Kombat ($MK) &#8211; Best Play-to-Earn CryptoÂ </h3>
<p>The next crypto on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK) which offers staking and is a top play-to-earn crypto game. This exciting new blockchain meme coin project leverages AI and stake-to-earn (S2E) mechanics with decentralized gaming offering degens a meme token with genuine utility.Â </p>
<p>With just a few weeks since its launch, the Meme Kombat presale has already raised over $2m highlighting its upside potential and popularity amongst degens and the wider crypto market.Â Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/331100/meme-kombat-homepage.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat play to earn presale" /></figure>
<p>Meme Kombatâs platform facilitates outcome-based wagers, crypto staking, and Web3-based meme gaming. This trio of hot crypto trends helps Meme Kombat enter the scene as an innovative crypto project merging meme culture with staking and wagering games.Â </p>
<p>As well as earning an income from staking &#8211; which currently sits at 512% APY &#8211; users will have the opportunity to bet with $MK tokens on the results of battles between 11 meme characters within the Meme Kombat battle arena.Â </p>
<p>Meme Kombat introduces an innovative gaming sisystem that pivots on its native token, $MK. The main premise: to simplify staking and wagering while simultaneously offering enticing rewards. Winners not only receive $MK tokens but also stand a chance to win valuable prizes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/331101/mk-site.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat Staking During Presale" /></figure>
<p>A unique staking system sits at the heart of this gaming ecosystem. Early-bird enthusiasts can purchase $MK tokens for a discounted price of $0.214 and begin earning up to 415% through the staking mechanism. However, the income earned is based on both the staking duration and the level of engagement on the platform.</p>
<p>Throughout the presale, staking is automatic for all degen buyers, with rewards accumulating over time. After the presale ends, participants can re-stake their tokens via the claim page. It&#8217;s important to note that removing tokens from staking post-presale results in forfeiting rewards, which compound daily.</p>
<p>How do Meme Kombatâs tokenomics work? With 50% of the total token supply allocated to the presale, 30% for staking and battler rewards, 10% for community rewards, and 10% for decentralized exchange liquidity, Meme Kombat offers a comprehensive meme, staking and wagering ecosystem that works.Â </p>

<h3>6. eTukTuk &#8211; Best Eco-Friendly Crypto to Buy</h3>
<p>One of the top cryptocurrencies to buy right now is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk (TUK)</a>. This is the worldâs first automotive project powered on the Binance Smart Chain and by leveraging blockchain technology.</p>
<p>eTukTuk aims to offer energy-efficient EV charging stations to TukTuk drivers in the developing world. The presale has now raised more than $265k, while those who lock their tokens into the staking pool can earn up to 750% APYs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315136/etuktuk-staking.jpg" alt="eTukTuk power staking" /></figure>
<p>Since the BSC charges low costs per transaction and is a highly scalable network, eTukTuk will be able to expand the platform across the world. TukTuk drivers can make the change from using Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) TukTuks to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs).Â </p>
<p>Not only do these vehicles reduce air pollution, but they will also result in lesser energy consumption. With the past exploitation of non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels, ICEs are slowly becoming obsolete. Thus, TukTuk drivers are already looking to switch to electric vehicles.Â </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf">eTukTuk whitepaper</a>, the platform will help TukTuk drivers save 75% by using efficient charging means. Firstly, eTukTuk will set up electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSEs), where ZEVs can be charged.Â </p>
<p>The EVSEs will be set up in multiple locations, primarily in developing countries. Each EVSE will be set up with the help of a territory partner, who will be responsible for operating and installing the equipment. Once drivers start paying on the eTukTuk driver app, the partners will receive a cut of every transaction.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315137/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk EV Crypto Project" /></figure>
<p>One of the best cryptos, $TUK, can also be staked to earn APY (Annual Percentage Yield) on the ecosystem. Furthermore, staked token holders will receive inflationary rewards from a staking pool for the next 15 years.Â </p>
<p>The $TUK presale has just launched with 12.5% of the total 2 billion token supply allocated for the presale. Join the <a href="https://t.me/etuktuk">eTukTuk Telegram channel</a> for more information on this cryptocurrency project.Â </p>

<h3>7. Green Bitcoin â Best Gamified Price Prediction Crypto to Buy</h3>
<p>Next on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin</a>, a new token presale aiming to raise funds and develop a Bitcoin price prediction reward system. All you need is $GBTC tokens to stake, and then predict Bitcoin&#8217;s price. If you&#8217;re accurate, you&#8217;ll be rewarded.</p>
<p>However, the game isn&#8217;t live yet but you can buy $GBTC tokens in a presale at a discounted price. Once the token is listed on major exchanges, the price could potentially go up. Moreover, the token presale is divided into multiple stages and the token price goes up with each stage even during the presale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-139682 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-768x434.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-150x85.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You need ETH, USDT or a card to buy the $GBTC token in the presale. Withdrawal of your tokens will be enabled once the presale ends. While you wait, stake your tokens and earn more $GBTC as a reward. There&#8217;s a 700% APR as of this writing, which will drop as more tokens are staked. This means if you&#8217;re planning to participate in the presale anyway, it&#8217;s best to do it early due to the lower token price and higher staking APR.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.greenbitcoin.xyz/whitepaper.pdf">Green Bitcoin&#8217;s whitepaper</a>, there are 21 million tokens in total with 40% dedicated to the presale and 27.5% to the staking rewards. This means more than half of the supply will go to early supporters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="464" class="alignnone wp-image-139318 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin tokenomics" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-300x155.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-768x396.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>There are four phases in the project&#8217;s development. First phase is the presale launch, second phase is the token listing on exchanges after the presale ends. The third phase implements the Bitcoin price prediction reward system where the fun begins.</p>

<h3>9. Launchpad XYZ â Best Gateway to Web3</h3>
<p>Launchpad XYZ is a brand-new Ethereum-based platform that aims to streamline the transition of the next 10 million users to the world of Web3 technologies. To do this, Launchpad XYZ will offer various tools and features to create an &#8216;all-in-one&#8217; ecosystem that touches on all aspects of Web3 â a setup that has yet to be completed in the crypto market.Â </p>
<p>Within the Launchpad XYZ platform, users can access a decentralized exchange (DEX), trading terminal, presale marketplace, metaverse experience library, play-to-earn (P2E) game hub, and much more. Launchpad XYZ will also offer several features that have yet to be widely adopted by the crypto community, such as an NFT DEX and a fractionalized assets marketplace.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/272445/launchpad-web3.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ Crypto Project" /></figure>
<p>One of the main features is the alpha Telegram channel, which offers signals and recently made a 7,000% call on LINQ. Underpinning all of these features is LPX â Launchpad XYZ native ERC-20 token. As per the projectâs <a href="https://whitepaper.launchpad.xyz/">whitepaper</a>, LPX will be used to pay fees and list assets on Launchpad XYZ numerous exchanges, although investors can also stake tokens to receive unique benefits.Â </p>
<p>These benefits include early access to presale cryptos and discounts on trading fees. Since Launchpad XYZ is entirely decentralized, the platform never has control over each userâs digital assets. Moreover, Launchpad XYZ will also feature expert insights and educational materials showcasing how users can make money through new and exciting Web3 technologies.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/271597/launchpad-2.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ Platform Features" /></figure>
<p>However, as a presale cryptocurrency, Launchpad XYZ is naturally considered riskier than more established coins since there&#8217;s no price history to look back on. However, even though presale cryptos have clear risks attached, they can sometimes provide significant returns â such as in the case of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lucky-block/">Lucky Block</a>.</p>
<p>Those looking to participate in the presale, which has raised $2 million, can <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-launchpad.htm">buy Launchpad XYZ tokens</a> for $0.0445 â 50% lower than the project&#8217;s intended listing price. Notably, the LPX price will increase between stages, rewarding those who get involved the earliest.

<h3>11. Doge Star &#8211; Community-Centered Galactic Metaverse With Doge Theme, Integrated NFT Marketplace, And 69% Token Burn</h3>
<p><a href="https://dogestar.net/index.html">Doge Star</a> is an ERC20 meme ecosystem with a stellar theme. This is a Doge-inspired token with the wisdom of the stars,Â  as a shining beacon in the wider crypto universe. It claims to be more than just a token or even a community, but a universe unto itself.Â </p>
<p>The vision of Doge Star is to integrate NFTs into an inclusive Metaverse, where each collectible can be sent from planet to planet. The Doge Star Metaverse serves two purposes &#8211; to entertain players and to provide a means of ROI. Every NFT is meant to have real-world value.Â </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="442" class="alignnone wp-image-133096 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241642-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-16-52-15.png" alt="Doge Star token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241642-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-16-52-15.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241642-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-16-52-15-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241642-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-16-52-15-768x377.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241642-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-16-52-15-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241642-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-16-52-15-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241642-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-16-52-15-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>At the core of Doge Star is the NFT Marketplace, referred to as the âGalactic Bazaarâ. Each individual NFT is a blockchain-certified collectible to ensure correct ownership. So not only is each NFT interoperable within a broader universe, it is certified and immutable for individual ownership.Â </p>
<p>Players have the opportunity to take part in DAO governance and to customize characters, ships, and bases. In-game achievements can be monetized for increased ROI.Â </p>
<p>There is a gigantic 1 quadrillion $DOGESTAR tokens in total. 69% is allocated to a burn pool, 10% to the presale, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to CEX liquidity. 69% is an extremely large token burn, a strategy to encourage price appreciation. The final 1% is for marketing purposes.Â </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="337" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133099" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241651-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-17-19-35.png" alt="Doge Star Crypto Team" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241651-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-17-19-35.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241651-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-17-19-35-300x112.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700241651-screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-17-19-35-768x288.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Currently, in stage 6, the presale has raised over $800k and is priced at $0.00000032. The exchange listing price is substantially higher, at $0.0000006. The combination of a 69% token burn, a definitive presale price increase, and a Doge-inspired theme could yield impressive ROI rewards, if market conditions are appropriate.Â Â </p>
<p>Doge Star has been <a href="https://dogestar.net/DOGESTAR_AUDIT.pdf">smart contract audited</a> for additional transparency.

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/pikamoon">Pikamoon</a> is a P2E metaverse with a significant community focus. The team behind Pikamoon studied many other P2E projects and took the winning elements, including player incentivization, community focus, and engaging gameplay.Â </p>

<p>Travelers within the Pikaverse engage in combat with other travelers, instructing their Pikamoon to attack. They can also swap, talk, flee, check-in, or use an item. The battle system can get very complex with defensive and offensive maneuvers, and the team has clearly put a lot of thought into battle mechanics to make it engaging for players.</p>

<h3>13. Bitcoin &#8211; Best to Buy for Long-Term Investors</h3>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is the leading crypto asset of choice, with the largest presence and market capitalization in this space. Bitcoin went on a prolonged bull run in 2021, which halted in November of the same year when the digital asset surpassed $69,000.Â </p>
<p>This is unprecedented when one considers that you could <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/should-i-buy-bitcoin.htm">buy Bitcoin</a> for just a small fraction of a dollar when it was first launched in 2009. In other words, in just over 12 years of trading, Bitcoin achieved gains in the millions of percentage points.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/275542/bitcoin111.jpg" alt="bitcoin coin" /></figure>
<p>Nonetheless, Bitcoin has since entered a bear market and subsequently dragged the rest of the industry down with it &#8211; in just 12 months between November 2021 and November 2022, BTC lost more than 75% of its peak value, dropping below $17k in late 2022.</p>
<p>However, 2023 has seen the price of Bitcoin making an excellent recovery from those lows and, at the time of writing, BTC is priced at $36,000 &#8211; 120% up from January 1. Much of its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-added-dtcc-file-aug-dtcc-spokesperson-2023-10-24/">price action has been driven by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity</a> &#8211; major financial management firms with trillions of dollars of assets under management &#8211; applying for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p>Experts believe the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/13/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-is-approaching-experts-say-what-to-know.html">US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve their applications soon</a>, which could be the catalyst for another bull run in 2024 &#8211; along with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52628034">pending Bitcoin halving</a>, which is expected in April 2024.</p>
<p>Despite the increased price in the last year, Bitcoin remains attractive to investors as it can still be purchased at 50% below its all-time high. According to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price predictions</a>, some analysts forecast that the price of BTC could hit $100,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Consequently, if BTC does return to its ATH in 2025, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-much-to-invest-in-bitcoin.htm">how much should you invest in Bitcoin</a> to maximize any potential profits? Â Another thing to remember about Bitcoin is that many platforms now offer yield services on the digital asset. This means that while investors wait out the bear market, they can generate a passive income on their Bitcoin holdings.Â As such, some investors are also asking <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-buy-bitcoin.htm">is it too late to buy Bitcoin</a>? Â </p>
<p>In terms of the upside potential, this remains to be seen. Some Bitcoin proponents see no limit to the value of the de-facto digital asset, with medium-term objectives of $100,000 per token. In the shorter term, a return to the $69,000 level would require an upside move of over 150%.Â When it comes to buying BTC we found that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm">best crypto app</a> in 2023 is the Binance crypto app.Â </p>

<h3>14. Ethereum &#8211; Best Crypto for Decentralized Apps</h3>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> also stands out as one of the best crypto to invest in 2023. The worldâs second-largest crypto project by market capitalization is the leading smart contract blockchain &#8211; there are thousands of ERC-20 tokens built on top of Ethereum, which highlights its legitimacy.Â </p>
<p>Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, when ERC-20 tokens are sent and received, transaction fees must be paid in ETH. This means that ETH has real-world utility, and thus &#8211; demand from the broader markets remains strong. With the ETH Merge now completed, some market analysts consider this crypto to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/greenest-cryptocurrency.htm">greenest cryptos</a> on the market in 2023.Â </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1280" height="853" class="aligncenter wp-image-127697 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699304472-ethereum-6286124_1280.jpg" alt="ethereum coin" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699304472-ethereum-6286124_1280.jpg 1280w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699304472-ethereum-6286124_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699304472-ethereum-6286124_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699304472-ethereum-6286124_1280-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Another thing to note when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-invest-in-ethereum.htm">investing in Ethereum</a> is that it&#8217;s the de-facto blockchain of choice for metaverse projects. Whether thatâs Enjin, Decentraland, or the Sandbox &#8211; leading metaverse worlds operate on top of Ethereum. During the 2021 crypto bull run, the Ethereum price reached highs of over $4,900.</p>
<p>As of writing, the same crypto asset is trading at around $2,00. For a return to its prior high at current pricing levels, that would mean an upside of over 145%. The price of ETH has also been pumping in recent weeks because, like with Bitcoin, major investment firms such as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-plans-ethereum-trust-fuel-speculation-about-etf-filing-2023-11-09/">Fidelity have also applied to open spot Ethereum ETFs</a>.</p>

<h3>15. BNB &#8211; Best for Binance Customers</h3>
<p>Looking at the value of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/">Binance Coin</a> at the time of writing, this could also be one of the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2023. This digital asset is the native token of the Binance ecosystem, which is the largest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm">P2P crypto exchange</a> globally for trading volume and offers reduced trading fees and other loyalty rewards.</p>
<p>BNB was created in 2017 and its initial use case was to offer discounted trading fees for users of its exchange. Binance has since gone on to create a multitude of additional products and services, many of which offer BNB further use cases.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/275545/bnb-coin.jpg" alt="BNB Crypto Trading Fees" /></figure>
<p>For example, the Binance Smart Chain &#8211; which aims to compete with legacy blockchain networks, typically requires listed projects to pair against BNB. Moreover, transaction fees on the Binance Smart Chain are paid in BNB.Â Just like ETH on the Ethereum blockchain, this ensures that BNB has real-world value and remains in constant demand. Compared to its prior all-time high of $669, BNB is trading at a discount of 57% for those investing at prices as of writing.Â Â </p>
<p>Those investing in BNB should be aware that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aa636b3f-a4b6-4cda-afbf-72ca44c198a4">Binance has been subject to clampdowns across the world</a>, including in major markets such as the US and UK, as regulators seek to avoid another FTX-scale disaster.</p>

<h3>16. XRP &#8211; Best for Cross-Border PaymentsÂ </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp.htm">XRP</a> was launched in 2012, which makes it an established crypto asset that has gone through several bear markets. This is the native token of the Ripple network &#8211; which enables banks to transfer funds across cross-borders.Â </p>
<p>In comparison to legacy payment systems like SWIFT, Ripple offers fast, cheap, and scalable transactions. This is the case irrespective of where the sender or receiver is based. Moreover, the rapid performance of Ripple also remains solid when competing currencies are used.Â Â </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="703" height="493" class="aligncenter wp-image-121172 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698333058-xrp-chart.png" alt="XRP Crypto Chart" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698333058-xrp-chart.png 703w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698333058-xrp-chart-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /></p>
<p>Typically, when banks use the Ripple network to transact, the transfer takes 4-5 seconds. Fees amount to a very small fraction of a cent, and Ripple can handle up to 1,500 transactions each and every second.Â </p>
<p>XRP was up as much as 120% in October from its January prices after a series of minor court victories swayed investors into believing Ripple was about to win their two-year court case &#8211; however, that <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xrp-news%3A-uncertainty-prevails-as-sec-gears-up-for-potential-appeal">momentum has slowed amid uncertainty and a potential appeal from the SEC</a>.</p>

<h3>17. Dogecoin &#8211; Most Popular Meme CoinÂ </h3>
<p>Next up on our list of the best crypto to buy now is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>. Although it wasnât until 2021 that Dogecoin came alive &#8211; at least in terms of its pricing action, this digital currency was launched way back in 2013. But is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-dogecoin.htm">it too late to buy Dogecoin today</a>?</p>
<p>The project was launched as a joke, to highlight the ease in which crypto assets could be sold to the general public, but still remains one of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">the best meme coins</a> around. This joke-like tag remained until early 2021, which was when Dogecoin caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and pumped to incredible highs in just a few short weeks.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/275549/kanchanara-r9dg85a7e-u-un.jpg" alt="Dogecoin coin " /></figure>
<p>Across many Tweets and public appearances, Musk reiterated that he was a Dogecoin believer, with DOGE peaking at $0.71 &#8211; marking a 700,000% jump in just three months. Tesla &#8211; among other companies &#8211; now accepts Dogecoin as a payment method and many believe Musk will eventually add it as a payment/tipping service on X (Twitter).</p>
<p>DOGE has suffered through the bear market, while <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/elon-musk-is-accused-insider-trading-by-investors-dogecoin-lawsuit-2023-06-01/">Musk was accused of insider trading and sued for over $200 billion in a class-action lawsuit</a>. The token remains at a relatively low price &#8211; 90% down from its peak price &#8211; but its instant name recognition could see it pump in a true bull market.</p>

<h3>18. Uniswap &#8211; Best for Decentralization</h3>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/">Uniswap</a> is a popular decentralized exchange that operates on top of the Ethereum network, meaning that traders can buy and sell crypto assets without a third party. Its native token UNI was one of the best cryptos to buy in 2021.</p>
<p>Instead, users can simply connect their crypto wallet to Uniswap and begin trading. Therefore, no account needs to be opened, nor does the user need to provide any KYC documents. The Uniswap exchange has revolutionized how trading orders are facilitated.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/272957/uniswap.jpg" alt="Uniswap Protocol App" /></figure>
<p>Instead of using order books, Uniswap utilizes an AMM (automated market maker) system. This means that a user can trade tokens without needing a seller. Uniswap achieves this through liquidity pools.Â Those that wish to add liquidity to a Uniswap pool will earn interest. This offers a passive way to generate income on idle crypto tokens. Uniswap also offers other DeFi (decentralized finance) services, and more products are in the pipeline.Â Â Â </p>

<h3>19. Shiba Inu &#8211; Popular Alternate Meme CoinÂ </h3>
<p>Ever wondered if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-shiba-inu-a-good-investment.htm">Shiba Inu is a good investment</a> right now? Although Dogecoin is the original meme coin to enter this market, it now has a lot of competition. In this regard, Shiba Inu is perhaps the best cryptocurrency to buy now for those that wish to add a collection of alternative meme coins to their portfolio.Â </p>
<p>The Shiba Inu story is nothing short of impressive. Although the project was only launched in April 2020, it has already become a large-cap crypto asset. Not only that, but early investors have since witnessed gains of several million percentage points.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/272958/shib-coin.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu the Metaverse" /></figure>
<p>Crucially, Shiba Inu aims to become more than just a meme coin. For instance, the project has since built its own native layer-2 blockchain network &#8211; Shibarium &#8211; metaverse world, decentralized exchange, NFT collection, and selection of games.</p>
<p>SoÂ <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-shiba-inu.htm">is it too late to buy SHIB</a> for 2023? The token is also way down from its all-time high but, like DOGE, has the name recognition to potentially secure good returns in a bull market.</p>

<h2>How We Rated the Best Cryptos to Buy Now</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To curate this list of the best cryptos to buy now we looked at various factors including historical performance, potential for growth and long-term potential, current price, utility, and security. For new projects currently on presale we also analyzed their teams, whitepaper, tokenomics, and roadmap to ensure they are legitimate projects that offer no risk of being a scam.</p>
<p>Our top picks tend to be presale and low market cap projects as they often offer much more potential for a return on investment (ROI) compared to longer-established projects, although investors should understand they can come with increased risk.Â </p>
<p>Bitcoin, for example, is the largest cryptocurrency and considered by many to be the &#8216;safest&#8217; investment &#8211; although investors are still at risk of losing funds. To make a significant gain when investing in BTC, billions of dollars elsewhere would need to be invested, making the potential to return large sums much more limited.</p>
<p>Some crypto presales offer immediate upside, as they offer staged price increases, which means those who enter early can see returns as soon as the tokens are listed on an exchange. However, we would always recommend having a <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/mutual-funds/diversification">diverse investment portfolio that contains both riskier and safer investments</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Find the Best Cryptos to Buy</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Still wondering if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-cryptocurrency-a-good-investment.htm" rel="nofollow">cryptocurrency is a good investment</a> in 2023? In this section, we will explain some of the methods that investors can utilize when searching for the best crypto to buy now for their portfolio.Â </p>
<h3>Long-Term PotentialÂ </h3>
<p>First, it is wise to consider what is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long-term</a> potential of the crypto project. For example, <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/is-bitcoin-a-store-of-value">Bitcoin will likely remain a &#8216;store of value&#8217;</a> for most, while Ethereum operates as the de-facto smart contract blockchain for ERC-20 tokens and metaverse coins, making it incredibly useful.</p>
<p>The long-term potential of both Bitcoin and Ethereum looks strong. As outlined above, the fact that major investment firms are preparing to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to their clients, with the SEC expected to approve them, will be seen as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_3CvNhs2FE">a &#8216;huge seal of approval&#8217;, as Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz</a> put it, for the potential long-term value of those two coins.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">âThis regulatory breakthrough is very important,â says <a href="https://twitter.com/ARKInvest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ARKinvest</a> Founder, CEO and CIO <a href="https://twitter.com/CathieDWood?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CathieDWood</a>. âOur expectation is that the crypto ecosystem will be dominated [by Ether and Bitcoin] and it will scale from more than $1 trillion today to $25 trillion in 2030.â <a href="https://t.co/yWqwiMA5hV">pic.twitter.com/yWqwiMA5hV</a></p>&mdash; Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1724432019067691089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Analysts at British investment bank <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/standard-chartered-bumps-up-bitcoin-forecast-120000-2023-07-10/">Standard Chartered told their clients earlier this year that BTC could reach $120,000 by the end of 2024</a> &#8211; a 233% price increase from now &#8211; and a healthy Bitcoin means the rest of the market is healthy as investment trickles down into riskier tokens.</p>
<p>Similarly, many other established crypto projects should have a bright future ahead of them. For instance, XRP has formed partnerships with over 200 banks, despite its continued issues with the SEC, while plots of land within the Decentraland metaverse have been purchased by multiple global brands.Â Â Â </p>
<p>There are dozens of examples of major brands investing in Web3 and blockchain technology and by the end of the decade, it is expected to become a much larger part of mainstream life. Indeed, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has predicted that the total crypto market &#8211; currently worth just over $1 trillion &#8211; will be <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1724432019067691089">worth as much as $25 trillion by the end of the decade</a>.</p>
<h3>Crypto PresalesÂ </h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Cryptocurrency presales distribute a portion of a projectâs tokens to early investors on a first-come, first-serve basis. By investing in a presale, investors can acquire coins before they are listed on exchanges and before they are available to trade amongst the general public.Â </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wondering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-much-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency.htm">how much to invest in cryptos</a>? Many investors will have missed the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at under $100 or Ethereum at below $1. Fortunately, there are plenty of other opportunities to target similar gains.Â </p>
<p>One of the best ways of achieving this goal is to search high and low for solid presale projects, which are often referred to as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">crypto ICOs</a> (initial coin offerings). For example, in late 2022 Tamadoge was on sale for $0.01 in the first stage of its presale before reaching a peak of $0.194 after listing on exchanges &#8211; nearly 2,000% gains from that price. Crypto presales tend to offer more room to grow as they sell tokens at lower than their true market value to fund development.</p>
<p>However, investors must be diligent in their research to ensure they only purchase high-potential tokens that have a legitimate chance of being a worthy investment. Research should include investigating the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read the whitepaper</strong>: A whitepaper is a document that outlines the whole project and should give readers a clear understanding of exactly what they are investing in. Poorly written or vague whitepapers should be considered a red flag.</li>
<li><strong>Read the roadmap</strong>: A roadmap is the plan of how a project will develop over the coming months and years. It is easy to promise a $1 billion market cap, but the best projects also outline plans of action and the steps they will take to get to that point.</li>
<li><strong>Check the smart contract</strong>: Unfortunately, the crypto world is rife with scammers and some projects are intended to steal funds from the get-go. There are resources to check smart contracts, while top projects will provide a full audit from a reputable third-party blockchain security firm.</li>
<li><strong>Check the team</strong>: Again, due to the proliferation of scammers in the space, doxxed and public teams will relieve investors as they know exactly who is behind the project. An anonymous team is not necessarily a red flag if other parts of the project (whitepaper/roadmap/audit) are legitimate.</li>
<li><strong>Check social media sentiment</strong>: Social media sentiment and hype are crucial to the success or failure of a project. Interesting projects will fail if they do not catch the attention of the wider marker. Similarly, be wary of projects that use bots/fake accounts to promote their tokens.</li>
</ul>
<h3>UtilityÂ </h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Cryptocurrency projects offering high utility are likely to be more sustainable in the long run, since investors can use the tokens within the ecosystem to generate real value.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When searching for one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-10-crypto.htm">top 10 cryptos</a> to invest in, it is wise to focus on projects that have a real-world use case. As we mentioned earlier, Ethereum is a high-quality utility project as it has hundreds of other protocols and thousands of altcoins built on top of its blockchain. This means that its token ETH has huge levels of demand as people engage with those projects.</p>
<p>At the time of writing ETH has more than a 50% market share for DeFi chains, with a TVL (Total Value Locked &#8211; the value of other projects built on its blockchain) sitting at more than $25 billion, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">DeFiLlama</a>.</p>
<p>Ethereum has more than 950 other protocols built on top of it, more than a third larger than the Binance Smart Chain (664), while the next largest chain by TVL, Tron, is almost 70% smaller with a TVL of around $8 billion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1623" height="904" class="aligncenter wp-image-131205 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699976943-total-value-locked-ethereum-and-other-chains.png" alt="total value locked ethereum and other chains" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699976943-total-value-locked-ethereum-and-other-chains.png 1623w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699976943-total-value-locked-ethereum-and-other-chains-300x167.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699976943-total-value-locked-ethereum-and-other-chains-1024x570.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699976943-total-value-locked-ethereum-and-other-chains-768x428.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699976943-total-value-locked-ethereum-and-other-chains-1536x856.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1623px) 100vw, 1623px" /></p>
<h3>Market CapitalizationÂ Â </h3>
<p>Investors should have a firm grasp of how the market capitalization of a crypto asset works as it will enable the investor to assess what the potential upside looks like. For example, when the price of Bitcoin peaked in late 2021, it surpassed a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. In theory, this means that the upside is potentially limited with Bitcoin, as it has already witnessed significant levels of growth.Â </p>
<p>Should Bitcoin break a new all-time high in the coming months it would represent a 92% price increase from the price at the time of writing &#8211; an excellent ROI but one that can be beaten in other parts of the market.</p>
<p>Smaller market caps projects, such as trending meme coins, have much larger room for growth as it doesn&#8217;t take so much investment to see their price increase. For example, in the past week alone five meme tokens listed on CoinMarketCap have seen a price increase of more than 100% beating what Bitcoin investors hope to achieve in the next 12 to 18 months &#8211; there will be dozens more if one navigates around the site.</p>
<p>Of course, small market cap tokens come with increased risk that have to be priced in when investing. While small market tokens can see much higher growth in a shorter spell than the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, they are also more likely to plummet in price.</p>
<h3>CompetitionÂ Â </h3>
<p>It is also a good idea to see how much competition the respective crypto asset has. After all, there are now more than 25,000 tokens listed on CoinMarketCap &#8211; and even more that lie in waiting. For instance, there are many so-called âEthereum Killersâ in the market, each of which claims to offer a faster, cheaper, and more scalable alternative to Ethereum.Â </p>
<p>Investors will need to decide on whether it is better to invest in Ethereum or a direct competitor such as layer-2 solution Polygon, which is capable of faster speeds and cheaper transactions than Ethereum, but has yet to gain the same footing with consumers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1389" height="772" class="aligncenter wp-image-131229 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699979925-top-10-cryptos-market-cap-coingecko.png" alt="top 10 cryptos market cap coingecko" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699979925-top-10-cryptos-market-cap-coingecko.png 1389w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699979925-top-10-cryptos-market-cap-coingecko-300x167.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699979925-top-10-cryptos-market-cap-coingecko-1024x569.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699979925-top-10-cryptos-market-cap-coingecko-768x427.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1389px) 100vw, 1389px" /></p>
<p>The same is true of &#8216;DOGE Killers&#8217;, meme coins that promise to one day surpass the market cap of Dogecoin, the biggest and most popular meme coin.Â Crypto investors often cycle through tokens and trends, with copycat and derivative tokens quickly popping up if one token shows it resonates with investors.Â </p>
<p>Pepe is one such example &#8211; after the meme coin hit a $1 billion market cap in May 2023 it sparked a mini meme coin revival with dozens of copycat tokens, such as Pepe 2.0, AstroPepeX, McPepe, PepeAI and dozens &#8211; if not hundreds &#8211; of others being created in its wake.</p>
<h3>Trading Signals and Trading Bots</h3>
<p>Some investors prefer to integrate the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">best crypto signals</a> into their trading strategy as it allows them to eliminate emotions from the investing process.Â We have also reviewed the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best AI crypto trading bots</a> for traders who want to execute trades 24/7.</p>
<h3>Trends</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, trends should not be discounted when deciding which cryptos to purchase at a given time. Investing in a trending token or theme can prove to be both hugely beneficial if the timing is good &#8211; or disastrous should an investor take too long to realize that the trend is no longer popular.</p>
<p>During the 2021 bull run was play-to-earn gaming and the metaverse, which was expected to become a major industry in the 2020s and revolutionize the way people played games and interacted in a virtual world.</p>

<p>Axie Infinity (AXS) is one such example as it grew more than 3,300% &#8211; rising from under $5 to over $160 &#8211; from June 2021 to November 2021, as players across the world invested in their NFTs and cottage industries were developed with players earning incredible sums.Â </p>
<p>At its peak, the game had almost 3 million daily active users and a market cap of almost $10 billion, a piece of virtual land in its metaverse sold for over $2 million, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/08/25/crypto-video-game-axie-infinity-crypto-traders-unemployed/">players in developing countries were earning up to 5x their regular wage</a>.</p>
<p>However, complaints over the gameplay and the price of the NFTs needed to play it quickly saw the hype die away. By January 2022, the market cap had dipped to $3 billion and the price to under $50.Â Its secondary token SLP lost 99% of its value just a month later and then the protocol <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/14/us-links-axie-crypto-heist-north-korea/">suffered a $600 million hack from North Korea</a> from which it has never recovered.</p>
<p><a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/axie-infinity?range-ds=24h">According to DappRadar</a>, there are just 13,500 daily active players at the time of writing, with the price around $6.</p>
<p>Investing in a trending token can bring huge rewards but investors should be diligent to take profits and/or cash out when that trend starts to die, unless they want to be left holding a worthless bag of tokens.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In summary, this market insight has reviewed and ranked many of the best cryptos to buy now. We have covered a variety of projects to ensure that investors can diversify well and help answer which crypto to buy in 2024. Diversification can help to preserve capital, because all investments carry risks, and prices can go in both directions.Â </p>
<p>Our top choice is a revolutionary new cryptocurrency project called Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF). This cryptocurrency is linked to the potential release of Bitcoin spot ETFs, and will conduct multiple burning events on the completion of various milestones associated with the spot ETF release.</p>
<p>$BTCETF can be staked to earn high APYs, and offers deflationary tokenomics. More than $1.8 million has been raised in just three weeks since launch with the staking rewards currently over 140%.</p>

<h2><strong>Full Analysis of the Next Cryptocurrency to Explode in 2024</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>By reading the below insights, investors can take a closer look at some of the potentially profitable crypto projects listed above. This includes key information such as market capitalization, use cases, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Overall Best Crypto To Explode With Market-Linked Roadmap And 40% Automatic Price Increase</strong></h3>
<p>In terms of predicting the next crypto to explode, our top choice would have to be <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a>. This is because it is offering something truly unique, being connected to an important regulatory event &#8211; BTC ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1303" height="608" class="aligncenter wp-image-133410" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472843-bitcoin-etf-token-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472843-bitcoin-etf-token-presale.png 1303w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472843-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472843-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-1024x478.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472843-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-768x358.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472843-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472843-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1303px) 100vw, 1303px" /></p>
<p>While most other crypto projects have no connection to the larger market, Bitcoin ETF Token is specifically positioning itself for this approval, and could 10x or more should it come to pass. Many industry professionals have suggested that the SEC ratification could materialize as soon as December 2023.Â </p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token roadmap is very market-specific. It contains 5 milestones, mostly linked to key events &#8211; the native token reaching $100M in trade volume, the SEC approval, the trading of the first BTC ETF token, the total market cap of BTC ETFs hitting $1B, and the price of BTC surpassing $100K.Â </p>
<p>At each of these milestones, 5% of the supply is burned for a total burn of 25%. Its deflationary mechanism is tied to its market-focused roadmap, a technique that few other presales have used. Token burning helps to promote scarcity, driving up the coin price. 25% is a large percentage to allocate to token burning.Â </p>
<p>Aside from the token burn, the dynamic proof of stake APY for this crypto stands at over 200%. At the time of writing, $BTCETF is priced at $0.0056 on presale. By the final round, the price will increase to $0.0068 per token.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1210" height="417" class="aligncenter wp-image-127528" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token milestones" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png 1210w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-300x103.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-1024x353.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-768x265.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1210px) 100vw, 1210px" /></p>
<p>While SEC approval is what could make this crypto explode, these incentives can add considerably to the overall ROI, especially for early-bird investors.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Stake-to-Mine Crypto that Could Explode in Price</strong></h3>
<p>One of the cryptos that has the potential to explode is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a> &#8211; while Bitcoin Minetrix is not related to the Bitcoin project, it will be used to reduce the barriers to mining cryptos such as Bitcoin.Â </p>
<p>Bitcoin mining can be a lengthy and expensive process. Investors must purchase advanced equipment, hardware, and even set up mining rigs. Therefore, Bitcoin mining is conducted mostly by large corporations. However, Bitcoin Minetrix will decentralize cloud mining to make it available to everyday people.Â </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1319" height="640" class="aligncenter wp-image-133412" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png 1319w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1024x497.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-768x373.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1319px) 100vw, 1319px" /></p>
<p>The platform palms to rent equipment and mining times from other corporations. By staking $BTCMTX, the native cryptocurrency, token holders can earn cloud mining credits.Â </p>
<p>The tokens will be staked on an Ethereum-based smart contract. The credits you receive are ERC-20 tokens and will be recorded on the blockchain.Â </p>
<p>These tokens can be burned to earn Bitcoin mining power. The mining power is leveraged to get allocated mining times, through which you can potentially earn a percentage of mining revenues. Thus, Bitcoin Minetrix will make it cost-effective and simpler to earn rewards via mining.Â </p>
<p>Staking the token can also give investors high APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) of up to 200%. This token is currently priced at $0.0116, with the price to increase to $0.0148 by the 39th and final round.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Meme Token with Staking and Play-to-Earn Wagering</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK) is one of the top meme cryptocurrency tokens that can explode in the coming months.Â </p>
<p>Not just another meme project with a lack of utility, Meme Kombat will feature a battle arena, staking rewards, and free tokens for participating in its ecosystem.Â </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1201" height="720" class="aligncenter wp-image-122027 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698417747-meme_kombat_sponsored.jpg" alt="meme kombat presale graphic" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698417747-meme_kombat_sponsored.jpg 1201w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698417747-meme_kombat_sponsored-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698417747-meme_kombat_sponsored-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698417747-meme_kombat_sponsored-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></p>
<p>The play-to-earn battle arena will kick off with its first season after the conclusion of the $MK presale. The arena will let users wager their $MK tokens on live battles between meme coin avatars. The first series will feature 11 meme coin avatars such as Pepe Coin and Spongebob.Â </p>
<p>Users can wager their tokens to earn exclusive rewards and free tokens. Once you purchase $MK during the presale, your holdings will be locked on the staking contract. Meme Kombat is offering up to 500% APYs for staking during the presale.Â </p>
<p>The Meme Kombat battle arenas allow one to bet on Player vs Player modes, where they can challenge other friends and earn rewards depending on their performance. You can also bet on Player vs Games modes and earn big on this ecosystem.Â </p>
<p>The developer team on Meme Kombat has been doxxed and are public-facing, which is not a common occurrence in the meme space. Boasting the potential to soar by more than 100x, Meme Kombat also offers a competitive token supply of only 120 million.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/331179/meme-kombat-home-img.jpg" alt="meme kombat staking and wagering rewards" /></figure>
<p>The presale will allocate 60 million tokens, as Meme Kombat aims to raise a hard cap of $10 million. While projects such as Pepe Coin have offered staggering returns in the past, Meme Kombat offers more utility and stronger tokenomics.Â </p>
<p>A 100% community token, $MK is only for the public. 30% of the supply will be distributed as staking and battle rewards and another 10% as community rewards. The remaining 10% will be used for DEX allocation.Â </p>
<p>Investors can <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-meme-kombat.htm">buy Meme Kombat</a> for only $0.205 on presale &#8211; which has now raised more than $1.9 million.

<h3><strong>4. TG.Casino &#8211; New Crypto Casino with 200% Bonus, Cashback and Buyback</strong></h3>
<p>Online crypto casinos have been one of the hottest niches in the cryptocurrency space. After the success of projects such as Rollbit and Hamster, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino">TG.Casino</a> ($TGC) is emerging as one of the best new online casinos.Â </p>
<p>TG.Casino sets itself apart by offering 100% accessibility through Telegram. This way, users do not need to create a new account and connect to the casino through their Telegram app. Telegram also offers high-quality security and infrastructure, which supports seamless deposits and withdrawals.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/331176/tg-casino-img.jpg" alt="tg casino live and sports betting" /></figure>
<p>The TG.Casino has recently released $TGC, its native cryptocurrency, on presale. This token can potentially explode due to the multiple use cases and staking opportunities it offers. Firstly, TG.Casino users must hold $TGC to get access to exclusive casino games, while the token will also be awarded to players in the ecosystem.Â </p>
<p>Secondly, $TGC can be staked to earn high APYs. At the time of writing, you can earn more than 200% in annual yields by staking $TGC. Despite setting a low supply of 100 million, TG.Casino will implement a burning mechanism to reduce the supply and make $TGC a more competitive asset.Â </p>
<p>TG.Casino will buy back a portion of $TGC with its profits &#8211; 60% of purchased tokens will be distributed as a profit-share to those staking, while 40% will be burnt, making the supply deflationary and increasing its value over time.</p>
<p>New players at the casino, which is live and available globally, can earn a 200% welcome bonus up to 10 ETH, as well as 25% weekly cashback on losses if they play with $TGC.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Trending Meme Coin and Crypto Casino</strong></h3>
<p>Capitalizing on the meme crypto explosion, a new crypto has emerged: the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes (WSM)</u></a> token.Â </p>
<p>The token is already one of the largest in the meme space but has a relatively low market cap and massive room for growth &#8211; it has also just launched a crypto casino to offer even more utility.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/334836/wsm-casino.jpg" alt="wsm casino new player welcome bonus" /></figure>
<p>$WSM is currently the fifth-largest meme token by trading volume, trailing only Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki, and Pepe, but unlike those coins it has a small market cap of just $50 million. Floki&#8217;s market cap is $250m &#8211; 5x bigger &#8211; while DOGE sits at almost $10 billion, 200x bigger.</p>
<p>WSM could be the next crypto to explode because of its excellent early performance despite launching in a bear market, its huge staking rewards, major community support, and newly launched crypto casino.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wsmcasino/">WSM Casino</a> is now open and playable globally and utilizes Telegram bots to allow for instant, secure, and anonymous account creation, as well as anonymous crypto transfers.Â </p>
<p>New players receive a 200% welcome bonus for their first deposit, up to $25k, while those who deposit and play with $WSM earn an extra 200 free spins. The casino has thousands of slots, classic casino games and a full sportsbook.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/311692/wall-street-memes-1.jpg" alt="wsm casino wall street memes token graphic" /></figure>
<p>$WSM tokens can also be staked and is currently offering an APY of 39% &#8211; the staking pool has seen huge uptake with more than 500 million tokens, or 25% of max supply, currently locked in the pool, signaling strong community support.</p>
<p>The project, which previously sold out an NFT collection in just 30 minutes, had one of the best presales ever, raising more than $25 million before pumping around 275% in price.</p>
<p>With a social media following of more than a million &#8211; with Elon Musk a known fan having has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954"><u>interacted with the platform&#8217;s memes</u></a> on multiple occasions &#8211; and added utility, it could be huge in the next bull run.</p>

<h3><strong>6. eTukTuk &#8211; Sustainable Cryptocurrency with New Presale LaunchÂ Â </strong></h3>
<p>For the past five years, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk</a> (TUK) has been working on its cryptocurrency platform. The project will set up electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and EV charging stations in developing nations&#8217; urban and suburban areas.Â </p>
<p>Currently, over 270 million TukTuks use internal combustion engines (ICEs). These ICEs run on fossil fuels, contributing to more emissions than cars. As ICEs are slowly becoming obsolete, TukTuk drivers struggle to make a minimum wage.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/323432/etuktuk-img-1.jpg" alt="etuktuk presale graphic" /></figure>
<p>eTukTuk wants to set up affordable charging stations by leveraging the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. Since the blockchain supports a high number of transactions and charges low fees, TukTuk drivers will take home 400% by making the chance to electric vehicles.Â </p>
<p>Furthermore, eTukTuk will set up charging stations in designated territories with the help of territory partners. These are local partners who will help in the operation and installation process. Thus, the costs will be lowered.Â </p>
<p>eTukTuk will launch a drivers app through which TukTuk drivers using zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and other EVs can charge their vehicles at charging stations. On the driver&#8217;s app, drivers will make payments using $TUK, the native cryptocurrency.Â </p>
<p>Token holders can stake $TUK to earn a passive income. As the number of territories increases, there will be a rise in revenue through the charging stations. This will also allow staked token holders to earn more passive income.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/315135/etuktuk-features.jpg" alt="etuktuk how it works" /></figure>
<p>Currently, interested investors can join the token presale and buy $TUK for $0.02475 &#8211; over $230k has been raised already with the staking APY currently over 899%.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Green Bitcoin &#8211; Crypto Presale Focused on Rewarding Holders Who Predict Bitcoin&#8217;s Price</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin</a> is a new token presale with a twist: Predict Bitcoin&#8217;s price and earn rewards in the form of $GBTC tokens. $GBTC is an ERC20 token, meaning you need an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask to participate in the project.</p>
<p>You can only buy $GBTC tokens in a presale at the moment, where it runs in stages. Each stage will have a higher token price than the previous, making it potentially prudent to buy as early as possible to lock in a better price. Once the presale ends, the team plans to list the token on an A-tier exchange. Typically, tokens list on exchanges at a higher price than the presale price.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="460" class="alignnone wp-image-139347 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-768x393.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Luckily, you can maximize the number of tokens you have with staking. During the presale, there is a generous APR for those who stake their tokens. Keep in mind, the APR will drop as more tokens are locked. This makes staking early a potentially profitable option as you get to reap the highest rewards.</p>
<p>Regardless of when you stake your tokens, though, out of the 21 million token supply over 14 million tokens are dedicated to the token presale and the staking rewards, meaning early adopters are likely to get the biggest piece of the pie in token numbers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="464" class="alignnone wp-image-139318 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin tokenomics" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-300x155.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-768x396.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>As for the project&#8217;s future, Green Bitcoin will run in four phases based on the <a href="https://www.greenbitcoin.xyz/whitepaper.pdf">Green Bitcoin whitepaper</a>. These are:</p>

<li>Token presale launch.</li>

<p>The SCORP token is the native token behind the platform and is the exclusive payment method for the Scorpion ecosystem. Itâs the default betting currency across sports and casino gaming products and provides a passive income for those holding the token. The re-distribution tax provides the income, which sees 2% of every transaction being re-distributed to holders. Furthermore, a 1% burn tax also makes the token deflationary.</p>
<p>The project is currently hosting a presale for the SCORP token before it launches and hits centralized exchanges. Those that purchase more than $1,000 SCORP in the presale are enrolled in the Elite Scorpion Members Club, which provides VIP services, cashback, extra staking rewards, and extra SCORP tokens.</p>
<p>Additionally, investors that use the exclusive bonus code Scorpion20 in the presale can get an extra 20% tokens on their investment. More than $1.75m has been raised since the presale launched.Â </p>

<h3><strong>9. Launchpad XYZ &#8211; Web3 Dashboard for Crypto Traders and Investors</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a> is a new Web3 dashboard that puts everything traders and investors need to know about the crypto market in one place. It&#8217;s designed to make it easier than ever before to spot opportunities and act on them quickly.</p>
<p>The idea behind Launchpad XYZ is that so many opportunities in the crypto market are fleeting. Traders have just a short window to get in on a trending token before it pumps. Investors have a limited time to buy into crypto presales or join a new NFT mint before they sell out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1337" height="458" class="aligncenter wp-image-133455" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700475246-launchpad-xyz-presale.png" alt="Launchpad XYZ presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700475246-launchpad-xyz-presale.png 1337w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700475246-launchpad-xyz-presale-300x103.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700475246-launchpad-xyz-presale-1024x351.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700475246-launchpad-xyz-presale-768x263.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1337px) 100vw, 1337px" /></p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ puts everything traders and investors need to know in one place. From this dashboard, it&#8217;s possible to see hot new crypto presales, monitor token prices in real-time, keep an eye on NFT mints, and much more. Launchpad XYZ various dashboards are very user-friendly and call attention to the most important details crypto investors need to know.</p>
<p>To make Launchpad XYZ even more actionable, the experienced team behind this project is introducing the Launchpad XYZ Quotient. This is a simple signal of whether investors should pay attention to a trending asset or not. Investors can rank assets based on their Launchpad Quotient to find new opportunities quickly.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ is also building its own decentralized exchange and NFT marketplace. That enables users to go straight from research to trading with no delay.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ native token, LPX token, plays a central role in this platform. Token holders receive discounted trading fees along with access to limited token presales and NFT mints. Check out the <a href="https://whitepaper.launchpad.xyz/">Launchpad whitepaper</a> for more details.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="895" height="491" class="aligncenter wp-image-123040 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698670197-launchpad-xyz-signals.png" alt="launchpad xyz crypto signals" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698670197-launchpad-xyz-signals.png 895w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698670197-launchpad-xyz-signals-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698670197-launchpad-xyz-signals-768x421.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to predict what will happen to the price of $LPX after launch. But early investors can earn paper gains of 100% between the first stage of the Launchpad XYZ presale and when it lists. That&#8217;s a very generous return just for investing in the presale.</p>
<p>The Launchpad XYZ presale has now raised over $2 million, so investors are clearly excited about this new Web3 dashboard. Join the <a href="https://t.me/Launchpad_Official_Channel">Launchpad Telegram channel</a> to get all the latest updates on the presale.</p>

<h3><strong>10. yPredict &#8211; Crypto Analytics Platform Offering Multiple Token Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a>, an ecosystem offering data-driven market analytics and insights in the cryptocurrency niche. Members can buy subscriptions to predictive analytics and models on yPredict with $YPRED, the native token.Â </p>
<p>These prediction models have been created by AI developers, financial quants, and trading experts. One of the main use cases of yPredict is to leverage AI tools, such as Natural Language Processing, to conduct sentiment analysis, technical analysis, and study chart patterns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/311697/ypredict-robot.jpg" alt="ypred presale ai trading graphic" />Members can see various future outlooks for the cryptocurrency space through the prediction marketplace. All these models are released after being verified by the yPredict DAO. Through the patent-pending pattern recognition algorithm, yPredict can identify hundreds of bearish and bullish charting and candlestick patterns.Â </p>
<p>AI signals and technical analysis are among the other use cases of the ecosystem. While there is no guarantee that $YPRED will be a profitable cryptocurrency in the long term, the multiple use cases will help token holders to maximize their returns.Â </p>
<p>For instance, one can stake tokens on the ecosystem to generate a yield from a staking pool. 10% of all the revenue generated from new subscription sign-ups are distributed to token holders. Moreover, 15% of the fees collected from token swaps are also given to holders through a staking pool.Â </p>
<p>Other use cases include access to a Learn2Earn ecosystem, through which members can complete assessments and earn rewards. There is also a 7% tax on selling the $YPRED token, which has been introduced to limit the regular selling of the coin.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/272401/ypredict-home.jpg" alt="ypred ai insights and analytics" /></figure>
<p>Currently, $YPRED can be bought on presale for $0.11 per token &#8211; the price will jump to $0.12 for the listing, with more than $4.8 million raised so far.</p>

<p><a href="https://dogestar.net/index.html">DogeStar (DOGESTAR)</a> is a multi-utility meme ecosystem that will feature an open-world metaverse, in-game NFTs, and a governance DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).Â </p>

<p>While $DOGESTAR is still available to buy on presale, the deflationary tokenomics and use cases can help the token explore after the initial exchange offering. DogeStar will offer community members entry into a space exploration metaverse &#8211; where you can explore and take part in multiple games.Â </p>
<p>The NFTs are based on a dynamic value system &#8211; meaning they can grow in value over time. This will happen depending on your performance within in-game events, and individual player achievements. Community members can also help shape the future of DogeStar by joining the decentralized autonomous organization &#8211; which gives you governance rights.Â </p>
<p>NFTs can be purchased through the Galactic Bazaar &#8211; DogeStarâs NFT marketplace. The NFTs range from cosmic enhancements to powerful artifacts that offer help throughout the gameplay. DogeStar has a total supply of one quadrillion &#8211; 69% of which will be burned over time.Â </p>

<p>The next big crypto to talk about is DOT, the native token of Polkadot. This is a decentralized protocol that facilitates data and value being sent between different networks that wouldnât otherwise be compatible.</p>
<p>As such, Polkadot serves as a connecting point for all other blockchain networks. This promotes scalability and interoperability. Thanks to its use of next-generation nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS), Polkadot uses a tiny fraction of the energy compared with many other blockchains.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/311698/polkadot.jpg" alt="polkadot web3 homepage" /></figure>
<p>Among the proof-of-stake procedures examined in a recent study, Polkadot has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry. Investors of DOT can stake their tokens for incentives. DOT also acts as a governance token.</p>
<p>Unlike some platforms, which only offer certain privileges to miners, Polkadot holders can partake in the management of events like fixes and protocol upgrades. At the time of writing, DOT has a market capitalization of over $7 billion and is in the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">top 15 coins on CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>14. Chainlink &#8211; Established Project With Hundreds of Partnerships</strong></h3>
<p>Although LINK is already a well-known cryptocurrency and is ranked among the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">top 25 tokens on CoinMarketCap</a>, it still has room to grow. Chainlink&#8217;s ability to link smart contracts on blockchains to data and events in the real world is one of its many uses. Does this mean it become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-real-world-asset-tokens.htm">top real-world asset tokens</a>?Â </p>
<p>This is the most popular oracle network for hybrid smart contracts. The oracle network of Chainlink may be used by a smart contract to obtain external data, such as the price of Bitcoin Cash in US dollars for instance.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/311699/chainlink.jpg" alt="chainlink crypto homepage" /></figure>
<p>Then, as compensation for their work, Oracles receive LINK tokens. Chainlink also offers timely, precise off-chain data reports for anything from AccuWeather to the SWIFT payment system. Furthermore, token staking and node delegation schemes will soon be implemented by the network.</p>
<p>The upgrades could contribute to making Chainlink more secure and decentralized, which might rekindle interest in the project. At the time of writing, LINK has a market cap of nearly $4 billion.</p>
<h3><strong>15. ApeCoin &#8211; Native Crypto of the Bored Ape Yacht Club Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>APE also has the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">potential to be the next crypto to blow up</a>. ApeCoin is based on Ethereum and governed by the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) of the same name. According to the team behind the project, APE was largely created to act as a token for commerce, gaming, and culture.</p>
<p>For anyone unaware, the <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> ecosystem has become the benchmark NFT catalog for many investors to follow. This project represents more than digital art. It has become a well-known brand.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/311700/apecoin.jpg" alt="apecoin token graphic" /></figure>
<p>An example of this is the Bored Ape Breakfast Club, an NFT project offering a coffee subscription service along with exclusive privileges. Bored Apes are so popular that it is the theme of a burger joint in California which has become popular with NFT enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Additionally, renowned musicians Snoop Dogg and Eminem performed in the Otherside metaverse at award events as their own Bored Ape avatars. ApeCoin has a market capitalization of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/apecoin-ape/">almost $1.5 billion</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<h3><strong>16. Decentraland &#8211; Currency of Popular All-Immersive Metaverse</strong></h3>
<p>As most metaverse enthusiasts will know, Decentraland is an all-immersive virtual reality. Its token, MANA, is built on the Ethereum network. Decentraland users can build, explore, socialize and earn.</p>
<p>This might just be the next crypto to blow up in the virtual real-estate sector. MANA functions as a utility token for Decentraland. Put simply, plots of land are offered in the form of NFTs called LAND.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/311701/decentraland.jpg" alt="decentraland crypto gaming graphic" /></figure>
<p>These virtual plots of land within the Decentraland metaverse can be purchased using MANA tokens. Holders can also swap their MANA tokens for avatars, accessories, services, and many other goods within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The market capitalization of Decentraland at the time of writing is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/">over $1.3 billion</a>. MANA is in the top 50 tokens on CoinMarketCap.</p>
<h3><b>17. Pepe &#8211; Meme Cryptocurrency Offering Potential for Long-Term GrowthÂ </b></h3>
<p>Pepe ($PEPE) is a popular meme cryptocurrency that rose to fame during the initial months of 2023. The cryptocurrency is named after the viral Pepe the Frog meme. After the token launched in April 2023, it became one of the fastest-growing meme tokens.Â </p>
<p>In only a few weeks, $PEPE soared past a market cap of $1 billion. By May beginning, this new meme coin reached an all-time high of $0.0000043. However, the token corrected following the highs. $PEPE sunk to the $0.0000006 level and traded sideways for most of the year.Â </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="830" height="661" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134030" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700549897-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-39-40-am.png" alt="Pepe price" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700549897-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-39-40-am.png 830w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700549897-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-39-40-am-300x239.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700549897-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-39-40-am-768x612.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" /></p>
<p>But, as we approach the final stages of 2023, $PEPE is growing in momentum once again. In the last 30 days, $PEPE is up by more than 57%. Due to the volatile nature of meme coins, investors may witness a further price jump in the coming months.Â </p>
<p>At press time, the token is trading at the $0.0000011 levels and has a market cap of more than $460 million. The price is still over 70% below its all-time highs, leaving a lot of room for growth in the future.Â </p>
<h2><strong>How to Find the Next Potential Cryptocurrency to Explode</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When looking for the next crypto to explode, investors should look for projects with doxxed (publicly revealed) teams, thorough and well-put-together roadmaps and whitepapers.Â </p>
<p>Finding the next cryptocurrency to explode isnât as easy as it sounds.</p>
<p>Sites like <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, <a href="https://coinlist.co/">CoinList</a>, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">CoinGecko</a> will list dozens of new coins every week, but potential investors must do further research and due diligence before deciding to invest in a coin.</p>
<p>Websites like <a href="https://coinsniper.net/">CoinSniper</a>, <a href="https://solidproof.io/">Solid Proof</a> and <a href="https://tokensniffer.com/">TokenSniffer</a> will help you decide if a project is legitimate or not, as can social media sites like Reddit and Twitter.</p>
<p>Weâve analyzed the next potential cryptocurrency to boom and heaps of alternatives. That said, investors can check out some considerations below to aid their decision-making.</p>
<h3><strong>Growing Popularity</strong></h3>
<p>A sign of the next cryptocurrency to explode in 2024 could be increasing popularity at an early stage.Â </p>
<p>Many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new crypto projects</a> introduce tokens in phases and will start with a beta, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presale</a>, or both.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tamadoge (TAMA) went on sale to early presale investors for $0.01 each.</li>
<li>The final presale stage saw the coin on sale for $0.03 &#8211; a 200% increase before listing.</li>
<li>TAMA raised more than $19 million total in its presale with huge hype.</li>
<li>The coin pumped to an all-time high of $0.194 &#8211; nearly 2,000% over the early presale price and 550% over list price</li>
<li>Tamadoge continues to build its ecosystem which includes NFT ownership and P2E gaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, presales are an important time for a project. If a token does well in its presale phase, it can skyrocket when it hits a major crypto exchange.</p>
<h3><strong>Crypto Project RoadmapÂ </strong></h3>
<p>The project roadmap simply refers to what the project has planned in order to grow and stand out in the overcrowded cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>With certain roadmaps like Love Hate Inu&#8217;s ambitious vote-to-earn project has a detailed roadmap that includes plans to integrate a voting system into major metaverses.</p>
<p>Finding the roadmap of a cryptocurrency project is fairly simple and entails checking the official platform and/or its whitepaper.</p>
<h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have produced crypto millionaires even though they have no utility. However, these are outliers. Most top-performing coins offer utility to users that keeps demand for the tokens high.</p>
<p>The next cryptocurrency to explode could be a meme coin with ZERO use cases.Â </p>
<p>However, most of the crypto projects that prove to be successful in the long run, after the initial hype, tend to have multiple use cases.</p>
<p>All of the cryptos with the potential to explode discussed on this page have use cases.</p>
<h3><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3>
<p>Token prices are determined by supply and demand. So, check how a project plans to release tokens and how quickly to see if there is an opportunity for its price to spike.</p>
<p>A cryptocurrency project&#8217;s tokenomics are one of the most crucial variables in determining success.</p>
<p>Love Hate Inu, for example, has a large supply of 100 billion tokens, but 90% of those are available for purchase in the presale, putting the project totally in the hands of the community.</p>
<p>The final 10% is reserved for liquidity on exchanges.</p>
<h2><strong>Where to Buy Other Potential Cryptos to Boom</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Here is a brief guide on how to buy $BTCMTX tokens during the Bitcoin Minetrix presale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1 &#8211; </strong>Download a crypto wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2 &#8211; </strong>Head to the Bitcoin Minetrix website and click &#8216;Connect.&#8217;</li>
<li><strong>Step 3 &#8211; </strong>Purchase ETH, USDT, or BNB from a trusted wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, or an exchange and transfer it over</li>
<li><strong>Step 4 &#8211; </strong>Convert ETH, USDT, or BNB tokens for $BTCMTX.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5 &#8211; </strong>Claim $BTCMTX tokens after all presale stages are finished.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The Verdict on the Most Likely Crypto to Explode Next</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ve looked at the roadmap, performance, and many other important metrics to rank the best crypto projects that could potentially explode, looking at a range of different projects to meme coins and presales and more established ones.</p>
<p>Our findings concluded that the next cryptocurrency to explode in 2024 is Bitcoin ETF Token. Investors can buy $BTCETF, the native token, and earn generous staking rewards as well as definitive presale price increases.</p>
<p>The token price could also 10x or more, pending SEC regulatory approval and wider market events.Â </p>

<h3><strong>Mega Dice â Best for Live Dealer Games</strong></h3>

It offers an anonymous gambling experience that only requires an email address. Payout requests are automatically approved, so you&#8217;ll receive your winnings in minutes.

<h2><strong>Our Methodology When Ranking Instant Payout Casinos in Canada</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We conducted extensive research when reviewing the top instant withdrawal casinos in Canada. Here&#8217;s an overview of the key metrics we focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Licensed Casinos Only: </strong>Make no mistake about it; we never consider Canadian casinos that operate without a license. On the contrary, all of the casinos listed on this page are regulated by a reputable license issuer. Safety will always be the most important factor, so rest assured you&#8217;ll be gambling in a safe and secure environment.</li>
<li><strong>Instant Withdrawals: </strong>The safe casino sites discussed on this page offer instant withdrawals. This means it takes minutes for the funds to arrive in your private cryptocurrency wallet. In most cases, the listed casinos process payouts automatically, meaning they don&#8217;t need to be approved manually.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous Gambling Accounts: </strong>We also prioritized instant payout casinos offering anonymous gambling accounts. This removes the need to upload ID verification documents, let alone provide personal information. For added security, we gave preference to casinos that allow VPNs.</li>
<li><strong>Generous Welcome Package: </strong>All of the instant withdrawal casinos that we reviewed offer a welcome package. We prefer matched deposit bonuses with reasonable wagering requirements. This gives players a realistic chance of cashing their bonus winnings out. We also explored bonuses for existing account holders, such as deposit reloads and cashback.</li>
<li><strong>Games From Reputable Software Providers: </strong>We only consider instant payout casinos in Canada that offer games from reputable software providers. This includes Evolution, Betsoft, Hacksaw, Microgaming, and Pragmatic Play. These providers are licensed in multiple countries and have their games audited by third parties.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Pick the Best Online Casino in Canada With Fast Payouts</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This section delves a lot deeper into the research methods we discussed above. This will help you choose the best fast withdrawal casino in Canada for your requirements.</p>
<h3><strong>Deposit and Withdrawal Speeds</strong></h3>
<p>Most Canadian casino sites offer fast deposits when using a debit/credit card or e-wallet. However, withdrawals aren&#8217;t treated with the same level of urgency. In fact, withdrawal requests often remain &#8216;pending&#8217; for several days. Only when the casino site manually approves the payout will the funds be sent to your payment method.</p>
<p>Therefore, when choosing an online casino, you&#8217;ll want to avoid platforms that have a manual payment process. For instance, Mega Dice, Lucky Block, and Betpanda.io have integrated blockchain technology into their platforms. This means that when players request a payout, it&#8217;s automatically processed.</p>
<p>Wallet-to-wallet payments are not only secure but ultra-fast. Depending on the underlying blockchain, the cryptocurrencies should arrive in your private wallet in 0-10 minutes.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t find the withdrawal time frames on the payments page, check the terms and conditions. Then search for &#8216;Withdrawal&#8217; to find if there are any terms related to payouts.</p>
<h3><strong>Licensing and ReputationÂ </strong></h3>
<p>We mentioned earlier that the best instant withdrawal casinos in Canada offer a safe gambling experience. This is a non-negotiable metric, as there are many scam casinos operating online.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137905" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338759-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-05-49.png" alt="Lucky Block regulation and licensing" width="900" height="345" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338759-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-05-49.png 2498w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338759-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-05-49-300x115.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338759-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-05-49-1024x393.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338759-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-05-49-768x295.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338759-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-05-49-1536x589.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338759-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-05-49-2048x785.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The most effective way of staying safe is by using a regulated casino site.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, Lucky Block and Mega Dice are licensed by the Governor of CuraÃ§ao.</li>
<li>Although this is an offshore jurisdiction, CuraÃ§ao has been at the forefront of online casino licensing for over 20 years.</li>
<li>Therefore, casinos under the watchful eye of CuraÃ§ao are considered safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, if you&#8217;re planning to deposit cryptocurrencies to benefit from instant payouts, make sure the casino has solid security systems in place. It should keep the majority of client-owned funds in cold wallets. The balance can be kept in hot wallets, so that withdrawals can be honored instantly.</p>
<h3><strong>Established Software ProvidersÂ Â </strong></h3>
<p>Third-party software providers supply games to online casinos. However not all software providers can be trusted, so research in this department is also important.</p>
<ul>
<li>In particular, we prefer established software providers that are regulated by a tier-one gambling body.</li>
<li>The reason for this is simple; licensed software providers must use &#8216;test houses&#8217;.</li>
<li>These are independent companies that test and audit casino games. Until the audit process is complete, games cannot be launched.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of software providers that meet this criterion include NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, Play&#8217;n GO, Playtech, and Novomatic. Games from these providers can be found in Lucky Block, Mega Dice, BC.Game, and many other instant payout casinos discussed today.</p>
<p>In contrast, unregulated software providers aren&#8217;t required to follow the same rigorous testing rules. This means there isn&#8217;t a way to know if the respective games are truly fair.</p>
<h3><strong>Available Games</strong></h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve researched software providers, the next step is to explore what casino games are available. The vast majority of instant withdrawal casinos in Canada offer slots. This usually includes Megaway slots, which offer thousands of paylines. Table games can also be found at most Canadian casino sites.</p>
<p>We like providers that offer different versions of roulette, blackjack, and baccarat. For instance, Wild.io offers almost 100 variations of roulette. This includes European, American, and French roulette, all with software and live dealers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137856" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03.jpg" alt="Mega Dice slot games" width="900" height="498" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03.jpg 1576w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03-300x166.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03-768x425.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03-1536x850.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth checking out blockchain-based games on BC.Game. Each gaming outcome, such as a round of blockchain, is determined by provably fair technology. Without getting technical, this means that games are guaranteed to be random and fair. Moreover, gaming outcomes can be verified on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Many fast withdrawal casinos also offer sports betting. This means you can place bets on ice hockey, American football, baseball, soccer, rugby, and other popular sports. Ultimately, make sure you check what gambling markets are available before choosing an online casino.</p>
<h3><strong>Account Limits</strong></h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to choose an instant withdrawal casino in Canada that aligns with your budget. At one end, casual players should choose a provider that has a small minimum deposit requirement. Lucky Block requires just 0.0001 BTC, which is about $5. This is an inconsequential amount for most Canadian players.</p>
<p>High rollers, however, will need an instant payout casino that supports high betting limits. Moreover, there should be no caps on withdrawals. We came across many platforms that limit daily withdrawal amounts; these casinos should be avoided. If you&#8217;re a high roller, consider Mega Dice &#8211; no withdrawal limits are in place.</p>
<h3><strong>Player Privacy and KYC Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re comfortable providing an online casino with your personal information, government-issued ID, and proof of address (e.g. bank statement), then you&#8217;ll have plenty of options to choose from.</p>
<p>That said, if you want to gamble anonymously without any KYC requirements, you&#8217;ll want to consider platforms like Lucky Block, Mega Dice, or BC.Game. These instant payout casinos do not have a KYC process, as they only handle cryptocurrency deposits. This means you can gamble anonymously.</p>
<p>In addition, this will fast-track the sign-up process. After all, you only need to provide an email address and choose a password. You can then deposit cryptocurrencies and begin gambling within minutes.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Package and Ongoing PromotionsÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Bonuses remain an integral part of the online gambling space, especially with Canadians. Therefore, when choosing an online casino with fast payouts, make sure it offers a generous welcome package.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get a huge 200% deposit bonus when joining Lucky Block. The maximum bonus is â¬10,000 or about $15,000. After you&#8217;ve claimed the Lucky Block welcome package you can move onto Mega Dice. Once again, the first deposit is matched by 200%. Only this time, the maximum bonus is 1 BTC, or about $50,000.</p>

<p>BC.Game, Betpanda.io, Wild.io, and many other casinos listed on this page also offer generous welcome packages. Some of the things to consider before claiming a casino bonus:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum deposit requirement to qualify</li>
<li>The wagering requirements before the bonus can be withdrawn</li>
<li>How many days you have to meet the wagering requirements</li>
<li>What games you can play</li>
<li>The maximum amount that can be won from the bonus funds</li>
</ul>
<p>Casino bonuses aren&#8217;t just for first-time players. Some of the best Canadian casino sites also offer bonuses to existing accounts. This keeps players coming back for more, rather than joining another casino.</p>
<p>Some of the best casino bonuses for existing players include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit reloads</li>
<li>Cashback</li>
<li>Rakeback</li>
<li>Free spins</li>
<li>Loyalty rewards</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like welcome packages, ongoing bonuses also come with terms and conditions.</p>
<h3><strong>Usability</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important to choose an online casino that is simple to use. After all, some casinos offer thousands of games, so there should be adequate filters. For example, casino games should be split by the gambling product, such as &#8216;table games&#8217; or &#8216;slots&#8217;. There should also be a filter for software providers.</p>
<p>The overall gaming experience should be enjoyable, meaning fast loading speeds. This is especially the case when playing live dealer games. For instance, we found that some live dealer feeds are a few seconds behind actual gameplay. This means gaming outcomes are revealed before you get to watch the action unfold.</p>
<h3><strong>Mobile Gaming</strong></h3>
<p>The best instant withdrawal casinos in Canada are available on desktop <em>and</em> mobile devices. The casino will optimize its platform for mobile web browsers, enabling players to gamble on a smartphone. Games will also be optimized by the respective software provider.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137908" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338903-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-08-13.png" alt="Mega Dice mobile casino" width="435" height="612" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338903-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-08-13.png 808w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338903-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-08-13-213x300.png 213w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338903-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-08-13-728x1024.png 728w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338903-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-08-13-768x1080.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p>This ensures that the gambling experience is still fun and enjoyable. Once again, this highlights the importance of choosing a casino that partners with reputable software developers. There should be no features missing when using the mobile platform; full functionality should be available.</p>
<h2><strong>How do Online Casino Payouts Work?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Online casino payouts require players to manually request a withdrawal. It&#8217;s usually just a case of clicking the &#8216;Withdrawal&#8217; button, typing in the amount, and then confirming. The withdrawal will then show as &#8216;Pending&#8217;. This is where things can become frustrating, as casinos need to manually approve the payout before the funds are processed.</p>
<p>How long this takes will vary from one casino to the next. We found that it&#8217;s usually at least two working days. The casino will claim that it needs to verify all withdrawal requests for security purposes. In the meantime, players have the option of &#8216;Canceling&#8217; the withdrawal, meaning the funds are put back into their casino account balance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137903" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338667-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-04-16.png" alt="Mega Dice deposit process" width="900" height="726" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338667-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-04-16.png 1372w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338667-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-04-16-300x242.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338667-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-04-16-1024x825.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701338667-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-17-04-16-768x619.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>All that being said, <a href="https://www.softswiss.com/news/state-of-crypto-q1-23/">the rise of crypto gambling</a> has created a sea-change in how payouts are handled. This is because leading crypto casinos automatically approve withdrawals, meaning the funds are instantly transferred to the player&#8217;s private wallet. This reduces the payout time from days to minutes.</p>
<p>This is because <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2021/07/26/blog-cryptoassets-as-national-currency-a-step-too-far">crypto assets are not considered legal tender</a>, so there is less regulatory friction when processing withdrawals. This isn&#8217;t the case with traditional fiat payments.</p>
<p>Irrespective of where the casino platform is based, fiat money withdrawals trigger KYC compliance checks. This is a legal requirement for all instant payout casinos, as they must comply with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/financial-sector-policy/canadas-anti-money-laundering-and-anti-terrorist-financing-regime-strategy-2023-2026.html">anti-money laundering regulations</a>. As such, if you want to gamble with Canadian dollars, you&#8217;ll need to first upload some government-issued ID before payouts are approved.</p>
<h2><strong>Whatâs Considered a Fast Casino Withdrawal Time?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Most online casinos &#8216;aim&#8217; to process payouts within 1-2 working days. However, longer waits are common, especially if a large amount is being withdrawn. As we mentioned, your withdrawal will remain &#8216;Pending&#8217; until the casino manually approves it. Until it&#8217;s processed, there is nothing you can do to speed it up.</p>
<p>The only way to receive your winnings faster is by using an instant payout casino that specializes in cryptocurrencies. For example, Mega Dice approves payout requests instantly. This is also the case with Lucky Block and BC.Game. You simply need to paste your wallet address and the cryptocurrencies will be transferred straight away.</p>
<p>The entire process is automated, so the funds should arrive in under 10 minutes. Our research shows that in a small number of cases, even cryptocurrency casinos might need a little bit more time to approve the payout.</p>
<p>We found that this is usually because the player has requested a withdrawal to a new wallet address. Although this is permitted, the casino might want to make sure that the requested address is correct. After all, if the cryptocurrency tokens are transferred to the wrong wallet address, the casino won&#8217;t be able to help the player recover them.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Online gambling sites in Canada are known for slow and cumbersome payouts. Fortunately, there are many alternatives in the market that offer fast withdrawals.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that Lucky Block is the fastest payout online casino in Canada. Not only does Lucky Block approve payouts instantly but it doesn&#8217;t have a KYC policy. Lucky Block offers thousands of games and new players will receive a generous welcome bonus with fair terms.</p>

<h2><strong>Our Methodology When Ranking Instant Payout Casinos in Australia</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We ranked the best instant withdrawal casinos in Australia, our methodology focused on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safe Gambling Experience:Â </strong>We only considered an online casino if it offers Australian players a safe gambling experience. All of the top providers discussed are regulated. Moreover, games are provided by licensed software developers, many of which provide electronic games to land-based casinos in Australia.</li>
<li><strong>Instant Payouts: </strong>Our methodology only included online casinos that offer instant payouts. This means the casino processes withdrawal requests immediately, or within minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Wide Selection of Games: </strong>We focused on instant payout casinos with a broad selection of games. We looked for variations of blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and video poker, plus a large range of slots. We gave extra preference to casinos that double up as a sportsbook.</li>
<li><strong>Generous Bonuses With Fair Terms: </strong>The best online casinos listed on this page not only offer generous bonuses but with fair terms and conditions. This means wagering requirements that players can realistically achieve in the stated time frame.</li>
<li><strong>Data Protection: </strong>Many Australians are concerned about data breaches when gambling online. Therefore, our methodology focused on casinos that offer a private gambling experience. This means no KYC procedures or requests for personal information.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Pick the Best Online Casino in Australia With Fast Payouts</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Navigating through dozens of instant withdrawal casinos in Australia can be a daunting task. To ensure you select the best option, we&#8217;ve created a checklist of important considerations.</p>
<p>Read on for guidance on how to choose a top-rated online casino with speedy payouts.</p>
<h3><strong>Payout Times</strong></h3>
<p>If your main priority is fast payouts, the first step is to assess how long the casino takes to <em>approve</em> withdrawals. If the casino offers instant payouts, this information is often displayed on its homepage. That said, it&#8217;s worth browsing through its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We came across several casinos advertising instant withdrawals, but the terms and conditions yielded some concerning clauses. For instance, some casinos put limits on how much can be withdrawn each day. The best option is to select a casino that automates its payout processes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137859" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325583-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-26-02.jpg" alt="Lucky Block casino review" width="900" height="454" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325583-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-26-02.jpg 1772w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325583-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-26-02-300x151.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325583-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-26-02-1024x516.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325583-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-26-02-768x387.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325583-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-26-02-1536x774.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Lucky Block, for example, automatically approves withdrawals. For added security, you&#8217;ll need to confirm the withdrawal via two-factor authentication. After that, the cryptocurrencies will be sent to the blockchain. This means the funds will arrive in your wallet in a few minutes, depending on the network.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t feel comfortable using cryptocurrencies, Lucky Block, Mega Dice, and other top-rated providers also support debit/credit cards. However, due to increased anti-money laundering controls, fiat money payouts require additional checks. This means you won&#8217;t benefit from instant withdrawals like you get with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3><strong>Safety and Regulation</strong></h3>
<p>The best instant withdrawal casinos in Australia are located offshore. This means that you won&#8217;t be protected under Australian consumer laws. As such, it&#8217;s very important to use a reputable online casino that is well-regulated. This is why we rate Lucky Block as the best online casino in Australia with fast payouts.</p>
<p>Lucky Block has secured a remote gambling license from the Governor of CuraÃ§ao. This ensures that Australians can deposit and withdraw funds safely and that they can gamble in fair conditions. Moreover, Lucky Block has formed partnerships with regulated casino software providers. Examples include Evolution, NetEnt, Microgaming, and Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137858" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325518-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-25-09.png" alt="Lucky Block casino license " width="900" height="675" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325518-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-25-09.png 1410w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325518-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-25-09-300x225.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325518-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-25-09-1024x768.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325518-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-25-09-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>We would strongly suggest that you choose another casino if you come across an unregulated provider. What&#8217;s more, you should also check third-party review sites in Australia. This will enable you to evaluate the experiences of current players, especially when it comes to withdrawal times.</p>
<p>Data protection is another aspect to consider when choosing an online casino. After all, <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/privacy">privacy laws in Australia have required various amendments</a> in recent years due to large-scale data breaches. Fortunately, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">best Bitcoin betting sites</a> discussed on this page do not have a KYC process.</p>
<p>In simple terms, this means you won&#8217;t need to provide personal information or ID verification documents. This is on the proviso you deposit, gamble, and withdraw cryptocurrencies.Â  Therefore, data breaches are no longer a risk.</p>
<h3><strong>Accepted Payment Methods</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned, instant withdrawal casinos in Australia specialize in cryptocurrency payments. When researching a casino, check which cryptocurrencies it accepts.</p>
<p>Most cryptocurrency casinos accept Bitcoin and a range of altcoins. This should include Ethereum, Tether, BNB, and other popular digital assets.</p>
<h3><strong>Supported Gambling Games</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to fast payouts and a safe regulatory framework, you&#8217;ll want to check what gambling games the casino supports. For example, BC.Game is one of the best options for playing live dealer games. It supports 584 live tables across blackjack, craps, roulette, video poker, and baccarat.</p>
<p>This will appeal to players who want the &#8216;real&#8217; casino experience while playing online. If you&#8217;re more interested in pokies, Mega Dice is worth considering. Mega Dice offers over 4,000 pokie titles, covering Megaways and bonus buys. It also offers jackpot slots with low minimum bet requirements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137856" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03.jpg" alt="Mega Dice slot games" width="900" height="498" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03.jpg 1576w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03-300x166.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03-768x425.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325469-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-24-03-1536x850.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Importantly, it&#8217;s wise to check what software providers supply games to your chosen casino site. We prefer established software providers that are regulated by a reputable gambling body. For example, Pragmatic Play &#8211; which supplies games to Lucky Block, Mega Dice, and BC.Game is certified and licensed in over 20 countries.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you&#8217;re looking to place sports bets with competitive odds, Lucky Block is the stand-out provider. Its sportsbook covers over 40 sports, including footy, cricket, rugby league, rugby union, snooker, and darts. It also supports esports games like League of Legends and FIFA.</p>
<h3><strong>Casino Bonuses and PromotionsÂ </strong></h3>
<p>When choosing an online casino in Australia with real money and easy withdrawals, don&#8217;t forget about bonuses. This is a very competitive landscape with over 100 operators competing for your business. Therefore, you should &#8216;milk&#8217; as many welcome packages as you can.</p>
<p>But before claiming a sign-up bonus, you&#8217;ll want to check the terms and conditions.Â This ensures that the bonus comes with fair wagering requirements.</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-bitcoin-casino-bonuses.htm">best Bitcoin casino bonuses</a> come as a matched deposit. For example, Lucky Block matches the first deposit by 200% up to â¬10,000 or about $15,500. Mega Dice also matches the first deposit by 200%, up to 1 BTC. Both Lucky Block and Mega Dice also offer 50 spins. These are risk-free and simply require a minimum deposit of â¬20 (about $33) to qualify.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137861" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325664-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-27-18.jpg" alt="Mega Dice promotions " width="900" height="455" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325664-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-27-18.jpg 1591w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325664-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-27-18-300x152.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325664-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-27-18-1024x518.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325664-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-27-18-768x389.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325664-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-27-18-1536x777.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>We found that Wild.io is one of the best instant withdrawal casinos in Australia for regular promotions. These are bonuses offered to existing players. For instance, Wild.io offers free spins, cashback, and deposit reloads throughout the week. It&#8217;s also worth exploring loyalty programs.</p>
<p>The casino will credit your account with loyalty points whenever you place bets. As more points are accumulated, you&#8217;ll be upgraded to the next loyalty tier. As you keep climbing the loyalty ladder, you&#8217;ll be able to exchange your points for bonuses and other perks.</p>
<h3><strong>Accessibility </strong></h3>
<p>There are several factors to consider when exploring accessibility. First, the instant withdrawal casino should offer a smooth sign-up process. As we mentioned, casinos specializing in cryptocurrencies rarely have a KYC process in place. This means you only need to provide an email address.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t be the case when using a traditional online casino. On the contrary, you&#8217;ll need to provide KYC documents, such as a passport or driver&#8217;s license. This means it can take a couple of days to get set up, as the casino will need to manually review the documents.</p>
<p>If privacy is one of your main priorities, consider using a casino that operates on Telegram. Mega Dice has a popular Telegram casino that doesn&#8217;t require an account to be opened. All you need is a verified Telegram account, which only requires a mobile number. For more information, we&#8217;ve created a beginner&#8217;s guide on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-casinos.htm">best Telegram casinos</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure your chosen casino accepts Australian players. Even if the casino offers KYC-free accounts, it might block Australian IP addresses. We found that some Australian players will use a VPN to make it appear they&#8217;re from another country.</p>
<h3><strong>User ExperienceÂ </strong></h3>
<p>The best instant withdrawal casinos in Australia offer a great user experience. This means a simple account opening process alongside hassle-free deposits. The user experience should also be positive when withdrawing funds. You shouldn&#8217;t be required to wait around for the withdrawal to be processed.</p>
<p>This is why we prefer cryptocurrency casinos, as payouts are usually approved instantly. What&#8217;s more, the casino should make it seamless to search for and play games. Loading times should be fast and the gaming experience should cover both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
<h3><strong>Customer ServiceÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Using an instant payout casino outside of Australia can be daunting if you don&#8217;t have access to good customer service. In most cases, offshore casinos service players from around the world, meaning the customer service team operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137862" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325750-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-29-01.png" alt="Lucky Block casino live chat on mobile" width="435" height="617" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325750-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-29-01.png 808w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325750-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-29-01-212x300.png 212w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325750-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-29-01-722x1024.png 722w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325750-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-29-01-768x1089.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p>This is the case with Lucky Block, Mega Dice, BC.Game, and many other providers discussed today.Â We found that you&#8217;ll usually be connected to a live chat agent in seconds. This means you receive answers to your concerns straight away, rather than needing to wait for an email reply.</p>
<h2><strong>How do Online Casino Payouts Work?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Most online casinos in Australia follow a similar process when it comes to payouts. First, players must request a withdrawal from within their account dashboard. The amount must be stated and the funds will need to be transferred to the same payment method.</p>
<p>This ensures the casino complies with <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-legislation/related-legislation/anti-money-laundering">anti-money laundering (AML) regulations</a>. After all, <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-044mr-star-provides-150-million-for-fines-and-penalties-after-asic-raises-concerns/">ASIC recently fined Star Entertainment Group $150 million for AML violations</a>. Once the player confirms the payout request, it will then be sent to the casino&#8217;s payment team. Our research shows that on average, it takes 24-48 hours for online casinos to approve payouts.</p>
<p>Additional delays can occur if the request is made over the weekend. The casino will manually check the withdrawal and the respective player&#8217;s account. Once satisfied everything is in check, they will process the withdrawal. If the funds are being sent back to a debit/credit card, it will likely take an additional 48 hours to arrive. Bank payments can take even longer.</p>
<p>In addition, the first withdrawal made by players is often the slowest. This is because you can usually open an account and deposit funds without needing to upload ID verification documents. However, requests for documents will arrive when you make the initial withdrawal request.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137855" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325363-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-22-25.png" alt="How do Online Casino Payouts Work?" width="900" height="623" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325363-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-22-25.png 1716w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325363-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-22-25-300x208.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325363-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-22-25-1024x709.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325363-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-22-25-768x532.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701325363-screenshot-2023-11-30-at-13-22-25-1536x1063.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The KYC process requires a government-issued ID and a recently-issued proof of address. Once submitted, you&#8217;ll need to wait for the casino to verify them. This can add further delays, as it can take a few days for the documents to be approved. And, if there are any issues (such as an unclear document), you&#8217;ll need to submit the documents again.</p>
<p>Now consider the payout process when using a cryptocurrency-centric casino, such as Lucky Block or Mega Dice. As soon as the payout request is made, it will be approved instantly. The cryptocurrency tokens will be transferred to the player&#8217;s wallet. It&#8217;s important the correct wallet address is entered, as mistakes cannot be rectified once the transfer is made.</p>
<p>Thereon, it should only take a few minutes for the winnings to arrive in the wallet. That said, specific times are dependent on the blockchain network. Bitcoin, for example, is one of the slowest blockchains, so you&#8217;ll need to wait around 10 minutes. Other cryptocurrencies, like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Tether are considerably faster.</p>
<h2><strong>Whatâs Considered a Fast Casino Withdrawal Time?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We&#8217;ve established that regular online casinos usually take about 24-48 hours to approve withdrawals. Don&#8217;t forget, once approved, you still need to wait for the debit/credit card issuer or bank account provider to credit the payment. This can take an extra couple of days.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, same-day withdrawals would be considered fast, as this beats the industry average. For this guide, we&#8217;ve focused on Australian casinos that offer instant payouts. This means that withdrawal requests are automatically approved. After that, you&#8217;ll just need to wait for the blockchain network to verify the transaction.</p>
<p>Do note that in rare instances, there might be a slight delay when withdrawing funds from an instant withdrawal casino. For instance, if you request a cryptocurrency withdrawal to be sent to a new wallet address, the casino will likely ask for confirmation. This is to protect players from unauthorized withdrawals. Moreover, delays can also occur if additional anti-money laundering checks are required. This could be because of suspicious betting patterns or abnormally large wagers.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We&#8217;ve researched and reviewed the best instant withdrawal casinos in Australia. We select Lucky Block as the best option. Lucky Block is a regulated casino and sportsbook that approves payouts instantly.</p>
<p>It supports thousands of games and first-time customers will receive 50 free spins and a 200% deposit bonus. Lucky Block also offers top-notch customer support via live chat, 24/7.</p>

<h3><strong>2. MetaMask &#8211; Popular Decentralized Wallet for Storing ERC-20 Tokens and NFTs</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-wallet-review.htm">MetaMask</a> is one of the best DeFi crypto wallets for storing Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens.

<p>MetaMask provides users with a 12-word backup passphrase when creating a wallet. Only the user has access to the passphrase, ensuring that MetaMask remains decentralized at all times. The wallet is secured by a password, which needs to be entered when opening it.</p>
<p>While MetaMask supports a range of other networks, by default, it only connects to Ethereum. Other networks can be added manually. This includes Polygon, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. However, there is a lack of support for many notable blockchains. In addition to Bitcoin, this includes some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> &#8211; such as Cardano, Solana, and XRP.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-xrp-wallets.htm">popular XRP wallet</a> comes with an in-built staking tool that connects to Rocket Pool and Lido. Currently, these staking pools offer APYs of 3.8% and 4.3% on Ethereum deposits, respectively. For more options, MetaMask can be connected to decentralized applications. This can be done within the wallet interface or externally.</p>

<p>MetaMask also offers an in-built token-swapping tool. This enables users to trade tokens without going through a centralized exchange. All supported network standards are compatible. However, once again, better rates are often available when connecting to dApps like UniSwap or PancakeSwap.</p>
<p>MetaMask has also partnered with various third parties to process debit/credit card and e-wallet payments. This includes Sardine, MoonPey, PayPal, and Transak. Users are redirected to a supported payment provider based on their location and required cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h3><strong>4. OKX &#8211; Decentralized Wallet App With Aggregator Tool to Maximize Yields Â Â </strong></h3>
<p>OKX is also one of the best decentralized crypto wallets to consider today. Backed by one of the world&#8217;s leading exchanges, OKX is compatible with iOS and Android devices. It is free to download and comes packed with features. At the forefront of this is its exchange aggregator tool.</p>
<p>In simple terms, OKX scrapes data from over 200 <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">DeFi exchanges</a>. This allows investors to find the highest APYs when earning interest via staking, yield farming, and crypto savings accounts. Best of all, there is no requirement to visit external DeFi exchanges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="539" class="alignnone wp-image-125638 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet.jpg" alt="OKX crypto wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Instead, the OKX aggregator tool allows users to complete their investments via the wallet interface. Moreover, the OKX wallet also supports in-built token swaps. Users will almost always secure the best exchange rates, considering the aggregator tool checks over 200 platforms.</p>
<p>In terms of fees, OKX adds a markup when swapping tokens or earning interest. While there is no fixed commission, fees are clearly displayed before confirming orders. Finally, OKX supports dozens of blockchain networks &#8211; including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. However, there is no support for Bitcoin.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Trezor &#8211; Self-Custody Hardware Wallet Aimed at Long-Term Crypto Investors Â  Â </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en">Trezor</a> is one of the best decentralized crypto wallets for security. Retailing from $69, the Trezor device allows investors to keep their cryptocurrencies in cold storage. In simple terms, this means that Trezor is never connected to live servers.</p>
<p>As such, the cryptocurrencies stored are kept away from remote hackers at all times. That said, Trezor will not appeal to those that actively trade or move cryptocurrencies. This is because to transfer tokens out of Trezor, users need access to the device.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="527" class="alignnone wp-image-125640 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3.jpg" alt="Trezor Safe 3" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3-768x450.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Only after entering the PIN on the Trezor device is the transaction authorized. Nonetheless, Trezor connects to its native app for iOS and Android. This allows users to view their cryptocurrency balances, with real-time valuations.</p>
<p>The Trezor app also allows users to buy cryptocurrencies with a debit/credit card and other fiat payment methods. However, watch out for fees, as fiat payments are processed by third parties. Finally, Trezor supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. This includes Bitcoin and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">best utility tokens</a>, such as Ethereum, Polygon, and XRP.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Coinbase Wallet &#8211; User-Friendly DeFi Wallet for iOS and Android Devices Â Â </strong></h3>
<p>Coinbase Wallet is a decentralized wallet app for iOS and Android. This wallet is completely separate from the main Coinbase exchange &#8211; which is centralized. As such, Coinbase Wallet users have full control of their cryptocurrencies and private keys.</p>
<p>The wallet is free to download and ideal for beginners exploring <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-non-custodial-wallets.htm">non-custodial storage</a> for the first time. In fact, setting up the wallet takes seconds. Users simply need to choose a strong password and write down their backup passphrase.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311618/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Coinbase Wallet app" /></figure>
<p>The Coinbase Wallet states that it supports hundreds of thousands of coins. This includes large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Tether, Dogecoin, Polygon, and Solana. Coinbase Wallet also supports the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks.</p>
<p>As such, all ERC20 and BSC tokens are supported. Coinbase Wallet allows users to explore the decentralized web and connect to dApps like Uniswap and Compound. While in-built token swaps are not supported, this can be achieved by connecting to a dApp.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Electrum &#8211; Best Crypto DeFi Wallet for Storing Bitcoin on a Desktop Device Â Â </strong></h3>
<p>Those looking to store Bitcoin on a laptop or PC might consider Electrum the best decentralized wallet. It&#8217;s compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac and completely free to use. Electrum is one of the most established Bitcoin wallets, first launching in 2011.</p>
<p>While it comes with limited features, it&#8217;s packed with security tools. For example, Electrum enables users to keep their private keys in cold storage. This means the private keys remain offline until the user wants to make a transfer.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311619/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Electrum Bitcoin wallet" /></figure>
<p>Another security tool offered by Electrum is multi-signature permissions. This requires users to authorize outgoing transfers across two or more wallets. Like most decentralized wallets, Electrum is protected by a password.</p>
<p>If this is forgotten or the device is lost, damaged, or stolen &#8211; the wallet can be recovered with the backup passphrase. Finally, Electrum also offers a mobile app for Android smartphones. Unfortunately for Apple users, there are no plans to release an iOS version.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Crypto.com &#8211; Feature-Rich DeFi Wallet Supporting Interest Accounts Â Â </strong></h3>
<p>Crypto.com is a leading crypto exchange that also offers a decentralized wallet. This is a non-custodial wallet app for iOS and Android. There is also a browser extension and desktop software for those that prefer using a laptop device.</p>
<p>Crypto.com supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies across 30+ network standards. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, and its own network &#8211; Crypto.org Chain. The wallet is protected by a password and backup passphrase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222672/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-57-06.jpg" alt="" /> <img decoding="async" width="900" height="658" class="alignnone wp-image-125642 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet.jpg" alt="Crypto.com wallet app" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet-768x561.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The latter &#8211; which consists of a 12, 18, or 24-word passphrase, is displayed when setting up the wallet. Crypto.com enables users to set their own <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/learn/defi/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees">GAS fees</a> when transferring funds. This supports efficient transactions based on real-time GAS prices.</p>
<p>That said, one of the best features of the Crypto.com wallet is its in-built support for interest accounts. This supports over 25 cryptocurrencies, including Cronos, Cosmos, and Dai. Alternatively, the Crypto.com wallet can also connect to dApps like MM Finance and VVS Finance.</p>

<h3><strong>9. BitAddress &#8211; Open-Sourced Paper Wallet Provider for Free Cold Storage Â  Â Â </strong></h3>
<p>BitAddress is the best decentralized crypto wallet for cost-effective cold storage. Unlike Trezor and Ledger Nano, BitAddress is completely free to use. This is because BitAddress is a &#8216;paper&#8217; wallet solution. Here&#8217;s how it works. First, users visit the BitAddress website to create a new wallet address.</p>
<p>Within seconds, BitAddress will display two unique barcodes. One represents the wallet address. The other is the wallet&#8217;s private keys. The user can then transfer Bitcoin to the wallet address and finally &#8211; print the two bar codes onto a sheet of paper and keep it somewhere safe.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Bitaddress.org Bitcoin wallet" /></figure>
<p>In doing so, the Bitcoin tokens remain offline at all times. If the user wants to transfer the tokens to another wallet, they can scan the private key QR code. This imports the wallet credentials to the next wallet location.</p>
<p>In terms of safety, BitAddress is an <a href="https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org">open-sourced provider</a> that merely creates Bitcoin wallet addresses and private keys. This means it is the user&#8217;s responsibility to keep their credentials safe. Finally, BitAddress only supports Bitcoin &#8211; so this option won&#8217;t be suitable for diversified portfolios.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a Decentralized Wallet?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Decentralized wallets give users full control of their crypto investments. Unlike centralized wallets, only the user has access to their private keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, decentralized wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrency tokens safely. This is because users control their private keys.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to centralized wallets, which are often provided by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> or brokers. This is because centralized wallets do not provide users with their private keys. This means users need to trust the centralized provider will keep their funds safe.</p>
<p>Importantly, when setting up a decentralized wallet, private keys are usually provided in a simplified form. This is often a 12-word passphrase that needs to be entered in the correct order. Nonetheless, the decentralized wallet provider will never have access to the private keys.</p>
<p>This means users are responsible for safeguarding their wallets. If the wallet is compromised or the private keys are misplaced &#8211; the provider cannot help recover the funds.</p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Using a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the core benefits provided by decentralized wallets include sole custody of the private keys, access to dApps, and faster transaction times.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still not sure if a decentralized wallet is the best option?</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of using a decentralized wallet for storing cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3><strong>Full Control of Crypto Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>The main attraction of decentralized wallets is that users control their funds. This is because only the user has access to their private keys.</p>
<p>As such, only the user can authorize outgoing transactions. Moreover, entities &#8211; whether that&#8217;s the wallet provider or the government, cannot access the crypto funds.</p>
<p>This allows users to store wealth outside of the conventional financial system. In other words, users do not need to trust decentralized wallet providers as they do with centralized exchanges.</p>
<h3><strong>Faster Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>The best decentralized crypto wallets offer much faster transaction times when compared to centralized options.</p>
<p>This is because there is no requirement to have the transaction authorized by a third party.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, consider the process involved when storing crypto tokens on a centralized exchange</li>
<li>First, the user would need to request a withdrawal from the exchange</li>
<li>The user would need to wait for the exchange to approve the transfer</li>
<li>This could take minutes, hours, or days &#8211; this can vary widely depending on the centralized exchange</li>
<li>Once approved, only then will the crypto tokens be transferred to the recipient</li>
</ul>
<p>In comparison, there is no third-party approval process with decentralized wallets. As such, the transaction will be executed on the blockchain as soon as it is verified by the wallet owner.</p>
<h3><strong>Store a Great Number of Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>When using a centralized wallet, the number of supported tokens will often be limited. This is because users can only store tokens that are supported by the exchange.</p>
<p>In comparison, the best DeFi wallets support thousands, sometimes <i>millions,</i> of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Take Trust Wallet as a prime example. We found that Trust Wallet is compatible with over 70 blockchain networks and 4.5 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This enables investors to store all of their digital assets in one safe place.</p>
<h3><strong>Access Web 3.0 dAppsÂ </strong></h3>
<p>The best decentralized crypto wallets provide seamless access to Web 3.0 dApps.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="DApps list" /></figure>
<p>Some of the most commonly supported dApps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>UniSwap</li>
<li>SushiSwap</li>
<li>PancakeSwap</li>
<li>OpenSea</li>
<li>Compound</li>
<li>Yearn.finance</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are hundreds more. Crucially, these dApps offer access to decentralized finance tools, such as token swaps, staking, yield farming, and dual investments.</p>
<h3><strong>Anonymity Â </strong></h3>
<p>Another popular feature of decentralized crypto wallets is they offer complete anonymity. This means users can create a wallet without providing any personal information or contact details.</p>
<p>All users need to access their wallet is the respective password or private keys.</p>
<h2><strong>Centralized vs Decentralized Wallets</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The responsibility of &#8216;custodianship&#8217; is how DeFi and centralized wallets are differentiated. Centralized wallet providers are tasked with keeping the user&#8217;s cryptocurrencies safe. While DeFi wallets give users full control &#8211; meaning they are responsible for looking after their private keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeFi and centralized wallets both enable users to store their cryptocurrency tokens. The key difference is in who takes responsibility for safeguarding the wallet&#8217;s private keys.</p>
<p>In the case of centralized wallets, private keys are secured by the provider. This is often a crypto exchange or broker. As such, users do not have access to their private keys. In turn, if the custodian is hacked or goes bankrupt (like FTX), the user&#8217;s crypto funds are at risk.</p>
<p>DeFi crypto wallets, on the other hand, give users full control of their funds and private keys. This means that there is no reliance on a third-party custodian. Users can send and receive funds at any time without needing approval from another person or entity.</p>
<p>However, there is nowhere to turn if the DeFi wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys. Therefore, while DeFi wallets give users control of their wealth &#8211; appropriate security practices should be taken.</p>
<p>This means keeping the private keys offline at all times &#8211; preferably written down on a sheet of paper. In doing so, the user can recover their wallet if they forget their password or the device is lost or stolen.</p>
<h2><strong>Different Types of DeFi Wallets</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Now that we have established the difference between centralized and DeFi wallets, we can explore the different types available.</p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Most crypto investors opt for a software-based decentralized wallet. Software wallets are often referred to as &#8216;hot storage&#8217;. This is because the funds remain online at all times, increasing both convenience and risk.</p>
<p>Software wallets come in many forms, but mobile apps are particularly popular. Decentralized wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet both offer an app for iOS and Android. This enables users to secure their crypto funds with a PIN or fingerprint ID.</p>
<p>Mobile wallets are very convenient for actively managing crypto portfolios. At the click of a button, users can send, receive, and trade crypto right from their smartphones.</p>
<p>Software wallets also come as a browser extension. For example, MetaMask offers an extension for Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox browsers. This enables users to access the crypto markets whenever they are on their laptops.</p>
<p>Some decentralized wallets come as desktop software, but this is less common. One of the most popular desktop wallets is Electrum, which safely stores Bitcoin on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Hardware wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrencies on a device. The private keys are held on the device and kept offline at all times.</p>
<p>To transfer crypto to another wallet, users must enter a PIN on the hardware device. This offers an ultra-secure way to store large amounts of crypto.</p>
<p>Equally, hardware wallets are far from convenient for active crypto traders. This is because making last-minute trades is cumbersome, considering access to the hardware device is needed.</p>
<p>The leading hardware wallet providers are Trezor and Ledger Nano. Both are decentralized, as neither provider has access to the device&#8217;s private keys.</p>
<p>However, do remember that users will need to provide some personal and financial information when buying a hardware wallet online.</p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Paper wallets also offer a decentralized way to store crypto tokens. As we mentioned earlier, BitAddress allows users to instantly create a Bitcoin wallet address and private keys.</p>
<p>Both are represented by a QR code, which the user can print onto a sheet of paper. As long as the paper is kept somewhere safe and private, the crypto funds remain unhackable.</p>
<h2><strong>How Secure Are Decentralized Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
First and foremost, there is no requirement to trust a third party when using a decentralized wallet. After all, decentralized wallets merely provide a bridge between crypto transactions and the blockchain.</p>
<p>However, decentralized wallets will always be at risk from remote hacking attempts and theft. As such, users must ensure that they follow sensible security practices to keep their crypto funds safe.</p>
<p>For example, those using a mobile wallet should ensure that a suitable PIN is used. This should be in addition to a lock-screen password for the smartphone. If someone is able to bypass these security measures, they will have access to the wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet data" /></figure>
<p>This is also the case for desktop and browser extension wallets. Another way for hackers to access a decentralized wallet is through &#8216;links&#8217;. For example, a scammer might impersonate the wallet&#8217;s support team and send a link for the user to click.</p>
<p>Unwittingly, the link might install a virus or keylogger, enabling the scammer to access the wallet remotely. The safeguard here is to never click links from unknown sources &#8211; whether that&#8217;s on social media or emails.</p>
<p>The safest option is to keep the crypto wallet offline at all times. For example, consider installing the wallet on a cheap smartphone that is never connected to the internet. Similarly, users might also consider a paper wallet that is stored away from the risk of theft or damage,</p>
<p>Ultimately, decentralized wallets <i>are</i> safe, but users must also take responsibility too. Users also need to consider that increased convenience often leads to reduced security.</p>
<p>For example, while software wallets are convenient for actively trading and investing crypto, the private keys will always be vulnerable to hackers. As such, users should only keep small amounts of crypto in a software wallet.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Select the Best Decentralized Crypto Wallet?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Choosing a suitable wallet is a crucial part of the crypto investing process.</p>
<p>Therefore, this section highlights the most important factors to look for when choosing the best decentralized crypto wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p>Decentralized wallets provide users with their private keys, ensuring that wealth is built and maintained without third parties.</p>
<p>However, decentralized wallets are still vulnerable to hackers. As such, choosing the best decentralized wallet requires users to consider what security features are included.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask are secured by a PIN</li>
<li>Desktop and browser-based wallets are secured by a password</li>
<li>Hardware wallets are secured via cold storage. Plus, users need to enter a PIN on the device to transfer funds</li>
</ul>
<p>In comparison, centralized wallets offer additional security features. This can include device whitelisting, two-factor authentication, and even insurance.</p>
<h3><strong>Supported Networks</strong></h3>
<p>The number and type of blockchain networks supported by decentralized wallets will vary wildly. For example, Trust Wallet supports over 70 networks. This includes Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> &#8211; like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrencies list" /></figure>
<p>In contrast, Electrum only supports one cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin. Crucially, users should check which networks and cryptocurrencies are supported by choosing a decentralized wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Device Type</strong></h3>
<p>Consider the most convenient and secure device type to store the decentralized crypto wallet. Options include desktop software, browser extensions, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>For offline storage, consider a hardware or paper wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3>
<p>Another factor to consider is user-friendliness.</p>
<p>For instance, beginners should explore whether the chosen decentralized wallet is suitable for their skill set. Sending and receiving crypto should be simple, as should setting up and securing the wallet.</p>
<p>More experienced crypto investors might seek a crypto wallet with more advanced features. For example, Electrum offers multi-signature permissions. While this adds a great level of security to the wallet, this feature is not suitable for newbies.</p>
<h3><strong>Investment and Trading Features</strong></h3>
<p>The best decentralized wallets enable users to maximize their crypto investments. For example, OKX has an in-built aggregator tool that connects to over 200 dApps.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="Trending crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>Users can search for the crypto they currently hold in the OKX wallet and locate the highest APYs available. OKX also comes with an in-built token-swapping tool, not to mention a fully-fledged NFT marketplace.</p>
<p>In contrast, the likes of BitAddress and Electrum do not offer any such features.</p>
<h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Use a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Below, we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up an account and use our top decentralized wallet, Best Wallet, which should only take five minutes.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Download Best Wallet App</strong></h3>
<p>First, find the Best Wallet app, which is available on mobile for Android and iOS in the App Store and the Play Store and download it.</p>
<p>A desktop browser extension is currently in development and will be released soon.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" alt="Best Wallet mobile app" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Create an Account</strong></h3>
<p>As a leading self-custody, decentralized wallet, all that&#8217;s needed to create an account is an active email address.</p>
<p>There is no KYC requirements to fill in, allowing for anonymous storage and transfers.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Choose Security Settings</strong></h3>
<p>Next, choose the level of security you wish to attach to the account.</p>
<p>All accounts will require a four-digit passcode to be input and confirmed, while there is the option to add two-factor authentication and/or fingerprint ID.</p>
<p>Once that step is complete, an account will have been created, but users should head to the settings tab and note down their private key.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>An account has now been created and users will be redirected to Best Wallet dashboard, where they will be able to purchase or store crypto an trade on the built-in DEX.</p>
<p>As outlined above, some features are not yet live at the time of writing but will be launched in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/best-wallet-homescreen.jpg" alt="Best Wallet main wallet" /></figure>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In summary, decentralized wallets offer many benefits for crypto investors. This includes having full control of the wallet&#8217;s private keys, enabling investors to become their own bank.</p>
<p>Decentralized wallets are also ideal for connecting to Web3 applications, as well as remaining anonymous. That said, do remember that decentralized wallets also invite risk. If the wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys &#8211; the crypto funds will likely be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to choose wisely when selecting a decentralized wallet, with Best Wallet our top pick and an excellent choice. The self-custody wallet allows for accounts to be created in less than five minutes with no KYC verification needed, with users able to securely store crypto and trade tokens via built-in DEX.</p>
<p>It stands out ahead of its rivals because it is more than just a crypto wallet &#8211; its native token $BEST can be staked to earn rewards and holding it also grants other benefits such as early access to new projects and NFTS and reduced fees, while the platform will also offer unique insights and data on trending tokens.</p>
<p>$BEST is not yet live but will be airdropped to active users of the wallet in the near future.</p>

<h2><strong>Mega Dice &#8211; First Licensed Telegram Casino in the WorldÂ </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Mega Dice has just made a groundbreaking development in the crypto casino industry. This is the first ever licensed crypto casino to be completely accessible via the <a href="https://t.me/megadicecasinobot">Telegram app</a>.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice is leveraging the growing popularity of Telegram, which is being used by more than 700 million people from all over the world. This popular application offers robotic capabilities and can self-execute commands generated by users.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117387/322623/screen-shot-2023-08-08-at.jpg" alt="Mega Dice Telegram Casino" /></figure>
<p>Mega Dice has introduced the Telegram app to allow users to dictate decisions that can be automatically executed by the Telegram bot.Â </p>
<p>Thus, users do not need to visit the website directly and can instead give commands to the Telegram robot. One such advantage is instant sign-up, with the telephone number needed to download the app used as a unique customer reference.</p>
<p>With this giant breakthrough, Mega Dice will be coming after other industry leaders, such as Stake.com, which generated a recent of over $2.6. billion in 2022. Not only will Mega Dice be in contention with these casinos, but it will also gain the first-mover advantage. Thus, we may see a new demographic that is interested in associating with the crypto gambling niche.</p>
<p>Since millions of crypto-based traders already use Telegram, this innovative solution should help attract new customers in the long term. Mega Dice has stated that this development showcases their passion for their user base, as they are looking to promote innovative and user-friendly ways of accessing gambling services.</p>
<p>This popular platform offers multiple live casino and table games, such as Baccarat, Blackjack, and Bac Bo, offered by some of the top software companies. Furthermore, users can bet on popular games, such as Aviator and Plinko, through the Telegram bot.Â </p>
<h3><strong>WalletConnect</strong></h3>
<p>Another exciting feature for Mega Dice users is via WalletConnect, an open-source software protocol that allows users to connect to dozens of leading Web3 wallets.</p>
<p>This includes the likes of TrustWallet, Coinbase and MetaMask, and ends the need to make cumbersome wallet-to-wallet transfers that take time and effort.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117387/329873/lucky-block-wallet-connect.jpg" alt="Lucky Block Crypto Wallet Options" /></figure>
<p>Once a connection is made with a chosen wallet, WalletConnect allows Mega Dice users to deposit or withdraw at the click of a button.</p>
<p>This option also further increases anonymity for players, making it one of the best in the space for security and anonymity.</p>

<h3><strong>Mega Dice Welcome Bonuses</strong></h3>
<p>Mega Dice is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoin-casino-sites.htm">best altcoin casino sites</a> for welcome bonuses. This makes sense, considering that Mega Dice is a brand-new platform that aims to increase its client base.Â </p>
<p>After opening an account for the first time, new players will have their first deposit matched. The deposit is matched by 200% up to 1 BTC. Based on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current BTC/USD prices</a>, we value the Mega Dice deposit boost at approximately $27,000.Â </p>
<p>This is in addition to 50 free spins, playable on the Wanted Dead or a Wild slot game.Â </p>
<p>Now for the key terms and conditions to be aware of.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>First, the minimum deposit to qualify for the deposit boost is â¬20 (crypto equivalent).</li>
<li>All supported cryptocurrencies are eligible.</li>
<li>Â The deposit must be made within 30 days of opening the account.Â </li>
<li>Most importantly, the bonus funds must be wagered 40 times before a withdrawal can be made.Â </li>
<li>While this might seem high, 40x reflects the industry average.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>Players have 14 days to meet the wagering requirements for the deposit boost. While winnings deriving from the free spins must be wagered within seven days. The maximum wager when using bonus funds is â¬3.</p>
<p>Only slots will contribute 100% to the wagering target. Live game shows (50%) and other titles (20%) contribute less. Â Â </p>

<p>The Dog House Multihold is a popular slot game by <a href="https://www.pragmaticplay.com/en/games/the-dog-house-multihold/">Pragmatic Play</a>. It comes with a standard 5&#215;3 grid and 20 paylines. The RTP of this game is 96.06%, and the maximum payout is 9,000x the player&#8217;s stake.Â </p>

<p>The feature round can be accessed by landing a bonus symbol on reels 1, 3, and 5. This triggers the free spins round with multiplier bonuses.Â </p>
<p><strong>Wild West Gold MegawaysÂ </strong></p>
<p>Also backed by Pragmatic Play, Wild West Gold is a popular megaways slot. It comes with an unprecedented 117,649 ways to win. This is because each winning combination removes symbols from the grid, meaning new wins can be generated.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117387/313822/screenshot-2023-06-20-at-.jpg" alt="Wild West Gold MegawaysÂ Casino Game" /></figure>
<p>The maximum payout stands at 5,000x the player&#8217;s stake. Wild West Gold Megaways has an RTP of 95.35%. This slot game doubles up as a bonus buy slot. This allows players to buy access to the free spins feature round. Do note that this will cost 100x the player&#8217;s stake.Â </p>
<p><strong>Blaze of RaÂ </strong></p>
<p>Blaze of Ra is a popular slot game supplied by Push Gaming. It follows an Ancient Egyptian theme with superb graphics and sound effects. The RTP of this slot game is 96.4%, and it&#8217;s classed as a mid-high volatility slot.Â </p>

<p><a href="https://www.pushgaming.com/games/play/blaze-ra.html">According to Push Gaming</a>, Blaze of Ra does not come with a maximum payout. Therefore, this slot will appeal to players seeking huge jackpots.Â </p>
<p><strong>Toshi Video Club Â </strong></p>
<p>Toshi Video Club is a classic video slot developed by Hacksaw Gaming. It comes with just 15 paylines, which will appeal to those that prefer simple slot games. That said, Toshi Video Club comes with a huge win multiplier of 10,000x the player&#8217;s stake.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117387/313825/screenshot-2023-06-20-at-.jpg" alt="Toshi Video Club Slot Game" /></figure>

<p><strong>20 Mega Fresh Â </strong></p>
<p>20 Mega Fresh is one of the newest slot games on the Mega Dice platform. Backed by CT Interactive, the slot follows a classic 5&#215;3 grid layout. It comes with an RTP of 95.55% and a mid-to-high variance.Â </p>

<p>While the minimum bet is just $0.20, the maximum spin size is just $10. As such, 20 Mega Fresh is more suited to casual slot players.Â </p>
<p>All in all, the Mega Dice slots department covers all bases, with new titles being added regularly.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Roulette</strong></h3>
<p>Our Mega Dice review also came across a comprehensive table game department. This includes various roulette titles backed by Spinomenal, Evolution, and other leading developers.Â </p>

<p>For example, we mentioned above that Evolution is licensed by the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UK&#8217;s Gambling Commission</a>. This is also the case with Pragmatic Play.Â </p>
<p>Other leading software developers providing games for Mega Dice include Hacksaw Gaming, Push Gaming, CT Gaming, and Nolimit City. Â This ensures that gaming outcomes are fair and random.Â </p>
<p>Additionally, Mega Dice also hosts provably fair games from <a href="https://spribe.co/">Spribe</a>.Â </p>
<h2><strong>Mega Dice Payments &amp; Withdrawals</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Payments at Mega Dice are frictionless and automated. Players simply need to choose their preferred cryptocurrency, copy the deposit address, and complete the transfer.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we have covered the casino gaming suite, let&#8217;s explore how Mega Dice performs in the payments department.Â </p>
<p>First, here&#8217;s a list of cryptocurrencies that players fund their accounts with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
<li>Tether</li>
<li>LitecoinÂ </li>
<li>EthereumÂ </li>
<li>XRPÂ </li>
<li>DogecoinÂ </li>

<p>Deposits can be made on a wallet-to-wallet basis, much like adding coins to a crypto exchange. Once logged in, users can choose their preferred cryptocurrency. Then, Mega Dice displays the unique deposit address.Â </p>
<p>Users can click on &#8216;Copy&#8217; and paste the address into their private wallet. Alternatively, those using a mobile wallet can scan the QR code displayed. This option ensures that mistakes are avoided.Â </p>
<p>However, as revealed in more detail above, users can also use WalletConnect to streamline this process.</p>
<p>WalletConnect links to dozens of different Web3 wallets and allows users to instantly and anonymously deposit and withdraw with one click.</p>
<h3><strong>Deposit Terms</strong></h3>
<p>Each supported cryptocurrency comes with a minimum deposit amount. For example, those opting for Bitcoin will need to deposit at least 0.0001 BTC. While depositing Ethereum requires at least 0.01 ETH.</p>
<p>Do remember that to claim the Mega Dice welcome bonus, a deposit of at least â¬20 (crypto equivalent) is required. In terms of processing times, payments are credited automatically. Just one Bitcoin confirmation is needed, meaning BTC should be credited in 10-20 minutes.Â </p>
<p>Other supported cryptocurrencies offer much faster processing times. For example, Ethereum and Tether deposits should be credited in under a minute.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Withdrawal Terms</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to payouts, the minimum withdrawal on Mega Dice is â¬10 (crypto equivalent). There are no withdrawal fees as long as the initial deposit has been wagered at least once.Â </p>
<p>If not, then Mega Dice will deduct 8% at a minimum of â¬4. Another term to be aware of is the maximum withdrawal limit. Mega Dice states that if the withdrawn balance is 10 times the deposit amount, only â¬5,000 can be withdrawn per month.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice does not specify its payout times.</p>

<p>The Mega Dice casino and sportsbook are simple to use, so no prior experience is needed. This is also the case with opening an account. Users simply need to provide an email address, username, and password; and the account is opened instantly.Â </p>
<p>We also found that making deposits is seamless. After choosing the cryptocurrency they want to deposit, players are shown their unique wallet address. As noted earlier, players can copy the address or scan the QR code.Â </p>
<p>There is no requirement to check the deposit transaction, as payments are credited automatically. Finding games on Mega Dice is also straightforward. Users can click on their preferred gambling product, such as &#8216;Slots&#8217;, &#8216;Live Casino&#8217;, or &#8216;Crash&#8217;.Â </p>

<p>Overall, our Mega Dice review found the platform is suitable for beginners and experienced gamblers alike.Â </p>
<h2><strong>Mega Dice Mobile App</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>First and foremost, Mega Dice does not offer a native mobile app, but through Telegram it is fully accessible on a mobile.Â </p>
<p>The platform has optimized both its casino and sportsbook for mobile browsers. This allows players to log into their Mega Dice accounts anywhere, at any time.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117387/313836/screenshot-2023-06-20-at-.jpg" alt="Mega Dice Mobile Application Dashboard" /></figure>
<p>The mobile version of Mega Dice comes with full functionality. In addition to playing games, this includes deposits, withdrawals, and contacting customer support. All functions are clearly displayed and are not hindered by smaller screens.Â </p>
<p>For example, clicking on the &#8216;Wallet&#8217; button at the bottom brings up the payments page. Then, users can choose which cryptocurrencies they want to deposit or withdraw via WalletConnect.</p>
<h2><strong>Mega Dice Licensing &amp; Security</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although Mega Dice is a new casino site that was recently launched, it has secured a regulatory license from the Governor of CuraÃ§ao. This highlights that the casino takes player safety seriously.Â </p>
<p>The license was issued to its parent company, MIBS B.V. The Master Gaming License number is #5536/JAZ. This can be verified on the <a href="https://www.curacao-egaming.com/">CuraÃ§ao eGaming website</a>.Â </p>

<p>What&#8217;s more, players are not required to enter any sensitive payment information when making deposits. Instead, deposits are made from the player&#8217;s private key &#8211; which Mega Dice does not have access to.Â Once the transfer is made, players can rely on the blockchain confirmation code. This proves that the payment was sent to Mega Dice. But this won&#8217;t be as necessary, as payments are credited automatically.Â </p>

<h2>Fastest Payout Online Casinos Reviewed</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The crypto casinos listed above each offer instant, or near-instant, withdrawals.Â  However, due to the sheer number of crypto casinos offering rapid withdrawal services, players also need to assess other metrics associated with the platform.Â </p>
<p>For instance, the type of casino games offered, supported software providers, welcome bonuses and existing player promotions, and reputation.Â  Read on to discover the best online casinos with instant withdrawal.Â </p>
<h3>1. Mega Dice &#8211;Â  Fastest Payout Online Casino</h3>
<p>Mega Dice is our best instant pay casino and one of our overall <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best Bitcoin casinos</a> for several reasons &#8211; it utilizes Telegram and blockchain technology to facilitate instant, secure, and anonymous deposits and withdrawals that are processed instantly and come with no fees or limits.</p>
<p>Mega Dice offers a 200% matched bonus for the initial deposit, with a minimum of $20, which means if you deposited $100, you could benefit from a bonus of $200, provided all other wagering requirements are met. Mega Dice also offers 50 free spins and a $1 minimum deposit.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/99791/322902/screen-shot-2023-08-09-at.jpg" alt="Mega Dice instant withdrawal casino website" /></figure>
<p>The platform is operated by MIBS B.V., under the regulations and licensing of the Curacao Gaming Commission, and is available to players globally without the need for a VPN. Despite being fully licensed and regulated, it also provides anonymity to users with a KYC free sign-up &#8211; this feature is highly sought after by crypto proponents who do not want to have their online activities monitored and tracked.Â </p>
<p>One thing that really sets it apart from the competition, however, is that it was the first provider in the world to offer <a href="https://bs_c22ac4a3.cryptonewsdom.care/">licensed gambling to users through Telegram</a>. Mega Dice games can be played directly through the Mega Dice Telegram Casino Bot. The bot redirects users to the popular messaging app and allows them to create an account instantly and anonymously, as well as play games directly on mobile.</p>
<p>The familiarity and popularity of Telegram, combined with the Mega Dice Casino, is a potent partnership that improves both accessibility and usability for customers. Telegram currently has over 700 million users, many of whom are interested in DeFi and Web3, and allows for instant deposits and withdrawals, with no fees or limits.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/99791/322903/screen-shot-2023-08-09-at.jpg" alt="Mega Dice Telegram casino bot" /></figure>
<p>More than a dozen different cryptocurrencies are accepted on fast cash-out casino Mega Dice, including BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, USDT, XRP, TRX, ADA, and DOGE.Â </p>
<p>In addition to its large variety of game offerings, with more than 5,000 slots available, as well as casino games, and a sportsbook. Mega Dice places great emphasis on providing good customer support, which is available 24/7. It&#8217;s a top online casino and could become even more prominent in 2023, thanks to its Telegram partnership which will vastly increase its appeal for users.Â </p>

<h3>3. TG.Casino &#8211; Telegram-Powered Casino with Huge Rewards</h3>
<p><u>TG.Casino ($TGC)</u> is an instant-withdrawal instant-deposit Telegram-powered crypto casino. It offers some of the best rewards to players in the space as its native token can be staked and will be used for a token buyback/burn scheme.</p>
<p>TG.Casino is another globally accessible casino that allows players to deposit and withdraw instantaneously through the Telegram messaging application. No account is required, there is no KYC whatsoever, and the player retains control over the funds. The minimum deposit is a $1 crypto equivalent and this is a legal endeavor, fully licensed with a base in Curacao.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/99791/334092/screen-shot-2023-10-18-at.jpg" alt="TG Casino token presale instant withdrawal" /></figure>
<p>Unlike legacy casinos, TG.Casino generates APY for token holders, currently in the region of 425%. The native token is not needed to play in the casino, though there is a 25% cashback advantage of losing bets placed in $TGC. There is a 200% welcome bonus for those who join, up to 10 ETH.</p>
<p>Aside from an easy onboarding process with instant deposits/withdrawals, TG.Casino has a different revenue generation mechanism than Web3 casinos. It uses its revenue to buy back the token and 40% of it is burned, promoting price appreciation for the coin. This means that token holders are in a sense shareholders of the platform. The $TGC token can be likened to stock, its price depending on how well the casino is performing.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/99791/334093/screen-shot-2023-10-18-at.jpg" alt="TG Casino features" /></figure>
<p>The price per token is $0.125 and there are 40 million available in the presale, for a hard cap of $5 million. It has already reached its soft cap of $1 million and is nearly at the $1.2 million mark. To take part in the presale, a compatible Web3 wallet such as MetaMask is necessary. Acceptable cryptos include ETH, BNB, and USDT.</p>
<p>More information about this instant withdrawal casino can be found in the social accounts &#8211; <a href="https://t.me/TG_CasinoCommunity"><u>Telegram</u></a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/TGCasino_"><u>Twitter</u></a> &#8211; along with the TG.Casino <a href="https://tg-casino.gitbook.io/tg.casino-whitepaper/"><u>Whitepaper</u></a>.</p>

<h3>5. Metaspins &#8211; Best Instant Withdrawal Casino with Small WageringÂ </h3>
<p>MetaSpins continues to extend its fee-free withdrawal offer into 2023 &#8211; not only that, but Metaspins approves all withdrawal requests instantly. Deposits are processed quickly too, albeit, the specific time will depend on the respective blockchain network. Metaspins accepts a plethora of cryptocurrencies when it comes to making a deposit.Â </p>
<p>It is one of our top choices because the welcome bonus comes with much lower wagering requirements than some rival sites on this list &#8211; 25x compared to 40-plus for others.</p>

Conventional software-backed gambling providers are also supported, including the likes of BetSoft, Ezugi, Big Time Gaming, and Playson.Â </p>
<p>Some of the most popular games played at Metaspins include blackjack, slots, roulette, crypto crash, and dice. Although Metaspins is one of the best instant withdrawal online casinos, there is no sportsbook.Â </p>

<h3>8. Cloudbet &#8211; Highly Trusted and Long-Established Instant Pay CasinoÂ </h3>
<p>Cloudbet is an established crypto casino and sportsbook that was founded in 2013, giving it a high trust score in the community after operating for more than a decade. It is also a firm favorite on this list of the fastest payout online casinos. In fact, we found that in most cases, Cloudbet will automatically approve withdrawal requests &#8211; meaning that players will receive their winnings in a matter of minutes.Â </p>
<p>As is the case with many providers, however, larger withdrawals or those that appear suspicious might attract a slight delay. Nonetheless, Cloudbet accepts a wide range of cryptocurrencies for the purpose of making deposits and withdrawals. This includes Bitcoin, Tether, Dogecoin, Dash, Litecoin, and others. The minimum deposit is 0.001 BTC or the altcoin equivalent.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95768/238792/image.jpg" alt="Cloudbet fast cashout casino bonus" /></figure>
<p>Open a Cloudbet account today to benefit from a huge welcome package worth of up to 5 BTC, where the first deposit will be matched by 100%. Cloudbet incrementally releases the bonus funds, with 0.001 BTC being cleared for every 150 points earned. Each game on Cloudbet will offer a different stake-to-point ratio, but slots are generally the most efficient in this regard. Â Â </p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instant Payout Online Casinos vs Fastest Paying Online Casinos</span></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fast payout online casinos are classified in two ways: instantaneous and fast. Instant withdrawal casinos have payment processing times of less than 24 hours. The time taken to process your request and to receive the money in your account is included. If you choose a fast payout casino, you will receive your money in three days.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Process Times Can Differ</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here are some cautions. The processing time includes the time required to approve your withdrawal request. Fast-payout online casinos may offer the same payment method but with different timings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Casino A may approve requests in 12 hours, while Casino B could take 48. Casino A can complete crypto withdrawals within 24 hours. Casino B will take at least 48. Both casinos can be categorized as &#8220;fast payouts&#8221; because they offer fast payment methods, such as Bitcoin. When comparing specific timeframes, the casino offers faster payouts.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Banking Methods Are Important</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Online banking methods such as cryptocurrencies offer faster payouts than legacy banking methods such as debit cards. It&#8217;s because legacy financial systems were designed on the internet. These systems use different protocols for online banking. Digital wallets offer the fastest payouts.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Fastest Methods of Withdrawal at Instant Withdrawal Casinos &#8211; A Breakdown</span></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While we have talked much about fast withdrawals at online casinos, we have yet to say much about payment methods. Below is a list of the most efficient and popular ways to pay.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cryptocurrency</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-135332" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678257-instant-withdrawal-casinos-that-payout-in-crypto.webp" alt="instant payout bitcoin casino" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678257-instant-withdrawal-casinos-that-payout-in-crypto.webp 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678257-instant-withdrawal-casinos-that-payout-in-crypto-300x200.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678257-instant-withdrawal-casinos-that-payout-in-crypto-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678257-instant-withdrawal-casinos-that-payout-in-crypto-768x512.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cryptocurrencies have become the dominant payment method within the offshore betting domain, with digital tokens establishing a robust value correlation to the US dollar. Their exceptional speed and security have positioned cryptocurrencies as the preeminent choice for transactions, particularly favored by fast-payout casinos that routinely process withdrawals within 24 to 48 hours. These instantaneous transactions, following operator approval, make cryptocurrencies a cornerstone in the architecture of instant withdrawal casinos.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is a slight trade-off: engaging with cryptocurrencies requires registration with a digital exchange, where players can purchase, deposit, and withdraw their digital currencies. Although platforms such as CoinBase are integral to this process, they may impose additional withdrawal fees. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency transactions&#8217; swift and secure nature continues to make them an attractive option for savvy online players seeking efficiency and confidentiality in their financial dealings.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Visa and Mastercard</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-135331" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678161-fastest-payout-methods-by-online-casinos-that-pay-to-visa-or-mastercard.webp" alt="instant payout crypto casinos with visa or mastercard" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678161-fastest-payout-methods-by-online-casinos-that-pay-to-visa-or-mastercard.webp 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678161-fastest-payout-methods-by-online-casinos-that-pay-to-visa-or-mastercard-300x200.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678161-fastest-payout-methods-by-online-casinos-that-pay-to-visa-or-mastercard-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678161-fastest-payout-methods-by-online-casinos-that-pay-to-visa-or-mastercard-768x512.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Visa and MasterCard stand as the titans of global payment processing, their ubiquitous presence and esteemed reputation assuring users of secure and proficient withdrawal transactions. Industry pioneers guarantee a standard of safety and efficiency recognized worldwide. Withdrawals via these networks are systematically processed within three to five business days, a testament to their steadfast service. Notably, Las Atlantis is among the select operators that accommodate withdrawals through these channels, reflecting their international acclaim for excellence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that while Visa and MasterCard are synonymous with reliability, they do not specialize in the rapidity of transactions. As such, for those prioritizing speed, these providers do not fall into the category of fast withdrawal options. Despite this, their entrenched standing in the financial services sector continues to make them a favored choice for users who value security and establishing trust over immediacy.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">PayPal &amp; Ewallets</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-135330" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678070-fast-payout-crypto-casinos-that-pay-to-e-wallet.webp" alt="fast crypto casino payouts through e-wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678070-fast-payout-crypto-casinos-that-pay-to-e-wallet.webp 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678070-fast-payout-crypto-casinos-that-pay-to-e-wallet-300x200.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678070-fast-payout-crypto-casinos-that-pay-to-e-wallet-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700678070-fast-payout-crypto-casinos-that-pay-to-e-wallet-768x512.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The advent of cryptocurrencies has markedly overshadowed Ewallets, with only the premier offshore casinos in the US continuing to recognize their value amidst the crypto fervor. E-wallets, including the likes of PayPal, have faced a downturn primarily due to stringent regulatory measures and escalating fees affecting their usage. Despite this shift, PayPal has adeptly positioned itself as a critical intermediary, enabling users to fund their cryptocurrency wallets efficiently. This strategic pivot ensures that PayPal remains an integral player in the ecosystem of fast payouts, facilitating using crypto tokens for immediate transactions.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bank Transfer</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="812" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-135328" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677911-instant-withdrawal-from-crypto-casinos-via-bank-transfer.webp" alt="instant withdrawal from crypto casinos via bank transfer" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677911-instant-withdrawal-from-crypto-casinos-via-bank-transfer.webp 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677911-instant-withdrawal-from-crypto-casinos-via-bank-transfer-300x203.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677911-instant-withdrawal-from-crypto-casinos-via-bank-transfer-1024x693.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677911-instant-withdrawal-from-crypto-casinos-via-bank-transfer-768x520.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bank transfers, commonly referred to as wire transfers, are meticulously vetted by both the online casino&#8217;s security team and the banking institution, which inherently prolongs their processing time compared to cryptocurrency and debit card withdrawals. This deliberate pace ensures the utmost security, facilitating the safe transfer of funds from Point A to Point B. Widely accepted by most operators, bank transfers typically complete within 3 to 10 working days, upholding rigorous standards to safeguard your assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For large-sum transactions, bank transfers are unparalleled in handling high-value exchanges with unassailable security. Directly depositing funds into your bank account allows you to utilize your money online and offline. While the transaction time may extend up to 10 days, the assurance of safety and suitability for substantial financial movements firmly establishes bank transfers as the foremost method for high-stakes players.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Check by courier</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="540" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-135329" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677989-fast-payout-casinos-that-mail-checks.webp" alt="fast payout crypto casinos paying out via check in mail" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677989-fast-payout-casinos-that-mail-checks.webp 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677989-fast-payout-casinos-that-mail-checks-300x135.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677989-fast-payout-casinos-that-mail-checks-1024x461.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700677989-fast-payout-casinos-that-mail-checks-768x346.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Checks by courier stand as the time-honored method of payouts, retaining their popularity among those who prefer not to engage with cryptocurrencies or disclose bank account details, as well as among high rollers who require the convenience of receiving sizable payouts in one go. This method, steeped in tradition, involves the operator issuing a check, which is dispatched directly to your doorstep through international courier services.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The process exemplifies reliability and caters to significant withdrawal requests, providing a secure alternative to digital transactions. Although it may not match the speed of electronic transfers, with deliveries taking up to five days, checks by courier are an exemplary option for those valuing physical checks and high withdrawal capacities without modern technological involvement.</span></p>
<h2>How We Rated Best Instant Withdrawal Casinos</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We rated the casinos on this list from a wide variety of criteria and then weighed them against rival instant pay casinos to complete our list. We looked at the speed with which cryptos could be deposited and withdrawn, if there were any fees or limits imposed on crypto transfers and if the casino offered a variety of tokens to deposit and withdraw.</p>
<p>The best online casinos that payout instantly tended to offer no fees or limits, instant payout for certain cryptos, a decent number of cryptos to play with beyond the biggest cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT.</p>
<p>While these characteristics were given the most weight, our rating also factored in several other key features that players want. That included the size of the welcome bonus and the difficulty with which it is to attain due to wagering requirements, as well as other promotions or bonuses such as free spins, rakeback, and cashback.</p>
<p>The overall user experience was considered, with ease of creating an account, playing games, whether it had a mobile app, its security and anonymity, and also licensing and regulation considered, as well as the quality of its customer support.</p>
<p>Selection of games was another major consideration, with those offering a larger number of games &#8211; as well as favorites including Plinko and Aviator &#8211; given higher marks. We looked at not only the slots on offer but also classic casino games such as poker, blackjack, and roulette, and whether those tables had virtual and/or live dealers, multiple languages, and tables suitable for novice and pro players.</p>
<p>Crypto sports betting was also another hugely popular element in determining rankings on this list, with the best online casinos that payout instantly offering pre-game and in-play markets, bet builders, and specials for a wide variety of sports, and major and minor competitions.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at if the casino had any other features that helped them to stand out from the crowd &#8211; our top two choices Mega Dice and Lucky Block, for example, utilize Telegram to make account creation and crypto deposits and withdrawals instant, secure, and anonymous, while games can be played directly on the app on mobile.</p>
<h2>Selecting the Fastest Payout Online Casinos With Instant Withdrawal &#8211; What to Look forÂ </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When choosing the best online casino with instant withdrawal, players will need to look for a range of metrics to make the right decision.Â </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we looked for ranking the top online <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-instant-payout-casinos.htm">casinos with instant payouts</a> that we reviewed in the above sections.Â </p>
<h3>Withdrawal Times</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that one of the main factors players look for when choosing a crypto casino is the speed that withdrawals are processed.Â In the vast bulk of cases, the providers discussed today offer instant, or near-instant withdrawals. This means that the casino will transfer the funds as soon as the payout request is made.Â </p>
<p>After that, the speed of the transaction will be determined by the respective blockchain network. For example, at Lucky Block, Dogecoin and BNB withdrawals are usually received in about one minute.Â </p>
<h3>KYC and PrivacyÂ </h3>
<p>The best online casinos with instant withdrawals offer KYC-free accounts. In other words, upon signing up, the casino will only ask for an email address. This appeals to gamblers as there is no need to provide a proof of ID or address. Â </p>
<h3>Payout Limits and FeesÂ </h3>
<p>We typically avoid online casinos that have withdrawal limits in place. Ultimately, if a player wins a large jackpot, they should be able to withdraw all of the funds in one transaction. We also prefer Bitcoin casinos that offer fee-free withdrawals. Lucky Block and Metaspins are two examples of Bitcoin gambling sites that do not charge players to cash out. Â </p>
<h3>Supported GamesÂ </h3>
<p>Top-rated crypto casinos offer thousands of games, from blackjack and roulette to video poker and dice.Â Games should be backed by reputable software developers too. Lucky Block has partnered with more than 80 developers &#8211; including industry heavyweights such as Microgaming and NetEnt.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/99791/247272/screenshot-2023-01-03-at-08-56-50.jpg" alt="instant withdrawal casino sportsbook" /></figure>
<p>Those with an interest in sports betting should also assess whether the casino offers access to a sportsbook with competitive odds.Â </p>
<h3>Customer SupportÂ </h3>
<p>Customer support is also an important metric that we look for when ranking online casinos. The best instant payout crypto casino in this regard &#8211; Lucky Block, offers 24/7 customer support via live chat and email.Â </p>
<h3>Bonuses and PromotionsÂ </h3>
<p>We also like online casinos that offer players a welcome package for opening an account for the first time. Bonuses for new players will vary from matched deposits and free spins to cashback and free bets. Lucky Block, for example, is offering a 200% matched first deposit (up to 5,000 EUR or equivalent) plus 50 free spins to new players.</p>
<p>Â <strong>Note: </strong>Those searching for a no deposit instant withdrawal crypto casino will be disappointed &#8211; as no such gambling site exists. Instead, when claiming a no deposit bonus, the funds will need to be wagered a number of times &#8211; often at 40x or more. Â </p>
<h2>How do Crypto Casino Payouts Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those that are completely new to crypto casinos might be wondering how withdrawals actually work. The process is actually very simple and in most cases, consistent across all casinos in this space.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>First, the player will be required to make a withdrawal <i>request</i>.Â </li>
<li>This is usually just a case of logging into the account and selecting the relevant withdrawal button.Â </li>
<li>The player will need to paste in the wallet address that they wish to receive the funds in addition to the payout amount.Â </li>
<li>After making the request, it is then up to the online casino to approve it.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>The top-rated platforms discussed on this page will typically approve a withdrawal request autonomously. This means that there is no requirement for the casino to manually verify the payout. As a result, the cryptocurrencies will leave the online casino and head over to the player&#8217;s wallet. The timing of the transfer at this stage will depend on the respective blockchain.Â </p>
<p>As noted above, XRP, Dogecoin, and BNB withdrawals at Lucky Block are usually received in one minute, while Bitcoin is slightly slower.Â With that being said, there might be occasions where withdrawals are not processed by the Bitcoin casino instantly. This might be because the player is withdrawing a large amount from the casino and thus, it needs to be manually checked.Â </p>
<h2>How Fast Are Casino Withdrawals?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The timeframe associated with withdrawals from a online casino can and will vary from one provider to the next. The purpose of this comparison guide was to focus on casinos that offer instant withdrawals &#8211; meaning, payouts are processed as soon as the request is made (or several minutes after). This is the case when using Lucky Block, but this isn&#8217;t the industry standard.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/99791/247271/screenshot-2023-01-03-at-08-35-59.jpg" alt="lucky block instant withdrawal page" /></figure>
<p>For example, some Bitcoin casinos will take up to an hour to process a withdrawal request. This is still considered fast, especially when compared to fiat casinos &#8211; which can take several days.Â On the flip side, if a crypto casino takes more than 24 hours to approve a withdrawal, this is considered slow. As such, this type of casino should be avoided.Â </p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no justification for a fastest payout online casino to hold onto a player&#8217;s winnings for a lengthy period of time. After all, the winnings belong to the player, so the funds should be transferred to the requested wallet without delay. Apart from the ones mentioned on this list, another casino that delivers fast payment is Crashino Casino.</p>
<p>Check out our guide to discover more information about <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-instant-withdrawal-bitcoin-casinos.htm">Crashino Casino</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a short overview of the fast withdrawal definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instant Withdrawals:Â </strong>Instant withdrawals are exactly how they sound; the casino approves payout requests immediately. This is only the case with casinos that specialize in cryptocurrency withdrawals. So, when withdrawing Bitcoin, the tokens should arrive in about 10-15 minutes. When withdrawing altcoins, the timeframe is significantly reduced â often taking just 1-2 minutes.Â </li>
<li><strong>Fast Withdrawals:Â </strong>Fast withdrawals are not instant, but they are much quicker than the industry average. We view a withdrawal as âfastâ if the casino approves it in under an hour.Â Once again, withdrawals processed this quickly are usually reserved for cryptocurrency payouts only. Nonetheless, once approved, the tokens should arrive in the playerâs private wallet in a few minutes. Â Â </li>
<li><strong>Average Withdrawals:Â </strong>On average, the vast majority of online casinos take between 24-48 hours to approve withdrawals. This is usually the case when depositing and withdrawing funds with traditional payment methods. For example, debit/credit cards and bank wires.Â The reason for this is simple; fiat money payments have much stricter anti-money laundering rules. This means that the casino will need to manually review the withdrawals before it can approve it.Â </li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>This guide has ranked the best platforms to consider when searching for a fastest payout online casino. The top-rated casino discussed today &#8211; Mega Dice &#8211; offers instantly-approved withdrawals across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Tether, and many other cryptocurrencies.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice does not charge withdrawal fees and no payout limits are in place &#8211; ensuring that jackpot winners can cash out their entire balance in one go.Â Plus, not only does Mega Dice support thousands of casino games &#8211; but it is also home to one of the best crypto sportsbooks and has an enticing welcome bonus, offering a 200% matched first deposit plus 50 free spins.</p>

While this holds true for most of the listed casinos, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/en">Mega Dice</a> is an exception in that it does not directly support Shiba Inu at the present time.

This means that the 700 million Telegram users can play Mega Dice games instantly through Telegram. Once the crypto deposit is confirmed, players are free to access the casino. Typical deposit bonuses still apply through Telegram. Â </p>

<h3><strong>2. Lucky Block &#8211; A Premium Shiba Inu Casino in 2023</strong></h3>
<p>We found <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lucky-block-casino/en">Lucky Block</a> to be an exceptional Shiba Inu casino site. New players signing up today will receive a huge welcome bonus. This consists of a 200% matched deposit bonus of up to â¬10,000, in addition to 50 free spins. Not only does Lucky Block look after new players but existing ones too.Â </p>
<p>For example, the casino matches player deposits every Monday by 40%. It also runs seasonal promotions to keep players entertained. Lucky Block is also the best Shiba Inu casino for gaming variety. It supports thousands of games across slots, video poker, blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and more.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/96318/239924/image.jpg" alt="Lucky Block Casino Games" /></figure>
<p>In fact, most games can be enjoyed with live dealers &#8211; offering an immersive gambling experience from home. Lucky Block is also one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">best Bitcoin sports betting sites</a>, with competitive odds offered pre-match and in-play. This covers most sports, including basketball, soccer, tennis, cricket, American football, and snooker.Â </p>
<p>What we really like about Lucky Block is its registration and payment processes. First, Lucky Block does not collect any personal information or data, so is considered one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-decentralized-gambling-sites.htm">best decentralized gambling sites</a>. In turn, this allows players to gamble with SHIB without revealing their identity. What&#8217;s more, Lucky Block offers some of the fastest payouts in the industry.Â </p>
<p><iframe title="LuckyBlock! This Crypto Casino Has Good Potential! CHECK THIS OUT! | Can This 10X Your Money?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/guUW2wfUp4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>After all, payout requests are processed by Lucky Block instantly. This means players should receive their SHIB winnings in under five minutes. We also like that Lucky Block does not charge any withdrawal fees, nor does it install payout limits. This makes Lucky Block one of the best Shiba Inu casinos for high rollers.Â </p>
<p>That said, players can get started by meeting a small minimum deposit of just $1. When it comes to customer service, Lucky Block offers 24/7 support via email and live chat. Finally, we should note that currently, Lucky Block does not offer a loyalty program. That said, this is in the works, so expect to see this in the coming weeks and months. Â </p>

<h3><strong>3. Cloudbet &#8211; 200 Million SHIB Welcome Package for New Players</strong></h3>
<p>Bonus hunters might also consider <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/cloudbet/en">Cloudbet</a> the best Shiba Inu casino. After opening an account &#8211; which takes seconds, new players can claim a 100% matched deposit bonus.

From soccer, baseball, and tennis to cricket and basketball &#8211; Cloudbet has it all.Â </p>
<p>We found that Cloudbet is also one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-anonymous-casinos.htm">best no-ID verification casinos</a>. Accounts simply require an email address and password. Payments are also speedy, with withdrawals usually approved in minutes.

<h3><strong>5. Vave &#8211; Welcome Bonuses and VIP Perks on Casino Games and Sports Gambling Â </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/vave/en">Vave</a> is another Shiba Inu casino and sportsbook to consider today. Regarding the casino division, thousands of classic games are supported. This includes everything from blackjack, roulette, and video poker to slots and baccarat. Live dealer tables are also covered, including dozens of game shows.Â </p>
<p>The Vave sportsbook is also extensive. It operates 24 hours per day and covers thousands of betting markets. This includes baseball, cricket, soccer, tennis, and plenty of other popular sports. We like that Vave offers two welcome packages across its casino and sportsbook. Both can be claimed by new players, but the terms and conditions should be read before proceeding.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/99791/249429/vave-casino.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency Betting On Vave Casino" /></figure>
<p>For example, both bonuses offer a 100% matched deposit boost of up to 1 BTC (SHIB equivalent). However, the wagering requirements on the casino and sportsbook bonuses are 40x and 5x, respectively. While the sportsbook wagering requirement is highly achievable, the same can&#8217;t be said for the casino bonus.Â </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we like that Vave offers a VIP club that covers both casino games and sports betting. This enables players to accumulate points that can be exchanged for bonuses and other perks. To get started with Vave today, the casino requires a minimum deposit of 20 USDT (SHIB equivalent). In addition to SHIB, Vave supports all <a href="https://changelly.com/all-coins-exchange">cryptocurrencies listed on Changelly</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>6. BetOnline &#8211; Established Online Casino That Now Supports SHIB Deposits and Withdrawals Â </strong></h3>
<p>Launched more than 25 years ago, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/betonline/en">BetOnline</a> is an established online casino that supports Shiba Inu. It also supports some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">best utility tokens</a>, including Ethereum, XRP, and Tether. BetOnline offers a comprehensive gambling platform that covers all player preferences. This includes live poker rooms, sports betting, horse racing, and casino games.Â </p>
<p>The latter covers slots, video poker, blackjack, roulette, and much more. BetOnline offers top-rated customer service via live chat &#8211; operational 24/7. Expect to be connected with an agent in seconds. We also like that BetOnline offers a native mobile app. This is supported for both iOS and Android devices, including smartphones and tablets.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116099/311859/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="BetOnline Deposit Bonus" /></figure>
<p>BetOnline is also one of the best Shiba Inu gambling sites for bonuses. Those from the US and Canada can claim a 100% crypto deposit boost of up to $1,000. This promotion comes with low wagering requirements of 14x. Those from outside the US and Canada can claim the same deposit boost but with wagering requirements of 40x.Â </p>
<p>All nationalities can claim a first-time deposit bonus for sports betting, poker, and horse racing. These promotions come with various terms and conditions, so be sure to check them before proceeding. One of the main drawbacks of BetOnline is payout times. Unlike the other SHIB casinos discussed today, payouts are <i>not</i> instant. Instead, payouts average 48 hours. Â </p>

<h2><strong>Tips on Selecting the Best Shiba Inu Casino</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing the right Shiba Inu casino is crucial before risking any funds. Make sure their chosen casino site offers fast payouts, generous bonuses, and support for plenty of games.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many factors to consider when selecting the best SHIB casino site. This includes everything from bonuses and safety to supported games and payout times.Â </p>
<p>Read on to discover how we ranked the best Shiba Inu casinos for 2023.</p>
<h3><strong>Fast and Anonymous Registration Process</strong></h3>
<p>Players should stick with Shiba Inu casinos which offer a fast and hassle-free registration process. Casinos like Lucky Block and Cloudbet do not collect any personal information other than an email address.Â </p>
<p>This enables players to gamble with SHIB anonymously. This isn&#8217;t the case with all Shiba Inu casinos. On the contrary, some casinos demand personal information and KYC documents, which is likely a drawback for many. Â </p>
<h3><strong>Speedy Withdrawals Without Limits</strong></h3>
<p>The best Shiba Inu casinos offer super-fast withdrawals. Other than BetOnline, the SHIB gambling sites reviewed today approve payouts in 0-10 minutes. Once approved, players will find the SHIB tokens in their private wallet.</p>
<p>That said, players should also assess whether any withdrawal limits are in place. For example, we found various platforms that limit how much SHIB can be withdrawn each day. These gambling sites should be avoided.Â </p>
<p>Instead, consider Lucky Block &#8211; which not only offers instant withdrawals but without any payout limits. Â Â </p>
<h3><strong>Supported Gambling Games</strong></h3>
<p>Players should check which gambling games are supported before choosing a Shiba Inu casino.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116099/311862/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="Lucky Block Casino Tennis Matches" /></p>
<p>All of the SHIB casinos reviewed earlier support the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table games like blackjack, roulette, and baccarat</li>
<li>Live casino dealers</li>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Sports betting</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the best Shiba Inu casinos also offer provably fair games. BC.Game is the best option here, with the platform offering provably fair games with RTPs of up to 99%. Â </p>
<h3><strong>Bonuses and Promotions</strong></h3>
<p>Most Shiba Inu casinos offer a welcome package to new players. This often consists of a matched deposit bonus but can also include free spins. The best SHIB casinos offer fair terms and conditions, such as low wagering requirements.Â </p>
<p>Top-rated SHIB casinos also reward loyalty. This includes VIP programs with special bonuses and perks, not to mention ongoing promotions. The latter often includes free spins and deposit reloads.</p>
<h3><strong>Software Providers</strong></h3>
<p>It is also wise to check what software providers supply games to the chosen SHIB casino. There are dozens of regulated providers in this space, including NetEnt, Microgaming, and Playtech.Â </p>
<p>These providers offer a secure and fair environment to gamble online. After all, many are regulated by respectable licensing bodies, such as the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/licences-and-fees/remote-gambling-software-licence">UK&#8217;s Gambling Commission</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Customer Service</strong></h3>
<p>We also rank Shiba Inu casinos based on their customer service team. All of the casinos discussed today offer live chat and email.Â </p>

<p>Overall, Lucky Block offers the best customer support, with its live chat operational 24/7. What&#8217;s more, it usually takes just seconds to be connected with an agent.Â </p>
<h2><strong>Best Shiba Inu Online Gambling Bonuses</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonuses are rife in the online gambling space &#8211; and Shiba Inu casinos are no different. From matched deposits and free spins, players can claim many generous bonuses. Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shiba Inu gambling bonuses are increasingly becoming more generous. This is because the space continues to become oversaturated, so casinos attract new players with lucrative bonuses and promotions. Â </p>
<p>Read on to discover the best Shiba Inu casino bonuses currently available.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Matched Deposits</strong></h3>
<p>Most Shiba Inu casinos offer a matched deposit bonus to new players. This boosts the player&#8217;s deposit up to a certain amount, by a specified percentage.Â </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lucky Block matches the first deposit by 200% (up to â¬10,000)</li>
<li>Suppose a player deposits the SHIB equivalent of â¬1,000Â </li>
<li>Lucky Block will match this by 200% or â¬2,000Â </li>
<li>This means the player&#8217;s bankroll is now â¬3,000Â </li>
</ul>
<p>All matched deposit bonuses come with wagering requirements. This stipulates the amount that needs to be gambled to release the bonus funds.Â </p>
<p>For instance, suppose a player deposits â¬500 at wagering requirements of 20x. In this scenario, the player would need to gamble at least â¬10,000 to withdraw the bonus.</p>
<h3><strong>Free Spins</strong></h3>
<p>Many welcome packages offered by Shiba Inu online casinos include free spins. For example, Lucky Block adds 50 free spins to its 200% matched deposit offer.Â </p>
<p>In other instances, free spins are offered on a weekly basis when meeting minimum deposit requirements. Cloudbet, for example, offers 20 free spins when players deposit at least â¬20.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116099/311864/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="Free Spins Bonus On Cloudbet" /></figure>
<p>Free spins are risk-free, as the account balance is not used. However, winnings made from the free spins usually need to be wagered before a withdrawal can be made.Â </p>
<h3><strong>No Deposit Bonuses</strong></h3>
<p>Another promotion to look for is a &#8216;no deposit&#8217; bonus. This offers free casino credits, chips, or free spins without needing to add funds to the account.Â </p>
<p>In most cases, the wagering requirements will be unfavorable. Moreover, no deposit bonuses are rare these days. Instead, the best Shiba Inu casinos that we reviewed offer matched deposit bonuses. Â Â </p>
<h3><strong>VIP Club</strong></h3>
<p>Casinos that accept Shiba Inu usually reward loyalty via a VIP club. Usually, players will accumulate points when placing wagers. Points can then be converted into bonuses and/or prizes.Â </p>
<p>For example, Cloudbet points can be exchanged for risk-free bets, matched deposit bonuses, and even luxury holidays.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Deposit ReloadsÂ </strong></h3>
<p>We also found that the best Shiba Inu casino sites offer deposit reloads to existing players. For example, Lucky Block matches deposits by 40% each and every Monday.</p>
<p>Once again, remember that winnings made from deposit reloads will need to be wagered. Specific wagering requirements will vary depending on the Shiba Inu casino and the respective bonus.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Shiba Inu Casino Bonuses: OverviewÂ </strong></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of the best Shiba Inu casino bonuses alongside their required wagering terms and promo code.</p>

<p>Always check the terms and conditions of a Shiba Inu casino bonus before claiming it.Â </p>
<h2><strong>Is it Safe to Gamble With SHIB?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Many experts claim that gambling with SHIB and other cryptocurrencies is much safer than using a traditional casino. Not only are payments made on a wallet-to-wallet basis, but players are rarely asked for sensitive KYC documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When compared to regular casinos, gambling with SHIB is very safe.Â </p>
<p>For example, traditional online casinos demand a vast amount of personal information from players. This is in addition to <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/system-documentation-checklist-update/">KYC documents</a>, such as passports, driving licenses, and bank statements. Should these documents get into the wrong hands, players are vulnerable to identity theft.Â </p>
<p>In contrast, gambling with Shiba Inu is usually anonymous. This means players only need to provide an email address to get started. What&#8217;s more, this is only collected by the casino should the player forget their password.Â </p>
<p>Another safety net when gambling with SHIB is that payments are processed anonymously and away from the casino site. This is because deposits are made from the player&#8217;s private wallet. And hence, SHIB casinos do not collect financial details like credit card numbers.Â </p>
<p>That said, players should still err on the side of caution. Not all Shiba Inu casinos are legitimate. Moreover, players need to trust that the SHIB casino will honor payouts. This is why it&#8217;s best to stick with reputable casinos like Lucky Block, Cloudbet, and BC.Game.Â </p>
<p>In terms of the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/crypto-casinos-bitcoin-opened-new-online-gambling-world-rcna23062">legality of gambling</a> with SHIB, this still falls within a gray area of the law. While the specifics will vary from country to country, most gambling regulations do not cover digital assets.Â </p>
<p>Furthermore, the anonymous and borderless nature of crypto casinos makes the industry challenging to regulate. For example, while many crypto casinos ban US clients, this is often circumvented by VPNs. Â </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In summary, players have ample choice when gambling with SHIB online. But players should remember that not all Shiba Inu casinos are created equal. While some offer instant and limitless payouts, others take days to honor winnings.Â </p>
<p>The best Shiba Inu casino site that we reviewed is Mega Dice. Not only does Mega Dice offer instant withdrawals without limits &#8211; but there is no KYC process. From blackjack and roulette to slots, dice, and sports betting &#8211; Mega Dice has it all.Â </p>
<p>Those joining Mega Dice today can claim a super-generous welcome package. The first deposit is matched by 200% (up to 1 BTC) and includes 50 risk-free slot spins. The minimum deposit is as low as $1.Â </p>

<h2>Best Bitcoin Keno Sites Reviewed in Full</h2><span class="replacer"></span>

</blockquote>
<p>Players will find reviews of the best Bitcoin keno casinos below:</p>
<h3>1. Mega Dice &#8211; Best Overall Recently Launched Keno CasinoÂ </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/en">Mega Dice</a> presents an appealing online gambling experience with its fluid interface and captivating green and black colour scheme. It is highly likely that once users fully explore this platform, they will find it immensely enjoyable and potentially their go-to Bitcoin casino.Â </p>
<p>Operated by MIBS B.V., Mega Dice stands out as a prominent keno casino and sportsbook, drawing in thousands of players from around the world. This platform holds a license from the Curacao Gaming Authority and supports various cryptocurrencies beyond BTC, such as USDT, ETH, LTC, XRP, DOGE, ADA, TRX, and BCH. While Mega Dice offers multiple game categories, including Keno, its primary focus appears to be on sports betting, providing numerous options for enthusiasts.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112228/314587/screenshot-2023-06-25-at-.jpg" alt="Keno Games On Mega Dice Casino" /></figure>
<p>Mega Dice is the first online casino to offer licensed gambling to customers through Telegram. This is an excellent market maneuver because Telegram is a popular application, especially among crypto enthusiasts.Â </p>

<p>We also noticed that the number of keno games on the Mega Dice casino is comparatively lower than a lot of its competitors. However, this may solely be due to the fact that it is a new platform. As of now, the Keno games available on Mega Dice include titles like Magical keno, Jungle keno, Banana keno etc.Â </p>
<p>At present, Mega Dice offers a single promotion: the welcome bonus, granting players an impressive 200% bonus up to 1 BTC, accompanied by 50 free spins.

<h3>2. Lucky Block &#8211; High Quality Bitcoin Keno Casino Site for 2023</h3>
<p>Players looking for one of the best Bitcoin keno casinos for 2023 might like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lucky-block-casino/">Lucky Block</a>. Its casino library includes seven different keno titles. For instance, soccer fans might like Keno Goal, which includes a field of 80 cells with consecutive numbers. The object of Keno Goal is to predict the winning numbers and mark them on the grid. The game draws up to 20 numbers.</p>
<p>Another popular variation at Lucky Block is Keno Rush. A grid of 40 numbers is used in this quick-fire version. Each player can select up to 10 numbers and choose between three risk modes: high, medium, or low. Other Bitcoin keno games include Jungle, Banana, Rainbow, and Magical. Additionally, Lucky Block offers <a href="https://spribe.co/games/keno">keno from Scribe.</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112228/271580/screenshot-2023-04-27-13-06-49.jpg" alt="Lucky Block Casino Featured Games" /></p>
<p>The latter is provably fair and offers an RTP of 97%, which refers to <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/public-and-players/guide/return-to-player-how-much-gaming-machines-payout">how much games payout</a> The Lucky Block casino also features 30 game shows, almost 200 table games, thousands of slots, hundreds of live dealers, and jackpot titles. Meanwhile, the sportsbook features multiple markets and betting options.Â </p>
<p>Furthermore, the site is fully optimized to play keno with crypto on cell phones and tablets. Keno players don&#8217;t need to enter sensitive information or complete the KYC process at Lucky Block. Players that consider this the best Bitcoin keno casino just need to enter an email address and password to register for an account.Â </p>
<p>As one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-decentralized-gambling-sites.htm">best decentralized gambling sites</a> in the space, Lucky Block also accepts multiple other cryptocurrencies.Â </p>
<p><iframe title="LuckyBlock! This Crypto Casino Has Good Potential! CHECK THIS OUT! | Can This 10X Your Money?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/guUW2wfUp4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This includes Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Tether, Ethereum, Tron, Cardano, BNB, Ripple, Litecoin, and its native currency LBLOCK. The latter was the fastest cryptocurrency to hit a market capitalization of $1 billion in 2022 and can be used as payment at the casino. The platform also supports wire transfers, credit cards, or Google/Apple Pay.Â </p>
<p>However, fiat payments require KYC. Â The minimum deposit is 0.0001 BTC or $1. When signing up, new players who deposit at least â¬20 can claim a 200% matched deposit of up to â¬10,000. The welcome bonus also comes with 50 free spins. Returning players will find additional benefits including weekly deposit reloads, competitions with free spins, and more.Â </p>
<p>That said, a potential disadvantage of Lucky Block is that US and UK players need to use a VPN service to bypass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/01/uk-gambling-safeguards-no-match-for-online-bookie-stake-com">geo-restrictions</a>. Moreover, some games are not available in all regions.Â </p>

<h2>How to Pick the Best Bitcoin Keno Casino Sites</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Important aspects to consider when choosing the best Bitcoin keno casino sites include game diversity, bonuses, fast payouts, and ensuring the platform is safe and secure.</p>
<p>Read on for some key considerations when choosing the best Bitcoin keno sites for 2023.</p>
<h3>Safe Platform</h3>
<p>Players searching for the best crypto keno sites should ensure the platform is safe. In doing so, players can gamble on keno without worrying about whether they will receive their winnings.Â </p>
<p>This is why we like Lucky Block, as the platform has a gambling license from the CuraÃ§ao Gaming Control Board. Moreover, Lucky Block uses an SSL encryption protocol to keep player data private.Â </p>
<p>Not only that, but Lucky Block facilitates deposits externally. This means players can deposit funds safely from a private wallet.Â </p>
<h3>AnonymityÂ </h3>
<p>Players don&#8217;t have to complete the KYC process with crypto-centric platforms like Lucky Block, Mega Dice and BC.Game.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>To open an account, players simply need to provide an email, username, and password.Â </li>
<li>This means no personal information or KYC documentsÂ </li>
</ul>
<p>Just like the blockchain network, this enables players to gamble on keno with Bitcoin anonymously. In contrast, regular online casinos ask for lots of personal information, including a government-issued ID.Â </p>
<h3>Fast Payouts</h3>
<p>Casinos that accept Bitcoin and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> usually offer super-fast payouts. The speed can depend on the respective blockchain. Lucky Block, BC.Game, and Cloudbet offer players almost instant payouts.</p>
<p>For instance, at Lucky Block, Bitcoin payouts can <a href="https://www.exodus.com/news/how-long-does-a-bitcoin-transaction-take/">take around 10 minutes</a> to arrive. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, Ripple, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/">BNB</a> transactions can be completed within a minute in most cases.Â </p>
<p>In contrast, credit cards and wire transfers take several business days when using a regular online casino.Â </p>
<h3>Bitcoin Keno VarietyÂ </h3>
<p>The best Bitcoin keno casinos offer many game variations. This is the case at Lucky Block and BC.Game, where players can choose from multiple keno titles backed by various software developers. Â </p>
<p>For each supported keno game, players can see the RTP and the biggest win. Players could also look for casinos that offer free Bitcoin keno for risk-free fun. For instance, Lucky Block, BC. Game and Cloudbet all offer demo versions of keno.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112228/271579/image.jpg" alt="Keno Game Variants" /></figure>
<p>Players will also find a large number of other gambling games, such as roulette, blackjack, and baccarat at these casinos. Â Additionally, there are table card games like pai gow, sic bo, teen patti, and Pirate 21.</p>
<h3>Bonuses and Perks</h3>
<p>One of the main attractions of crypto casinos is the bonuses on offer. After all, the Bitcoin keno casino market is crowded. As such, many platforms compete to offer the best welcome bonus. This is often a matched deposit bonus, and they sometimes include free spins on particular slots.</p>
<p>Many casinos also have a VIP program with various perks, such as cashback, free spins, and rakeback. Many keno casino sites also run regular promotions for their existing players, such as weekly deposit reloads.</p>
<h3>User-Friendly Layout</h3>
<p>Many players like to access their favorite keno games on the go. As such, the best Bitcoin keno casinos are adaptive, so the same quality can be enjoyed across all devices.Â </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also beneficial if the casino is easy to navigate and signing up is quick and simple.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Keno: How it Works</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin keno is the online version of the classic game, only players pay for their stake with BTC tokens instead of fiat funds. Players choose a specified amount of numbers and match as many as possible to those that are drawn &#8211; it&#8217;s comparable to a lottery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic concept of keno is to choose numbers from a table and place bets on them in the hope of them being drawn. Like with lottery games, the more numbers a player correctly matches, the higher the winnings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most keno games have a grid containing up to 80 numbers and allow the player to pick up to 10.Â </li>
<li>However, there are many other variations with different rules.</li>
<li>For instance, in Keno Rush, players choose up to 10 numbers from a grid for 40.Â </li>
<li>In the Scribe version, players must choose up to 10 numbers from a grid of 36.Â </li>
<li>Keno Goal, offered by BC.Game, allows players to select up to 20 numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some keno games are provably fair. For instance, at Lucky Block, all keno draws are carried out via smart contracts for fairness. As such, players can verify the results to ensure the keno draw was fair and true.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Keno Casino Bonuses</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Read on to see the best Bitcoin keno casino bonuses on offer in 2023:</p>
<h3>Matched Deposit</h3>
<p>Matched deposit bonuses are offered by many of the top Bitcoin keno sites we&#8217;ve reviewed today.Â </p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lucky Block matches the first deposit by 200% up to the value of â¬10,000</li>
<li>BC.Game offers four matched deposit bonuses of up to 1,260%</li>
<li>Cloudbet welcomes new players by matching their first deposit by 100% up to 5 BTC</li>
</ul>
<p>This provides players with free funds to get started. That said, players should research any wagering requirements attached to the bonus and ensure they understand them in full.</p>
<h3>Risk-Free Spins</h3>
<p>Free spin bonuses are a standard offering at many Bitcoin keno sites, despite the two not being related. Free spins are sometimes offered as part of the welcome package.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112228/271591/image.jpg" alt="Free Spin Bonus" /></figure>
<p>For instance, Lucky Block players are given 50 free spins when signing up. Oftentimes, casinos have free spin bonuses for existing players as well. For instance, Lucky Block offers one deposit reload each week to all registered users. Â </p>
<h3>VIP Program Perks</h3>
<p>Some casinos offer points when gamblers play keno with crypto. This enables players to climb the VIP ladder.</p>
<p>The higher the VIP status, the more bonuses and benefits they will earn. This might include cashback, rakeback, and exclusive offers.</p>
<h3>No Deposit Bonus</h3>
<p>The no deposit bonus is hard to come by these days. Nonetheless, this provides players with bonus funds for signing up, and they will not need to make a deposit in order to claim them.</p>
<p>None of the Bitcoin keno casinos we&#8217;ve reviewed today offer no deposit bonuses. This is largely because they are crypto-based and transactions are anonymous. As such, regulating who has already claimed the offer would be difficult.</p>
<h3>How to Play Keno With Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of how to play keno with Bitcoin:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a Reputable Casino: </strong>The first step is to pick the best Bitcoin keno casino and sign up for an account. At crypto-focussed casinos like Lucky Block, this only involves entering an email username, and password.</li>
<li><strong>Pick a Keno Game: </strong>All keno games have similar rules but will vary in the size of the grid and how many numbers can be chosen. Traditionally, keno has 80 numbers, and players pick 10. Provably fair variants usually include a grid of 36. Â </li>
<li><strong>Select Some Numbers: </strong>Next, the player needs to choose the numbers they think will be drawn. Alternatively, it&#8217;s also possible to choose the numbers at random.</li>
<li><strong>Begin Playing: </strong>Place a bet and start playing keno. Some casinos accept stakes as low as $0.20 for keno games. The more numbers a player matches to what is drawn, the more they will win.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>Players should check the RTP and risk level of each keno game before proceeding. And of course, players should gamble responsibly. Moreover, if the casino offers free Bitcoin keno, players can play for fun without risking any funds.</p>
<h2>To Conclude</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>That concludes this guide on the best Bitcoin keno casinos, we found Mega Dice to be the overall best place to play keno with Bitcoin.Â </p>
<p>Its welcome offer is a generous 200% matched deposit bonus with 50 free spins. Moreover, payouts are instant, and there are no KYC requirements &#8211; so signing up is quick and easy.</p>

<h2><strong>Best Avalanche Gambling Sites: Full Reviews</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We will now review the best Avalanche casinos for 2023. Within each review, we explain how the casino rates for bonuses, supported games, odds, customer service, and much more.Â </p>
<h3><strong>1. Mega Dice &#8211; Overall Best Casino for 2023 With Telegram Functionality</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/en">Mega Dice</a> is one of the overall best crypto gambling sites on the market. Though it only recently launched, it has already made waves and could soon integrate AVAX into its variety of crypto payment methods. Despite its recent launch, Mega Dice has already obtained a Curacao Gaming Commission license, which highlights its commitment to operating within regulatory standards.Â </p>
<p>Yet despite being a regulated casino platform, there is no KYC enforced on customers. All that is required is an email address and password to take part in its offerings. Signup is quick and the minimum deposit is only $1, meaning it is possible to get set up in less than one minute. A lot of crypto enthusiasts look for anonymity and stress free onboarding when it comes to online activities.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117732/323044/screen-shot-2023-08-09-at.jpg" alt="Mega Dice Telegram Casino And Sportsbook" /></figure>
<p>And Mega Dice is one step ahead of the competition when it comes to easy onboarding and user anonymity. The casino made history as the first to use Telegram to offer licensed gambling to users. Through Telegram, it could not be easier to <a href="https://bs_c22ac4a3.cryptonewsdom.care/">access the Mega Dice Casino.</a> There is no KYC and once the crypto deposit is made, customers are free to place their bets. It removes the need to download another application or use a website, providing a seamless onboarding experience.Â </p>
<p>The 200% matching bonus also applies when the crypto deposit is made through Telegram. This means if you deposit $100 USDT, you can benefit from an additional $200 USDT, provided the 40x wagering requirement is met. A 10% referral bonus is also on offer for Telegram signups, payable in USDT.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117732/323045/screen-shot-2023-08-09-at.jpg" alt="Mega Dice Telegram Casino Bot" /></figure>
<p>Mega Dice supports a wide range of crypto, including BTC, LTC, ETH, USDT, ADA, XRP, DOGE, BCH, USDT, and TRX. Notably, BTC can be purchased directly from the website using credit cards, providing users with seamless access to different digital currencies.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice has no KYC requirements or email verifications. You can just go to the website and log in to start playing. The email is required to give long-time players access to customized bonuses.Â </p>
<p>While fiat payments can take a while to process, crypto rewards are processed instantly, as soon as the block is confirmed.Â </p>

<h3><strong>2. Lucky Block &#8211; Top Avalanche Casino for 2023</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lucky-block-casino/en">Lucky Block</a> offers AVAX holders the ultimate gambling experience. It has one of the largest gambling suites in the industry, covering thousands of games. For example, Lucky Block is home to over 4,000 slot titles. This includes jackpots, megaways, classics, and more. There are slots to cover all budgets, with minimum and maximum stakes averaging $0.20 and $100, respectively. Â </p>
<p>Lucky Block is also one of the best Avalanche casinos for table games. Whether players prefer blackjack, roulette, baccarat, or craps &#8211; Lucky Block has it all. Each game can be played with software or live dealers. The latter is provided by Evolution and Pragmatic Play, two leaders in the live casino space.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/96318/239924/image.jpg" alt="Games On Lucky Block Casino" /></figure>
<p>In addition, Lucky Block offers provably fair games. This includes Aviation, a popular variant of crypto crash. Lucky Block players also have access to a sportsbook. This enables players to gamble on soccer, tennis, cricket, baseball, darts, snooker, and dozens of other sports. We found that Lucky Block is very competitive for odds, and wagers can be played pre-match or in-play.Â </p>
<p>Lucky Block stands out when it comes to payments. While it supports AVAX, it also accepts some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a>. In addition to XRP, Cardano, Tether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, Lucky Block is also considered the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ethereum-casinos.htm">best Ethereum casino</a>. Irrespective of the chosen crypto asset, Lucky Block processes deposits and withdrawals instantly.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117732/314299/screenshot-2023-06-23-at-.jpg" alt="Lucky Block Casino Lobbies" /></figure>
<p>There are no withdrawal fees or limits. This means large wins can be withdrawn without delay, unlike other casinos in this space. Another benefit of Lucky Block is it offers customer support 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Players simply need to click the &#8216;Live Chat&#8217; icon to connect with a Lucky Block support agent instantly.Â </p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Lucky Block offers a generous welcome package. New players will have their first deposit matched by 200%. The minimum deposit to qualify is â¬20, and the maximum bonus available is â¬10,000. Those meeting the â¬20 minimum will also receive 50 free slot spins. These can be used on the Wanted Dead or Alive slot game.Â </p>

<p>We found that the main drawback of Lucky Block is its lack of a loyalty program. That said, this is in the works, so expect to see this soon. In the meantime, existing players can claim a 40% reload bonus every Monday, up to â¬200. Lucky Block also runs seasonable promotions, including a &#8216;Game of the Week&#8217; bonus. Â </p>

<p>We also found that Cloudbet is one of the best Avalanche casinos for loyalty rewards. Each and every bet placed on the platform yields Cloudbet points. Players can exchange these points for bonuses and real-world prizes, such as VIP holidays and a Rolex. Cloudbet also looks after its loyal players through weekly promotions.Â </p>

<h3><strong>5. BetOnline &#8211; Comprehensive Casino, Sportsbook, and Poker Suite Â </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/betonline/en">BetOnline</a> is one of the best all-rounders in the AVAX gambling space, supporting casino games, sports betting, and live poker rooms. BetOnline is also one of the best AVAX casinos for bonuses. New players will have their first AVAX deposit matched by 100% &#8211; up to $1,000. This comes with very fair wagering requirements of just 14x.Â </p>
<p>There are also bonuses available when gambling on sports, horse racing, and poker for the first time. Existing players returning to BetOnline will receive a 30% boost on all future AVAX deposits. While this is capped at $300, reload bonuses come with low wagering requirements of just 7x. There is also a 25% lifetime deposit boost in the sportsbook department.Â </p>

<p>Breaking down the gambling suite further, BetOnline supports thousands of casino games. This includes video poker, roulette, blackjack, and slots. Live casino dealers are also available. Players benefit from weekly rebates when playing casino games at BetOnline. This refunds 10% of losses and is credited in cash every week.Â </p>
<p>Additionally, the BetOnline pokers department is worth checking out. This connects to a global network of poker sites and supports tournaments and cash tables. BetOnline has developed native poker software, available for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android. Poker tables can also be accessed via standard web browsers.Â </p>

<p>In terms of reputation, BetOnline has been in the online gambling space for over 25 years. It is US-friendly, and accounts take less than five minutes to open. That said, this is not an anonymous AVAX casino. On the contrary, players need to provide personal information when signing up. Moreover, withdrawals usually take 48 hours to process.Â </p>

<h3><strong>6. Vave &#8211; Welcome Bonuses and VIP Perks on Casino Games and Sports Gambling Â </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/vave/en">Vave</a> is another top-rated casino that accepts AVAX deposits. This is one of the best new Avalanche casinos, covering traditional gambling games and a sportsbook. The latter covers dozens of sports and thousands of weekly betting markets. Pre-match and in-play betting is supported 24/7. The Vave casino supports a huge selection of gambling games.Â </p>
<p>Over 155 and 325 roulette and blackjack tables, respectively. There are almost 100 baccarat tables and over 50 live game shows. If that wasn&#8217;t enough, Vave also offers more than 7,500 slot games. This is one of the largest slot libraries in the industry. Some of the top software developers supplying slots include Fugaso, NetEnt, OneTouch, Fantasma, and Hacksaw.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117732/314296/screenshot-2023-06-23-at-.jpg" alt="All Games On Vave Casino" /></figure>
<p>In terms of promotions, new players are offered two deposit bonuses. First, there is a 100% deposit boost of up to 1 BTC for casino games. The same conditions are offered again but for the sportsbook. While the sportsbook bonus comes with wagering requirements of just 5x, this is increased to 40x for casino games.Â </p>
<p>Existing players can claim a 50% deposit boost of up to 150 USDT every Thursday. This also includes 100 free spins on the Wild Cash slot game, provided by popular developer <a href="https://bgaming.com/">BGAMING</a>. Vave also runs loyalty clubs that are split between casino games and sports betting. Vave also runs regular slot races, with monthly prizes of 15,000 USDT and 15,000 free spins.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/99791/249429/vave-casino.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Customer support is also highly rated. Vave offers 24/7 live chat and players rarely need to wait more than a minute to connect to an agent. That said, one of the main drawbacks of Vave is that deposits need to be wagered at least three times before a withdrawal can be made. This is the case even if the welcome bonus isn&#8217;t claimed.Â </p>

<h2><strong>Tips on Selecting the Best Avalanche Casino: Our Criteria</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Having ranked the best Avalanche casinos for 2023, players might be wondering what criteria we used.Â </p>
<p>Below, we explain the most important considerations to make when gambling with AVAX.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Supported Games</strong></h3>
<p>Top casinos that accept Avalanche will offer a comprehensive gambling suite. The five providers that we reviewed above offer casino games and a sportsbook.Â </p>
<p>For example:Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Lucky Block supports hundreds of table games, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat.Â </li>
<li>BC.Game is popular for playing provably fair games, including plinko, crash, and dice.Â </li>
<li>Cloudbet stands out for its sports betting platform, which offers competitive odds.Â </li>
<li>Those looking to play slots might consider Vave, as the casino offers over 7,500 titles.Â </li>
<li>We found that BetOnline is suitable for poker players, with cash tables and tournaments supported.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, players should check what games are supported when choosing the best AVAX casino.</p>
<h3><strong>Payments</strong></h3>
<p>Nobody wants to wait around for their payments to be processed by a casino. This is why the best Avalanche casino sites offer speedy deposits and withdrawals.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, Lucky Block processes deposits automatically.Â </li>
<li>The player&#8217;s account is credited once confirmed by the blockchain.Â </li>
<li>This means AVAX deposits should appear in under a minute.Â </li>
<li>Lucky Block also approves withdrawal requests instantly.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, some Avalanche casinos take several days to process payouts. These casino sites should be avoided.Â </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another factor to consider when researching AVAX casino sites is withdrawal limits. While platforms like Lucky Block and Cloubet have no limits in place. others do. For instance, some AVAX casinos have a maximum weekly withdrawal amount. If the player lands a big win, this can be problematic.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Account Opening Process</strong>Â </h3>
<p>The best Avalanche casinos offer a completely anonymous experience. This means that opening an account requires nothing more than an email address. And certainly no KYC documents.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117732/314297/screenshot-2023-06-23-at-.jpg" alt="Lucky Block Casino Signup Page" /></figure>
<p>That said, some AVAX gambling sites are legally mandated to ask for ID. This is because they also accept fiat money, so KYC is required to stay compliant with <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/history-anti-money-laundering-laws">anti-money laundering laws</a>.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Bonuses and Promotions</strong>Â </h3>
<p>Players should also consider bonuses and promotions when choosing an Avalanche casino. All of the casinos discussed today offer a welcome package. This boosts the player&#8217;s first deposit by a certain percentage.Â </p>
<p>For example:Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Lucky Block offers a matched deposit bonus of 200% &#8211; up to â¬10,000.Â </li>
<li>Cloudbet matches the first deposit by 100% &#8211; up to 650 AVAX.Â </li>
<li>BetOnline is also generous with bonuses. For instance, it offers a 100% deposit boost of up to $1,000, with wagering requirements of just 14x (US and Canadian players only).Â </li>
</ul>
<p>The best Avalanche casinos also offer ongoing bonuses for existing players. This often includes free spins and deposit reloads.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Customer Service</strong>Â </h3>
<p>We also rank AVAX casinos based on the level of customer service they provide.Â </p>
<p>All of the casinos discussed today offer 24/7 support via live chat. We found that, in most cases, it takes just seconds to connect with an agent.Â </p>
<h2><strong>Best Avalanche Casino Bonuses</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bonuses are an important criterion when selecting the best Avalanche casino.Â </p>
<p>Below, we explore what AVAX bonuses are available in 2023 and how each promotion works.Â </p>
<h3><strong>Matched Deposit Bonuses</strong></h3>
<p>Matched deposit bonuses are offered by <i>all</i> of the AVAX casinos discussed today. This boosts the player&#8217;s deposit by a specified percentage &#8211; usually 100% or more.Â </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>New players at Lucky Block depositing â¬20 or more will have the payment boosted by 200% (up to â¬10,000)</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s say the player deposits â¬50 worth of AVAX</li>
<li>Lucky Block will boost the deposit by an extra â¬100</li>
<li>The player&#8217;s account balance now stands at â¬150</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to consider the wagering requirements before claiming a matched deposit bonus. If the requirements are too high, it might not be worth claiming.Â </p>
<p>For example, non-US and Canadian clients at BetOnline need to meet a 40x wagering requirement on the welcome bonus,Â </p>
<h3><strong>Free Spins</strong></h3>
<p>AVAX gambling sites sometimes offer free spins to new players. The spin can be used on selected slot games and is completely risk-free.Â </p>
<p>New players at Lucky Block will receive 50 free spins, playable on the Wanted Dead or Alive game. At Cloudbet, players can claim 20 free spins every Tuesday. To qualify, players need to deposit at least â¬20.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/117732/314300/screenshot-2023-06-23-at-.jpg" alt="Lucky Block Deposit Bonuses" /></figure>
<p>Vave is also a good option for free spins. It offers 100 free spins every Thursday to existing players. To qualify, players need to make two deposits (minimum of 20 USDT)</p>
<p>Just remember that, like matched deposits, free spin bonuses must also be wagered.Â </p>
<h3><strong>No Deposit Bonuses</strong></h3>
<p>No deposit bonuses are popular with AVAX gamblers &#8211; as no payment is required.Â </p>
<p>However, none of the AVAX casinos discussed today offer this bonus type. All of the bonuses we sourced require at least one deposit.</p>
<h3><strong>Reload Bonuses</strong></h3>
<p>Reload bonuses are ideal for regular gamblers. They work much the same as matched deposit bonuses.Â </p>
<p>For example, Lucky Block matches deposits by 40% every Thursday. While BetOnline adds 30% to all crypto deposits.Â </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best Avalanche casinos also offer loyalty rewards. In most cases, players accumulate points for every wager they place. Points can then be exchanged for perks. For example, Cloudbet points can be converted to bonuses or real-world prizes. The latter includes a Rolex and VIP holidays.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Comparison of the Best AVAX Bonuses</strong></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a table that outlines the best AVAX casino bonuses for 2023:</p>

<h2><strong>Is it Safe to Gamble With AVAX?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>While most AVAX casinos are safe, gamblers should be aware that not all platforms are created equal. The anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies means that some AVAX casinos will turn out to be scams. Fortunately, there are plenty of legitimate AVAX casinos to choose from &#8211; including Lucky Block, Cloudbet, and BC.Game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In most cases, gambling with Avalanche is completely safe. In fact, when compared to traditional casinos, crypto-centric platforms offer additional safety features.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the best Avalanche online casinos do not ask players to provide any personal information.Â </li>
<li>Nor is there a need to upload KYC documents, like a passport or driver&#8217;s license.Â </li>
<li>This removes the risk of being a victim of identity fraud.</li>
<li>KYC-free accounts also allow players to gamble without transactions appearing in their name.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s more, AVAX casinos accept deposits on a wallet-to-wallet basis. This means that deposits are not made directly on the casino&#8217;s website. Just like funding a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">crypto exchange</a> account, AVAX casino deposits are made from a private wallet.Â </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another safeguard is that some AVAX casinos are regulated. For example, Lucky Block holds a gambling licence issued by the <a href="https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/">CuraÃ§ao Gaming Control Board</a>. This ensures that best practices for safety and security are met. For example, <a href="https://www.investor.gov/what-registered-owner-what-beneficial-owner">beneficial owners</a> of the casino will need to be identified before the license is issued.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that being said, not all AVAX casinos are credible. On the contrary, a small minority of platforms let the wider industry down. Unscrupulous tactics to look for include limiting betting and withdrawal sizes, unnecessarily slow payouts, and unethical terms and conditions.Â </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In terms of casinos that directly offer AVAX, Lucky Block is a good option. But the overall best choice is Mega Dice. Not only does Mega Dice allow players to gamble anonymously, but it supports thousands of games.Â </p>
<p>From slots and video poker to live dealers and sports betting &#8211; Mega Dice has something to suit all gambling preferences. New players joining Mega Dice will receive a 200% deposit boost alongside 50 free spins.Â </p>
<p>The initial deposit is only $1 to get started, and you don&#8217;t even need an account if you play through Telegram. Â </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100002/247670/image.jpg" alt="BC.Game Casino Dashboard" /></figure>
<p>BC.Game also has one of the best deposit bonuses around, with players able to earn 180% on their first deposit bonus with no wagering requirements.</p>
<p>This is a huge benefit over rival crypto casinos, that often require players to have 25x to 50x wagering requirements to secure their bonus.</p>
<p>One downside to the bonus, though, is that the 180% bonus is paid in BC Dollars and only available to use on the BC.Game site.</p>
<p>The casino also offers further bonuses on subsequent deposits, meaning players can receive 780% bonuses matched on their first four deposits.</p>
<p>BC.Game supports more than 100 cryptos in total, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and other large-cap altcoins, and offers near-instant deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>There is a minumim depsoit of $30 required, however.</p>
<p>Away from the sportsbook, BC.Game has a large selection of classic casino games and slots, including live and virtual dealers and provably fair games from leading providers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Pros:Â </strong></p>

<h3>11. 1xBit â Racebook Offering Live Betting Markets</h3>

<h2>How to Pick the Best Crypto Horse Betting Site</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Finding the best crypto horse betting site is not an easy task &#8211; especially when considering the wide range of options in the market.Â </p>
<p>Nevertheless, players can narrow down their options by taking into account the following factors.</p>
<h3>SecurityÂ </h3>
<p>Players should make sure that their chosen crypto horse betting site has strong security measures in place. All of the casino sites from our list have adequate licensing to offer online gambling services.Â </p>
<p>In addition to this, players can also check for other features, such as an SSL certificate and the latest security protocols that ensure data is kept safe. Â </p>
<h3>Horse Racing Betting Odds</h3>
<p>It is important to compare odds from multiple online sportsbooks and bookmakers in order to find the most competitive prices.Â </p>
<p>All of the best crypto horse racing betting sites we reviewed above stand out in the market with their often industry-leading odds.Â </p>
<p>Moreover, players should also check whether their chosen racebook offers odds in their preferred format.Â </p>
<p>For instance, some platforms might give odds in American or fractional format, while others might provide them in decimal.Â </p>
<p>There are also online betting sites that support multiple odds formats, such as decimal, fractional, and money-line.Â </p>
<h3>Range of Horse Race Betting Markets</h3>
<p>In simple terms, the more betting markets a site offers, the more wagering options a player has to choose from.Â </p>
<p>As is clear from our guide, the best crypto horse race betting sites grant players access to a wide range of races from across the world.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/105018/257246/screenshot-2023-02-16-at-03-12-31.jpg" alt="Horse Racing Betslip" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, players should check out what types of race betting markets are available on different sites.Â </p>
<p>The top providers offer a wide range of horse race betting markets &#8211; such as win, place, show, exacta, quinella, trifecta, superfecta, and more.Â </p>
<h3>Racebook BonusesÂ </h3>
<p>Bonuses can significantly increase a player&#8217;s bankroll, allowing gamblers to play for longer periods or bet more than they would have otherwise.Â </p>
<p>The bonuses can vary widely between different crypto horse race betting sites.Â </p>
<p>Therefore, players need to think about what types of bonuses they prefer &#8211; such as matched deposits or free bets.Â </p>
<p>It is also important to check the wagering conditions before joining a platform for the purpose of claiming a bonus.Â </p>
<h3>Live Streaming</h3>
<p>Based on our research, there are not many betting sites that feature live streaming of horse races.Â </p>
<p>Cloudbet is one of the few crypto horse race betting sites that feature this option. Moreover, there are also only a limited number of crypto casinos that facilitate in-play betting on races.Â </p>
<h3>Mobile App</h3>
<p>Among the crypto horse racing betting sites we listed earlier, only 1xBit has a dedicated app.Â </p>
<p>Otherwise, players can access their chosen horse betting site from their standard phone browser.Â </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we noticed that all the top providers offer responsive websites that feature a smooth user experience, enabling players to bet on horse racing while on the go. Â </p>
<h3>Accepted Cryptos</h3>
<p>Players should also consider whether the chosen horse race betting site accepts their preferred cryptocurrencies.Â </p>
<p>While the majority of providers support Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin payments, funding with digital assets such as Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin is not widely available.Â </p>
<h3>Min Deposit &amp; Payout Time</h3>
<p>When checking out the payment options, also assess the deposit requirements.Â </p>
<p>For instance, on Lucky Block, players can get started with just $1, whereas the majority of other platforms stipulate $20 or more.Â </p>
<p>Moreover, the minimum deposit conditions might also be different for specific bonuses.Â </p>
<p>Payout times can also vary between betting sites &#8211; so it is best for players to choose a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-casino-instant-withdrawal.htm">Bitcoin casino that supports instant withdrawals</a>.Â </p>
<h2>How to Bet on Horse Races with Crypto</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Wondering how to get started with a horse racing crypto betting site?Â </p>
<p>Below, we offer a step-by-step explanation of how to create an account and start betting with BetOnline &#8211; one of the best crypto horse racing betting sites of 2023.Â </p>
<h3>Step 1: Join BetOnline</h3>
<p>The first port of call is to create an account with BetOnline. This requires players to provide some basic personal information &#8211; such as a full name, email address, and date of birth.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/105018/257242/screenshot-2023-02-16-at-00-36-28.jpg" alt="Create Account On BetOnline" /></figure>
<p>Then click on the &#8216;Create Account&#8217; button to proceed.Â </p>
<h3>Step 2: Complete KYC Verification</h3>
<p>BetOnline accepts both fiat and crypto deposits. And as such, this platform needs players to complete the KYC process.Â </p>
<p>Players can do this by providing a copy of their government-issued ID, such as a passport or driverâs license.Â </p>
<p>The platform will also need a recently issued proof of address document, like a utility bill.Â </p>
<h3>Step 3: Deposit Funds</h3>
<p>Once the KYC verification is complete, players can fund their accounts. To do this, go to the &#8216;Cashier&#8217; section of the account dashboard, and find the &#8216;Deposit&#8217; button.Â </p>
<p>Next, choose the preferred cryptocurrency from the available deposit options.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/105018/257244/screenshot-2023-02-16-at-01-50-08.jpg" alt="Bet Online Bitcoin Deposit" /></figure>
<p>Enter the desired deposit amount and carry out the transaction using an external crypto wallet.Â </p>
<p>At this stage, players can also enter a promo code to take advantage of the many BetOnline bonuses currently being offered. Â </p>
<h3>Step 4: Select a Race and Place a Horse Racing BetÂ Â </h3>
<p>Once the funds are credited to the account, players can head over to the &#8216;Racebook&#8217; section and find an event they want to bet on.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/105018/257245/screenshot-2023-02-16-at-01-54-57.jpg" alt="BetOnline Horse Racing" /></figure>
<p>Next, choose a race to bet on. BetOnline will now display the different betting markets along with the respective odds.Â </p>
<p>Choose the preferred option and enter a stake. The betting slip will reflect the chosen bet. Click on the &#8216;Submit All Bets&#8217; button to place the wager.Â </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>For those looking to bet on horse racing with crypto, Lucky Block, BC.Game and CloudBet all represent excellent choices &#8211; they offer access to tracks from multiple countries, as well as superb welcome bonuses.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice is our overall best crypto casino, offering unmatched bonuses, leading slots games and both live and virtual casino games. It also has no KYC verification and instant payouts, allowing players to sign up and get playing quickly. It doesn&#8217;t offer horse racing yet, but could add it soon.</p>

<p>Not to mention support for fast payments and a wide range of cricket markets &#8211; both domestically and internationally.Â </p>
<p>Read on to find comprehensive reviews of the 11 best Bitcoin cricket betting sites.Â </p>
<h3>1. Mega Dice &#8211; Bitcoin Cricket Betting Site Offering Up to 1 BTC Welcome Bonus</h3>
<p>Another high-ranking Bitcoin betting site on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice</a>. A recently released casino and sportsbook, Mega Dice offers a 200% matched deposit bonus of up to 1 BTC and 50 free spins.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice&#8217;s sportsbook supports 39 different markets. But that list doesn&#8217;t include cricket, but rather includes eCricket. When it comes to betting, Mega Dice supports both in-play and future lets. Parlay bets are also available for those who want to take a riskier approach. And those who are in a rush can click on the Quick Bet option on the Betslip to place bets with just a single click.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/314800/live-ecricket-betting-meg.jpg" alt="Mega Dice Live eCricket" /></figure>
<p>Mega Dice&#8217;s sportsbook includes games such as Tennis, Soccer, Basketball, Table Tennis, FIFA, Volleyball, American Football, Baseball, and more. There are also virtual sports available. For traditional sports, the odds provider is Betradar, and for digital sports betting, the odds providers are Betgenius and Odding.Â </p>
<p>While live cricket betting is not an option available on this platform, it may not be the same in the future. Mega Dice is focusing on expanding its services. And more sports will be added to the sportsbook. For now, we suggest checking out the eSports betting options.Â </p>
<p>However, Mega Dice doesn&#8217;t have any sportsbook-specific bonuses. The 200% matched deposit bonus it offers is only for the casino. But you can use the winnings of your casino and spend on a sportsbook if you wish. Claiming the welcome bonus won&#8217;t be much difficult for veteran and long-term players due to the casino options available.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/322911/screen-shot-2023-08-09-at.jpg" alt="Mega Dice Telegram Casino Bot" /></figure>
<p>Mega Dice also offers its games through Telegram, something which has never been done before. Users can navigate to the <a href="https://bs_c22ac4a3.cryptonewsdom.care/">Mega Dice Casino Telegram bot</a> to place their bets and to deposit their crypto, without any KYC. This can have a major impact in terms of usability, given the existing Telegram userbase of over 700 million users.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice offers a host of slot games and live dealer games to choose from. These include old school and traditional slots as we all fan favorite table games. There is also a section of crypto-specific games like Crash, and Plinko.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice supports 10 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Tether, BNB, and more. Fiat deposits and withdrawals are also supported, and there is live chat support available that responds within 30 seconds.Â </p>

<h3>2. Lucky Block &#8211; Best Bitcoin Cricket Betting SiteÂ </h3>

<p>Moreover, there are upcoming test games including Bangladesh vs India and Australia vs South Africa. Many individual betting markets are offered on each supported cricket game. This includes bespoke bets such as the total number of boundaries and whether or not a century will be scored. We also like that players can place cricket bets while the game is still ongoing. Â </p>
<p>To offer a more immersive gambling experience, Lucky Block provides a live dashboard with in-game cricket scores and statistics. The Lucky Block sportsbook is hugely comprehensive and one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">best Bitcoin betting sites</a> for multiple sports.

<h3>3. BC.Game &#8211; Bet on Cricket After Claiming 4 Deposit BonusesÂ </h3>
<p><a href="https://partnerbcgame.com/d40d2463d">BC.Game</a> is also one of the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites. The platform offers both pre-match and in-play odds on cricket games from all over the world. This includes T20, test, and ODI games from various leagues, tournaments, and regions. In terms of markets, BC.Game offers a huge range of options when it comes to choosing a Bitcoin cricket betting outcome.</p>
<p>For example, players can bet on who will win the game outright, or on individual innings and specific overs. For instance, the total number of runs for a particular team after 20 overs. BC.Game is also great for player prop bets. This refers to betting on individual player achievements from within the respective game &#8211; such as total runs or wickets. Â Â </p>
<p>On top of cricket, BC.Game (considered by some users as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-nfl-betting-sites.htm">best Bitcoin NFL betting site</a>) covers dozens of other sporting markets. This includes everything from soccer, baseball, and boxing to MMA, darts, and snooker.

<h3>4. Cloudbet &#8211; Established Cricket Betting Site With a 5 BTC Welcome Package</h3>
<p><a href="https://cloudbet.com/en/bitcoin-bonus?af_token=ae4254b0cbbf0760d3442112d77a6748&amp;aftm_campaign=cryptonews">Cloudbet</a> is also a high-ranking platform on this list of the best Bitcoin cricket sites. Whether it&#8217;s ODIs, T20s, or test games, Cloudbet has cricket gamblers covered. Odds are very competitive here but the number of individual betting markets is limited. For example, on Big Bash games, the only bet on offer is the winner&#8217;s market.Â </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Cloudbet more than makes up for this drawback with its welcome package. Those opening an account for the first time will get the first deposit matched by 100% &#8211; up to a maximum of 5 BTC. There is no bonus code required to claim the matched deposit. In addition to Bitcoin, Cloudbet also supports cricket betting with Ethereum, Tether, DAI, Dash, and multiple other coins.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244636/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-12-48-26.jpg" alt="Cricket Competitions On Cloudbet" /></figure>
<p>Cloudbet is also a great option for betting on other sports, with the platform offering markets on soccer, darts, American football, baseball, and dozens of other events. Cloudbet is also considered a great option for casino games. This includes more than a thousand slot games, live dealers, provably fair titles, and dice.Â </p>

<h3>5. Winz.io &#8211; Get a $20 Risk-Free Cricket Bet With ZERO Wagering Requirements</h3>
<p><a href="https://winzmedia.top/af171f53e">Winz.io</a> is one of the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites for its hugely generous bonus and promotion terms. This platform is the only provider on this list that offers ZERO wagering requirements on its welcome package. What&#8217;s more, Winz.io offers a welcome bonus not only for sports betting, but slots too.Â </p>
<p>Regarding the former, players making a deposit of a least $100 will get two bonuses by entering the promo code &#8216;SPORTS&#8217;. First, the new player will get a $20 risk-free bet, which can be used on cricket or any other sporting event. Second, the new player will also get a 100% matched deposit bonus. As such, by depositing $100, Winz.io will add a further $100 to the player&#8217;s account.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244638/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-13-00-41.jpg" alt="Winz.io Upcoming Cricket Matches" /></figure>
<p>Once the sports bonus has been claimed, players can then enter the promo code &#8216;SLOTS&#8217;. In doing so &#8211; and making a further $100 deposit, 300 free slot spins will be awarded. And once again, just like the sports bonus, there are no wagering terms on the free spins. Winz.io also supports live dealers, table games, and a range of instant win titles.Â </p>

<h3>6. Thunderpick &#8211; 2x Wagering Requirements on a $500 Deposit BonusÂ </h3>
<p>While not as generous as Winz.io, Thunderpick is still one of the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites for bonuses. The welcome package offers players a 5% matched deposit bonus of up to $500 with wagering requirements of just 2x. Alternatively, there is also a 100% matched bonus up to the same amount but the wagering target increases rapidly to 30x.Â </p>
<p>Either way, the bonus funds can be used to bet on cricket games &#8211; both pre-match and in-play. The main drawback with Thunderpick is that the number of supported cricket betting games is limited when compared to the likes of Lucky Block or BC.Game. As such, this option is more suited for claiming the welcome package and other notable promotions.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244639/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-13-04-15.jpg" alt="Thunderpick Casino Signup Page" /></figure>
<p>With that said, Thunderpick does stand out when it comes to classic casino games like baccarat, blackjack, and roulette &#8211; all of which can be accessed via live or software dealers. Slots are also a staple on this platform, with leading providers including Pragmatic Play, BGaming, and Reflex Gaming. Thunderpick accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, XRP, and Bitcoin Cash.Â </p>

<h3>7. Rabona &#8211; User-Friendly Cricket Betting Site With Fair Bonus Terms Â </h3>
<p>Rabona offers a modest welcome package that consists of a 100% matched deposit bonus of up to â¬100. The key benefit of claiming this bonus, however, is that the wagering requirement is set at just 1x. Plus, to unlock to bonus and make a withdrawal, players can opt for a low-risk cricket betting market of 1.50 or more.Â </p>
<p>We also like Rabona for its wide selection of supported cricket games. As of writing, players can place wagers on domestic leagues in the UAE, Australia, Sri Lanka, and Barbados. There are also international games across T20 and a test series. In the Bangladesh vs India game alone, there are more than 286 betting markets to choose from. Most of which offer competitive odds.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90263/226276/screenshot-2022-10-10-at-11-44-20.jpg" alt="Rabona Casino Registration " /></figure>
<p>Cricket bets can also be played while the chosen match is still being played. Rabona offers great odds on dozens of other sports too, with the most popular including soccer, tennis, ice hockey, baseball, and American football. Players can also bet on horse racing and esports, in addition to classic casino games, slots, and video poker.Â </p>

<h3>8. 1xBit &#8211; Most Comprehensive Sportsbook in Terms of Cricket Betting Markets Â  Â </h3>
<p>When it comes to supported games and markets, 1xBit is arguably the best Bitcoin cricket betting site. Put simply, if there is a cricket game being played then 1xBit is all but certain to offer a betting market on it. As of writing, the platform is offering odds on nearly 150 cricket games, from the Australia vs South Africa test to the Barbados T10 league.Â </p>
<p>To offer further insight into just how comprehensive 1xBit is, some cricket games come with hundreds of individual betting markets. We also like 1xBit for its commitment to competitive odds and a streamlined in-play betting facility. 1xBit is also one of the best sportsbooks for soccer, tennis, and darts &#8211; not to mention American football, chess, and even greyhound racing.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244644/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-13-14-21.jpg" alt="1XBit Casino Cricket Sportsbook" /></figure>

<h3>9. Stake &#8211; Bet on Cricket Games From Around the World Â  Â  Â </h3>
<p>Although Stake is largely aimed at North American sports fans, it also offers one of the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites. As of writing, Stake is offering betting odds on the Big Bash League, in addition to the Barbados T10. Domestic games in Sri Lanka and the UAE &#8211; in addition to international matches, can also be found.Â </p>
<p>During times when there are limited games, Stake also offers virtual cricket betting markets around the clock. Stake also offers gambling markets on dozens of other sports, including soccer, baseball, ice hockey, and lacrosse.

<h3>10. BetOnline &#8211; US-Friendly Crypto Sportsbook With In-Play BettingÂ </h3>
<p><a href="https://record.commissionkings.ag/_Y2LNxjhQXIkNTExyHzZxqWNd7ZgqdRLk/919/">BetOnline</a> is favored by Bitcoin cricket betting stakeholders for its high limits, competitive odds, and generous bonuses. Regarding the latter, BetOnline offers a 50% welcome bonus of up to $1,000 with wagering requirements of just 10x. However, players based in the US will get a 100% welcome bonus when making a payment in crypto.Â </p>
<p>The wagering requirements are slightly higher at 14x and the bonus is also capped at $1,000. Cricket betting markets are average at BetOnline, with only the most popular games and leagues supported. Nonetheless, we like the user-friendliness of the platform, which will appeal to beginners.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90263/226265/screenshot-2022-10-10-at-10-59-34.jpg" alt="BetOnline Account Opening" /></figure>
<p>Another metric that will appeal to newbies is that the minimum deposit at BetOnline is just $20. BetOnline is also one of the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites for accepted cryptocurrencies. This even includes the likes of Tron, Shiba Inu, ApeCoin, and Avalanche. BetOnline also offers traditional casino games, slots, live poker rooms, and horse racing markets.Â </p>

<h3>11. FortuneJack &#8211; Huge Welcome Package of 6 BTC for New PlayersÂ </h3>
<p>One of the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites to consider for bonuses is FortuneJack. Not only are the wagering conditions fair at 30x, but the welcome package is valued at up to 6 BTC. As such, we value the welcome bonus at nearly $100,000 based on current prices. To get the full 6 BTC in bonus funds, the player must make four deposits.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244645/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-13-34-16.jpg" alt="FortuneJack Signup Page" /></figure>
<p>The welcome package also comes with a series of free slot spins. FortuneJack is also one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ethereum-betting-sites.htm">best Ethereum betting sites</a> for cricket odds. We found this to be the case both pre-match and in-play. Both deposits and withdrawals are processed quickly at FortuneJack and in most cases, there is no KYC process.Â </p>
<p>However, KYC documents might be required after certain betting limits have been triggered. The minimum deposit at FortuneJack is 0.001 BTC or the crypto equivalent. In addition to cricket and sports betting, FortuneJack players can access slots, table games, live dealers, and provably fair titles. Â Â </p>

<h2>How we Picked the Best Crypto Cricket Betting Sites</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>During the process of researching the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites, we compared platforms based on a variety of factors.Â </p>
<p>Read on to find out how we ranked the 11 best crypto cricket betting sites:</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Cricket Betting Bonuses</h3>
<p>All sports gamblers look for Bitcoin betting bonuses and cricket is no different in this regard. As such, we give high priority to cricket betting sites that offer the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casino-bonuses.htm">best Bitcoin casino bonuses</a>.</p>
<p>Take BC.Game for example &#8211; which offers first-time customers four matched deposit bonuses. Lucky Block offers new players a 15% cashback promotion for the first seven days, while Winz.io offers a $20 risk-free cricket bet.Â </p>
<p>When exploring bonuses, players should read the terms and conditions. In particular, check metrics surrounding the minimum deposit, wagering requirement, and accepted markets. Â Â </p>
<h3>Range of Cricket Betting Markets</h3>
<p>There was a big disparity in the range of supported cricket games and betting markets when reviewing the many sportsbooks in this space.Â </p>
<p>We found that Lucky Block and BC.Game were strong in this regard, with both platforms covering cricket games from multiple regions &#8211; both domestically and internationally.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244646/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-13-50-09.jpg" alt="Australian Cricket Game Odds" /></figure>
<p>While in other cases &#8211; such as BetOnline, only the most popular cricket tournaments and leagues are covered.Â </p>
<p>Moreover, we also found that both Lucky Block and BC.Game are great when it comes to supported markets on each cricket game. This includes more bespoke betting options &#8211; such as the player with the most runs or wickets.Â </p>
<h3>Live Cricket Betting</h3>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s T20s, ODIs, or test games &#8211; the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites offer in-play wagers. This means that even if the game has already started, the site will offer live odds.Â </p>
<p>The odds will change on a second-by-second basis &#8211; based on each bowl. For example, if team A gets a wicket, then the odds of team B winning will increase. Â Â </p>
<h3>Competitive Cricket Betting Odds</h3>
<p>We only consider Bitcoin cricket betting sites that offer competitive odds. This can be a challenging metric to evaluate on a DIY basis, considering how many markets are on offer.Â </p>
<p>Nonetheless, from the comprehensive research that we compiled, we found that the best crypto cricket betting sites for odds are Lucky Block and BC.Game.Â </p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why the aforementioned sportsbooks ranked so highly on our list of providers.Â </p>
<h3>Secure Crypto Payments</h3>
<p>Depositing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into a cricket betting site should be secure and seamless.Â </p>
<p>All of the providers discussed today accept external crypto payments on a wallet-to-wallet basis.Â </p>
<p>There is no need to provide any financial information &#8211; as the sportsbook will credit the payment as soon as the respective network confirms the transfer.Â </p>
<h3>Low Minimums &amp; Fast Payouts</h3>
<p>The best crypto cricket betting sites ensure that players of all budgets are catered for. At Lucky Block, players can get started with a cricket betting account with just $1.Â </p>
<p>At the other end of the cricket betting journey, Lucky Block does not implement withdrawal limits. This ensures that if a player secures a large cricket betting win, they can withdraw the entire amount instantly.Â </p>
<p>In terms of payout speeds, this is another metric that can vary wildly from one cricket sportsbook to the next. For example, while Ethereum withdrawals usually take just five minutes at Lucky Block, the same transaction can take up to 24 hours at 1xBit. We rank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-instant-withdrawal-bitcoin-casinos.htm">instant withdrawal casinos</a> higher in this rating.</p>
<h2>How Does Bitcoin Cricket Betting Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When betting on cricket with Bitcoin, the process works much the same as a traditional sportsbook. Only instead of depositing funds with a debit/credit card or bank account wire, payments are made on a crypto-to-crypto basis.Â </p>
<p>Furthermore, when cricket crypto betting online, the best platforms do not ask for any personal information when opening an account. This means that when betting on cricket with Bitcoin, the process is often anonymous.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Players will have access to both domestic and international cricket games at leading providers like Lucky Block, across hundreds of individual betting markets.Â </li>
<li>Players will also need to set up a betting slip to execute the wager.Â </li>
<li>This simply requires the player to enter their stake and confirm the respective bet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the best crypto cricket betting sites usually settle bets as soon as the game has finished. This means that if the cricket bet won, the player can either use the funds to place another wager or withdraw the crypto to a private wallet.Â </p>
<h2>Crypto Cricket Betting Bonuses</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In each of our cricket sportsbook reviews, we briefly discussed the ins and outs of each bonus and promotion that players can claim.Â </p>
<p>For those new to gambling bonuses, here&#8217;s what beginners need to know when cricket betting with Bitcoin online.Â </p>
<h3>Cashback Bonuses</h3>
<p>Lucky Block is a great option for cashback bonuses.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244647/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-14-31-13.jpg" alt="Lucky Block 15% Cashback" /></figure>
<p>This is because when cricket betting with Bitcoin during the first seven days, a 15% refund can be claimed for any net losses.Â </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player deposits $200 after opening an account</li>
<li>After seven days of betting, the player&#8217;s balance stands at $100</li>
<li>This means that the player has net losses of $100</li>
<li>As such, 15% will be refunded &#8211; at $15</li>
</ul>
<p>To claim the refund, players simply need to speak with a member of the Lucky Block customer service team via live chat, which operates 24/7. Â </p>
<h3>Free Bets</h3>
<p>We also like cricket sportsbooks that offer free bets. This sometimes comes in the form of a risk-free bet.</p>
<p>For example, those making a deposit of at least $100 at Winz.io will be offered a $20 risk-free bet.Â </p>
<p>Naturally, if the bet loses, the player will find $20 in their betting account. On the other hand, if the bet wins, the player will keep the winnings minus the stake.Â </p>
<h3>Matched Deposit</h3>
<p>The most popular bonus type offered by the best Bitcoin cricket betting sites is a matched deposit. This is usually offered to players that are yet to open an account with the sportsbook.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>At BC.Game, deposits 1-4 are matched by 270%, 300%, 330%, and 360% respectivelyÂ </li>
<li>At Cloudbet, the first deposit is matched by 100% (up to 5 BTC)</li>
<li>At BetOnline, there is a 50% sports betting bonus up to $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Wagering requirements average 40x on matched deposit bonuses &#8211; but some Bitcoin cricket betting sites are more generous.Â </p>
<p>For example, Winz.io offers a 100% matched deposit bonus of up to $500 and there are no wagering requirements to meet whatsoever.Â </p>
<h3>No Deposit Bonus</h3>
<p>Due to the anonymous nature of Bitcoin cricket betting, no deposit bonuses are rarely seen. The only option we found in this regard is FortuneJack.Â </p>
<p>The platform offers a no deposit bonus of 100 free spins but with one fundamental condition &#8211; the player must go through a KYC process first.</p>
<h3>Prize DrawsÂ </h3>
<p>We also come across some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-airdrops.htm">best crypto airdrops</a> when reviewing Bitcoin cricket betting sites.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244648/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-14-30-58.jpg" alt="$10K LBLOCK Airdrop Giveaway" /></figure>
<p>The overall most generous is the $10,000 LBLOCK token giveaway being offered by Lucky Block.Â </p>
<p>As soon as the player has made a deposit and placed at least one bet, they will be entered into the prize draw. Â </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cricket betting with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is becoming hugely popular in the online gambling arena.Â </p>
<p>Some of the main driving forces for this continued growth increase generous cricket betting bonuses and promotions, anonymous gambling accounts, ultra-fast withdrawals, and access to hundreds of pre-match and in-play markets. Â </p>
<p>To start placing Bitcoin cricket bets right now &#8211; head over to Mega Dice. This casino and sportsbook offers betting markets on domestic and international cricket games at industry-leading odds, not to mention payouts that rarely exceed five minutes.Â </p>

<h3>4. Cloudbet &#8211; Range of Provably Fair Titles and Up to 5 BTC Welcome Bonus</h3>
<p><a href="https://cloudbet.com/en/bitcoin-bonus?af_token=ae4254b0cbbf0760d3442112d77a6748&amp;aftm_campaign=cryptonews">Cloudbet</a> is one of the most reputable provably fair crypto casinos in the space. Best of all, supported provably fair games have an RTP of at least 97%. Cloudbet offers a range of provably fair games, albeit not as many as BC.Game. Players can access provably fair games such as Mines, Keno, Aviator, and Hi-Low.</p>
<p>We also found Goal Mines. This provably fair title has the same layout as the classic Mines game, only the grid is a football pitch and players must reach the goal without hitting a bomb. Cloudbet is one of the most reliable Bitcoin casino options, besides Lucky Block.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100002/247673/image.jpg" alt="Provably Fair Games On Cloudbet" /></figure>
<p>Cloudbet casino sometimes runs a promotion where players can claim 10% cashback of up to $1,000 on all provably fair games. Importantly, players will need to opt-in to qualify. This cashback offer is not always available so it is important for players to check the promotions page.</p>
<p>One promotion that is still running as of writing is the welcome offer worth up to 5 BTC. This is offered as a 100% first deposit match bonus. This means the casino is willing to match what the new player funds their account with.</p>
<p>When playing games, a segment of the bonus (0.001 BTC) is awarded for every 150 points gained. The number of points gained depends on the game played. The highest points are awarded for wagers on slot machines. The least amount of points is awarded for bets on blackjack.</p>

<p>Additionally, players can choose the sports option. In this case, when a player deposits $20 or more, they will be matched 100%. The bonus, in this case, will be given as free wagers for sports betting. Note that a wagering requirement of 50x must be completed in full in order to make a withdrawal. This is much higher than the other provably fair casinos we&#8217;ve reviewed today.</p>

<h2>Best Dogecoin Casino Sites Reviewed</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When deciding on the best Dogecoin casino, players should ensure that the platform has a solid reputation and that it offers fast deposits and withdrawals.Â </p>
<p>Players should also consider whether the platform offers Dogecoin casino bonuses for both new and existing account holders.Â </p>
<p>Below, we cover the above metrics and more by reviewing the 12 best Dogecoin casinos for 2023.Â </p>
<h3>1. Mega Dice &#8211; Dogecoin Casino Supporting a Wide Array of Crypto Games</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/en">Mega Dice</a> is a crypto casino that differentiates itself from the rest thanks to its selection of crypto-related games. Not only will you find a standard array of slot games, live dealer games, and game shows on his platform, but there are also other crypto-specific games available.Â </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the first provider of its kind, in the world, to offer licensed gambling through Telegram. This means that any Telegram user can deposit crypto via the <a href="https://bs_c22ac4a3.cryptonewsdom.care/">Mega Dice Casino Bot,</a> and immediately start playing games. With no KYC, the time taken to access the Casino is minimal, usually completed as fast as the crypto deposit is confirmed.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/104309/314871/mega-dice-dogecoin-casino.jpg" alt="Mega Dice Casino 200% Bonus" /></figure>
<p>You can play these games through 10 cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. Many consider Dogecoin as one of the best crypto this platform supports, because it has the lowest payout time &#8211; 1 minute. Other than Dogecoin, this casino also supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, Tron, Binance Coin, XRP, and Tether.Â </p>
<p>Those who sign up for the first time can get access to the welcome bonus as long as they deposit a minimum of $20. The welcome bonus is a 200% matched deposit bonus of up to 1 BTC and 50 free spins. Alongside welcome bonuses, Mega Dice also offers reloads and cashback bonuses. And when we reached out to the customer support team, they told us that loyal users also get access to customized bonuses.Â </p>
<p>Another major plus of this platform is the lack of any KYC requirements. You can also create an account without any need for email verification. That said, the only issue is that Mega Dice is not available in the US &#8211; but that problem can easily be circumvented using VPN.Â </p>

<h2>How We Select the Best Dogecoin Casinos</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When ranking the best Dogecoin casinos, we focused on the following metrics:</p>
<h3>Private and Anonymous Accounts</h3>
<p>Most Dogecoin online casinos support private and anonymous betting accounts.Â </p>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>No personal information</li>
<li>No contact details (other than an email address)</li>
<li>No KYC documents</li>
</ul>
<p>Anonymous accounts are not available when gambling with fiat money, which is why Dogecoin casinos are becoming so popular.Â </p>
<h3>Near-Instant Payments</h3>
<p>We also found that the best Dogecoin casinos offer rapid deposits and withdrawals. At Lucky Block, it takes just 2-3 minutes for DOGE deposits to clear.Â </p>
<p>Moreover, Lucky Block approves DOGE withdrawals near-instantly. As a result, it takes just minutes for winnings to be transferred to the selected Dogecoin wallet.Â </p>
<h3>Fee-Free Dogecoin Deposits and WithdrawalsÂ </h3>
<p>Another aspect of the payment process that we look for when ranking casinos that accept Dogecoin is whether or not fees are charged.Â </p>
<p>Most of the platforms discussed on this page offer fee-free payments.Â </p>
<h3>Casino Gaming Suite and SportsbookÂ </h3>
<p>We prefer Dogecoin casinos that offer a huge gambling suite across many gaming products. At a minimum, we expect to find dozens of table games like blackjack and roulette, across many different variations.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/96318/239926/image.jpg" alt="Soccer Matches On Lucky Block Casino" /></figure>
<p>We also look for new Dogecoin casinos that offer a wide selection of slots and live dealer tables. The best Dogecoin casino sites &#8211; including Lucky Block, Cloudbet, and BC.Game &#8211; also offer an in-house sportsbook with competitive odds.Â </p>
<h3>Dogecoin Bonuses and PromotionsÂ </h3>
<p>When signing up with a Dogecoin casino site for the first time, players will usually receive a bonus.Â </p>
<p>This ranges from matched deposit bonuses, free spins, cashback, and risk-free bets. When researching Dogecoin casino bonuses, we take a very close look at the terms and conditions.Â </p>
<p>For instance, the minimum deposit to qualify for the bonus and what the wagering requirements amount to.</p>
<h3>Mobile Compatibility Â </h3>
<p>All of the Dogecoin casinos discussed today enable players to place wagers on a smartphone device. Each platform has optimized its gaming suite for standard mobile web browsers.Â </p>
<p>Some of the Dogecoin casinos listed on this page offer a dedicated app, with both Android and iOS usually supported. Â </p>
<h3>Reputation Â </h3>
<p>Dogecoin casinos operate in an unregulated environment, so it is important to do some due diligence on a platform before opening an account.Â </p>
<p>With that said, the very best Dogecoin casino that we reviewed today &#8211; Lucky Block, is licensed with regulators in Curacao.Â </p>
<p>This shows that Lucky Block takes player safety seriously and that account holders can be confident in the legitimacy of its platform.Â </p>
<h3>Customer Support Â </h3>
<p>The best Dogecoin gambling sites in the market offer 24/7 customer support. With that said, we prefer platforms that offer support via live chat.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/104309/255803/screenshot-2023-02-08-at-09-35-07.jpg" alt="Lucky Block 15% Cashback" /></figure>
<p>This prevents the need to send an email and subsequently wait several hours for a response.Â </p>
<h2>Are Dogecoin Casinos Legal?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto assets &#8211; including Dogecoin, are unregulated in most countries. This means that Dogecoin gambling sites operate in a completely different way from fiat casinos. Â </p>
<p>For example, Dogecoin casinos like Lucky Block and Cloudbet do not have e a conventional KYC policy in place, so players can open an account anonymously.Â </p>
<p>Furthermore, unlike traditional casinos, many Dogecoin gambling sites operate without betting and withdrawal limits.Â </p>
<p>While players will need to research the legality of gambling in their own country, crypto casinos are generally not prohibited.Â </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>This comparison guide has ranked and reviewed 12 Dogecoin casinos, taking into account promotions, games, sign-up bonuses, withdrawal times, and much more.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice is the number one provider that we have discussed today. Players can open an anonymous account in just 30 seconds and Dogecoin payments are processed near-instantly.Â </p>
<p>Mega Dice supports everything from sports betting and live casino dealers to table games and slots.Â </p>

<h3>1. Mega Dice &#8211; Bitcoin Super Bowl Betting Site With Up to 1 BTC Matched Deposit Bonus</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/en">Mega Dice</a> is a casino and sportsbook offering betting opportunities across a wide array of events, including the Super Bowl, NFL, CFL, NCAA Division 1, and more. Betting odds on this website are provided by the likes of Betradar for traditional sports. But if you are interested in eSports titles, Betgenius and Odding are the odd providers.Â </p>
<p>Customers can now <a href="https://bs_c22ac4a3.cryptonewsdom.care/">access the Mega Dice Casino through Telegram</a>. Telegram has never before been used to offer licensed gambling to customers. But the integration will allow for increased accessibility, given the popularity of Telegram among crypto enthusiasts. It removes all extra steps in terms of onboarding, so customers can quickly and easily place bets on their favorite games.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/99679/314809/mega-dice-super-bowl.jpg" alt="Mega Dice NFL Games" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, Mega Dice makes it easier to bet on sports in multiple ways. The dashboard is simple to interact with, and all you need to do is to select an event and the team, which will quickly allow you to place your bets via the bet slip. Betslip will allow you to customize your bets, but quickbet is also an option you want to bet immediately.Â </p>
<p>Along with sportsbetting, Mega Dice offers multiple casino games to choose from. While the platform doesn&#8217;t have any table games available, it has a robust live dealer selection with games like Blackjack, Poker, Baccarat, and others available. Crypto-specific games such as Crash, Plinko, Hi-Lo, and Keno are also present here.Â </p>
<p>Playing slots on Mega Dice is the most rewarding, as the welcome bonus you get upon creating an account is tied to the slots. As a new user, you get a 200% matched deposit bonus and 50 free spins. These free spins can be used on Wanted: Dead or A Wild. The 200% matched deposit bonus goes up to 1 BTC and has a 40x wagering requirement.</p>
<p>In terms of payment options, Mega Dice supports 10 cryptocurrencies. Fiat payment options are also available here &#8211; but their payout times can be high. With crypto payments, however, payout times are near instant. For instance, Dogecoin&#8217;s payout time is only 1 minute.Â </p>

<h3>4. Cloudbet &#8211; Super Bowl Betting Site With Crypto Bonus of up to 5 BTC</h3>
<p><a href="https://cloudbet.com/en/bitcoin-bonus?af_token=ae4254b0cbbf0760d3442112d77a6748&amp;aftm_campaign=cryptonews">Cloudbet</a> has the reputation of being a great crypto casino for sports gamblers. And not so surprisingly, it is also one of the most popular sites for Super Bowl betting. The main reason for this is that Cloudbet offers a range of unique promotions and features that are exclusive to its platform.Â </p>
<p>For instance, the casino offers close-to-zero margins on betting markets for selected NFL games. Users can find this offer by keeping an eye out for highlighted events on the Cloudbet sportsbook. In addition to this, Cloudbet also offers a 100% matched deposit bonus worth up to 5 BTC for new players.Â </p>

<p>However, users need to bear in mind that the entire welcome bonus will not be released at once. Instead, players will have to place wagers on Cloudbet and gain points. The casino will release 0.001 BTC every time the player accumulates 150 points.Â </p>
<p>While Cloudbet features more than 35+ sports, it also has an impressive selection of classic casino games. Players can try their luck at popular games such as slots, video poker, baccarat, and blackjack. There is also support for live dealer casino games on Cloudbet.Â </p>
<p>In terms of other bonuses, Cloudbet offers seasonal promotions &#8211; such as free spins and slot tournaments.

<p>Perhaps, the most impressive aspect is that Winz.io has no wagering requirements for its welcome bonuses. Bear in mind that there are other bonuses for slots players, as well as those who prefer live-dealer games. Regarding features, Winz.io supports both pre-match and in-play betting for sports events like the Super Bowl.Â </p>
<p>Moreover, Winz.io also has a unique feature that shows the relevant statistics related to a specific game. This can be a valuable tool for players to assess the potential outcome before placing bets. However, we found that Winz.io only supports decimal odds, which might not be suitable for Americans.Â </p>
<p>The platform also offers access to thousands of popular casino games, such as slots, live dealers, video poker, and crypto lotteries. Players will also be to fund their accounts with seven cryptocurrencies. To keep things interesting, Winz.io also hosts slots tournaments and gambling races regularly.Â </p>

<h2>Guide to Super Bowl Bitcoin Betting</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Sports betting has become an increasingly popular segment of online gambling in recent years. Thanks to a US Supreme Court decision that opened the door to state-by-state legalization, Americans now have access to online sports betting sites that allow them to gamble on Super Bowl using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.Â </p>
<p>Moreover, with online crypto gambling sites, Super Bowl betting is now accessible to not only Americans but also to sports enthusiasts from across the world. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-decentralized-gambling-sites.htm">best decentralized gambling sites</a> allow players to fund their accounts with Bitcoin, as well as other popular cryptocurrencies.Â </p>
<p>This means that players need not pay high deposit fees, nor do they have to wait for days to get their winnings transferred to their wallets. Instead, the entire process is simplified, allowing players to get started with Super Bowl betting in a matter of minutes.Â </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Super Bowl Betting Odds &amp; Lines</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In crypto sports betting, odds and lines are used to specify the probability of an outcome, and how much money a player can win. To learn how to read odds, players need to understand what type of system they are dealing with.Â </p>
<p>The best Bitcoin Super Bowl sites feature different types of odds. However, players will most commonly find American and European odds when gambling on sports events such as the Super Bowl.Â </p>
<h3>American Odds</h3>
<p>American odds, also known as the &#8216;Money line,&#8217; is most popular in the US. In this case, the favorites will have odds represented with a minus (-) sign, which indicates the amount players need to stake to win $100. On the contrary, odds for underdogs will have a positive (+) sign.Â </p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say a betting website prices an NFL game between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo Bills: +125</li>
<li>Cincinnati Bengals: -150Â </li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the bookmaker suggests that Cincinnati Bengals have a high probability of winning. So, if a player bets $150, they have a chance of winning $100, in order to get a total payout of $250.Â </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the player decides to bet on Buffalo Bills, they need to risk $100 in order to make a potential win of $125 &#8211; which will bring the total payout to $225.Â </p>
<p>In both cases, the winner will get back the initial stake, along with the amount won. The difference between the two odds also indicates how much of a chance the favorite has of winning the game.Â </p>
<h3>European Odds</h3>
<p>European, also known as decimal odds, are widely used by players across Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. As it uses a decimal system, it&#8217;s easier to understand for many.Â </p>
<p>For instance, European odds for an NFL match can look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo Bills: 2.25</li>
<li>Cincinnati Bengals: 1.66</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate the potential win, players can simply multiply the stake amount by the odds. So, if a player bets $100 on Buffalo Bills and the team wins, the winnings amount to $225 (2.25 X $100). The total payout is therefore $325 ($100 stake + $225 winnings).Â </p>
<p>With European odds, the higher the payout (higher the decimal point) &#8211; the less probability that the team will win.Â </p>
<p>In addition to American and European lines, many popular sites also support Super Bowl Bitcoin betting odds that are based on British (fractional), Hong Kong, Indonesian, and Malaysian systems.Â </p>
<h2>Super Bowl Betting MarketsÂ </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When looking for the best Bitcoin Super Bowl betting site, players should also consider what types of markets are available.Â </p>
<p>Below, we go over some of the most popular Super Bowl betting markets commonly found on crypto sports gambling sites.Â </p>
<h3>1&#215;2</h3>
<p>1&#215;2 bets allow players to place wagers on the three possible results of a match. In this betting option,Â </p>
<p>&#8216;1&#8217; represents a win for the home team, and &#8216;x&#8217; suggests that the match will end in a draw.Â </p>
<p>As imaginable, the &#8216;2&#8217; means that the away team will win. If a player correctly guesses the result, they will win the bet.Â </p>
<h3>Point SpreadÂ </h3>
<p>In sports betting, a point spread is the margin of victory in a match. It represents the difference between the oddsmaker&#8217;s and the betting market&#8217;s best guess.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/99679/247538/screenshot-2023-01-04-at-02-27-37.jpg" alt="NFL Point Spreads" /></figure>
<p>As such, the spread can be as low as half a point, or even more than 50 &#8211; depending on the teams. In some betting markets, the point spread is also known as &#8216;handicap.&#8217;Â </p>
<h3>Props</h3>
<p>A prop bet is not tied to the outcome or the final score of the game. Instead, it often revolves around individual players or other aspects of the game.Â </p>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will there be a safety in the Super Bowl &#8211; yes or no?</li>
<li>Which team will have more rushing yards?</li>
<li>How many total receptions will a specific player have?</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of props markets available will vary from one sportsbook to another.Â </p>
<h3>Game Totals</h3>
<p>Betting sites also allow players to speculate on the total score for the two teams playing the Super Bowl. Put simply, the player will need to wager whether the total score will be above or below a predefined number.Â </p>
<h3>ParlayÂ </h3>
<p>Parley is another way for football fans to bet on the Super Bowl. In simple terms, a parlay bet combines multiple wagers.Â </p>
<p>Although there is only one Super Bowl game, players can combine bets such as game lines, props, and others into one bet slip for a parlay.Â </p>
<p>All of the picks on the bet slip must be correct in order for it to be settled as a winner.Â </p>
<h3>Super Bowl Futures BetÂ </h3>
<p>In this bet, players need to consider the Super Bowl odds days, weeks, or months in advance to decide which team will win.Â </p>
<p>The catch is that the odds can change at any time, depending on events. For instance, players could get injured, or the coach might get sacked.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/99679/247539/screenshot-2023-01-04-at-02-28-34.jpg" alt="NFL Match Odds" /></figure>
<p>The team with the lowest Super Bowl odds is favored to win the championship, whereas the rest are deemed underdogs.Â </p>
<h2>Super Bowl Bitcoin Free Bets &amp; Bonuses 2023</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To encourage gambling on the Super Bowl, crypto betting sites often feature a variety of bonuses and promos.Â </p>
<p>In this section, let us take a look at the top crypto bonuses available on sportsbooks.Â </p>
<h3>Cashback Bonuses</h3>
<p>With a cashback bonus, players can get a certain percentage of any losses encountered &#8211; usually for a specific number of days.Â </p>
<p>Cashback bonuses are not commonly available at all sports betting sites.Â </p>
<p>Lucky Block happens to be one of the few that offers this feature. With Lucky Block, players can get 15% cashback on any losses incurred after seven days of joining.Â </p>
<h3>Matched DepositsÂ </h3>
<p>Matched bonuses are offered by casinos when a player deposits funds into their account.Â </p>
<p>With this bonus, the sportsbook will offer a certain percentage of the deposit as a reward to the player.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/99679/247541/screenshot-2023-01-04-at-03-07-25.jpg" alt="FortuneJack Matched Deposits" /></figure>
<p>This bonus amount can vary depending on the platform. On BC.Game, players can get a matched bonus of 1,260% across the first four deposits.Â </p>
<p>Matched deposits are commonly offered as a welcome package. However, some platforms also offer reload bonuses each time a returning player makes a deposit to the platform.Â </p>
<h3>Risk-Free BetsÂ </h3>
<p>A risk-free bet is an offer where the player will be refunded the original stake if the wager ends up losing. Usually, the amount is capped at a certain amount.Â </p>
<p>For instance, Winz.io offers sports gamblers a risk-free bet as part of the welcome bonus. However, this is capped at $20.Â </p>
<h3>No Deposit Free BetsÂ </h3>
<p>Free bets are another bonus commonly offered by sports gambling sites. With free bets, players can place wagers on the Super Bowl and other sports events without risking their own money.Â </p>
<p>No deposit free bets are offered as rewards for players when signing up with a site. This means that there is no need to make a deposit at the time of signing up.Â </p>
<p>Instead, players will receive free bet credits; however, they will need to fulfill huge wagering conditions before they can withdraw any winnings.Â </p>
<h3>GiveawayÂ </h3>
<p>Players will also come across gambling sites offering a Bitcoin giveaway for Super Bowl betting. Sometimes, the giveaway might be offered in the form of altcoins, instead of Bitcoin. To take part in the giveaway, players might have to buy entry tickets or fulfill other requirements.Â </p>
<p>Lucky Block has just completed a giveaway of $10k worth of LBLOCK tokens. All players who placed a wager on Lucky Block were eligible for the giveaway.Â </p>
<p>Below, we have included the bonuses offered by the leading platforms.Â </p>

<p>Unlike other Bitcoin NFL betting sites, Winz.io bonuses do not come with any wagering requirements. This is also the case with the slots welcome package &#8211; which offers 300 free spins. To claim this bonus, a minimum deposit of $100 is needed alongside the promo code &#8216;SLOTS&#8217;. For the aforementioned sports betting bonus, enter the promo code &#8216;SPORTS&#8217;.Â </p>

<h3>6. Thunderpick &#8211; 5% Welcome Bonus With 2x WageringsÂ </h3>
<p>Thunderpick offers Bitcoin NFL betting markets across all games, both in-play and pre-match. The sportsbook dashboard is user-friendly and can be accessed via desktop and mobile web browsers. Thunderpick accounts are easy and fast to open and the platform accepts payment in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, Ethereum, Tether, and Litecoin.Â </p>
<p>Thunderpick offers new players a matched deposit bonus on the first payment and the percentage will depend on the selected wagering requirements. For example, players can opt for a 100% matched deposit with wagering of 30x, or 5% at 2x. Both bonuses are capped at â¬500.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244639/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-13-04-15.jpg" alt="Thunderpick Signup Page" /></figure>
<p>The claim the bonus, a minimum deposit of â¬1 and â¬20 is required, depending on whether the 2x or 30x wagering requirements are chosen. Although all NFL games are supported at Thunderpick, there are typically just 50-55 betting markets to choose from.Â </p>
<p>This is a lot less than compared to the likes of Lucky Block and BC.Game. Moreover, odds at Thuderpick are rarely industry-leading. Other sports available to bet on here include soccer, basketball, snooker, table tennis, and cricket. Thunderpick also offers a casino suite with slots, live dealers, and table games. Â </p>

<h3>7. Rabona &#8211; Top Bitcoin NFL Betting Sportsbook for Beginners Â </h3>
<p>In a similar nature to Thunderpick, Rabona is one of the best Bitcoin NFL betting sites for beginners that require a user-friendly dashboard. Opening an account is a breeze here and the minimum deposit is just â¬20 &#8211; or the crypto equivalent. New players will be able to claim a 100% matched deposit bonus up to a maximum of â¬100.Â </p>
<p>This is much lower than what the likes of BC.Game (1 BTC) and Cloudbet (5 BTC) offer, but the wagering terms are favorable nonetheless. For instance, the bonus funds only need to be wagered one time before a withdrawal can be made. In addition to Bitcoin, Rabona also accepts payment in Ethereum, Dogecoin, Tether, USD Coin, XRP, and Bitcoin Cash.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90263/226276/screenshot-2022-10-10-at-11-44-20.jpg" alt="Register With Rabona Casino" /></figure>
<p>NFL betting markets can be found pre-match and while the game is still being played. When betting pre-match, players can expect between 350-450 markets on each game. This includes a huge number of handicap and totals markets. Although Rabona is favored for its sports betting facility, it also offers casino games and slots.Â </p>

<h3>8. 1xBit &#8211; Access Thousands of NFL Betting Markets Each Week Â  Â </h3>
<p>Each and every week, 1xBit offers access to thousands of Bitcoin NFL betting markets. As of writing, for example, most upcoming games have at least 800 markets to choose from. This includes a long list of markets on the total points, handicaps, individual player stats, and much more.Â </p>
<p>Although 1xBit offers a huge range of NFL betting markets and oftentimes competitive odds, the platform is known for capping larger wagers. As such, 1xBit is best suited for players that intend to place smaller bet sizes.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98540/244873/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-08-49-01.jpg" alt="NFL Games On 1XBit Casino" /></figure>
<p>Nonetheless, we also like 1xBit for its fast payouts and hugely generous welcome package. The latter offers four matched deposit bonuses totaling 7 BTC. Wagering requirements amount to 40x, which is the industry standard. Â </p>

<h3>9. Stake &#8211; Weekly Promotions on NFL Betting and Other Sports Â  Â  Â </h3>
<p>Stake is home to thousands of casino games and sports betting markets. As many Stake customers are from the US (albeit using a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-use-stake-casino-vpn-to-play-in-us.htm">Stake VPN</a>), NFL is often at the forefront of the bonuses and promotions advertised by this sportsbook. For example, the NFL Primetime Double Winnings promotion &#8211; which runs until February 2023, offers twice the winnings when on selected games.Â </p>
<p>This is capped at $100 and for the bonus to be paid, the selected player must hit the specified target. For example, Baker Mayfield making 230+ passing yards, and the Rams winning the game. In another promotion, Stake pays out losing NFL bets if the team was winning by more than seven points in the third quarter, but ends up losing the game. This is also up to a maximum of $100.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90263/226283/screenshot-2022-10-10-at-12-52-15.jpg" alt="Stake Casino Live Events" /></figure>
<p>With that said, Stake does not offer a welcome package and this is the case across both its casino and sportsbook. Another drawback with Stake is that it offers a small number of Bitcoin NFL betting markets. For example, most NFL games this week come with just 46 betting options.Â </p>

<h3>10. BetOnline &#8211; Leading Bitcoin Sportsbook for US Sports &#8211; Including NFLÂ </h3>
<p><a href="https://record.commissionkings.ag/_Y2LNxjhQXIkNTExyHzZxqWNd7ZgqdRLk/919/">BetOnline</a> specializes in US sports betting, which includes the NFL in addition to the MLB and NBA. Non-US sports are offered too, such as soccer, tennis, and cricket. On the one hand, we found that BetOnline is one of the best crypto NFL betting sites for odds. However, on the flip side, it generally only offers three betting markets on each NFL game.Â </p>
<p>This includes the spread, money line, and the total number of points (over/under). As such, this will likely be a major drawback for those that like to place specialist bets. To make up for this shortfall, BetOnline offers a wide range of bonuses and promotions. New players can claim a 50% matched deposit bonus of up to $1,000.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90263/226265/screenshot-2022-10-10-at-10-59-34.jpg" alt="BetOnline Signup Page" /></figure>
<p>Wagering requirements are 10x and the promo code &#8216;BOL1000&#8217; needs to be entered. Players from Canada and the US can also claim a first-time 100% crypto deposit bonus of up to $1,000 with the promo code (CRYPTO100). Wagering requirements amount to 14x. BetOnline also offers horse racing markets, casino games, slots, and one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-poker-sites.htm">best Bitcoin poker sites</a>.Â </p>

<h3>11. FortuneJack &#8211; New Players Get up to 6 BTC in Bonus Funds Â </h3>
<p>FortuneJack will likely appeal to players in the market for a Bitcoin NFL betting site that offers lucrative deposit bonuses. In total, FortuneJack offers four deposit bonuses that total 6 BTC, with wagering requirements of 30x. This is much lower than the 40x required at 1xBit and as such, is potentially easier to cash out.Â </p>
<p>The other option available to new players is a 20% cashback promotion on the first four deposits. After each deposit is made, 20% cashback will be offered on net losses encountered after 24 hours of betting. Either way, FortuneJack offers a sizable number of NFL betting markets. For each NFL game in the coming week, for example, there are 293 betting options to choose from.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244645/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-13-34-16.jpg" alt="FortuneJack Signup Page" /></figure>
<p>This includes multiple spreads, the money line, total points, total home/away points, half-time and quarter betting, and more. FortuneJack also covers dozens of other sports, with popular leagues including the Premier League, NBA, and NHL. FortuneJack also offers provably fair titles, table games, live dealers, and slots.

<h2>How we Picked the Best Crypto NFL Betting Sites</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Comparing and ranking the best crypto NFL betting sites is no easy feat considering how many providers are active in this market.Â </p>
<p>Not only did we explore NFL bonuses, promotions, and betting limits, but accepted coins, minimum deposits, payout speeds, and more. Â </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some additional information on how we ranked the 10+ best crypto NFL betting site providers for 2023.Â </p>
<h3>Bitcoin NFL Betting Bonuses</h3>
<p>Players can claim a wide range of crypto betting bonuses when selecting an NFL sportsbook. Â Â </p>
<p>Examples of the best NFL bonuses currently on offer are highlighted below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lucky Block</strong>: 15% cashback on net losses after seven days of betting</li>
<li><strong>BC.Game</strong>: Four deposit bonuses of between 270% and 360% &#8211; up to 1 BTC</li>
<li><strong>Cloudbet</strong>: 100% matched deposit bonus of up to 5 BTC</li>
<li><strong>Winz.io</strong>: Â $20 Risk-Free Bet and 100% Matched Deposit Bonus &#8211; up to $500</li>
</ul>
<p>As per the above, there are many different types of Bitcoin NFL betting bonuses that can be claimed by new players.Â </p>
<p>With that said, we also like sportsbooks that offer regular bonuses to players that already have an account.Â </p>
<h3>Range of NFL Betting Markets</h3>
<p>We also spent countless hours researching which markets each crypto sportsbook offers on upcoming NFL games.Â </p>
<p>At one end of the spectrum, platforms like Lucky Block and FortuneJack offer hundreds of betting options on each NFL game. This includes a long list of bespoke handicaps and totals.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98540/244874/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-09-21-39.jpg" alt="NFL Odds On Lucky Block" /></figure>
<p>Platforms like BetOnline, however, offer just three betting markets on each NFL game &#8211; the money line, spread, and totals (over/under).Â </p>
<p>This is a super-limited number of markets to have access to, meaning that players are often forced to miss out on a more personalized bet.Â </p>
<h3>Live NFL Betting</h3>
<p>There is nothing more frustrating than missing the start of an NFL game and thus &#8211; being unable to place a bet on the respective match.Â </p>
<p>Fortunately, the best crypto NFL betting sites offer in-play betting. In other words, even though the game has already started, players can still place bets.Â </p>
<p>There are usually fewer live betting markets available when compared to pre-match odds. But, nonetheless, bets will be available until the very end of the game. Â </p>
<p>As such, if the initial bet loses, players can still enter wagers to enjoy the remainder of the match. Â </p>
<h3>Competitive NFL Betting Odds</h3>
<p>The best crypto NFL betting odds that we reviewed on this page &#8211; include the likes of Lucky Block, BC.Game, and Cloudbet &#8211; will often offer industry-leading odds.Â </p>
<p>This simply means that the respective platform is offering the best odds possible that cannot be rivaled by another sportsbook.Â </p>
<p>Choosing NFL betting sites that offer competitive odds will benefit the player in the long run. This is because the sportsbook will have a lesser advantage over the player.Â </p>
<h3>Secure Crypto Payments</h3>
<p>All of the NFL sportsbooks discussed on this page accept payments in Bitcoin and a range of other digital currencies.Â </p>
<p>Players will first need to copy the wallet address given by the chosen NFL sportsbook, for the respective cryptocurrency. Then, paste the address into a private wallet and transfer the cryptocurrency tokens.Â </p>
<p>This provides a secure framework for making payments, as no financial data is entered into the sportsbook website.Â </p>
<h3>Low Minimums &amp; Fast Payouts</h3>
<p>Lucky Block is a prime example of a top-rated Bitcoin NFL betting site that caters to both casual players and high rollers.Â </p>
<p>For example, players can open an account and deposit from just $1 to get started. On the other hand, Lucky Block does not have any withdrawal limits in place.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98540/244875/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-09-55-24.jpg" alt="Lucky Block NFL Games" /></figure>
<p>We did, however, also come across NFL sportsbooks that impose low betting limits. This means that the sportsbook will determine the maximum bet size that the player can make.Â </p>
<h2>How Does Bitcoin NFL Betting Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Players that have traditionally used fiat-based NFL betting sites will find that crypto platforms are similar in many ways.Â </p>
<p>That is to say, players will need to open an account, make a deposit, and choose an NFL betting market. And as such, the overarching objective is to place bets and hopefully make some money.Â </p>
<ul>
<li>However, there are also many metrics that differentiate Bitcoin NFL betting sites from their fiat counterparts.</li>
<li>Â At the forefront of this is the KYC process.Â </li>
<li>While fiat sportsbooks ask for personal information, contact details, and documentation before a withdrawal can be made, this is rarely the case when using one of the best Bitcoin NFL betting sites discussed today.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Lucky Block only requires an email address and username to get started. Another benefit of using a crypto-centric NFL sportsbook is that withdrawals are usually processed in minutes, rather than several days.Â </p>
<p>Furthermore, the best crypto NFL betting sites offer generous promotions and welcome packages for both existing and new players.Â </p>
<h2>Crypto NFL Betting Bonuses</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>This beginner&#8217;s guide on Bitcoin NFL betting has talked extensively about the many bonuses available when signing up with a new sportsbook.Â </p>
<p>In this section, we explain how each NFL betting bonus type works in a little more detail. Â </p>
<h3>Cashback Bonuses</h3>
<p>Lucky Block has opted for a cashback promotion that is automatically awarded to new players that join the sportsbook for the first time.Â </p>
<p>After seven days of betting on the NFL (or any other sport/casino game), net losses will be refunded by 15%.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244647/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-14-31-13.jpg" alt="Lucky Block 15% Cashback" /></figure>
<p>While it is hoped that the player will not encounter any losses, this is a nice safeguard to have nonetheless. Â </p>
<p>The main reason that we prefer this bonus over a matched deposit is that there are no wagering requirements.Â </p>
<h3>Free Bets</h3>
<p>Free NFL bets come in a wide range of shapes and sizes.Â </p>
<p>For example, Stake offers a promotion that refunds a losing bet if the respective NFL team was winning in the third quarter by seven points or more. The refund is paid as a free bet, which needs to be wagered.Â </p>
<p>Winz.io offers a different free bet promotion that is paid to the player after making an initial deposit of $100 and entering the bonus code &#8216;SPORTS&#8217;. This consists of a $20 risk-free bet that comes without wagering requirements.Â </p>
<h3>Matched Deposit</h3>
<p>Some of the Bitcoin NFL betting sites discussed today offer a conventional matched deposit bonus. For example, BetOnline offers a 50% sportsbook bonus of up to $1,000.Â </p>
<p>Cloudbet is a lot more generous in this regard, with the platform offering a 100% matched deposit of up to 5 BTC. This values the bonus at approximately $80,000 based on current prices.Â </p>
<p>BC.Game offers a maximum bonus of 1 BTC but this is split across the first four deposits. As such, this gives returning players a second, third, and fourth chance to turn bonus funds into withdrawable cash.Â </p>
<h3>No Deposit Bonus</h3>
<p>FortuneJack offers a no deposit bonus in the form of 100 free slot machine spins.Â </p>
<p>The only way to get this bonus is to go through a KYC procedure, which requires the player to provide personal information and upload some ID.Â </p>
<p>In turn, the player will no longer be able to bet on the NFL anonymously.Â </p>
<h3>Prize DrawsÂ </h3>
<p>Some NFL crypto betting sites offer prize draws and giveaways.</p>
<p>All players at Lucky Block that has placed at least one wager will be eligible for its $10,000 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-airdrops.htm">crypto airdrop</a>.Â </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/98393/244648/screenshot-2022-12-19-at-14-30-58.jpg" alt="Lucky Block $10K Airdrop Giveaway" /></figure>
<p>One player will win $10,000 worth of LBLOCK tokens and the draw takes place at the end of December 2022. Â Â </p>
