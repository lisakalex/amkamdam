Binance had to suspend the deposits on Friday &ldquo;due to technical difficulties.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please note that you may not be able to view your deposits of FLOKI or PEPE during this period &#8211; we&#8217;re currently working on resolving the issue,&rdquo; the exchange said via Twitter.</p><h2>Pepe Coin Price Soars 55% To $0.000003</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Pepe Coin has recently emerged as a trending topic in the digital currency and meme coin space.</p><p>Originating from the well-known internet meme &#8220;Pepe the Frog,&#8221; created by artist Matt Furie, this green anthropomorphic frog has now become the face of an Ethereum-based meme coin called PEPE, launched in mid-April 2023.</p><p>Notably, PEPE has outperformed some of its meme coin counterparts, such as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and FLOKI, to achieve a record-breaking all-time high.</p><p>Consequently, the meme coin rankings have shifted with Shiba Inu now in the second position and PEPE securing the third spot. PEPE&#8217;s market capitalization experienced tremendous growth to $1.2 billion, achieving a record-high price of $0.000004354.</p><p>PEPE now trades on several exchanges including the decentralized Uniswap v2 and v3, KuCoin, OKX, Gate.io, Bybit, MEXC, LBank, and Bybit among others.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pepe Coin is trading at $0.0000031 on Saturday following the Binance listing announcement. Based on the two-hour chart, PEPE has established short-term support at $0.0000025 but faces resistance at its daily open around $0.000003785.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/113163/273927/pepeusdt-2023-05-06-14-29-57.jpg" alt="Pepe Coin Price Prediction" width="1145" class="content-img"><figcaption>PEPE/USD two-hour chart</figcaption></figure><p>If that seller congestion is not weakened during the upcoming sessions, investors may face a pullback triggered by a sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) resistance.</p><p>However, with PEPE holding above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.0000008264, the 100-day EMA at $0.000001539, and the 50-day EMA at $0.0000020912, it is probable the rally would carry on to 0.000005 before the new week.</p><h2>As Pepe Coin Uptrend Slows AiDoge and SPONGE&rsquo;s Rally Thaws</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As PEPE shatters records with each passing moment, another zero-value token is garnering attention in the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>Originating from the well-known children&#8217;s TV show, SpongeBob Square Pants, the $SPONGE token is set to potentially reward investors with returns exceeding 100 times their initial stake.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/spongeoneth/status/1654403948474777600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1654403948474777600%7Ctwgr%5E3a596fbbb8a22efb612dcc27a1815fd7a3eea410%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptonews.com%2Fnews%2Fbiggest-crypto-gainers-today-5-may-flow-internet-computer-casper-network.htm[/embed]<p>At the time of writing, $SPONGE has soared over 45% within the past day, reaching a staggering price of $0.0005108. Investors are attracted to its relatively lower market capitalization.</p><p>Differing from $PEPE, this new ERC-20 meme coin has a market cap of slightly below $18 million, with a fully diluted valuation exceeding $20 million.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/113163/273926/sponge-7d-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Pepe Coin Price Prediction" width="892" class="content-img"><figcaption>SPONGE price chart</figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, its 24-hour trading volume is ablaze, recording over $21 million in trades, which represents a 48% uptick.</p><p>SPONGE is still in its early stages, with the opportunity for 100x returns or more if the robust purchasing momentum persists.</p><p>Should its market cap achieve $1 billion, $SPONGE could generate a fresh group of cryptocurrency millionaires overnight.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/spongebob/en"><strong>Buy SPONGE Now</strong></a></p><h2>AiDoge Presale Hits $2 Million as FOMO Spreads</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>AiDoge is a revolutionary meme coin combining meme coin hype and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>With $2 million raised in the presale in just a few weeks, the fear of missing out (FOMO) has taken over investors who would like to get a piece of the token to outperform Pepe Coin, SPONGE, SHIB, and DOGE combined.</p><p>Potential investors can buy AI tokens at $0.0000272 before the increases to $0.0000276 using ETH, USDT, BNB, USDT, and all major cards.</p><p>AiDoge is a decentralized meme initiative utilizing state-of-the-art generative technology to enable users to craft high-quality memes.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/aidogecrypto/status/1654757982431789059[/embed]<p>This innovative platform stands out from other AI-based cryptocurrencies by offering an automatic meme coin generator, allowing early investors an edge in the quickly expanding crypto space.</p><p>The AiDoge meme is powered by the same AI system employed by ChatGPT and DALL-e, establishing it as a potent instrument for ingenious creativity.</p><p>To generate memes, users input a text prompt describing the intended meme. In addition, creators of the most popular memes are awarded $AI tokens at the end of every month.</p><p>As the platform continues to expand, these creators will have ample opportunities for rewards and a stable income source.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/aidoge/en"><strong>Buy AiDoge Now</strong></a></p><p><strong>Related Articles:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-bounces-from-local-bottom-targets-30000-level-what-happens-next.htm">Bitcoin Price Prediction as BTC Bounces from Local Bottom and Targets $30,000 Level &ndash;&nbsp;What Happens Next?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-faces-doj-probe-over-possible-breach-of-us-sanctions-russia.htm">Binance Faces DOJ Probe Over Possible Breach of US Sanctions on Russia</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/biggest-crypto-gainers-today-5-may-flow-internet-computer-casper-network.htm">Biggest Crypto Gainers Today 5 May &ndash; Flow, Internet Computer, Casper Network</a></li></ul><iframe title="PEPE COIN PRICE EXPLOSION - Will PEPE Reach New ATH?

The largest meme coin, boasting nearly $ 11 billion in market capitalization is trading at $0.0786, down 3% on Monday.</p><p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s most beloved cryptocurrency is up 18% this year alone, although it is worth mentioning that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-900-million-trading-volume-rushes-can-doge-hit-1-year.htm">DOGE </a>hit highs slightly above $0.1 early last month.</p><p>As the value of the meme continues to surge, investors are becoming more interested in whether it will ever reach the $1 milestone. Nevertheless, industry experts advise caution, as it may take some time to achieve this goal.</p><h2>Is Dogecoin Destined to Hit $1 and When?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Although Dogecoin has generated a considerable amount of buzz, the chances of it reaching $1 anytime soon are uncertain, with experts offering divergent opinions on the matter.</p><p>While some analysts anticipate that social media hype and the connection to Elon Musk could push the currency&#8217;s price to $1 in the future, others are more skeptical.</p><p>That said, Despite the recent excitement surrounding Dogecoin, it faces an uphill task to hit the $1 benchmark.</p><p>Its lack of real-world applications and utility, combined with an inflationary supply and inability to generate its own price appreciation, make it improbable for the currency to achieve the approximately 1,100% increase required to reach $1.</p><p>One of the reasons why many analysts hesitate to predict significant future gains for Dogecoin is its lack of utility and purpose outside of being a means of exchange or a store of value.</p><p>The cryptocurrency was created as a joke and, despite its enthusiastic following, it is not widely used as a payment method. Also, its high volatility and lack of regulatory oversight in the larger cryptocurrency market make it a risky investment for many people.</p><p>Despite the obvious lack of utility, Dogecoin commands a massive following on different social media platforms, with Twitter leading with 3.7 million. According to a recent tweet by the project, Dogecoin is still decentralized, open source, and is not controlled by a single entity.</p><p>Unlike projects like XRP which are struggling to prove they are not securities, DOGE like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-forecast-btc-drops-25-whats-next-move-for-bitcoin.htm">Bitcoin</a> is undisputedly a cryptocurrency. Dogecoin attracts investors for being affordable compared to BTC which is trading at $28,500 and Ethereum at $1,845.</p><h2>Dogecoin Bulls Search for Support &ndash; Time to Buy?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Dogecoin price is trading at $0.07856 as bulls rush to defend support at $0.075. The meme token is holding below all the major moving averages, including the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/112634/272268/dogeusd-2023-05-01-17-37-27.jpg" alt="Dogecoin price prediction" width="1141" class="content-img"><figcaption>DOGE/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;If Dogecoin price rebounds from support at $0.075 bulls will have another chance to push for gains above $0.1. Investors waiting for an opportunity for new buy entries should consider closely monitoring the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), as it may send a buy signal in the coming sessions.</p><p>The call to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-dogecoin-doge.htm">buy DOGE</a> would manifest with the MACD line in blue flipping above the signal line in red. Also, the MACD will change direction above the mean line at 0.00 suggesting that buyers have the upper hand.</p><p>If support at $ 0.075 fails to hold, Dogecoin would be in grave danger of dropping to test the demand area as highlighted by the gray band on the chart around $0.065.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy Dogecoin Now.</strong></a></p><h2>AiDoge &ndash; A Dogecoin Alternative Advancing AI in Meme Generation</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Gone are the days when meme coins were only about the hype, pump, and dumps. Creators of up-and-coming ecosystems like AiDoge are going the extra mile to launch meme coins that have utility and even help solve real-world problems.</p><p>This new meme coin, powered by AI, has successfully amassed $670,000 in its first stage presale. Currently, in the middle of its second presale stage, the price of AI tokens has climbed from $0.00002600 to $0.00002640.</p><p>The project plans to carry out 20 presale stages, and as the trend for AI meme coins continues to surge in popularity, the tokens are expected to sell out within a matter of weeks.</p><p>Potential investors are encouraged to take advantage of early bird pricing before the coin becomes unattainable.</p><p>While there are many AI cryptos in circulation, AiDoge is the first to introduce an automated meme coin generator.</p><p>This unique feature provides early investors with a strategic advantage, and the potential to become one of the biggest names in the crypto industry.</p><p>The past success of meme and AI coins, such as Conflux and Pepe Coin, further confirms the potential of AiDoge within the space.</p><p>As with OpenAI and its ChatGPT, the key to success within new technology is in adopting a valuable application and launching it promptly, which is exactly what AiDoge aims to achieve.</p><p>AiDoge offers a range of compelling benefits to users who stake AI tokens, including staking incentives and daily rewards.</p><p>Additionally, top-performing meme creators on the platform are granted exclusive access to premium features and voting rights, which allow them to participate in the governance of AiDoge.</p><p>With AiDoge&#8217;s user-friendly voting mechanism, every user can select the superior meme. The most popular meme, as determined by the platform&#8217;s voting system, will receive token rewards.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/aidoge/"><strong>Buy AiDoge Tokens Now.</strong></a></p><p><strong>Similar Articles:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pepe-coin-price-prediction-as-pepe-pumps-higher-even-with-bitcoin-price-down.htm">Pepe Coin Price Prediction as PEPE Pumps Higher Even With Bitcoin Price Down</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/why-is-crypto-crashing-fomc-meeting-this-week-best-coins-to-buy-the-dip.htm">Why is Crypto Crashing &#8211; FOMC Meeting This Week, Best Coins to Buy the Dip</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-forecast-btc-drops-25-whats-next-move-for-bitcoin.htm">Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Drops 2.5% &ndash; What&#8217;s the Next Move for Bitcoin?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/aidoge-presale-nears-4-million-milestone-1m-raised-today.htm">AiDoge Presale Nears $4 Million Milestone, $1M Raised Today</a></li></ul><iframe title="AIDOGE New AI MEMECOIN Crypto ICO (100x potential?!)

Despite its 24-hour trading volume surpassing $800 million, XRP is down 2.1% and trading at $0.4654 on Sunday.</p><p>Support at $0.46 remains imperative to the resumption of the uptrend, otherwise, if lost investors may want to start acclimatizing extended losses testing $0.42 and $0.35, respectively.</p><h2>Ripple Unlocks 1 billion XRP Tokens from Escrow</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The San Francisco-based blockchain startup Ripple Labs released 1 billion XRP tokens worth around $470 million from its escrow account on May 12. Ripple has since 2017 been systematically distributing XRP from escrow to guarantee a stable supply and maintain the stability of the XRP token.</p><p>This latest release is part of an ongoing series of monthly allocations aimed at bolstering the expanding ecosystem and satisfying the growing appetite for digital currency. Typically, any remaining XRP is sent back to escrow, thus prolonging the distribution timeline.</p><p>However, critics assert that Ripple&#8217;s dominance over the bulk of XRP tokens stored in escrow may result in centralization.</p><p>Some market watchers have voiced concerns that Ripple&#8217;s potential to unlock sizable quantities of XRP monthly might have an impact on the token&#8217;s pricing.</p><p>This apprehension follows Ripple&#8217;s impressive Q1 2023 performance, with the company witnessing a notable upswing in XRP sales.

After the regulator sued the blockchain company in December 2020, XRP price plunged massively with many exchanges like Coinbase delisting it.</p><p>Having said that, it would be prudent to diversify portfolios with carefully selected crypto presales offering a better risk-reward ratio.

However, there is a higher probability of the outcome flipping bullish bolstered by the soon-to-launch metaverse.</p><p>Shiba Inu is exchanging hands at $0.00001030 on Saturday, after staying relatively unchanged in the last 24 hours. The majority of digital assets are showing vivid bullish signs but with volatility lacking, price movement could remain suppressed throughout the weekend.</p><p>Meanwhile, for Shiba Inu, support at $0.00001 must hold in place to avert the possibility of declines gaining traction to test December lows of $0.0000078.</p><p>On the other side of the fence, if SHIB rebounds from the same support at $0.00001, that situation could change drastically in favor of a breakout to $0.00001574 &ndash; highs achieved in February.</p><h2>Shiba Inu Reveals New Metaverse &ndash; The Rocket Pond</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Shiba Inu developers have announced the launch of a new metaverse world called the Rocket Pond. Although details of the new metaverse remain hidden, the team is conducting a giveaway to usher in the new era. Participants would be looking at winning land titles in the metaverse.</p><p>Investors currently buying land in Shib &ndash; The Metaverse part with $0.2 ETH or roughly $380, the giveaway includes 10 land titles and requires only a like and a retweet to enter.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1651744671595630592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1651744671595630592%7Ctwgr%5E14c903d6cdad2e3cb636ee4ad7a1a8298372bdfa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailycoin.com%2Fshiba-inu-teases-rocket-pond-as-free-land-giveaway-nears-close%2F[/embed]<p>Users can stay tuned to Shib &ndash; The Metaverse and shib.io to uncover the secrets of the Rocket Pond, the new flyover.</p><p>The SHIB Token&#8217;s official website has undergone a recent revamp and now features a 3D flyover. Presently, metaverse aficionados can explore the WAGMI Temple Flyover, which serves as the inaugural HUB in the SHIB: The Metaverse series.</p><p>In a recent blog update, the SHIB team revealed that Rocket Pond aims to showcase the journey of Shiba Inu through a visually appealing representation while capturing the essence of a secluded mountain getaway.</p><p>Moreover, its architectural inspiration is drawn from various well-known landmarks, such as Lake Tahoe and Cape Canaveral, blending them seamlessly into its design.</p><p>&ldquo;Rocket Pond brings the feel of a hidden resort inside of mountains, The YMCA or KOA camping vibe with the wilderness around you mixed with modern luxuries/touristy elements. Crystal clear waters with wildlife mixed with resort buildings that lead up to the mountains,&rdquo; the team said in the blog post.</p><h2>Shiba Inu Price Wobbles but Recovery Awaits</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>SHIB bulls have been holding onto support at $0.00001 since the price corrected from $0.00001574 around the second week of March. Attempts to break acute resistance at $0.000012 have been frequent but again, none were successful.</p><p>Having said that, bulls have very few options but to weaken the seller congestion zone and pave the way for a substantial rebound, first to $0.00001574 and later to close the gap to the all-time high of $0.00008616.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/112538/271976/shibusd-2023-04-29-13-31-34.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu Price prediction" width="1145" class="content-img"><figcaption>SHIB/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>The launch of the Rocket Pond has the potential to make SHIB more attractive to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/altcoins/">buyers</a> in the market, especially those that might be feeling already sidelined by larger assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>Whales are accumulating massive amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB), with the 19th biggest <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x73af3bcf944a6559933396c1577b257e2054d935#tokentxns">Ethereum whale</a> acquiring a staggering 76,316,827,917 SHIB tokens. Furthermore, the same whale has secured an additional 69 billion of the Japanese guard dog-themed digital currency.</p><p>Regarded as a positive indication, this whale activity suggests a growing concentration of large holder positions, hinting at strengthened market confidence.</p><p>According to the Stochastic Shiba Inu is at the start of a trend reversal with a break above the descending trendline on the daily chart likely to trigger a major upswing in the coming days.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/">Buy Shiba Inu Now.</a></p><h2>AiDoge &ndash; Merging AI and Memes to Power Innovation</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As Shiba Inu price wobbles ahead of the expected launch of the new metaverse, Rocket Pond, investors may find AiDoge intriguing. Dubbed the greatest meme generation platform, AiDoge presents a never seen user experience with the ability to adapt to the ever-changing crypto space.</p><p>AiDoge utilizes sophisticated AI techniques to generate pertinent memes derived from textual cues supplied by users. Notable features encompass an AI-driven meme creator, text-centered prompts, and AI tokens used to buy credits.</p><p>AiDoge&#8217;s creation tool employs state-of-the-art AI algorithms to produce contextually appropriate memes by drawing on vast meme databases and the latest cryptocurrency news. This guarantees top-notch, current memes.</p><p>AiDoge is conducting a presale to raise funds to build the meme ecosystem powered by both AI and blockchain technology.

Often this fear of missing out (FOMO) helps to build momentum during up-trending markets.</p><h2>Can Ethereum Reach $5,000 in 2023</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Ethereum price is suitably positioned to rally following its remarkable performance since the beginning of the year. This week&rsquo;s spike above $2,000 confirmed the initial stages of a bull market.</p><p>Its older sibling, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-and-ethereum-prediction-btc-and-eth-soar-over-10-is-there-a-limit-to-their-ascent.htm">Bitcoin blasted above $30,000</a> changing the technical outlook for a potential rally to $38,000 in the coming few weeks. In addition to the momentum surrounding the Shapella upgrade, Ethereum price tends to follow in Bitcoin&rsquo;s footsteps.</p><p>A massive rally in Ethereum price to $5,000 will only happen if many boxes are checked in the market in the coming months. For instance, Ether must hold the new support at $2,000 at all costs.</p><p>However, this cannot be guaranteed even with a successful Shapella upgrade, which allowed investors who staked ETH to withdraw their tokens and the rewards earned, for the first time since the network transitioned to become a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol.</p><p>Whales must keep their bags intact if not keep demand for Ethereum rising. Another huge factor to consider is the regulatory landscape in the industry.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/bradmillscan/status/1646686643569426432[/embed]<p>Europe is moving a step closer to having a clear regulatory framework with a vote on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) expected later this month.</p><p>However, the situation in the US is still murky with no hope for a resolution in the near term. The SEC vs Ripple lawsuit summary judgment in May might provide some clarity, but maybe not.</p><p>All the same, the US approach to digital assets in 2023 could shape the market for a bull run or extend the crypto winter.</p><p>That said, Ethereum price continues to exhibit strength in the bullish camp and the move above $2,000 could mark the start of a sustainable climb to $5,000.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy Ethereum Now</strong></a></p><h2>Love Hate Inu Presale Hype Explodes, Eyes $10 Million</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The cryptocurrency market is watching the birth of a new ecosystem with the potential to rival both Dogecoin (DOGE) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-elon-musk-plans-add-crypto-trading-twitter-will-shib-included.htm">Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB).</p><p>For the first time in the crypto industry, community members will be rewarded for their opinions on the world&rsquo;s hottest topics.</p><p>Users will be allowed to create polls on different topics, be it politics, entertainment, or social issues.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/LoveHateInu/status/1646959004919185411[/embed]<p>Love Hate Inu&rsquo;s voting system is secure, decentralized, and cannot be manipulated thanks to a rule that requires those who wish to take part in the polls to stake LHINU tokens for a minimum of 30 days.</p><p>The more you stake and the longer your staking period, the more voting power you accumulate.</p><p>The team is keen to ensure the future of the project is not undermined by a few people in bad faith.

Support at $0.5 has been pivotal this week, as XRP tested $0.484 at some point before reclaiming its current position.</p><h2>XRP Topples Cardano, Becomes the 6th Largest Coin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>XRP&rsquo;s market cap is up by 0.58% in 24 hours to $26 billion, surpassing Cardano&rsquo;s $13.5 billion. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-forecast-as-ada-overtakes-dogecoin-market-capitalization-are-whales-buying.htm">ADA is performing relatively well on Saturday</a>, up 2% to exchange hands at $0.38.</p><p>Meanwhile, XRP has attracted over $700 million in trading volume in the same 24-hour period, however, its price remains relatively unchanged at $0.51.</p><p>Most experts believe XRP is balancing at the edge of a tall cliff; where two scenarios are likely to play out. On the bright side, XRP may resume the uptrend, bolstered by possible bullish momentum ahead of the final ruling on the case with the SEC on or before May 6.</p><p>On the other hand, if support at $0.50 fails to hold and XRP price slides below $0.48, investors may start acclimatizing to a possible trend reversal. This means short positions could quickly turn profitable with targets at $0.45, $0.4, and $0.4, respectively.</p><p>On the other side of the fence, declines could liquidate most long positions taken in anticipation of Ripple winning the case.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109873/266331/xrpusd-2023-04-08-17-19-26.jpg" alt="XRP price prediction" width="1140" class="content-img"><figcaption>XRP/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>The path with the least resistance is to the downside based on the position of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The sell signal, as observed on the chart above, manifested as the MACD line in blue crossed below the signal line in red.</p><p>The sell signal would have a dire impact on XRP price if bulls let go of the support area between $0.48 and $0.50. However, if this support is upheld, the technical outlook for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp.htm">XRP</a> will keep improving toward $1.</p><p>According to the position of all the applied moving averages, the likelihood of XRP price recovering to $1 is greater.</p><p>In addition to a golden cross that came into play in late March, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (line in blue) is about to flip above the 200-day EMA (line in purple).</p><p>A golden cross pattern forms when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one. For example, when the 50-day EMA flips above the 200-day EMA. Traders consider the pattern bullish, which means chances of a pullback to $0.4 or $0.35, may reduce significantly.</p><h2>Can XRP Overtake Bitcoin in 2023?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The performance of XRP in 2023 will revolve around the Ripple vs SEC court case, whose summary judgment is expected on or before May 6. Investors are betting on Ripple winning the case as the biggest driver for XRP price in 2023.</p><p>However, as we draw closer to the ruling, new twists seem to be emerging. On April 7, attorney Bill Morgan took to Twitter to share that according to an admission made by the SEC&#8217;s expert, the fluctuations in XRP&#8217;s value since mid-2018 have been largely influenced by the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, accounting for up to 90% of the variations.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1644318616681353218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1644318616681353218%7Ctwgr%5E4c9cd147daa32b20fdbe5a396382f976c035c08a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinbold.com%2Fsudden-twist-in-ripple-v-sec-case-heres-what-happened%2F[/embed]<p>He put forth the idea that if the SEC&#8217;s expert assumption holds, it may suggest that Ripple is allowing the value of XRP to be affected by the price changes in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>Thus, the SEC aims to prove this claim by showing evidence that Ripple&#8217;s price announcements influence XRP&#8217;s value. Furthermore, the SEC could argue that the fact that Ripple holds substantial amounts of XRP makes the token centralized and subsequently a security.</p><p>Having said that, XRP has a significant distance to cover before it can pose a serious challenge to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-btc-remains-below-28250-amid-strong-us-nonfarm-payroll-report.htm">Bitcoin&#8217;s dominant position</a> in the market.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy XRP Now.</strong></a></p><p><strong>Related Articles:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-now-7-april-lunc-neo-aave.htm"><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Now 7 April &ndash; LUNC, NEO, AAVE</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-10-billion-trading-volume-floods-are-whales-buying.htm"><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction as $10 Billion Trading Volume Floods In &ndash; Are Whales Buying?</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-authorities-set-best-practices-for-crypto-client-vetting-banks.htm"><strong>Singapore Authorities to Set Best Practices for Crypto Client Vetting in Banks</strong></a></li></ul><iframe title="TOP 5 CRYPTOS TO BUY NOW?

For now, consolidation could take precedence, as observed with the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator, which currently indicates a negative volume flow of -28.73M.</p><p>Failure to break and hold above SOL&rsquo;s immediate resistance at the 50-day EMA and the confluence seller congestion at $21 may delay the breakout eyeing $24 in the short term.</p><p>Support would be expected to come in handy at $20 but if push comes to shove and overhead pressure overwhelms the bulls, Solana price may resolve to seek support at $16.00.</p><h2>Evaluating Solana Price Short-Term Profitability</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Traders considering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-solana.htm">increasing exposure to Solana</a> on Tuesday should take note of certain factors.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, SOL is currently trading above its weekly open at $20.54, with the previous day&#8217;s open at $20.02 serving as a strong support zone.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109474/265367/solusd-2023-04-04-14-04-57.jpg" alt="Solana Price Prediction" width="1215" class="content-img"><figcaption>SOL/USD four-hour chart</figcaption></figure><p>If liquidity from the $20 support level is robust enough to overcome resistance from the 50-day EMA, 100-day EMA, and 200-day EMA, Solana&#8217;s price could potentially challenge the monthly open at $21.21.</p><p>It&#8217;s important to note that a sustained drop below the previous day&#8217;s open at $20.02 might cause Solana&#8217;s price to retest the crucial support level at $16.</p><p>Nonetheless, investors should also be mindful of short-term support levels at $19 and $18.</p><p>For those looking to invest in SOL over a medium to long-term horizon, it is recommended to wait for the SuperTrend indicator (the thick line overlaying the chart) to flip below the price and change its color from red to green before initiating their positions.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong><u>Buy Solana Now</u></strong></a></p><h3><strong>Related Articles:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-now-3-april-snx-ada-stx.htm"><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Now 3 April &ndash; SNX, ADA, STX</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-price-prediction-as-1-billion-arb-proposal-goes-wrong-heres-where-arb-heading-now.htm"><strong>Arbitrum Price Prediction as $1 Billion ARB Proposal Goes Wrong &ndash; Here&#8217;s Where ARB is Heading Now</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-xrp-blasts-past-050-resistance-1-xrp-soon.htm"><strong>XRP Price Prediction as XRP Blasts Past $0.50 Resistance &ndash;&nbsp;$1 XRP Soon?</strong></a></li></ul><iframe title="BEST CRYPTO TO BUY NOW APRIL 2023 (CRAZY POTENTIAL) &#x1f525;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZO5_SGMn0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It grants the Arbitrum Foundation full discretion in allocating the nearly $1 billion sum, excluding ARB token holders from the decision-making process.&nbsp;</p><p>This centralization has raised concerns, as the special grants program would be subjected to a &#8220;full on-chain governance&#8221; procedure, enabling token holders to guide the ecosystem&#8217;s direction.</p><h2>Arbitrum&rsquo;s AIP-1 is a Ratification, The Foundation Clarifies</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The Arbitrum Foundation faced pressure to clarify decisions made concerning the proposal and other issues, which were undertaken without input from the community.</p><p>In explaining the ratification of AIP-1, the foundation assured members that prior to the decentralized autonomous organization assuming control, certain decisions and actions were essential for the ecosystem&#8217;s success.&nbsp;</p><p>They emphasized that all actions were executed in good faith, with the singular objective of ensuring Arbitrum&#8217;s success and competitive standing among its peers.</p><p>For instance, the Foundation explained its role in initiating and streamlining the decision-making process to circumvent critical operational questions such as, &#8220;who hosts the various governance forums where these discussions occur,&#8221; as well as broader questions like, &#8220;who kicks off governance.&#8221;</p><p>The Foundation acknowledged its lack of clear communication with the community, stating, &#8220;the proposal was intended to act as a ratification of the initial setup of both the Arbitrum DAO and the Foundation that has been created to serve the DAO.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the Foundation admitted it had not informed the community about key decisions made earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;The establishment of an initial distribution of tokens to the Foundation is a normal course of practice in setting up ecosystems like Arbitrum, and this was always the intent when AIP-1 was submitted for ratification concurrently with the announcement of the Arbitrum DAO,&rdquo; the Foundation explained.</p><p>While standing firm with the decisions made, the Arbitrum Foundation assured the community that ARB &ldquo;is unique in that it is the only one among its peers in which the DAO on-chain currently controls the vast majority of the community tokens.&rdquo;</p><p>Regarding the massive $1 billion grant in ARB tokens, which is set to occur off-chain, the Foundation argued that allocating &#8220;a significant token budget&#8221; is common practice and helps prevent &#8220;voter fatigue,&#8221; which many view as an effective approach for smaller grants.</p><p>The Foundation emphasized that the $1 billion special grants proposal is crucial for the Arbitrum ecosystem&#8217;s success.</p><h2>Arbitrum Price Still Overwhelmed &ndash; Where to Next?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-price-prediction-as-arb-listed-binance-coinbase-can-arb-reach-10.htm">Arbitrum&#8217;s</a> price is trading at $1.21 after bouncing off support at $1.1o.&nbsp;</p><p>The newly airdropped token was expected to stretch the leg to $1.4, where it would have activated a 25% double-bottom pattern breakout to $1.73, but it appears to have lost momentum.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109359/265181/arbusdt-2023-04-03-17-58-54.jpg" alt="Arbitrum price prediction" width="1197" class="content-img"></figure><p>For now, short-term support at $1.20 would matter most to the bulls and the bears alike. If this support is defended at all costs, Arbitrum price may gain momentum to $1.40 and $1.733 as buyers build confidence in its recovery.</p><p>However, a sustained break below the same support level would mean a spike in overhead pressure, with the possibility of ARB retesting the major $1.10 support area.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong><u>Buy Crypto Now</u></strong></a></p><h3><strong>Related Articles:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-companies-make-complaints-uk-government-amid-banking-woes-whats-going-on.htm">Crypto Companies Make Complaints to UK Government Amid Banking Woes &ndash; What&#8217;s Going On?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korea-stunned-by-crypto-motivated-murder-is-crypto-crime-on-the-rise.htm">South Korea Stunned by &lsquo;Crypto-motivated&rsquo; Murder &ndash; Is Crypto Crime on the Rise?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-xrp-blasts-past-050-resistance-1-xrp-soon.htm">XRP Price Prediction as XRP Blasts Past $0.50 Resistance &ndash;&nbsp;$1 XRP Soon?</a></li></ul><iframe title="3 New Crypto Presales that Could 10x Your Money in 2023!

This bullish outlook may be attributed to fresh interest among investors surrounding testnet &#8216;Puppynet&#8217; and the anticipated Shibarium launch.</p><p>Despite the intense selling pressure altcoins experienced in March, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-shib-jumps-8-from-recent-bottom-where-next-shib-target.htm">SHIB</a> held firmly to support at $0.00001&mdash;and now bulls are concentrating on the seller congestion at $0.000011, which must come out of the way to trigger more liquidity as the token recovers to $0.00001575, February&rsquo;s high.</p><h2>Testnet &#8216;Puppynet&#8217; Hits 1M Transactions as Shibarium Launch Approaches</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Puppynet, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shibarium-closer-than-ever-for-shiba-inu-shib-but-experts-want-people-divert-towards-renq-finance-renq-heres-why.htm">Shibarium&rsquo;s </a>testnet protocol is seeing increased activity as the Shiba Inu ecosystem gears up for the anticipated release of Shibarium, a layer-2 solutions provider.</p><p>According to blockchain explorer, over 1 million transactions have been processed with an average block time of 8.3 seconds. Testnet Puppynet was released on March 11 and processed more than 200,000 transactions in the week.</p><p>The majority of the transactions occurred in the previous week, with a total of over 114,000 transactions completed within 24 hours on dates, March 28 and 29.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109275/264966/screenshot-162.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu Price" width="1333" class="content-img"><figcaption>Puppynet &ndash; Blockchain Explorer</figcaption></figure><p>Investors are excited about the launch of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-rumors-emerge-that-shibarium-code-was-stolen-what-will-happen-shib.htm">Shibarium</a> and the success achieved by testnet Puppynet, which has been running for almost three weeks without any glitches.</p><p>The Shiba Inu development team has insisted in the past &ndash; they are not bound by timelines but by the need to ensure a quality product is released into the market.</p><p>Analysts believe that Puppynet&#8217;s activity could boost the value of the tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including SHIB and BONE as more features are added to the testnet.</p><p>Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, a decentralized derivatives trading exchange argues that contrary to what many believe &ldquo;the Shibarium upgrade&rsquo;s financial impact has been underwhelming,&rdquo; its testnet Puppynet is seeing tremendous activity.</p><p>However, the CEO reckoned that the network still has a long way to go and more work must be done. Unification, the company behind Shibarium, recently told users that more features are coming, including &ldquo;an all-in-one wallet solution that will enable native two-way asset transfers, staking/delegating, as well as a ShibaSwap integration module.&rdquo;</p><p>Although SHIB and BONE tokens may gain momentum amid the increasing network activity on testnet Puppynet, &ldquo;the current macroeconomic climate, any such movements will likely to be short-lived,&rdquo; Lin warned.</p><p>Testnet protocols like Shibarium&rsquo;s Puppynet refer to blockchain networks built for testing purposes. They help developers simulate activity on the mainnet so that any bugs and other issues that may arise are corrected before the final launch to a wider audience.</p><p>Shibarium is one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by the Shiba Inu ecosystem to improve the network&rsquo;s scalability by processing transactions off-chain before stacking them on the primary Ethereum blockchain.</p><h2>Can Shiba Inu Price Reach $1?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-shib-pumps-up-5-24-hours-can-shib-keep-rising.htm">Shiba Inu price</a> is trading at $0.00001085 while holding onto a confluence support formed by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (line in blue) at $0.00001072 and the dotted descending trendline.</p><p>On the upside, SHIB has tested resistance at $.00001095, a region strengthened by the upper falling trendline. This hurdle has kept bulls from attempting the next breakout above $0.000011, a seller congestion zone made relevant by the 200-day EMA (line in purple).</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109275/264964/shibusd-2023-04-01-14-24-40.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu Price" width="1218" class="content-img"></figure><p>If Shiba Inu price upholds the confluence support at $0.00001072, buyers could make good on a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.</p><p>A break above $0.000011 coupled with the expected boost from testnet Puppynet&rsquo;s increasing protocol activity may catalyze another significant trend reversal, as bulls look forward to $0.00001575.</p><p>Shiba Inu price may not reach $1 in 2023 but could &lsquo;eat&rsquo; two more zeros to trade at $0.001 by December bolstered by the launch of Shibarium and the token burn program.</p><p>One important feature of Shibarium is to support the token burn campaign to reduce SHIB&rsquo;s supply. As the supply thins, analysts expect Shiba Inu price to grow in value.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong><u>Buy Shiba Inu Now</u></strong></a></p><p><strong>Related Articles:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-will-btc-eth-break-free-from-weekend-blues.htm"><strong>Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: Will BTC and ETH Break Free from the Weekend Blues?</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-falls-below-1800-time-buy-dip.htm"><strong>Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Falls Below $1,800 &ndash; Time to Buy the Dip?</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-now-at-ico-before-exchange-listing-31-march.htm"><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Now at ICO Before Exchange Listing &ndash; 31 March</strong></a></li></ul><iframe title="Ecoterra Recycle2Earn NEW CRYPTO Presale Launch - NEXT 100X CRYPTO?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8oMChF1HTc?start=8&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p>

It is the second most important hard fork since the Merge in September, particularly among investors who locked ETH tokens in the Beacon Chain Smart Contract.</p><p>Recently baptized Shapella, the Shanghai upgrade will see Ethereum unlock its full potential as a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol, as validators will for the first time withdraw from the staking contracts.</p><p>&ldquo;There is much speculation about what the Shanghai hard fork will mean for the price action of ETH and related liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) such as Lido (LDO) and Rocket Pool (RPL). So far, we have seen large appreciations in the price for LSDs and related protocols,&rdquo; Bill Xing, head of financial products at Bybit said in an exclusive commentary to Cryptonews.</p><p>Like many experts in the market, expects the volatility being experienced to &ldquo;continue leading up to and around the time the Shanghai upgrade is enacted, similar to the situation that unfolded around the time of The Merge in September 2022,&rdquo; Xing added.</p><p>Ethereum has been one of the biggest bullish contenders in the last few weeks. Unlike other altcoins, ETH has rallied alongside Bitcoin, allowing investors to hedge against the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-suspends-automated-clearinghouse-deposits-withdrawals-due-silvergates-closure-what-does-mean-for-users.htm">banking crisis in the US</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;We expect it to continue to play an important role going forward, primarily if it can deliver what is promised on its roadmap,&rdquo; Xing said as he concluded his statement.</p><p>However, the biggest challenge the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> price faces at the moment is the risk associated with regulatory uncertainty in the US.

CoinMarketCap reveals an 84% increase in the 24-hour trading volume to $1.6 Billion.</p><p>Arbitrum price is trading at $1.33, growing by 10% in the same 24-hour period. ARB has also been one of the most volatile cryptos in the market following its launch on March 23 when it rallied almost reaching $10.00 before dumping to $1.1. If interest in ARB continues, we could see another spike to $10.00.</p><h2>What Is Arbitrum and Why Is It a Big Deal?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution designed for the Ethereum blockchain. It seeks to improve the scalability of the second-largest cryptocurrency network in the world subsequently reducing gas fees.</p><p>The scaling protocol utilizes an optimistic roll-up system to process transactions off-chain, which are later committed to the primary blockchain&mdash;Ethereum. This method avoids the congested Ethereum network, reducing the load to allow users to send transactions much faster and at lower fees.</p><h2>Smart Money Accumulating ARB</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The ARB airdrop, as expected culminated in a sell-the-news narrative, with token holders cashing out in large numbers. However, the token&rsquo;s fundamentals have not faltered amid an influx of funds from institutions and other large-volume buyers &ndash; smart money.</p><p>Following the announcement of the airdrop on March 16, tokens within the Arbitrum ecosystem exploded including Magic (MAGIC), GMX (GMX) Radiant Network (RDNT), and Gains Network (GNS).</p><p>Experts believe the pump experienced by these tokens was a result of a catalyst effect by the ARB airdrop.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109109/264517/arbitrum.jpg" alt="Arbitrum Price Prediction" width="688" class="content-img"><figcaption>Arbitrum Ecosystem Basket</figcaption></figure><p>An Ape&rsquo;s Prologue explained further that &ldquo;on the day the airdrop happened, which marked the launch of the $ARB token, the prices of ecosystem tokens began to decline,&rdquo; suggesting a classic &lsquo;sell-the-news&rsquo; event.</p><h2>Can Arbitrum Price Reach $10?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Arbitrum is emerging as a protocol to be reckoned with for its role as a layer-2 solutions provider for the Ethereum blockchain. Other tokens within the Arbitrum ecosystem like GMX and RDNT are &ldquo;two of the fastest-growing protocols in terms of fundamentals and price appreciation,&rdquo; Dustin Teander, an analyst at Messari said.</p><p>In other words,<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-price-prediction-as-arb-listed-binance-coinbase-can-arb-reach-10.htm"> ARB has launched into an ecosystem with strong fundamentals</a>, which are likely to cool off the token&rsquo;s downside in the coming weeks. Moreover, accumulation among investors, taking advantage of the dump after the airdrop could provide the necessary momentum for ARB to rally again.</p><p>The lack of enough price data makes it difficult to forecast ARB&rsquo;s outlook in the short term and long term. However, from the one-hour timeframe chart, we can see a strong bullish contender that has already bounced from the new primary support at $1.1 to trade at $1.33 on Thursday.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109109/264515/arbusdt-2023-03-30-19-53-28.jpg" alt="Arbitrum Price Prediction" width="1218" class="content-img"><figcaption>ARB/USD one-hour chart</figcaption></figure><p>There was an attempt to flip resistance at $1.40 earlier in the day but selling pressure overwhelmed the bulls. Now, relatively weak support has emerged at $1.30, strengthened by the descending upper trendline and highlighted by the upper yellow band.</p><p>If ARB overshoots this support, the 50-day EMA would come in handy, in addition to another substantial buyer congestion at $1.20. If push comes to shove ARB would retest the primary support at $1.1 before making an ultimate recovery attempt to $10.</p><h2>Arbitrum Alternatives to Buy Today</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Investors may want to explore some of the high-potential crypto presales in the market for 2023 as ARB tries to find support before another rally occurs.</p><p>In the list below, we&#8217;ve reviewed the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the Cryptonews Industry Talk team.</p><p>The list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin-bottom: 20px;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">See the 15 Cryptocurrencies</a></div></div><p><i><sup>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</sup></i></p><p><strong>Related Articles:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-burger-king-say-they-need-doge-twitter-whats-going-on.htm">Dogecoin Price Prediction as Burger King Say They &#8216;Need Doge&#8217; on Twitter &ndash; What&#8217;s Going On</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-now-28-march-flr-gmx-ada.htm">Best Crypto to Buy Now 28 March &ndash; FLR, GMX, ADA</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-frieds-legal-expenses-paid-by-alameda-money-he-granted-to-his-father-whats-going-on.htm">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Legal Expenses Paid by Alameda Money He Granted to His Father &ndash;&nbsp;What&#8217;s Going On?</a></li></ul><iframe title="Ecoterra Recycle2Earn NEW CRYPTO Presale Launch - NEXT 100X CRYPTO?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8oMChF1HTc?start=2&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p>

Dogecoin price is trading 1.3% lower on the day, with $371 million in trading volume streaming in the 24-hour period.</p><p>If bulls uphold support at $0.07, Dogecoin price would still be in a position to push for a bullish narrative ahead of the weekend.</p><h2>Burger King &lsquo;Need Doge,&rsquo; But Dogecoin Price Holds Still</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The global fast-food restaurant chain Burger King, which specializes in flame-grilled burgers, fries, and other food items in a tweet earlier this week said &ldquo;we need doge.&rdquo; The vague tweet left users with more questions than answers as some speculated that the restaurant could soon add support for Dogecoin payments.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/BurgerKingUK/status/1640714073309614082[/embed]<p>At the time of writing, the tweet had been viewed 118.9k times while attracting 535 retweets and 1,522 likes. The Dogecoin community was quick to express its excitement, with some sharing funny memes.</p><p>We later established that Burger King Paris had started accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as payment, a move that led to the restaurant&rsquo;s chain in the UK tweeting &ldquo;we need doge.&rdquo;</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/BurgerKingUK/status/1640714073309614082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1640714073309614082%7Ctwgr%5E9f5558a840c05a2d30b2bf8bdce6ab881fbdb3aa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fu.today%2Fdogecoin-doge-statement-made-by-burger-king-uk-delights-community[/embed]<p>Some Twitter users inquired when Burger King would start accepting DOGE as payment for its meals but the restaurant had not responded by the time of writing. Several users, however, replied to the tweet saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly pay Burger King in doge.&rdquo;</p><p>This is not the first time; Burger King is teasing about accepting Dogecoin as payment for meals in certain jurisdictions. In June 2021, Burger King Brazil made headlines after announcing it would be accepting Dogecoin as a form of payment, but only for its Dogpper dog snack.</p><p>Last year, Robinhood, a crypto trading app joined hands with Burger King to reward customers in the US in various cryptocurrencies, which comprised 20 BTC, 200 ETH, and 2 million DOGE.</p><p>It is not clear if Burger King would make good on its tweet &ldquo;we need doge&rdquo; and start accepting the meme coin as payment for its meals, but until then, the Dogecoin community can only hope.</p><h2>Where Is Dogecoin Price Headed</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The leading meme coin is trading at $0.0747, although the daily timeframe chart reveals an ongoing consolidation between its immediate support at $0.07 and the pivotal resistance at $0.08.</p><p>However, Dogecoin&rsquo;s immediate upside has from the second week of March, been limited by two key levels: The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (line in red) at $0.0771 and the descending trendline.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109104/264497/dogeusd-2023-03-30-18-09-33.jpg" alt="Dogecoin Price" width="1218" class="content-img"><figcaption>DOGE/USD Daily Chart</figcaption></figure><p>The stalemate between bulls and bears must be resolved for Dogecoin price to breakout on either side of the range between $0.07 and $0.08. A daily close above the falling trendline and the 50-day EMA would open the door for gains above $0.08.</p><p>Such a move would be welcomed by traders waiting to activate their long positions toward $0.10. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator depicts a slightly bullish outlook, strengthened by a buy signal.</p><p>Therefore, before traders activate their buy orders, they may want to make sure the MACD line in blue is sitting above the signal line in red. If the momentum indicator flips above the mean line at 0.00 into the positive region, it could serve as further confirmation for a bullish breakout.</p><p>On the other side of the fence, failure to flip the confluence resistance provided by the 50-day EMA and the descending trendline could dim bullish expectations, with DOGE&rsquo;s technical outlook turning bearish.</p><p>In that case, all eyes will turn to the buyer congestion at $0.07 to absorb the selling pressure. This region has been crucial in the past two weeks, from March 15, holding DOGE in place and preventing further declines.</p><p>Another attempt by sellers to push <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-dogecoin-doge.htm">Dogecoin</a> price much lower may be thwarted as the meme coin sweeps through fresh liquidity. In other words, such a minor decline could meet the many investors waiting to take slightly cheaper positions in the meme coin, thus fueling a significant trend reversal to $0.10.</p><p>If push comes to shove, Dogecoin price may be forced to seek relief at $0.06, an area that was vital in stopping February&rsquo;s downtrend. The same support was also vital to Dogecoin following the TerraUSD crash in May and the recovery in October to $0.01589.</p><h2>Dogecoin Alternatives To Consider</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Dogecoin&rsquo;s outlook is relatively stable at the moment, but this could change depending on how it reacts to resistance at $0.08 and support at $0.07. However, investors may want to explore the high-potential crypto presales in the market for 2023.</p><p>Being an early adopter in the presale stage will give you the fast-mover advantage, to generate substantial returns in crypto.</p><p>In the list below, we&#8217;ve reviewed the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the Cryptonews Industry Talk team.</p><p>The list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin-bottom: 20px;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">See the 15 Cryptocurrencies</a></div></div><p><i><sup>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</sup></i></p><p><strong>Related Articles:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-or-south-korea-terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-extradition-fate-to-be-decided-by-judge.htm">US or South Korea: Terraform Labs Co-Founder Do Kwon Extradition Fate to Be Decided by Judge</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mask-network-price-prediction-as-mask-blasts-up-30-7-days-next-big-crypto-explode.htm">Mask Network Price Prediction as MASK Blasts Up 30% in 7 Days &ndash; Next Big Crypto to Explode?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-frieds-legal-expenses-paid-by-alameda-money-he-granted-to-his-father-whats-going-on.htm">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Legal Expenses Paid by Alameda Money He Granted to His Father &ndash;&nbsp;What&#8217;s Going On?</a></li></ul><iframe title="Deelance Coin NEW WEB3 Presale Launch | Crypto Recruitment - WHAT?

Shiba Inu price stayed relatively stable, with the buyer congestion at $0.00001 holding tightly in place.</p><p>In addition to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tokenized-diamond-market-booms-amid-crypto-banking-crisis-as-investors-seek-hard-assets-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">banking crisis</a>, which has left many investors unsettled and regulators seemingly blaming the crypto industry, the US Federal Reserve FOMC meeting resolved to raise interest rates by 0.25% earlier this week, depriving the market of enough momentum to keep moving up.</p><p>Over the last 30 days, SHIB has lost 19% of its value to trade at $0.00001061 at the time of writing. The second most popular meme coin is down 5% in seven days although price data from CoinGecko shows a 3.2% gain in 14 days.</p><p>Shiba Inu&rsquo;s market value has remained relatively unchanged in the last 24 hours despite <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-fed-announces-interest-decision.htm">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum, the two top cryptocurrencies, falling by 2.3% and 3.2%, respectively. With the declines spread across the board, the total market cap is down by 1.5% to nearly $1.2 trillion.</p><h2>Shiba Inu Price On the Verge of A Wedge Breakout</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Two critical levels have generally determined how Shiba Inu price has responded to uncertainties in the global market this week. They are the short-term resistance at $0.00001 and the short-term support at $0.00001.</p><p>It was a relief for the bulls when Shiba Inu halted the downtrend from its new 2023 high of $0.0000157 in early February. This allowed SHIB to tap into the liquidity at this level and rebound in the second week of March.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/108641/263597/shibusd-2023-03-25-14-44-09.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu Price Prediction " width="1217" class="content-img"><figcaption>SHIB/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>Although the recovery started with a lot of vibrancy, it did not last long as Shiba Inu barely brushed shoulders with $0.000012&mdash;a supply area coinciding with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (line in purple).</p><p>Another minor correction followed, leaving SHIB with no other option but to retreat and retest $0.00001. Now, bulls and bears are engaged in a fierce tug-of-war with neither willing to let go.</p><p>As a result, market indecision has engulfed the $6.3 billion crypto, the fifteenth largest in the market. This analysis attempts to evaluate Shiba Inu&rsquo;s chances of resuming the uptrend and climbing first to $0.000015 so that it can create the foundation for the next move to $0.00002 as part of the investors&rsquo; quest to push SHIB above $0.0001.</p><p>A falling wedge pattern, formed as Shiba Inu dropped from the highs in February, is on the verge of handing over the reins back to the bulls. This is a trend reversal pattern that often comes into the picture after a long or significant pullback in the price of an asset.</p><p>Two trendlines, as shown on the daily timeframe chart, connect a series of lower highs and lows. Every time <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-shib-blasts-up-15-from-recent-bottom-new-bull-market-starting.htm">Shiba Inu</a> has tried to push out of the pattern, bulls have lost the battle, culminating in more declines.</p><p>At the same time, the lower trendline has controlled the bearish push allowing the price to get closer to the wedge&rsquo;s apex. In other words, this pattern allows for consolidation before the next big move in price.</p><p>Usually, a breakout is expected before the trendlines meet&mdash;and it is triggered by a move above the wedge pattern&rsquo;s upside boundary. Traders often place limit orders slightly above the wedge, with the possibility of a 42% gain.</p><p>Realize that price movement above the wedge pattern would be characterized by increased volatility and volume. Profit booking can be progressive with traders exiting around the 200-day EMA ($0.000012) before activating new orders to $0.000014 and $0.000015, respectively to manage risk.</p><p>A close observation of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reveals that buyers have the upper hand at the moment. A buy signal came into play when the MACD line in blue crossed above the signal line in red.</p><p>Traders waiting to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-altcoins.htm">activate buy orders</a> may, however, want to wait until Shiba Inu price spikes above the wedge pattern and particularly the resistance at $0.00001 to avoid sudden risky pullbacks.</p><p>The potential movement of the MACD toward the mean line at 0.00 would also help to validate the bulls&rsquo; influence on the price.</p><h2>Key Levels For Shiba Inu Price This Weekend &ndash; 2-Hour Chart</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The short-term outlook for Shiba Inu is neither bearish nor bullish. However, some key levels and indicators could help traders make informed decisions.</p><p>It is important to realize that Shiba Inu price is currently in consolidation, sitting comfortably on a massive buyer congestion zone between $0.00001020 and $0.00001040.</p><p>Every time SHIB has entered or touched this demand area, shown on the chart by the yellow band, it has increased substantially since the second week of March. Therefore, a retest of the same area could be bullish for the meme coin.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/108641/263596/shibusd-2023-03-25-15-01-31.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu Price Prediction " width="1223" class="content-img"><figcaption>SHIB/USD two-hour chart</figcaption></figure><p>On the upside, Shiba Inu price is struggling to topple the daily open, as shown by the POC VAH indicator. For day traders, a break above this level at $0.00001062 could attract more buyers and build momentum to fight the trendline resistance.</p><p>If Shiba Inu price settles above the dotted trendline hurdle, we can acclimatize and prepare to see a retest of the weekly open at $0.00001092. For now, the push and pull between bears and buyers is likely to continue until the status quo is disrupted.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nasdaq-launch-crypto-custody-service-meet-growing-market-demand-heres-what-you-need-know.htm"><strong>Related Articles</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nasdaq-launch-crypto-custody-service-meet-growing-market-demand-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">Nasdaq to Launch Crypto Custody Service to Meet Growing Market Demand &ndash;&nbsp;Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-weekend-breakout-possible-amidst-choppy-market-conditions.htm">Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: Weekend Breakout Possible Amidst Choppy Market Conditions</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/litecoin-price-prediction-as-ltc-rallies-38-from-recent-bottom-can-ltc-reach-1-2023.htm">Litecoin Price Prediction as LTC Rallies 38% From Recent Bottom &ndash; Can LTC Reach $100 in 2023?</a></li></ul><iframe title="Best Crypto to Buy Now? 5 Altcoins Set to EXPLODE in 2023 &#x1f525;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ZvhNFukmAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Shiba Inu price retested critical descending trendline support earlier in March&mdash;and rebounded, implying the trend was ready to change course northwards.</p><p>Before the correction to $0.00001, which coincided with the above-mentioned trendline, SHIB had broken out in January, lifting 96% to a new yearly high of $0.00001576 by early February.</p><p>Despite the double-digit move in the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu must tick a few boxes before investors can fully confirm a new bull market. For now, let us dive into the analysis to figure out what factors are in play to either validate or invalidate the uptrend.</p><h2>Evaluating Shiba Inu Price Technical Outlook &ndash; Daily Chart</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The second-most popular meme coin, boasting $6.6 billion in market capitalization, is trading at $0.00001120. In the last 24 hours, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-rumors-emerge-that-shibarium-code-was-stolen-what-will-happen-shib.htm">Shiba Inu has seen its trading volume jump by 30% to $321 million</a>, hinting at increased accumulation among investors who anticipate a much bigger move in the price over the coming few days.</p><p>However, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (line in blue) currently caps price movement under $0.00001126. A break above this key moving average remains critical for SHIB to uphold the breakout from the falling trendline.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/108032/262566/shibusd-2023-03-18-14-32-23.jpg" alt="shiba Inu price" width="1218" class="content-img"><figcaption>SHIB/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the immediate resistance, key momentum indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reveal a determined bullish front. After Shiba Inu dumped alongside the rest of the market due to the collapse of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-companies-shift-funds-asset-managers-including-fidelity-amidst-banking-turmoil.htm">Silicon Valley Bank</a> (SVB), the MACD flashed a buy signal on the daily timeframe chart.</p><p>Investors are likely to keep their long positions in SHIB intact as long as the MACD line in blue holds above the signal line in red. Furthermore, the momentum indicator should generally move toward the mean line at 0.00 and the positive region above it &ndash; this would help improve confidence in the uptrend.</p><p>Nevertheless, Shiba Inu&rsquo;s recovery journey is unlikely going to be smooth, considering the potential resistance at the 200-day EMA (line in purple) at $0.000012, and the seller congestion areas at $0.000014 and $0.000018, respectively.</p><h2>Shiba Inu Price Eyes Another 34% Move &ndash; 4-Hour Chart</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The MACD sustains the buy signal on the four-hour chart, but this time, it is holding above the mean line. Buyers are determined to hold onto the accrued gains, especially during this week&rsquo;s recovery ahead of the Federal Reserve decision on a possible interest rate hike on March 22.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/108032/262565/shibusd-2023-03-18-14-51-38.jpg" alt="shiba Inu price" width="1222" class="content-img"><figcaption>SHIB/USD four-hour chart</figcaption></figure><p>Shiba Inu price is sitting above the 100-day EMA, which is holding at $0.00001110 on the four-hour chart. Remember, on the daily chart, the 100-day EMA is the immediate resistance.</p><p>A daily close above $0.00001110 could serve as confirmation that support is intact and the path with the least resistance is to the upside.</p><p>The second and most conspicuous aspect of the four-hour chart is the 200-day EMA resistance at $0.00001148. If SHIB flips this level into short-term support, it could attract more interest from retail traders, especially those on the sidelines and undecided.</p><p>Failure to ease through this hurdle (200-day) might prove detrimental to Shiba Inu bulls because bears will seize the opportunity and try to push the price below $0.00001110 while eyeing a retest of $0.00001.</p><p>That said, Shiba Inu still has another hidden card, which if played well, could launch the meme coin 34% north of the 200-day EMA to highs above $0.000015. For such a breakout to materialize, Shiba Inu price would have to push out of the falling wedge pattern, as illustrated on the four-hour chart.</p><h2>Shiba Inu&rsquo;s Shibarium Beta Release Clouded In Code Drama</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Shibarium, the Shiba Inu scaling protocol released its beta version last week. Note that a beta testnet refers to a blockchain protocol designed to function in the same way as the main network.</p><p>The testnet allows developers to test a product, an upgrade, or even new features in a real-time environment before they are released on the mainnet blockchain.</p><p>However, the hype surrounding the layer-2 solutions provider was quickly washed out after a high-ranking community member took to Shiba Inu&rsquo;s Discord channel and raised concerns about the development team using a similar Chain ID to another existing protocol.</p><p>&ldquo;Chain ID is the simplest thing any Blockchain dev looks for first when deploying a Blockchain. Using an ID that already exists is just incompetent as your chain wouldn&#8217;t work properly and everyone trying to interact with your chain would instead interact with the other chain,&rdquo; Steve a community member wrote in the Discord channel.</p><p>The protocol Steve was referring to is called renia, with Shiba Inu development team accused of changing the name to rinia. Despite the allegations, some developers in the community threw their weight behind the Shiba Inu team &ndash; &ldquo;code is forked all the time.

He also pointed out that governments have long maintained the view that &#8220;CRYPTO IS SUPER RISKY,&#8221; and this is unlikely to change even in the face of banking sector implosions.</p><p>Furthermore, Hoskinson criticized banks for choosing to hold collateral mostly in longer-dated traditional finance bonds, which ultimately failed and left more questions than answers. Despite the impact of the three banks&#8217; collapse in a record four days, the ADA co-founder believes the government will continue to claim that &#8220;CRYPTO IS SUPER RISKY.&#8221;</p><p>The crypto community appeared to agree with Hoskinson&#8217;s sentiments with the tweet garnering over 3,000 likes in a few hours.</p><h2>Cardano Price Flaunts Key Buy Signals</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>After hitting a new 2023 high of $0.4210, Cardano&#8217;s price experienced a sharp downtrend that stabilized at $0.30, in line with analysts&#8217; predictions.</p><p>Here, buyers stepped in and pushed the price of ADA back up toward $0.35, where it has been hindered by a confluence resistance formed by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (represented by the red line) and the 100-day EMA (represented by the blue line).</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107617/261816/adausd-2023-03-14-14-15-09.jpg" alt="Cardano price rebounds to $0.35" width="1227" class="content-img"><figcaption>ADA/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>Traders who are considering opening new or additional long positions in ADA may want to wait until the token confirms the uptrend by breaking above the critical area of contention, which is slightly above $0.35.</p><p>A natural break above this level is essential to confirm the subsequent swing toward $0.40 as bulls play the long game, ultimately reaching for the $1 level.</p><p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has already issued a buy signal, indicating that the path of least resistance is towards the upside with resistance levels along the way at $0.50 and $0.75.</p><h2>Cardano Price Uptrend Steadies In Shorter Timeframes &ndash; 4-Hour Chart</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bulls are upholding the optimistic outlook for Cardano price even in shorter timeframes, as observed on the four-hour chart.

Terra Luna Classic price spiraled massively during the weekend as investors reacted to the messy events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank New York.</p><p>On the bright side, support at $0.00012 stood its ground and stopped LUNC from stretching the leg to $0.00012. Experts had predicted the token may sweep through the liquidity at this price level if it slipped beneath the broken support at $0.00014.</p><p>A sharp and immediate recovery was also anticipated from the same support area and true to the forecast, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-100-million-trading-volume-comes-whats-going-on.htm">Terra Luna Classic</a> aggressively sprung upward on Monday to trade at $0.0001336 at the time of writing.</p><p>With an over 167% increase in the 24-hour trading volume to $123 million, LUNC could be suitably positioned to recover the lost ground, bringing $0.00021&mdash;the new 2023 high within reach.</p><p>Traders often use the increase in volume to gauge the level of interest among investors. In other words, it shows their willingness to accumulate which translates to a stronger momentum behind LUNC.</p><h2>Assessing Terra Luna Classic Price Technical Outlook</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Terra Luna Classic price is gradually easing into a V-shaped recovery that could see it tag $0.0021 in a few weeks &ndash; perhaps months. However, the question among investors is, can LUNC price sustain this reflex upswing?</p><p>From the daily timeframe chart below, we can deduce that support at $0.00012 secured a lot of liquidity for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-50-million-trading-volume-comes-can-lunc-recover-year.htm">Terra Luna Classic price</a> and is the main reason for the 10% bullish move.</p><p>Still, LUNC appears ready to hit pause and secure another higher support, preferably above $0.0001325 before staging another offensive attack on $0.00014.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107560/261712/luncusd-2023-03-13-20-18-39.jpg" alt="t" width="1228" class="content-img"><figcaption>LUNC/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>The same daily chart brings into the technical outlook a strong falling trendline resistance since early February when Terra Luna Classic price exchanged hands at $0.00021. A recovery attempt in early March failed after tagging the same resistance line.</p><p>For that reason, investors should anticipate delays as LUNC closes in on the descending trendline. Given that Terra Luna Classic price breaks above the subsequent hurdle at $0.00014 and consequently the trend line, more would be expected from the bulls as they are likely to capitalize on the momentum for gains targeting $0.00018 and $0.00021.</p><p>On the other hand, the trendline coupled with the seller congestion at $0.00014 could easily flip into the new point of control likely to force Terra Luna Classic price to consolidate between $0.00012 and $0.00014 for a few weeks before resolving the next direction to take.</p><h2>Here&rsquo;re The Levels to Watch In Terra Luna Classic Price &ndash; 4-Hour Chart</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The two key levels analyzed in the daily timeframe are still relevant on the four-hour chart. Support at $0.00012 provided liquidity for the bullish move seen on Monday, however, buyers must brace themselves for a stronger challenge at $0.00014.</p><p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (line in red) at $0.0001336 has already slowed down LUNC&rsquo;s upward momentum. Meanwhile, a daily close above this price level is critical for the continuation of the uptrend.</p><p>Investors who are still unsure of LUNC&rsquo;s ability to uphold the recovery would be waiting for bulls to confirm $0.0001336 as support before they throw their weight behind the project. Such a move is also needed so that confidence in the uptrend stays intact and paves the way for an expanded bullish scope.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107560/261713/luncusd-2023-03-13-20-36-24.jpg" alt="Terra Luna Classic" width="1228" class="content-img"><figcaption>LUNC/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>That said, Terra Luna Classic price appears comfortably in the bullish camp, supported by a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.</p><p>Investors are likely to have resolved to buy LUNC as the MACD line in blue flipped above the signal line in red. Movement into the positive region above the mean line at 0.00 will further cement the bulls&rsquo; presence in the market.</p><p>Some key targets to the upside start with the 50-day EMA. Although tapped already, this level must be confirmed as support for Terra Luna Classic price to keep trending to the north.</p><p>The second critical target sits at $0.00014 and may be extrapolated to include the 100-day EMA (line in blue) on the same four-hour chart. Stubbornly bullish traders may want to wait for another spike before closing their positions at this level.</p><p>However, the ideal action would be to cash out at the 50-day EMA before placing new buy orders after LUNC affirms its position above $0.0001336. This means, the 100-day EMA would be the second target with a possible entry for gains eyeing the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, as highlighted by the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $0.0001532.</p><p>If Terra Luna Classic price keeps the uptrend intact above the 200-day EMA (line in purple) investors can begin to acclimatize to an explosive move to $0.00018 and $0.00021, respectively.</p><p>On the downside, failure to break above the 50-day EMA would dampen the recovery seen on Monday. Another sweep at the major support at $0.00012 cannot be ruled out, especially with the crypto market likely to face increased contagion from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-confirms-240-million-corporate-cash-balance-with-signature-bank-amid-lender-closure.htm">collapsing United States banks</a>.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy Terra Luna Classic Now.</strong></a></p><h2>Terra Luna Classic Alternatives To Consider Today</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>&nbsp;If you&#8217;re looking for other high-potential crypto projects alongside LUNC, we&#8217;ve reviewed the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the <i>CryptoNews</i> Industry Talk team.<br><br>The list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin-bottom: 20px;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">See the 15 Cryptocurrencies</a></div></div><p><i><sup>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</sup></i></p><p><strong>Related Articles:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-500-million-trading-volume-floods-are-whales-buying.htm">Dogecoin Price Prediction as $500 Million Trading Volume Floods In &ndash; Are Whales Buying?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-cryptocurrency-is-inevitable-two-hacks-okcoin-pauses-usd-deposits-beatport-polkadots-music-platform-alchemy-notifys-custom-webhooks.htm">Today in Crypto: Cryptocurrency is &#8216;Inevitable&#8217;, Two Hacks, OKCoin Pauses USD Deposits, Beatport &amp; Polkadot&#8217;s Music Platform, Alchemy Notify&#8217;s Custom Webhooks</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-suddenly-converts-1-billion-from-industry-recovery-initiative-bitcoin-ether-bnb-heres-why.htm">Binance Suddenly Converts $1 Billion From Industry Recovery Initiative to Bitcoin, Ether, BNB &ndash; Here&#8217;s Why</a></li></ul><iframe title="Love Hate Inu Memecoin Update (How Much Will I BUY) - Shiba Inu Killer?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lsy7EdEs70U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As the Federal Reserve began to raise rates quickly to reduce inflation, SVB&#8217;s bond investment suffered substantial losses.</p><p>SVB faced a shortage of liquid funds, which prompted it to sell its bonds at significant losses, leading to panic among investors and clients. The company&#8217;s disclosure of the asset sale was followed by its collapse after only two days.</p><h2>Why Dogecoin and the Crypto Market Dumped?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>News of a liquidity crunch at SVB sent panic across the world with clients rushing to withdraw funds &ndash; typical of a bank run. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-commits-covering-usdc-shortfalls-ensures-redemption-at-11-with-usd.htm">Circle</a>, the company that issues the second largest stablecoin USDC, announced it had exposure to SVB with $3 billion of reverses stuck in the bank.</p><p>The news fueled a sell-off in the crypto market with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/usdc-depeg-circles-43-billion-stablecoin-spotlight-as-silicon-valley-bank-exposure-revealed-heres-latest.htm">USDC dropping 10% from its dollar peg</a>. Investors panic-sold, fearing a repeat of the TerraUSD (UST) crash in May 2022. Bitcoin price dropped to sub $20,000, pulling most cryptos down.</p><p>Due to the sell-off, the total market capitalization slipped below the $1 trillion mark. However, Monday came with renewed interest among investors and hence the spike to $1.05 trillion at the time of writing.</p><p>The most popular meme token was not spared by the explosive selling activities over the weekend. Dogecoin price stretched the leg significantly below the monthly open roughly at $0.0825 and tested support at $0.0625.</p><p>Retail traders flipped bearish to take advantage of the available short positions, which kept DOGE suppressed throughout the weekend. However, Elon Musk&rsquo;s most loved crypto shot up 5% on Monday to trade at $0.06914 at the time of writing.</p><p>The trading volume has also been on an upward roll with over $500 million recorded in 24 hours, representing a 90% increase. Spikes in trading volume often indicate the presence of liquidity, in addition to a heightened accumulation of DOGE tokens. In other words, an expanding volume is often a positive signal for the token being traded.</p><h2>Evaluating Dogecoin Price Profitability This Week</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Dogecoin investors will throughout the week mainly be concerned about securing higher support, preferably above $0.07. Such a move will reduce the chances of declines extending below $0.06. However, investors should be open to Dogecoin price revisiting the most recent support at $0.0625.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107521/261624/dogeusd-2023-03-13-16-25-30.jpg" alt="" width="1228" class="content-img"><figcaption>DOGE/USD daily chart</figcaption></figure><p>Key levels to watch to the upside would be the region at $0.07 as mentioned. Holding above this level is crucial for the immediate resumption of the uptrend. Furthermore, DOGE staying above this level would repair investor confluence in a short-term trend reversal for gains targeting $0.08 and $0.10, respectively.</p><p>Dogecoin price will likely complete a daily bearish candle close On Monday and below $0.07. Nonetheless, all would not be lost for the meme coin, considering the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator could validate a buy signal anytime from now.</p><p>Traders would be looking forward to the MACD line in blue flipping above the signal line in red. A general upward movement in the momentum indicator toward the mean line at 0.00 and the positive region above it would keep investor interest intact.</p><p>Approximately 80,500 addresses that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-dogecoin-doge.htm">bought 34.59 billion DOGE </a>between $0.0738 and $0.0758 are out of the money. This means if they sold at the current market rate, they would realize a loss relative to the price at which they purchased the tokens.</p><p>Investors must keep in mind that as the Dogecoin price strikes above $0.07, it is likely to face resistance in the range between $0.0738 and $0.0758 because investors in this cohort will likely sell at various breakeven points.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107521/261623/screenshot-153.jpg" alt="Dogecoin price as $500 million in trading volume comes in" width="1069" class="content-img"><figcaption>Dogecoin IOMAP</figcaption></figure><p>On the downside, the Dogecoin price lacks robust support as observed from the chart above. The small green circles represent potential liquidity areas where DOGE can find support and rebound.</p><p>Given that support areas remain suppressed, a little spike in overhead pressure could force the Dogecoin price below $0.06 with potential support at $0.058 before it bounces again.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy Dogecoin Now</strong></a></p><h2>Dogecoin Alternatives To Buy Today</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>If you&#8217;re looking for other high-potential crypto projects alongside DOGE, we&#8217;ve reviewed the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the <i>Cryptonews</i> Industry Talk team.<br><br>The list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin-bottom: 20px;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">See the 15 Cryptocurrencies</a></div></div><p><i><sup>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</sup></i></p><h3><strong>Related Articles:</strong></h3><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-10-biggest-crypto-gainers-today-snx-fil-mkr-rndr-stx-find-out-more-here.htm">Top 10 Biggest Crypto Gainers Today: SNX, FIL, MKR, RNDR, STX &ndash;&nbsp;Find Out More Here</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-ripple-ceo-confirms-exposure-silicon-valley-bank-what-does-mean-for-xrp.htm">XRP Price Prediction as Ripple CEO Confirms Exposure to Silicon Valley Bank &ndash;&nbsp;What Does This Mean for XRP?</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-confirms-240-million-corporate-cash-balance-with-signature-bank-amid-lender-closure.htm">Coinbase Confirms $240 Million Corporate Cash Balance with Signature Bank Amid Lender Closure</a></li></ul><iframe title="Love Hate Inu Meme Coin Raises $250k - Next Dogecoin, Shiba Inu or Floki?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJoXdf8Ssk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
