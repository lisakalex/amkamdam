<p><i><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>An initial coin offering, or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-an-ico.htm">ICO</a>, is a popular way for crypto projects to generate publicity and raise capital. Much like crowdfunding, ICOs allow the community to have a tangible impact on a project&#8217;s growth – while also providing scope for investors to realize substantial returns in the future.</p>
<p>ICOs have the potential to generate these substantial returns. Ethereum (ETH) is currently demonstrating a <a href="https://coincodex.com/ico/ethereum/"><u>6,300x multiplier since its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014.</u></a> Cardano (ADA), meanwhile, is presenting a <a href="https://coincodex.com/ico/cardano/"><u>125x multiplier since its ICO in September 2017.</u></a> </p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://icodrops.com/ico-stats/"><u>OpenCampus (EDI) is trading at 1,400% of its initial ICO price</u></a> while SUI (SUI) trades at 660% of its initial ICO price. This shows that returns can be significant depending on which ICO is chosen &#8211; the other side of the coin is that multiple ICOs have <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ia_icorelatedclaims"><u>turned out to be no more than scams.</u></a></p>
<p>As brand new projects, ICO cryptos often have no established market to fall back on while their utility is unproven, even if the potential of the solution they offer is high. It is important for investors to understand that even the best ICOs are not guaranteed to deliver immediate returns or success for the investor.</p>
<p>This article discusses the best crypto ICOs available, covering what they are and why they are so highly regarded, before exploring the key factors to bear in mind when making an ICO investment decision.</p>

<h2><strong>The Best New ICO Crypto Projects Reviewed</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investing in an ICO can be risky, given that the project in question will still be in its infancy and is not yet established. However, those with a higher risk tolerance level can benefit from improved ROI potential. The two often go hand in hand. </p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at the best crypto ICOs listed above, exploring why they are so sought-after:<b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) &#8211; Best Crypto ICO Set to Increase in Price by 36%</b></h3>
<p>Our best crypto ICO in 2024 is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) &#8211; a cryptocurrency platform that is linked to the fate of the upcoming Bitcoin Spot ETF. The project has laid out 5 milestones &#8211; and will burn 5% of its token supply upon reaching each of these targets. </p>
<p>The milestones include: </p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1210" height="417" class="aligncenter wp-image-127528" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token milestones" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png 1210w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-300x103.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-1024x353.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-768x265.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1210px) 100vw, 1210px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>$BTCETF surpasses a $100 million trading volume</li>
<li>The announcement of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF</li>
<li>The release of the Bitcoin Spot ETF</li>
<li>Assets under management of the ETF cross $1 billion</li>
<li>Bitcoin trades above $100K </li>
</ul>
<p>From a supply of 2.1 billion &#8211; 5% will be burned on the completion of each of these milestones. Stage one of the ICO has priced $BTCETF at just $0.005 per token. The initial coin offering consists of ten rounds &#8211; each allocating 84 million tokens. 40% of the token supply has been allocated across these rounds. </p>
<p>The goal is to collect a hard cap of nearly $5 million by the end of the presale. By the final round, $BTCETF will be priced at $0.0068 per token &#8211; equating to a 36% price jump from the stage one levels. Therefore, early investors can acquire this token before the price goes up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1334" height="621" class="aligncenter wp-image-127433" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699267689-bitcoin-etf-token-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699267689-bitcoin-etf-token-presale.png 1334w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699267689-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699267689-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-1024x477.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699267689-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-768x358.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699267689-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px" /></p>
<p>Investors can also access high staking rewards by locking $BTCETF on verified smart contracts. At press time, the annual staking yield is set at more than 11,400%. Over 2.5 million tokens have already been locked on the smart contract. </p>
<p>Get these staking benefits by purchasing $BTCETF with Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT), after connecting a compatible crypto wallet. The ICO has already raised more than $17K.

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Revolutionary Stake-to-Mine ICO Crypto Offering Cloud Mining Credits</strong></h3>
<p>The next crypto on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX). This platform will converge the world of cloud mining and token staking with its stake-to-mine mechanism. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/334841/screen-shot-2023-10-24-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale" /></figure>
<p>Cloud mining power is a process through which individuals can rent mining power from third-party companies and corporations. However, the space is full of dubious corporations that scam investors. The Bitcoin Minetrix solution is to tokenize cloud mining and give investors control.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix achieves this through the $BTCMTX token. Investors can buy and stake the native token through an Ethereum-powered smart contract. One can then generate passive income and collect cloud mining credits. </p>
<p>These ERC-20 tokens are not tradable but can be burnt on the ecosystem to earn Bitcoin cloud mining power. Therefore, investors will get allocated mining times and a percentage of mining revenues. Not only does Bitcoin Minetrix reduce the entry barrier, but it leverages cloud mining companies’ equipment to become more cost-efficient. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/331751/bitcoin-minetrix-cloud-mining.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix decentralized cloud mining" /></figure>
<p>The $BTCMTX ICO has raised more than $105K in its first day, and has now raised $2.2M. $BTCMTX has a total supply of 4 billion, 70% of which is allocated for the presale. The presale will consist of 39 rounds. </p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix has set a presale hard cap of $32 million. Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.012. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; High Utility Meme Coin ICO Offering Wagering Opportunities and High Staking Yields</strong></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency ICO to watch is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK). This revolutionary project is leveraging blockchain technology to combine memes with play-to-earn battle arenas. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/331100/meme-kombat-homepage.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat website" /></figure>
<p>Meme Kombat will feature a battle arena where avatars will compete against each other in different environments. Notably, the avatars will be based on meme coins such as Pepe or Wojak. With the help of the $MK token, players can stake and wager on the battle arenas to win exclusive prizes and free tokens. </p>
<p>Currently, investors can <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-meme-kombat.htm">buy Meme Kombat</a> for $0.1667 through the ongoing presale round. The gaming will begin with the launch of the first seasons on Meme Kombat, after the end of the presale. This will feature various betting and wagering options such Player vs Player betting, Player vs Game betting, and side action betting. </p>
<p>As soon as you purchase the $MK token on presale, your funds will be staked on a staking contract. At press time, Meme Kombat is offering a 112% staking APY for the presale. To help foster a loyal community, Meme Kombat has allocated 50% of the 120 million token supply to the public. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/331171/meme-kombat-presale-apys.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat token staking" /></figure>

<h3><strong>5. eTukTuk (TUK) &#8211; Earn Staking Rewards with this Crypto Aiming to Reduce Air Pollution</strong></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency on our list is $TUK, the native token of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk</a>. This is the first-ever automotive project based on the Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<p>eTukTuk wants to help TukTuk drivers start adopting electric vehicles (EVs) and will build charging stations and set up electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/315478/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk electric vehicle" /></figure>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 99% of the population breathe polluted air. There are 270 million TukTuks that operate on Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs), which run on non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels. These contribute to more pollution than cars. </p>
<p>As ICEs are slowly becoming obsolete, TukTuk drivers struggle to make a minimum wage to support their families. Therefore, eTukTuk will set up EV charging stations in urban and suburban areas of developing countries. </p>
<p>The EVSEs and charging stations will be set up in different ‘territories.’ Each territory will be operated and set up with the help of local manufacturers, known as territory partners. This helps limit the cost of production. The platform will let drivers make payments at the charging stations with $TUK tokens. </p>
<p>Since the cryptocurrency is based on the Binance Smart Chain, there are low fees and high scalability. According to the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf">eTukTuk whitepaper</a>, drivers will take home 400% more in revenue by using this platform. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/315479/etuktuk-efficient-charging.jpg" alt="eTukTuk charging stations" /></figure>
<p>Territory partners will be rewarded, as they get a commission for each transaction on the charging stations. Token holders can stake $TUK to earn passive income. eTukTuk is priced at $0.024 on presale.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Green Bitcoin &#8211; Token Presale That Rewards Users Who Stake Their Tokens and Predict Bitcoin&#8217;s Price</strong></h3>
<p>In the realm of cryptocurrency projects, while many are focused on developing innovative financial solutions, some projects are focused on delivering gamified rewards for their holders. And that&#8217;s what <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin</a> is all about; A new ERC20 token presale that rewards users who predict Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>To start, however, you need to grab $GBTC tokens first. At the moment, they are only available on a token presale where you can use ETH, USDT or a card to acquire as many as you want. Given this is a multi-stage token presale, it&#8217;s typically best to buy in early to take advantage of the lower presale price. As the presale progresses, the token price goes up, eventually listing on an A-tier exchange.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="460" class="alignnone wp-image-139347 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-768x393.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701773772-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Once you have some $GBTC tokens, you can stake them during the presale. That way you&#8217;re maximizing your rewards as the staking APR is massive in the early stages. As more users buy and stake $GBTC tokens, the APR will drop. Once the token presale ends and Bitcoin&#8217;s price prediction comes on line, the staking rewards will depend on how long you stake your tokens as well as how accurate you predict Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>With a total of 21 million tokens, with 40% of them dedicated to the presale, early adopters will have the chance to scoop the biggest piece of the pie. Moreover, 27.5% of the total token supply will be dedicated to staking rewards, according to <a href="https://www.greenbitcoin.xyz/whitepaper.pdf">Green Bitcoin&#8217;s whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="464" class="alignnone wp-image-139318 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin tokenomics" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-300x155.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-768x396.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701770560-tokenomics-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>There are four phases in the Green Bitcoin&#8217;s roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1: </strong>The token presale launch.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2: </strong>The token launch on A-tier exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3: </strong>Staking rewards and prediction game go live.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 4: </strong>Improving on the prediction game, called Predict to Earn 2.0.</li>

<p>One can access trading insights through Launchpad XYZ’s trading terminal by staking the token. While this cryptocurrency has no historical price movements that can help us analyze its future price, it offers multiple use cases. $LPX is a utility token, as it will also be used to purchase fractionalized assets such as cars, houses, and more. </p>
<p>Those staking a minimum monthly average of 10,000 $LPX can benefit from discounts on fees and get guaranteed access to presales and to whitelists of new NFT mints.

<p>Launchpad XYZ hosts many crypto presales on its ecosystem, allowing users to directly claim new tokens through their wallets. By offering all these experiences in one ecosystem, Launchpad XYZ aims to onboard the next 10 million users in the Web3 space. </p>
<p>From a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens, 250 million $LPX have been allocated for the ongoing presale. The presale will consist of 10 rounds, each offering 25 million tokens. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/272374/launchpad-roadmap.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ roadmap" /></figure>
<p>Currently, $LPX is priced at $0.0445 during the second round, the price will jump to $0.0565 by the tenth and final round, an increase of 27%.</p>

<h3><strong>9. yPredict &#8211; New Trading and Analytics Platform that Utilizes AI and Machine Learning </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to offer financial prediction methods and data-driven insights on the cryptocurrency markets. </p>
<p>The platform, built by doxxed and experienced professional traders, quants and software engineers, will allow users to maximize their profit-making potential by providing a range of tools and AI-generated data and analytics.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/323178/ypred-presale.jpg" alt="yPredict token presale" /></figure>
<p>While yPredict is a new cryptocurrency, it uses an important element of blockchain technology &#8211; artificial intelligence. By using tools such as Natural Language Processing, the platform analyzes the sentiment of various tokens. Furthermore, the ecosystem uses over 25 chart pattern recognition tools, allowing the AI to determine the bullishness of a particular coin. </p>
<p>Users can access predictive analytics and models, which have been verified by the yPredict DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). By holding this utility token, users can also generate a potentially high APY (Annual Percentage Yield). </p>
<p>Existing $YPRED holders are awarded 10% of all the new subscription revenue generated. Furthermore, 15% of swap fees are also shared amongst token holders through a staking pool. By staking $YPRED, one gets free access to the data analytics platform as well. </p>
<p>yPredict lets members study about cryptocurrencies and take quizzes on its Learn2Earn ecosystem. After taking each test, users are awarded with a certain amount of $YPRED. Through a play-to-earn ecosystem, members can bet on the crypto markets&#8217; future outlook to earn more tokens. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/271812/ypredict-use-cases.jpg" alt="yPredict AI models" /></figure>
<p>The tokens have further utility as they are used to purchase memberships on the platform, with three tiers available (free, active, pro) that allow access to different levels of features and analytical data.</p>
<p>Currently, $YPRED can be purchased for only $0.1 during the ongoing cryptocurrency presale but by the final round, the price will jump to $0.12 per token &#8211; an increase of 20%.</p>
<p>Since the presale went live, yPredict has managed to raise over $4.4 million, with the token to be listed on exchanges after the presale concludes. </p>

<p>The platform will charge a fixed trading fee of 0.25% per transaction but has no plans to increase this number. AI will be used to detect fraud, offer users online assistance, and monitor cryptocurrency transactions. </p>
<p>Methods such as deep learning will be applied to offer advanced image generation via speech and text prompts. Since MindAI has registered itself as a startup in the Business Register in Italy, 15% of the available cash flow will be put towards research and development. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/268078/mindai-features.jpg" alt="TMC token and TMCX exchange" /></figure>
<p>The MindAI presale is currently in phase one, where the $TMC token is priced at just $0.15. There will be eight rounds in total, with the eventual price rising to $0.20 before the exchange listing. 50% of the total 300 million TMC supply will be allocated across the eight rounds. </p>
<p>5% of the tokens have been reserved for exchange listings, while 30% will be given to the team’s foundation. Read the <a href="https://officialmindai.com/_mindai_wp_1.pdf">MindAI whitepaper</a> to learn more about this project. </p>

<h3><strong>11. Cogwise &#8211; AI-Based Cryptocurrency Priced at $0.02 on Presale </strong></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency ICO to look at is <a href="https://cogwise.io/">Cogwise</a> ($COGW). This is a platform that is leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to offer fast and accurate information to traders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/332762/screen-shot-2023-10-05-at.jpg" alt="COGW token presale" /> One can access trading insights through AI tools that can offer charting patterns, technical analysis, and track large cryptocurrency wallets. Furthermore, Cogwise is capable of creating smart contracts and complete audits. The platform will also offer AI-based trading assistants to study vast amounts of market data to offer potentially profitable trading ideas. </p>
<p>Since Cogwise leverages tools such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system can easily communicate with humans. The $COGW token can be staked on the ecosystem to earn access to all the features and tools on the premium AI model. </p>
<p>The token can also be deposited on liquidity pools to provide liquidity to other decentralized exchanges. Token holders will receive passive income for depositing their tokens in these pools. The more one deposits, the more they can earn as rewards. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/332763/cogwise-tokenomics.jpg" alt="COGW tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>35% of all profits and revenues generated will be burned from the $COGW token supply. The remaining 65% will be used to sustain the ecosystem. Thus, the reduced token supply can help the token’s price as the demand increases. </p>
<p>Currently, $COGW is priced at $0.02 on presale. By the exchange listing, the price will jump to $0.065 per token &#8211; a 225% price increase. Cogwise has raised over $175K since the start of the presale. Read the <a href="https://cogwise.io/whitepaper-cogwise-COGW.pdf">Cogwise whitepaper</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/cogwise">Telegram channel</a> to stay informed and updated with this presale. </p>

<h3><strong>12. Doge Uprising &#8211; Brand New Meme Based ICO, $DUP Price Of $0.000013 Set To Increase To $0.000026.  </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising/"><u>Doge Uprising ($DUP)</u></a> is a highly creative story-focused ICO with a tale that features both Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk &#8211; two highly popular figures in the modern era. </p>
<p>Set in 2045, a number of Doge Mechas led by Elon Musk rise up against Mark Zuckerberg, who has captured the world in a global web of surveillance. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/333829/screen-shot-2023-10-16-at.jpg" alt="Doge Uprising presale" /></figure>
<p>These Doge Mechas are NFTs purchased by investors (pilots) who are interested in freeing the world from global tyranny. The machines are fueled by the utility based $DUP token, and are lifeless without it. The story ultimately ends with the Mecha NFTs defeating the forces of oppression, but this can only happen if enough pilots agree to take ownership of the NFTs.</p>
<p>This is a community orientated project with lots of AMAs, staking yields, and plans to collaborate with a number of key influencers in the field. There are a total of 270 billion $DUP tokens available in the presale, out of the maximum supply of 450 billion. Currently, the token trades at a 50% discount. Priced at $0.000013, it will double to $0.000026 in the next stage. After this it could easily rise further, and will ultimately list on Uniswap.</p>
<p>This ICO has done a lot of work in terms of its graphics, its research, and its story, which could be of interest to multiple investors. Surveillance is a hot topic right now, with many unhappy at the current state of affairs. And meme based presales, particularly those inspired by Doge, have a history of strong performance in recent years. It has also conducted a <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/SolidProof-Audit.pdf">smart contract audit</a> for increased transparency. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/333830/screen-shot-2023-10-16-at.jpg" alt="Doge Mecha " /></figure>
<p>To take part a compatible Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Wallet Connect) is required, along with an accepted crypto (ETH, USDT, BNB). The “Lizard Boy” (Mark Zuckerberg) can be stopped sooner, if more Doge Mecha NFTs are commanded by capable and willing pilots.</p>
<p>Additional data about this project can be found within the <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Doge Uprising Whitepaper</u></a>, which mentions the volatility and risks of meme coin investment.</p>

<h3><strong>13. Sensei Inu &#8211; MemeFi Presale on Ethereum Allows People To Earn As They Learn</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/senseiinu/"><u>Sensei Inu ($SINU)</u></a> is a new concept that provides an alternative to the proof of stake mechanism with a knowledge based approach to rewards. This is a trivia platform where rewards depend on quiz based performance. </p>
<p>This helps to make the system far more equitable in comparison. It is known as a “Proof of Value” consensus mechanism.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/334366/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Sensei Inu token presale" /></figure>
<p>This is an Ethereum initiative that provides a user-friendly Sensei dashboard to oversee all performance and identify areas of potential growth. Players can learn as they earn and the questions center around blockchain concepts. There are 10 questions in each round which get more difficult towards the end. A timer also adds to the excitement and the top 10 players get the lion&#8217;s share of rewards.</p>
<p>There are 5 billion $SINU tokens in total with 2.5 billion available in the presale at a price of $0.0007, set to rise to $0.0008 in the next stage. So there is definitely a benefit in early stage investment. 20% of the total supply, a large figure, is also set to be sent to a burn address.</p>
<p>This means the tokens are taken out of circulation, increasing the value of all existing coins. Of the remainder, 20% goes toward liquidity while 10% goes to the team and to a centralized exchange listing.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/334367/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Sensei proof-of-value" /></figure>
<p>Players and community participants can also vote on important decisions through the governance DAO. A referral program allows for additional rewards, on top of playing the trivia game. ETH, USDT, BNB, and Card are all accepted to take part in this presale.</p>

<p>With $PIKA &#8211; players can buy Pikamoon NFT avatars. Currently, the first edition of Pikamoon will offer 18,012 NFTs &#8211; which vary in rarity and design. On Dreva, the virtual world inside the Pikaverse &#8211; players can leverage their Pikamoon NFTs in battle to earn free tokens. </p>
<p>The Pikaverse will offer exploration opportunities &#8211; allowing players to travel across different regions, capture new Pikamoon avatars, and interact with NPCs. Through a marketplace, players can use their $PIKA tokens to buy NFTs of weapons, boosts, and capture devices. </p>
<p>Due to the multiple use cases of $PIKA &#8211; the token’s presale is off to a flying start. Pikamoon has raised over $4 million and is priced at $0.0006 during the final presale stage. Afterwards, the token will be listed on exchanges at a price of $0.0007. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="860" height="481" class="aligncenter wp-image-125719" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698916020-pikamoon-metaverse.png" alt="Pikamoon metaverse" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698916020-pikamoon-metaverse.png 860w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698916020-pikamoon-metaverse-300x168.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698916020-pikamoon-metaverse-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<p>This project also charges a 2.5% transaction tax on selling and transferring the token, but none on buying the cryptocurrency. While $PIKA has a total supply of 50 billion, 5% of the tokens spent on the marketplace will be burnt. This project has been KYC verified by Coinsult.</p>

<h3><strong>15. Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA) &#8211; Battle-Builder Game with P2E Features</strong></h3>
<p>Heroes of Mavia could be one of the best crypto ICOs in the blockchain gaming niche due to its appealing &#8216;base building&#8217; features. </p>
<p>Within the Heroes of Mavia ecosystem, players can create their own armies and conquer enemy bases – allowing them to earn Ruby tokens in the process.</p>

<p>Ruby tokens can then be used to upgrade a user’s base, strengthen their army, and solidify defenses.</p>
<p>However, aside from the battle mechanics, Heroes of Mavia also has a built-in NFT marketplace, live battle streaming features, and even a ‘Base Partnership Manager’ for users to collaborate and generate passive income.</p>
<p>Like many of the best ICO cryptos, Heroes of Mavia has already attracted massive attention from prospective investors on social media. </p>

<h3><strong>17. Scary Pepe &#8211; Meme Crypto Offering 99% of its 1 Billion Supply on Presale </strong></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency ICO is $SCARYPP &#8211; the native token of Scary Pepe. After Pepe Coin&#8217;s (PEPE) success in the start of 2023, the meme space has witnessed several new Pepe-themed meme tokens. </p>
<p>Scary Pepe is one such cryptocurrency that is soaring on presale. Notably, $SCARYPP has a low token supply of just 1 billion. A staggering 99% of the token supply has been offered for the ongoing presale. Thus, investors have enough time to acquire the token before the exchange listing takes place. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/332766/screen-shot-2023-10-05-at.jpg" alt="Scary Pepe token presale" /></figure>
<p>The remaining 1% of the supply is protected within a multi-signature vault. These tokens will be used for future exchange listings. Currently, $SCARYPP is priced at just $0.00028 on presale. The exchange listing will increase the price to $0.0004 per token. </p>
<p>The presale has already raised over $225K. Notably, Scary Pepe does not charge any buy or sell tax on the tokens. Join the <a href="https://t.me/scarypepe">Scary Pepe Telegram channel</a> to learn more about this cryptocurrency. </p>

<h2><strong>What is a Crypto ICO?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A crypto ICO is a type of blockchain-enabled crowdfunding that allows a crypto project to raise funds by selling tokens. The tokens that are offered tend to have a use case within the project itself, meaning early investors can become a part of the community before the project has even launched.</p>
<p>Most of the time, crypto ICOs will allow investors to purchase tokens at a discounted price relative to their eventual listing price. This is done to entice investors to participate in the ICO, kick-start development and generate publicity, which is crucial to a project&#8217;s growth.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/218661/coins.jpg" alt="Crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>The concept of crypto ICOs is not new, having been around since the early 2010s and similar to a stock exchange IPO.</p>
<p>Ethereum is one of the most notable projects to begin its life as an ICO, as early investors were able to acquire ETH for just $0.31 per token back in 2014.  Given that ETH tokens are now valued at around $1,800 &#8211; and has been as high as $4,800 &#8211; it&#8217;s clear <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-invest-in-an-ico.htm">why ICOs are so popular</a> with risk-seeking investors.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s also essential to bear in mind that crypto ICOs are generally unregulated, meaning they are not supervised or policed by leading institutions. As such, investors looking to participate in crypto ICOs must do their due diligence and be aware of the heightened risks before deciding to purchase tokens, as well as understand that success is not always guaranteed, despite the potential of a project.</p>
<h3><strong>A History of ICOs</strong></h3>
<p>ICOs emerged as a method for crypto developers to secure funds for cryptocurrency projects. It involves creating blockchain based tokens and selling them directly to investors at a discounted rate. While IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) involve the sale of stock to raise capital for mature companies, ICOs do the same thing in a Web3 context.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>ICOs serve as a funding mechanism for early-stage projects, often in the tech startup realm. ICO investors purchase tokens without obtaining any ownership stake in the company. The premise is that investors believe in the project&#8217;s value and anticipate potential profits by purchasing tokens at a lower price early on and selling them for a profit once the project achieves success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As previously mentioned, the first major success story in the world of ICOs was Ethereum. Back in 2014, it <a href="https://icodrops.com/ethereum/"><u>managed to raise an impressive sum of $16 million</u></a> (this amount is small by current standards, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-chaotic-launch-of-eos-the-blockchain-project-that-raised-4-billion-1528810352"><u>EOS having raised $4 billion</u></a>). Today, Ethereum not only stands as one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies but also serves as the foundation for an entire ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) that have flourished with its technology. It’s also the home of decentralized finance (DeFi), an incredibly large field estimated at <a href="https://defillama.com/?volume=true"><u>$44 billion by total value locked</u></a> (TVL). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317423/screen-shot-2023-07-07-at.jpg" alt="Ethereum DeFi ecosystem" /></figure>
<p>In 2017, however, the ICO success stories rapidly diminished &#8211; <a href="https://mashable.com/article/majority-ico-scams"><u>80% of ICOs in this time period were estimated to have been scams</u></a>. A number of fraudulent projects scammed investors out of their earnings. Only about <a href="https://kingpassive.com/ico-beginners-guide/"><u>8% of such ICOs reached a centralized exchange </u></a>(CEX) for serious liquidity and long term growth. </p>
<p>This resulted in a regulatory crackdown, mainly from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the USA. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ripple-says-recent-supreme-court-ruling-weighs-its-favor-sec-case-2023-03-03/"><u>An ongoing case of Ripple vs SEC</u></a> is still deliberating as to whether such projects constituted a securities offering or not. If so, the offerings would be in violation of SEC guidelines, potentially resulting in criminal liability for the founders. </p>
<p>Due to the regulatory crackdown and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-09/half-of-icos-die-within-four-months-after-token-sales-finalized#xj4y7vzkg"><u>the risky nature of ICOs</u></a>, Web3 fundraising mechanisms have evolved into various formats &#8211; Securities Token Offerings (STOs), Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs), and Initial Dex Offering (IDOs). The ecosystem had to evolve to become safer but also more flexible, as the sophistication of the Web3 ecosystem developed further.</p>
<h2><strong>How do Initial Coin Offerings Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Initial coin offerings are scheduled events that last for a specific amount of time which is decided on by the project&#8217;s team. The team will set a date for the ICO and determine their fundraising goal. </p>
<p>Each cryptocurrency ICO will usually have a soft cap and a hard cap, which state the minimum and maximum number of tokens to be sold. Once the ICO has gone live, the purchasing process tends to look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investors will go to the project’s official website to participate in the ICO</li>
<li>The website will display the token’s price and the currency used for the exchange – example ‘bridge’ currencies include ETH and BNB</li>
<li>A wallet address will be provided by the project&#8217;s team, to which investors must send funds to acquire tokens</li>
<li>The investor will then send their investment amount to the wallet address before providing their own wallet address to receive their ICO tokens post-purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>As the process above highlights, all that’s required to participate in an ICO is a crypto wallet and some digital currency holdings to make the exchange. However, this does mean prospective investors must own some crypto ahead of the ICO.</p>
<h2><strong>ICO, STO, IEO, IDO &#8211; What&#8217;s the Difference?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While traditional methods like bank loans and venture capital investments have long been the go-to choices, the rise of cryptocurrencies has introduced a new alternative in the form of token sales. Increasingly, companies are turning to token sales as a means to raise funds by creating cryptocurrencies and offering them to the public in exchange for major crypto or fiat currencies. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317430/screen-shot-2023-07-03-at.jpg" alt="ICO market statistics" /></figure>
<p>All token offerings are an investment in some form of digital currency, typically based on the Ethereum network. These are known as ERC-20 tokens. But the initial type of token fundraising, the ICO has now evolved into many subcategories and variants.The 4 main types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ICOs</strong> &#8211; Comparable to an IPO but with digital tokens. </li>
<li><strong>IEOs</strong> &#8211; Similar to the ICO but taking place on a centralized exchange for added liquidity and legitimacy. </li>
<li><strong>STOs</strong> &#8211; A regulated variant of the ICO that is in full compliance with existing legal frameworks</li>
<li><strong>IDOs</strong> &#8211; A decentralized and unregulated token offering mechanism with fewer safeguards and more risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each framework has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on what the classes of investors are looking for. </p>
<p>However, remember that the lines have blurred somewhat and the terms can be used in different contexts. Binance, for example, is a centralized exchange that offers a decentralized launchpad (<a href="https://www.bscpad.com/"><u>BSCpad</u></a>) for investment. This is an IDO on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It’s also common to hear that an ICO is launching on Binance, though this would technically be an IEO.     </p>
<h3><strong>ICOs</strong></h3>
<p>As touched upon earlier, the ICO represents the basic framework for cryptocurrency fundraising. ICOs started to take place in 2014, after Bitcoin had a noticeable upsurge in price around 2013. The <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/bitcoin+price+2013"><u>price of BTC was up 5,400% by the end of 2013</u></a>, prompting increased interest in tokens (Bitcoin itself had no ICO). Partially due to this, early stage cryptos like Monero, Litecoin, and Ethereum started to engage in ICOs around 2014.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317455/screen-shot-2023-07-03-at.jpg" alt="Biggest ICOs graph" /></figure>
<p>By 2017, unfortunately, the model was to be taken advantage of with a number of scam projects taking place, resulting in a regulatory crackdown. To this day, legal uncertainty still exists about the legal definition of a cryptocurrency, and how they should be taxed and regulated. Investors still have to learn how to stay safe when engaging in ICOs. </p>
<p>To mitigate <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-are-the-risks-in-an-ico.htm">ICO risks</a>, it is essential for potential ICO participants to conduct thorough due diligence. This includes researching the project team, reviewing the whitepaper, assessing the project&#8217;s roadmap and milestones, and evaluating the market demand for the proposed product or service. Investors should also consider the reputation of the project&#8217;s advisors, the transparency of communication, and the compliance of the project with relevant regulations.</p>
<p>Be aware of how scam artists use psychological tactics to entice investors &#8211; “get in before it&#8217;s too late” or “price could rise to 10x”  claims are to be treated with extreme skepticism. Ensure that you know who the founders are and check their history and social profiles.</p>
<p>Scam operations always leave telltale signs, usually on the official website and the whitepaper. People overlook these signs due to FOMO &#8211; “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-of-fomo-essay-11587426413"><u>Fear of Missing Out</u></a>”. They are too eager to make significant returns as opposed to completing their due diligence. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10438599.2021.1982712"><u>One study on 503 ICOs across 60 countries</u></a> found that an increased number of advisors and insider retention correlated with positive returns &#8211;  so making sure that the founders intend to stay with the project is essential to long term success. The friendliness of the legal system in the country also contributes to how much funds are raised in an ICO. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a traditional ICO, there is typically no third party that is offering any form of KYC audit or checks. The founders act as the marketers, auditors, and promoters &#8211; a recipe that leads to disaster, because there are few safeguards for investors and few penalties for fraudsters. </p>
<h3><strong>IEOs</strong></h3>
<p>IEOs, or Initial Exchange Offerings, involve a centralized cryptocurrency exchange facilitating token sales for new projects. In contrast to ICOs, IEOs are conducted through exchanges, allowing projects to leverage the exchange&#8217;s customer base and quickly enable trading for their tokens. Advantages of IEOs include enhanced trust due to the exchange&#8217;s due diligence on listings and immediate token liquidity. </p>
<p>A project that launches on a centralized exchange like Binance is typically safer than a decentralized exchange like Pancakeswap. Binance has to deal with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101"><u>increased regulatory pressure from centralized authorities</u></a> and likes to list higher-quality projects that adhere to KYC requirements. Otherwise, it would face criticism for listing low-quality tokens. </p>
<p>With the IEO, the project pays a listing fee to a centralized exchange. In return, the exchange will take on the responsibility of marketing and promoting the upcoming listing. So it makes sense to list on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trade volume, which tends to have the most power, features, and influence. New tokens on <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-effect-means-41-price-173526978.html"><u>Binance can appreciate by 41% shortly after listing</u></a> &#8211; a feature known as the “Binance Effect”. Projects that recently launched through Binance IEOs include Open Campus, Space ID, and Hooked Protocol, <a href="https://coincodex.com/ieo-list/binance/"><u>all with a 1000%+ increase at the time of this writing.</u></a><br /> </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317431/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at.jpg" alt="Binance token launch platform" /></figure>
<p>However, there are many decentralized platforms that <i>do</i> engage in KYC procedures. <a href="https://synapse.network/"><u>Synapse Network has a 2% acceptance rate</u></a> for projects, with $15 million raised with 37 participating projects. <a href="https://polkastarter.com/"><u>PolkaStarter</u></a>, meanwhile, allows anti-spam verification and KYC integration, with $49 million raised for over 111 initiatives. Top projects listed on Polkastarter include Galaxy Fight Club, OkLetsPlay, Humans, Wonderman Nation, and Nitro. </p>
<h3><strong>STOs</strong></h3>
<p>STOs, or Security Token Offerings, have emerged as a regulated alternative to ICOs. While ICOs lack regulation and have faced crackdowns due to scams and manipulation, STOs seek to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) requirements and securities laws. Security tokens issued through STOs represent tradable financial assets with the potential for profit. They offer benefits such as intrinsic value for tokens, reduced investor concerns about fraud due to regulatory oversight, and improved liquidity through the tokenization of various assets. </p>
<p><a href="https://securitize.io/"><u>Securitize</u></a> is an exceptional platform for Security Token Offerings (STOs), offering a comprehensive solution for individuals and companies seeking to create security tokens. The platform provides a highly flexible and efficient backend that assists users throughout the securities issuance process.</p>
<p><br /><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317433/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at.jpg" alt="Securitize crypto platform" /></p>
<p>A notable feature of Securitize is its capability to integrate third-party applications operating on the Ethereum network. Furthermore, the Digital Securities (DS) Protocol developed by Securitize offers a seamless and compliant integration solution for issuers, investors, and exchanges, covering the entire lifecycle of digital securities, including issuance, trading, distribution, and governance.</p>
<p>The platform has established itself as a leading global security token issuance platform, with support from more than 10 investors, including reputable names like Morgan Stanley, Blockchain Capital, and Tezos. Other notable STO launchpads include <a href="https://www.tokensoft.io/"><u>TokenSoft</u></a> and <a href="https://securrency.com/"><u>Securrency</u></a>. All allow for fully compliant securities token offerings. </p>
<h3><strong>IDO</strong></h3>
<p>IDO, or Initial DEX Offering, represents a newer financing model that combines aspects of ICOs and IEOs. IDOs issue tokens through decentralized exchanges, with pricing occurring after the tokens have been circulated. One benefit of IDOs is that pre-mines are avoided. This is a means through which the founders benefited at the expense of the wider community. But IDOs do not always enforce KYC requirements and few safeguards are in place for investors. </p>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-dao-maker"><u>Ethereums DaoMaker</u></a> is a prime example of an IDO launchpad. It was one of the very first platforms to allow access to IDO offerings and pioneer new types of token sale formats &#8211; such as the Dynamic Coin Offering (DYCO) and the Strong Holder Offering (SHO). This changed the way that investors gained access to tokens. It has held SHOs for many successful tokens &#8211; My Neighbour Alice, Lossless Protocol, Orion Money, etc.  <br /><br /><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317436/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at.jpg" alt="IDOs comparison table" /></p>
<p>BSCpad is Binance’s decentralized launchpad for Binance Smart Chain. Many are unaware that while the Binance exchange is centralized, <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en/blog/a-journey-to-decentralization-validators-delegators/"><u>the Binance Smart Chain/BNB Chain is decentralized</u></a>. Notable launches on BSCpad include Revomon, Medabots, GameZone, and AstroSwap.</p>
<p>PancakeSwap (CAKE) is an IDO platform and DEX that does not enforce special registration or KYC procedures. This is a huge IDO platform with over 1.6 million users. Famous IDOs that launched here include FC Porto, KALM, YieldWatch, and Horizon Protocol.</p>
<p>If you want to look into Web3 trading pairs on decentralized exchanges, then <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pool-explorer"><u>DEXTools.io</u></a> is a terrific resource. You can analyze trading pairs cross chain and pairs are ranked with a unique score. It also lists live new pairs including token price and liquidity &#8211;  you can keep tabs on your favorite pairs over time, to spot market insights.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Find the Best New ICO Cryptos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Finding the best crypto ICOs can be challenging – especially given how saturated the crypto market is. Websites such as <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/new/">CoinMarketCap</a>, Twitter, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency">Reddit/CryptoCurrency</a>, CoinList and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/new-cryptocurrencies">CoinGecko</a> are great for helping you find new projects &#8211; but it is vitally important you conduct thorough and detailed research in all projects before deciding to invest in them.</p>
<p>Strong indicators you are in good hands include a doxxed and public development team (although meme projects often have anonymous developers), a clear roadmap and whitepaper, and strong social media following &#8211; although check post engagement and beware of bots and spam accounts boosting numbers.</p>
<p>The strategies below can help separate the high-potential ICOs from those that are likely to fall by the wayside:</p>
<h3><strong>Review the Project’s Whitepaper and Roadmap</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most important things to do when considering an ICO investment is to review the project’s whitepaper and roadmap. These elements help inform whether the project will have longevity or not, which is a crucial factor in an ICO&#8217;s success. It’s also wise to ensure the whitepaper is grammatically correct and has no obvious spelling errors, which tend to be a hallmark of a hastily formulated project.</p>
<p>The best ICOs tend to have detailed whitepapers that clearly explain what the project looks to accomplish and how it plans to do so. The best projects set out to utilize blockchain technology to offer a solution to a real-world issue, although some &#8211; especially meme coins &#8211; deliver returns simply by capturing the current zeitgeist and gaining momentum. </p>
<p>The white paper should contain a detailed tokenomics section. This is a section detailing how tokens are to be distributed and at what price. It will clearly outline where the funds are going, how much is allocated to the founders, early stage investors, the public, etc. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317437/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at.jpg" alt="Cardano coins allocation" /></figure>
<p>This is very useful information because if one group has too many tokens, it could exert undue influence. You can also review any data in relation to staking, if applicable. Staking allows investors to reinvest their returns and can go up to 15% (<a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/polkadot/"><u>in the case of Polkadot</u></a>). This can be likened to <a href="https://www.dividend.com/dividend-investing-101/dividend-reinvestment-plans-drips/"><u>dividend reinvesting</u></a> in classical finance, which is a great way to build long term wealth. </p>
<h3><strong>Use Social Media</strong></h3>
<p>Another helpful tactic to find the best crypto ICOs is to use social media. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit have become valuable resources for crypto investors since they can offer real-time insight into a project&#8217;s progress. With marketing playing a massive role in an ICO&#8217;s success, most development teams will emphasize social media to foster strong community backing. </p>
<p>Reddit is a particularly useful resource when it comes to ICO investment. There is a subreddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptocurrencyICO/"><u>/r/CryptocurrencyICO/</u></a> that is just dedicated to ICOs. These Reddits can provide additional context for your investment, offering views and perspectives that may not be available directly from the official website or whitepaper. Reddit is particularly useful for meme tokens like Doge (2.4 Million subscribers) and Shiba Inu (400,000 subscribers), and massive movements can grow on Reddit to support cryptocurrency projects. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317448/screen-shot-2023-07-12-at.jpg" alt="Reddit crypto presale page" /></figure>
<p>For ICO updates, you will want to join Discord. Discord is often where giveaways and new info takes place, alongside Telegram. Popular Discord groups for ICO investment include Jacob Crypto Bury (best overall), <a href="https://discord.com/invite/cryptohub">Crypto Hub</a> (good for beginners), and Satoshi’s Insights (great for analytical insights). Large communities are built on these messaging platforms with regular updates, promotions, and announcements. This is especially true for ICOs and new projects that are just getting started.  </p>
<p>Twitter is useful for breaking news. Influential figures like Justin Sun (Tron) Changpeng Zhao (Binance), and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/sam-bankman-fried-crypto-twitter-posting/672191/"><u>Sam Bankman Fried (formerly of FTX)</u></a> will often make tweets about events that have just happened. In many instances, you can get breaking news on Twitter, right from the hands of the company founder. While new projects will often have a Twitter account, it becomes more prevalent as Web3 projects grow in size. </p>
<p>Youtube is another excellent resource. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JacobCryptoBury"><u>JacobCryptoBury</u></a> delves deeply into ICO listings and gives additional insights and perspectives. It’s useful to gain these additional insights from a group or from a seasoned professional, and this can shorten the learning curve in many ways. </p>
<p>Other useful Youtube resources include Ivan on Tech (250k subscribers) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjemQfjaXAzA-95RKoy9n_g"><u>BitBoy Crypto</u></a> (1.45m subscribers). Each channel covers a different angle. Ivan on Tech is useful because he brings on different professionals in the industry for additional perspectives. BitBoy crypto focuses on making money quickly, and it covers the latest news and updates in the industry. </p>
<h3><strong>Make Use of an ICO Calendar</strong></h3>
<p>ICO Calendars are a great way to find upcoming ICOs. Typically, you can first view the industry, start and finish date, blockchain, and how much the ICO is expected to raise in their campaign. You can then drill into the ICO for further information.</p>
<p>Popular sites for upcoming and newly launched ICOs include <a href="https://icodrops.com/"><u>ICO Drops</u></a> and <a href="https://coincodex.com/ico-calendar/"><u>CoinCodex’s ICO Calendar</u></a>.  </p>
<p>The benefit of these calendars is that you can filter them to suit your preferences. You can filter for upcoming or ongoing presales or the type of blockchain (BTC, Ethereum, Solana, etc). This allows you to become more granular in your search. You might want to pre-register for projects so you get the very earliest stage, with the lowest price. Given the variance between start and end prices, this is an excellent advantage from an investors standpoint. </p>
<p>An ICO calendar easily streamlines your research. You can pick a number of upcoming or ongoing ICOs that match your search criteria, and invest amounts in them as they come up. If you schedule your investments you are less likely to engage in impulsive spending on the next hype-laden ICO. </p>
<h3><strong>Look At The Liquidity</strong></h3>
<p>Aside from completing due diligence, one of the most overlooked aspects of ICO investment for newcomers is understanding token liquidity. It‘s possible to purchase a token while remaining completely unaware that you might not be able to sell it for a lockup/vesting period. This means you will be stuck with your tokens if you want to sell after a defined period. These vesting periods are enforced to prevent speculation and ensure the long term growth of the ecosystem. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.web3informer.com/web3-basics-understanding-crypto-vesting/"><u>vesting period</u></a> is a time when tokens are locked, until specific conditions have been met (token generation events, centralized exchange listing, etc). A certain amount of tokens will be released at set intervals. This encourages price stability and serves as an incentive for investors. It further helps to maintain the integrity of the project. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A prime benefit is to align employees and early investors with the long-term success of the project. For example, a management team might receive 20% of tokens after the first year (the “cliff” period), with the remaining 80% released on a monthly basis over 4 years or so. </p>
<p>Even if you do have the token to sell, there might not be a market for it. Tokens that list on decentralized exchanges as opposed to centralized exchanges will often be far less liquid. So it’s important to investigate the vesting period for an upcoming ICO/IDO and to ensure that the token will be liquid enough for sale. Projects that launch through an exchange (IEO) will often have much-improved liquidity, especially if it&#8217;s a large exchange such as Binance. </p>
<h3><strong>Get Involved in Web3 </strong></h3>
<p>The quickest way to understand ICO offerings is to take part in one of them. You can invest for as little as $20 in many instances. With $100, you could potentially invest in five ICOs and monitor the performance of each of them. This could be a much sounder investment decision rather than placing substantial amounts of capital into a new project that is going “to the moon” &#8211; at least according to the project founders. <br /> </p>

<p>Alternatively, you could take a full or part time position with a Web3 startup that is involved with token offerings. Smart contract developers are in demand &#8211; <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/blog/web3-developer-report-q3-2022"><u>117,000 Ethereum smart contracts were deployed in 2022</u></a>, while there were only 205,000 deployed from 2015 to 2021. And smart contract development is not tied to crypto prices, meaning you may not run out of a job just because Bitcoin decided to take a nosedive. </p>
<p>Other roles include content creators, marketers, network engineers, SEO specialists, consultants, lawyers, and more. In this manner, you can see how a company goes about creating an ICO first hand, and this is the best way to gain direct knowledge of the process. Hopefully, you can see how a high quality ICO project works in practice &#8211; you might even get the chance to invest early. </p>
<h2><strong>Risks of ICO Investments</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>ICOs are inherently risky. The main reasons include a lack of regulatory oversight, unrealistic expectations on behalf of the investors, and volatility/market manipulation. </p>
<h3><strong>Lack of Regulatory Oversight</strong></h3>
<p>One of the primary risks associated with ICOs is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/cryptocurrencies-sec-needs-to-set-regulations-for-icos.html"><u>lack of regulatory oversight</u></a>. Unlike traditional fundraising methods such as IPOs, ICOs do not typically adhere to the same stringent regulations and requirements. This lack of regulation leaves investors vulnerable to potential scams, fraud, and market manipulation. </p>
<p>Without proper oversight, there is a higher probability of encountering fraudulent projects or individuals who may misrepresent their intentions, inflate token values, or disappear with funds. This is often done through rug pulls or pump and dump schemes.  </p>
<p>With a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-rug-pull"><u>rug pull</u></a>, the creators of a cryptocurrency will intentionally drain the liquidity or value of a token, leaving investors with worthless tokens. The project team can remove liquidity from exchanges or even code the tokens so they are unsellable. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/pump-and-dump-schemes/"><u>Pump and Dump schemes</u></a> involve the manipulation of a token (often upward) through promotional content or direct market manipulation. When the price appreciates, the fraudsters sell their tokens. Scam ICOs are more correctly described as rug pulls, where the core team intends to take off with investors&#8217; funds. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317457/screen-shot-2023-07-06-at.jpg" alt="Listed tokens market cap" /></figure>
<p>The lack of regulatory oversight is primarily what attracted scam artists to the ICO in the first place. You have many investors eager to get in on Web3, where huge profits could be made. And you have a fundraising model that does not enforce any KYC compliance procedures.</p>
<p>This was made easier because the cryptocurrency markets were themselves not regulated &#8211; it was easy for traders to manipulate the price of a token, and get away with it. It is only recently that we have seen regulation enter cryptocurrency, and this still applies largely to centralized high volume exchanges as opposed to small-scale DEX exchanges. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/here-are-the-warning-signs-of-a-fraudulent-ico/"><u>A scam ICO</u></a> can also hide its fundraising progress, preventing investors from observing how much has been raised and how much time is left. Often, this is conducted alongside claims to “get in quick” before the time runs out. Ultimately, if you detect any lack of transparency in the ICO, follow up to see if it&#8217;s legitimate. </p>
<h3><strong>Unrealistic Expectations (Leading to Severe Losses)</strong></h3>
<p>Another risk lies in the quality and viability of the projects themselves with claims that are misleading or not based on factual information. Many ICOs are launched based on whitepapers or concepts without a working product or proven track record.</p>
<p>Investors often contribute funds based on promises and speculation, without concrete evidence of the project&#8217;s feasibility or potential for success. People often forget that they are literally investing in a piece of paper, a theoretical blueprint &#8211; in many cases, that is exactly what they were doing. The product has not actually been launched with a live audience. </p>
<p>As a result, there is a significant risk of investing in projects that fail to deliver on their promises or never materialize at all, resulting in financial losses for participants. Moreover, there is a risk of poor token distribution and governance. </p>
<p>In some cases, ICO projects allocate a significant portion of tokens to the development team or founders, leading to a concentration of power and potential conflicts of interest. If not properly managed, this could result in decisions that do not align with the best interests of token holders, further diminishing the value of investments.</p>
<p>Many projects have emerged making unsubstantiated claims that are designed to hook investors. There have been multiple “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/10/the-top-ethereum-killers-compared/"><u>Ethereum killers</u></a>”, but Ethereum has not been killed, and probably won’t be. Just because a project has an interesting whitepaper and concept does not mean it’s going to be a success or hit any of its claims. </p>
<h3><strong>Volatility &amp; Market Manipulation</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, the volatility of the cryptocurrency market poses an additional risk for ICO investors. The value of cryptocurrencies can experience significant price fluctuations, and this volatility extends to ICO tokens as well. <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27577/cryptocurrency-volatility-dmo/"><u>Bitcoin is the most stable of all cryptocurrencies</u></a> mainly due to its high trade volume. And it experienced large levels of volatility. So it stands to reason that lower volume ICO tokens are also going to experience even higher levels.  <br /> </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317440/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency volatility in 2021" /></figure>
<p>Large volume cryptocurrencies are more difficult to move because they take higher positions to manipulate the price. If the market capitalization of a token is $500 million, you would need very large sums to move the price. But if the market capitalization of a token is just $1 million, the amount required is relatively small, for some people and institutions. </p>
<p>Moreover, traditional financial markets have always been heavily regulated, with many safeguards in place against bad actors who seek to manipulate the price. Regulation within the crypto industry is not as strong, and it was almost non-existent in 2017, the days when the ICO was particularly popular.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Invest In An ICO</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investing in an ICO token is quite straightforward. By and large, tokens are a lot easier to invest in than other financial instruments. But you still need to get familiar with the process so you can keep your funds securely stored. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Choose Your ICO</strong></h3>
<p>We have already been over this step, but just to reiterate &#8211; you need to find a legitimate ICO that has a strong chance of success. Check an ICO calendar to see which ones match your preferences. <br /> </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317443/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at.jpg" alt="ICO drops website" /><br /> </p>
<p>Once you have decided on a suitable ICO, you can visit the page to see which type of tokens you need to invest in the project. You will want to buy a crypto that is accepted/required by the ICO. USDT and ETH are commonly accepted. If it’s a Binance-supported ICO, you might need BUSD or BNB.  </p>
<p>The official page should also tell you key information about the project (theme, industry, token price, vesting period, etc). This is key information needed to decide whether it&#8217;s worth the investment or not. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Buy Your Crypto on eToro</strong></h3>
<p>Investing in an ICO is relatively straightforward. First, you are going to need to acquire crypto funds, most likely either ETH or an acceptable stablecoin such as USDT, USDC, BUSD, etc. You can check what tokens the ICO accepts on its official presale page. Depending on the ICO, you might have to join an exchange to take part (this would technically be an IEO, but the terms are often used interchangeably). </p>
<p>We recommend eToro when it comes to buying your crypto. It comes with low fees (1% on all crypto transactions), world class copy trading features, and full KYC and regulatory compliance.  You can easily purchase any of the major cryptos on this site &#8211; It has over 90 cryptos to choose from. <br /> </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317444/screen-shot-2023-07-06-at.jpg" alt="eToro global markets explorer" /><br /> </p>
<p>You can buy your crypto on eToro and store it there too &#8211; it’s a highly regulated international brokerage. The eToro money crypto wallet is easy to use and actually has an unlosable private key, a distinct advantage over Web3 wallets. It can be accessed using your eToro credentials.  </p>
<p>But eToro does not connect to Web3 interfaces &#8211; you need a Web3 wallet for this to happen. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Send to a Web3 Wallet &amp; Make Purchase</strong></h3>
<p>Once you have purchased your crypto on eToro, you will need to send it to a Web3 wallet &#8211; <a href="https://metamask.io/"><u>MetaMask</u></a> and Wallet Connect are two of the most popular options. Both allow you to access the world of Web3 tokens. Simply go to the MetaMask download page and set up your accounting, remembering to store your private keys securely. <br /> </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86805/317447/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet app" /></figure>
<p>MetaMask, for example, functions as a browser extension that connects to Web3 sites. When you go to the presale/ICO page, your MetaMask wallet will connect to the site (or your Wallet Connect). You can purchase the ICO tokens using a coin in your MetaMask wallet. Simply go to the official ICO page, connect your MetaMask wallet, and make the purchase. It should take less than a minute to execute the transaction. </p>
<p>Ongoing presales like Bitcoin ETF Token or Bitcoin Minetrix are very easy to invest in, with clear instructions on each of their official listing pages. You can invest in these projects to better understand the world of ICOs, and to get started with crypto investment. While the results of any investment are never guaranteed, you also have to stake a certain amount to get real experience. </p>
<p>Note that the exact means of ICO investment might vary depending on your preferences and on the requirements of the ICO. There might also be differences between the project launchpads, fundraising type (IDOs, ICOs, IEO), minimum requirements, and a number of other criteria that you can only find out by looking at the official page and completing your own research. </p>
<h2><strong>Are ICOs a Good Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although ICOs are undoubtedly a widespread phenomenon within the crypto market, can they be considered a good investment? There are definite reasons why they can be a noteworthy investment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Become Part of a Growing Community &#8211; </strong>Taking part in an ICO allows investors to become part of a growing community at the very beginning of the project’s life cycle. This has the added benefit of enabling like-minded people to interact with each other and form relationships whilst also providing feedback to the project’s development team.</li>
<li><strong>Huge Returns Potential</strong> &#8211; Naturally, one of the main benefits of investing in an ICO is the vast returns potential that they can offer. Since most ICOs offer tokens at a reduced price point, early investors are in a great position to benefit if/when the token is listed on a major exchange. Projects offer discounted prices to kick-start development or generate publicity and attention &#8211; which then means more investment and a higher probability of success.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive Perks</strong> &#8211; Many ICO cryptos will offer exclusive benefits to entice early investors. The specific benefits can vary wildly but may include premium NFTs or access to merchandise. There may even be private Discord servers that only ICO investors can join, providing an incentive to participate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, it is essential to note that ICOs do not guarantee profits even if the fundamentals of the project are solid and the potential is high &#8211; ultimately the market will decide success or failure.</p>
<p>It is also important for investors to understand their own tolerance for risk as ICOs are substantially more risky and volatile than investing in established top cryptos such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto ICOs – Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In summary, this article has taken an in-depth look at the best crypto ICOs to launch in 2023, covering what they offer and why they have generated such high momentum. Thanks to the innovative use cases displayed by these projects, investors remain eager to see how well they can perform in the weeks and months ahead. </p>
<p>Investors will do well to remember that risk should be given equal weight to the potential rewards. This can help to avoid many of the ICO projects that turn out to have no long term viability. Returns are not guaranteed, especially when it comes to the volatile cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<p>One of the best crypto ICOs right now is Bitcoin ETF Token. This cryptocurrency speculates on the upcoming launch of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. The cryptocurrency will conduct 5 token burning events &#8211; reducing its total supply by 25%. $BTCETF can be staked to earn high annual yields. The token is priced at $0.005 during the first ICO stage. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<h3><strong>How does an ICO in cryptocurrency work?</strong></h3>
<p>When an upcoming ICO is announced, early investors will have the opportunity to buy tokens using a ‘bridge’ cryptocurrency – such as ETH or BNB. The project’s team will provide a crypto wallet address to send funds to in return for tokens, with the token price being either fixed or variable, depending on demand.</p>
<h3><strong>Is investing in ICO crypto a good idea?</strong></h3>
<p>Investing in upcoming ICOs is inherently risky since projects are still in the early stages of their lifespan, so nobody knows for certain whether they will be successful. However, investors with a higher risk appetite can often generate considerable returns when an ICO crypto is listed on a major exchange since they will have been able to acquire tokens at a discounted price.</p>
<h3><strong>How do I buy crypto ICO?</strong></h3>
<p>Participating in an ICO is as simple as heading to the project’s official website and connecting a crypto wallet. Following this, investors will be able to buy tokens using a bridge currency (e.g. ETH, BNB), after which the project’s team will send the relevant number of tokens to the investor’s wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Was Ethereum an ICO crypto?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes – Ethereum started as an ICO in 2014, raising over 7,000,000 ETH (around $2.2 million) in the first 12 hours of tokens going live. By the end of Ethereum&#8217;s presale, the development team had raised a remarkable $18.3 million for the project.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the best crypto ICOs to buy in 2023?</strong></h3>
<p>Out of all the projects we&#8217;ve reviewed, Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix, Meme Kombat, and TG.Casino offer the most intrinsic value and upside potential.</p>

<h2>Reviewing the Best Bitcoin Wallets for Beginners</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/863917/number-crypto-coins-tokens/">Statista</a>, there were over 9,000 cryptocurrencies in existence in December 2023 – nearly double the number seen in February 2021, although it is estimated there could be many more given the vast numbers of new meme coins and projects sprouting up regularly.</p>
<p>This highlights the rapidly-growing nature of the crypto market, which has naturally increased the need for secure wallet options. So, without further ado, let’s dive in and take a closer look at the top cryptocurrency wallets for beginners:</p>
<h3>1. Best Wallet – Overall Best Crypto Wallet in 2023 With Multi-Chain Crypto Swaps and Built-In DEX</h3>
<p>Topping our list of the best crypto wallets in 2023 is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a>, which has only just launched but already shot to the top of our list because of its unique features.</p>
<p>This is a multi-chain crypto wallet designed to address some of the challenges present in many current wallet offerings – such as multiple wallets required for various blockchains, lack of crypto news within the wallet, network bridges and NFT marketplaces.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/333477/best-wallet-1.jpg" alt="Best Wallet crypto app" /></figure>
<p>To address this, the creators of Best Wallet have created a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem that covers every aspect of digital asset management.</p>
<p>The non-custodial software wallet, available as a mobile app,  allows users to interact with coins, tokens and NFTs from multiple chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB. This ensures users aren&#8217;t confined to a single chain, allowing them to access limitless digital assets.</p>
<p>It also has several unique features that place it above other wallets &#8211; that includes market insights on trending and upcoming tokens, details on token airdrops, and even a built-in decentralized exchange to allow users to trade any token. Best Wallet is shaping up to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges.htm">best no-KYC crypto exchanges</a> on the market.</p>
<p>Acting as the backbone of the ecosystem is the $BEST token, which is the utility and governance token. Holders who stake $BEST tokens will receive benefits, including access to advanced analysis tools, swaps without fees, early token launch access and NFT drops.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/333478/best-wallet-3.jpg" alt="Best wallet portfolio management feature" /></figure>
<p>The tokens are not yet available but regular users of the wallet are set to get a huge airdrop of tokens in the coming months &#8211; with a total of 10% of the supply will be distributed to active users.</p>
<p>All in all, Best Wallet aims to be more than just a crypto wallet, with the developers seeking to make it a comprehensive digital asset management solution for multiple blockchains.</p>

<h3>2. Coinbase Wallet – Beginner-Friendly Crypto Wallet with Biometric Verification</h3>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267115/coinbase.jpg" alt="Coinbase Wallet app" /></figure>
<p>Coinbase allows users to bolster the security level even more by enabling two-factor authentication and biometric verification. Aside from its security features, the wallet also excels since it essentially acts as a handheld crypto exchange. Users can instantly buy and sell coins/tokens using a credit/debit card and even withdraw funds to an external bank account.</p>
<p>Since the Coinbase wallet provides access to the decentralized web, users can also make the most of the universe of DeFi apps available to them. Several opportunities are available in this regard, such as using liquidity pools to generate a yield or even taking part in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</p>

<h3>3. YouHodler &#8211; An Excellent Crypto Wallet With Up To 15% APY on Popular Cryptocurrencies, Crypto Loans and Trading</h3>

<p>Those who don&#8217;t want to trade can still earn yield on the tokens they hold. For example, Litecoin offers the highest annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 15%, while Solana has an APY of up to 13%, which is more than the 8% APY you can get by staking it on the Solana blockchain.</p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/youhodl-yield.jpg" alt="YouHodler crypto earn" /></figure>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334326/cloud-miner.jpg" alt="YouHodler BTC cloud mining feature" /></figure>

<h3>4. Ledger – One of the Best Crypto Hardware Wallets With High Security and Multi-Chain Functionality</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/%20">Ledger crypto wallet</a> is a hardware wallet widely considered one of the safest ways for investors to store their digital assets, whether that be cryptocurrencies or NFTs. This is because it uses &#8220;cold storage,&#8221; meaning users&#8217; private keys are kept offline and safe from threats.</p>
<p>Ledger comes with a mobile and desktop app called Ledger Live where you can monitor your crypto portfolio, regardless of which blockchain, you can buy crypto with fiat, stake your coins or exchange them. Each Ledger wallet supports over 5,500+ crypto assets.</p>
<p>The Ledger app also lets you connect with third-party services, such as 1inch DEX, MoonPay, Lido staking, YouHodler and more.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/334363/ledger-live.jpg" alt="Ledger Live apps" /></figure>
<p>To use the Ledger wallet, you need either the Ledger Nano X, Ledger Nano S Plus or the Ledger Stax. Nano X is particularly interesting since it doesn&#8217;t just boast USB functionality, but it can also connect to devices via Bluetooth. This means, you can safely execute transactions on your smartphone without connecting the Ledger wallet via cable.</p>
<p>Ledger even sells physical &#8220;chains&#8221; that allow crypto-savvy individuals to wear their Ledger wallet around their neck!</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267116/ledger.jpg" alt="Ledger hardware wallet devices" /></figure>

<h3><strong>5. Trezor – Security-Focused Hardware Wallet with Simple Functionality</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/">Trezor</a> is one of the most secure wallets in the whole market and for those looking for simple offline storage it is a go-to choice.</p>
<p>There are three Trezor wallets available: Model One, Trezor Safe 3, and the advanced Model T, which features a touch-screen that allows for two-factor authentication on the device itself.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/334365/trezor2.jpg" alt="Trezor hardware wallet devices" /></figure>
<p>Trezor&#8217;s added security also allows users to generate up to 16 recovery shares and store them in different places, meaning if one seed phrase is compromised then there are additional layers of protection.</p>
<p>It is also open source meaning its software is consistently reviewed and tested by third parties to keep its security transparent &#8211; main rival Ledger has closed-source firmware.</p>
<p>Trezor comes with its own desktop, mobile and browser app, called Trezor Suite. This lets you manage your coins by sending or receiving them, you can verify transactions or go incognito with Coinjoin. You can also directly purchase cryptocurrencies from within the app.</p>

<h3>6. OKX – User-Friendly Crypto Wallet with NFT Support &amp; DEX Aggregator</h3>
<p>Another hugely popular crypto wallet app suitable for beginners is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/">OKX</a> wallet. OKX describes its wallet as a &#8220;portal to Web3&#8221; since it contains various helpful features, including crypto asset storage, NFT support, and a decentralized exchange (DEX).</p>
<p>The great thing about the OKX wallet is its cross-chain support. At the time of writing, the wallet supports crypto assets from over 50 networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and OKTC. The OKX wallet’s interface is easy to navigate and doesn’t feature any complex jargon, making it suitable for beginners.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267110/okx-1.jpg" alt="OKX web3 wallet" /></figure>
<p>OKX’s wallet is also highly compatible with a range of devices. It can be downloaded for free on iOS and Android smartphones, although it’s also available on Windows and MacOS computers. The wallet’s features sync across all devices, so users can seamlessly transition from one to another.</p>
<p>This is also one of the top crypto wallets for those interested in NFT investing.

<p>Finally, the OKX wallet has a DEX and bridge aggregator that instantly lets users swap tokens across many top blockchains. Due to this and the features mentioned above, the OKX wallet is undoubtedly one of the best crypto wallets available right now.</p>

<h3>7. Binance – World’s Largest Exchange with Free Crypto Wallet App</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/">Binance</a> needs no introduction as it remains the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, facilitating daily trading volumes of over $6 billion. The exchange offers its own crypto wallet that links to the BNB Chain – Binance&#8217;s own blockchain network.</p>
<p>Unlike other top cryptocurrency wallets, the Binance wallet is structured as a browser extension, downloading on Google Chrome and other leading platforms. It&#8217;s free to download and use, enabling Binance users to store and manage their crypto holdings while interacting with other assets on the BNB Chain and Ethereum.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267112/binance.jpg" alt="Binance wallet mobile app" /></figure>
<p>Since the Binance wallet is inherently linked to the Binance exchange, users can instantly transfer their holdings from the latter to the former. The wallet supports over 380 cryptos and allows users to buy crypto instantly using a bank transfer or credit/debit card.</p>
<p>Those looking to explore the Binance ecosystem further can check out the exchange&#8217;s NFT marketplace and earnings protocols. Binance is also fantastic for active investors since it allows anyone to set up recurring buy orders to purchase specific assets at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Finally, the Binance crypto wallet enables users to send and receive crypto using QR codes instantly. This feature is essential for newcomers, as it mitigates the risk of using an incorrect wallet address and potentially losing funds forever.</p>

<h3>8. StrikeX Wallet &#8211; Investing Made Easy With a Simple, Secure, Multi Crypto DeFi Wallet</h3>
<p>Though not as well known as some of the other wallets on the market, <a href="https://tradestrike.io/strikex-wallet/"><u>StrikeX</u></a> could be quite the dark horse for those interested in security and ease of use. At the time of this writing, the StrikeX parent company (tradestrike.io) has an excellent <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/tradestrike.io"><u>4.8 star rating on Trustpilot</u></a>, and social reviews are often an accurate indicator of the quality of service. The StrikeX wallet app is available on both IOS and Android.</p>
<p>The simplicity of StrikeX is likely what has led to so many positive reviews. It has been built from the ground up to be easy to use, with clear instructions, an open interface, and excellent interoperability with other wallets. Users can build a wallet address list for easy transfer, so they don’t have to continually copy and paste long strings for repeat transactions.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/327034/screen-shot-2023-08-30-at.jpg" alt="StrikeX Wallet mobile app" /></figure>
<p>It’s also possible to buy crypto through the wallet with a credit or debit card. A cross-chain swap allows users to swap 15,000+ cryptocurrencies across twelve blockchains, and an in-app QR code allows for easy connection with Web3 websites and applications.</p>
<p>What StrikeX does really well is that it is simple and easy to use, but builds on this with advanced functions in a way that does not overwhelm new users. It allows users to track portfolio performance across multiple wallets with visual charting, and also provides an overall market overview.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/327035/screen-shot-2023-08-30-at.jpg" alt="StrikeX mobile app" /></figure>
<p>There are very few downsides associated with this simple yet powerful crypto wallet, and we were very impressed with the address list, a simple technique that few providers have adopted, but which greatly increases the convenience of the application, giving it a more familiar feel. It’s also a pure DeFi wallet &#8211; no personal identification is required to use it.</p>
<p>There are not many downsides with this wallet &#8211; but it only supports Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum &amp; Solana at the present time. Other than this, it is an ideal wallet for beginners who want to anonymously and securely send and receive their Web3 assets.</p>

<p>Kraken is a US-based crypto exchange that is rated as one of the most trustworthy in the market due to its reserve audit, large customer base and high liquidity.</p>
<p>The exchange offers almost 250 cryptos and has just celebrated 10 years in the market, having launched in September 2013 and is one of the best exchanges for advanced traders.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/332151/kraken.jpg" alt="Kraken mobile app" /></figure>
<p>Kraken is one of the most appealing centralized exchanges for advanced traders as it offers extremely competitive fees when trading Bitcoin, for example, and has a highly functional dedicated mobile app.</p>
<p>While instant buying of Bitcoin costs 1.5% and fees for beginners are about average, Kraken Pro users can take advantage of a maker-taker fee model, which ranges from just 0.00% to 0.26% depending on how often a user trades over a 30-day period.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say it is not a good choice for beginners, however, with Kraken having excellent security and storage for a hot wallet &#8211; with claims it holds 95% of its deposits offline, with enough in reserve so people can withdraw at will.</p>
<p>One downside over other exchanges is that Kraken offers no staking rewards for US customers, having had to previously pay a $30 million settlement to the SEC.</p>

<h2>Crypto Wallets Explained</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Now that we’ve identified the best crypto wallets for beginners, let’s take a closer look at what these wallets are. In simple terms, cryptocurrency wallets are software programs or hardware devices that allow users to store, manage, and transfer popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.</p>
<p>These wallets act as the holder&#8217;s &#8220;portal&#8221; to the crypto market, making it easy to hold crypto assets safely over the long term. Various types of wallets are on offer, such as &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets, which offer varying degrees of safety and functionality.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll explore these wallet types in more detail later, but it&#8217;s important to note that all wallets have a &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;private&#8221; key. These keys are essential since they prove asset ownership and enable wallet holders to send/receive funds.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/crypto-wallets-explained.jpg" alt="Ledger device among crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/">TripleA</a>, it’s estimated that over 420 million people worldwide own crypto. Most of these people are based in Asia and North America, although this figure is growing every month. Due to this vast customer base, the importance of using crypto wallets is more significant than ever – especially since the market is still relatively unregulated compared to &#8220;traditional&#8221; asset classes and hackers and scammers are extremely active.</p>
<p>Ultimately, crypto wallets act as a way to store crypto safely without keeping it on an exchange or brokerage account, giving an individual more power over their holdings.  Although there are various types of crypto wallets with specific features and security measures, all of them are designed to serve this purpose.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>How Do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Whether someone’s looking to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> or is more interested in well-established coins, it&#8217;s vital to understand how wallet storage works. Regardless of where the Bitcoin account is held, using a crypto wallet is critical for protecting crypto asset holdings from cyber attackers and other bad actors.</p>
<p>The simplest way of viewing crypto wallets is as a method for protecting an investor&#8217;s holdings, via access to their public and private keys. As noted above, these keys have essential use cases – but what do they do? Here&#8217;s a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Key</strong>: The public key can be considered the wallet&#8217;s &#8220;account number&#8221; and is used to receive funds from other individuals/businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Private Key</strong>: The private key is an alphanumeric code unique to each wallet and used to prove ownership of the crypto assets inside. In this sense, the private key is like a password – meaning it should never be shared with anyone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crypto wallets store and manage the private key – <i>not</i> the actual crypto assets. This is because the crypto assets are still held on the blockchain, meaning the private key simply provides <i>access</i> to them.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets are so important because they use advanced cryptographic techniques to protect the user&#8217;s private key, essentially a password. Different wallets have different approaches, but they can range from DDoS protection to biometric verification – and even 3D face scans.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/how-do-they-work.jpg" alt="eToro Money crypto wallet" /></figure>
<p>The best crypto wallets usually offer backup and recovery options that ensure users can’t lose access to their crypto. In the past, if a user lost their private key, their crypto assets could never be re-accessed. Nowadays, many wallet providers have recovery seed phrases and other features that can restore access, although it is important individuals also take great care not to share or lose those.</p>
<p>Whether a user opts for a crypto hardware wallet or a software wallet, partnering with a well-respected provider is essential. Moreover, it&#8217;s also vital that users follow security practices, like ensuring their private keys remain confidential and implementing a backup procedure.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Why Do You Need a Cryptocurrency Wallet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finding and using the best crypto wallet available is an integral part of the crypto-trading journey for beginners, especially if they plan to hold, trade or manage large sums of crypto. These wallets are essentially for safely storing, sending, and receiving digital currencies, making them like a &#8216;crypto bank account&#8217;.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve touched on earlier, traders need these crypto wallets since they keep the private key safe. The private key is the only way for someone to gain unauthorized access to the user&#8217;s funds – if this key is kept safe, the funds are inaccessible.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/why-do-you-need.jpg" alt="Crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-things-to-buy-with-bitcoin.htm">best things to buy with Bitcoin</a> can only be purchased by sending payment from a reputable wallet provider. Since crypto wallets make it easy to send crypto payments, they’re vital for buying goods/services online that are denominated in digital currencies.</p>
<p>Another critical feature of crypto wallets is that they allow users to have complete control over their crypto assets. Since cryptocurrencies are decentralized, they aren&#8217;t held by intermediaries like banks. Even holding on a centralized exchange comes with its own risk, as FTX customers previously found when the exchange collapsed leading to billions of dollars in investor losses, or if the exchange is hacked &#8211; like has been recently seen with Huobi Global, when $8 million was stolen in September 2023. Thus, having a self-custody crypto wallet will ensure that only the user &#8220;owns&#8221; the associated crypto assets.</p>
<p>Finally, crypto wallets are also important because they make it easy to access the crypto market. Most wallets allow users to instantly buy/sell crypto from within the wallet&#8217;s interface and many providers offer support for NFTs and DeFi protocols, significantly broadening the investment possibilities.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Types of Crypto Wallets &#8211; Hardware and Software, Hot and Cold, Paper</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Deciding to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-altcoins.htm">buy altcoins</a> or crypto tokens is a huge decision – yet choosing where to store them post-purchase is just as important.</p>
<p>We’ve already discussed what crypto wallets are, but there various types of wallets on offer with a litany of language that can leave beginners confused.</p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets (Hot Wallet)</strong></h3>
<p>Software wallets are the most popular type of storage solution for crypto assets, especially for beginners. These digital platforms allow users to store and manage cryptos in a user-friendly manner. The most important thing to note about these wallets is that they’re connected to the internet – which is in stark contrast to hardware wallets.</p>
<p>There are two main types of software wallets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile wallets</strong>: These are smartphone apps designed to provide on-the-go access to the user’s cryptos. Mobile wallets are often offered for free by many top exchanges, like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop wallets</strong>: These are applications that can be downloaded and installed on the user&#8217;s computer. Desktop wallets are slightly safer than mobile wallets since they store the user&#8217;s private key locally on the computer &#8211; MetaMask is one such is example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, these wallet types are considered &#8220;hot&#8221; since they&#8217;re connected to the internet. This makes them more susceptible to cyberattacks than &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets which have no connection to the internet.</p>
<h3>Hardware Wallets (Cold Wallet)</h3>
<p>Alternatively, crypto holders can store their assets in hardware wallets, which are also often referred to as cold wallets &#8211; think cold storage &#8211; as they are not connected to the internet until a user connects a physical device.</p>
<p>A Bitcoin hardware wallet is a physical device used to store the user&#8217;s private keys. These devices usually look like USB sticks and hold the private key offline – meaning hackers can&#8217;t access it.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/hardware-wallets.jpg" alt="Ledger Nano X device" /></figure>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-crypto-hardware-wallet">Kraken</a>, hardware wallets are one of the most effective ways for a user to protect their private key and are a must for investors or traders who are managing extremely large sums of crypto.</p>
<p>It is simply not safe to have huge holdings linked to the internet at all times.</p>
<p>However, these wallets must be connected to another device, such as a laptop or smartphone, to initiate transactions. So, although they have a much higher security level, hardware wallets aren&#8217;t as user-friendly as software wallets.</p>
<p>Another downside is that as they are physical devices they come with additional cost to purchase &#8211; Trezor&#8217;s latest Model T, for example, costs in excess of $200.</p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>The third wallet type is paper wallets. Unlike an online Bitcoin wallet, paper wallets are a type of “cold” storage that involves a user writing their public and private keys on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The user would then store this piece of paper somewhere safe where nobody else could access it &#8211; for example in a safe, safety deposit box or locker.</p>
<p>The downside to this approach is that those with paper wallets still eventually need to use a crypto wallet app to spend or transfer digital assets.</p>
<p>Thus, paper wallets are relatively impractical and considered less safe than the alternatives – hence why they aren’t widely used. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2>How to Find Safe Crypto Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finding the best Bitcoin wallet can be tricky – especially since so many options exist. However, we’ve identified three tactics that traders can employ to find safe crypto wallets effectively:</p>
<h3><strong>Use a Reputable Provider</strong></h3>
<p>The most important tactic to use is only choosing crypto wallets offered by reputable providers. It&#8217;s a good idea to read online reviews and check a potential provider&#8217;s track record before downloading the wallet that they offer. Many crypto wallet providers are even endorsed by high-profile individuals or businesses, which can boost credibility.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Many of the top providers listed in this guide have a long track record of success in the space and high security scores. However, even highly-trusted wallets can be susceptible to attacks &#8211; Atomic Wallet was one of the leading providers in the space before North Korean hacker group Lazarus stole more than $100 million of customer funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Consider the Wallet’s Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>When <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm">choosing a Bitcoin wallet</a>, it&#8217;s also essential to thoroughly research the wallet&#8217;s security features. We&#8217;ll explore this further in the next section, although it typically involves checking the type of encryption on offer and deciding whether to use a hot or a cold wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/consider-security-features.jpg" alt="eToro Money wallet features" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Test the Wallet Before Making Large Transfers</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, it may be best to test out a wallet with a small amount of crypto before fully committing. This minimizes the risk of catastrophic loss while allowing users to test the wallet&#8217;s functionality and security features. Assuming the wallet is up to the task, users can confidently transfer more significant amounts of crypto.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Much like when choosing between the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best AI crypto trading bots</a>, deciding which cryptocurrency wallet to use involves analyzing various factors and will also come down to user preference.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at six of the most important factors to consider:</p>
<h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>The single most important factor to review when choosing a crypto wallet is its security features. This includes the encryption technology it uses, how it manages the user&#8217;s private key and any backup options it has.</p>
<p>Many of the best Bitcoin wallets also offer two-factor authentication and biometric verification to enhance security further. There are even wallets that have multi-signature support, which means they have two private keys rather than one.</p>
<p>Cold wallets are automatically much safer than hot wallets &#8211; due to them not being connected to the internet, hackers cannot access those funds without having physical access to the hardware device.</p>
<h3><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Another important consideration is the type of wallet to use. This can be boiled down to using either one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-hot-wallets.htm">best hot wallets</a> or a cold wallet. As noted earlier, the former is connected to the internet, while the latter isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>A crypto hardware wallet is generally considered the safest way to store a trader&#8217;s private key. However, they can sometimes be impractical; if practicality is the primary concern, a software wallet may be more suitable.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Those trading crypto daily would likely prefer a hot wallet as they want fast and easy access to funds.</p>
<p>But users should always choose a cold wallet if they are holding large sums of crypto over an extended period of time, and only connect to the internet when they wish to make a specific transaction &#8211; buying, selling or transferring elsewhere &#8211; and then disconnect.</p>
<h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3>
<p>Navigating the market can be tricky for beginners, so user-friendliness is an important consideration. Users should review a wallet&#8217;s interface design and ease of setup, both of which are crucial for making the trading process accessible to beginners.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is whether the wallet comes with any help or support. Most prominent providers, like OKX, have dedicated help centers with answers to the most commonly-asked questions, which can be a blessing to newbie investors.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are not particularly difficult to use but add a another step compared to software wallets, with the likes of Trezor not having a mobile app on iOS also another thing to consider.</p>
<h3><strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the crypto market is now valued at over $1.08 trillion with tens of thousands of coins available.</p>
<p>Given the scale of the market, more new coins and tokens are springing up every week – so it’s a good idea to choose the best cryptocurrency wallet for asset selection.</p>
<p>Almost all crypto wallets will support the largest coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the top wallets also offer support for lesser-known tokens and stablecoins, which can be highly beneficial.</p>
<p>MetaMask is one of the best wallets for supported cryptos as it has multi-chain functionality and supports a massive range of tokens, as well as those new to the market.</p>
<h3><strong>Features &amp; Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>Users should also check out the wallet&#8217;s features and functionality. For example, if a user wishes to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-defi-coins.htm">best DeFi coins</a>, they should check whether the wallet provides access to the decentralized web.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/features-functionality.jpg" alt="NFT marketplace" /></figure>
<p>Many wallets also provide functionality for NFT storage alongside their crypto storage options. This can be a great benefit for investors interested in obtaining cryptos and NFTs to create a well-rounded portfolio of digital assets.</p>
<p>For NFTs specifically, investors who hold images from highly valuable collections should also consider placing them in cold storage and only connecting to the internet when carrying out a specific task such as selling.</p>
<h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, users should also consider the fees associated with using a crypto wallet. Most software wallets are free to download and use – the only fees to be aware of are network fees that occur during transfers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, those who choose to use a Bitcoin hardware wallet must be aware that these wallets have an up-front cost since they are physical devices.</p>
<p>The price of these devices can vary significantly, although it usually ranges between $50 and $300, depending on the provider and model.</p>
<h2>How to Get &amp; Use a Crypto Wallet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Before ending this guide on the best crypto wallets, let&#8217;s look at how to download and use one of these wallets. As noted earlier, our recommended crypto wallet app is offered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a>, which is free to download, simple to use, and available on iOS and Android devices.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 3 – Confirm Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>Once an email address has been put in, the app will ask if you would like to add two-factor authentication (2FA), which means it will send you a six-digit code when you log in for added security.</p>
<p>This skep can be stepped, although it is not possible to skip the next step which is inputting and confirming a four-digit password.</p>
<p>There is also the additional security feature of enabling fingerprint login which, if chosen, will allow users to skip putting in a password each time and just continue instantly.</p>

<p>Bitcoin remains the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, used by millions of people globally as a way to make payments or as an investment vehicle. Although Bitcoin has had a challenging time of late, its first-mover status means it&#8217;ll likely stay at the top of the pile for years to come. </p>
<p>This article presents our in-depth <strong>Bitcoin price prediction</strong>, diving into the coin&#8217;s price history and making several forecasts for the future. We&#8217;ll also explore where investors can buy Bitcoin today before highlighting an alternative project that could rival BTC in the coming years.</p>
<p>Bitcoin along with the rest of the crypto market, has recently reacted positively to news that a Bitcoin ETF could be approved in the near future. This pushed Bitcoin prices above $30,000 for the end of 2023 and, at the time of writing, Bitcoin was look like it was making a push for $40,000.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction Summary</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Do you find yourself asking <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment.htm">is Bitcoin a good investment?</a> Throughout this article, we&#8217;ll explore our BTC price prediction in detail, highlighting our price estimates for the coin over the coming years. For now though, presented below is a brief overview of these estimates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023: </strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-poised-hold-rates-steady-despite-economys-bullish-tone-2023-11-01/">The Federal Reserve in the US elected not to increase interest rate at their November meeting</a>, adding more fuel to the price increases for BTC, increases that can be traced back to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/23/bitcoin-rises-above-31k-with-options-positioning-suggesting-price-has-further-to-run/">ETF-conversation induced price increases from mid-October</a>. If this narrative is sustained through 2023, our Bitcoin price prediction sees the coin reach a valuation of <strong>$43,000</strong> by the end of 2023.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2024</strong>: With Bitcoin&#8217;s growing popularity, an approaching <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">Bitcoin Halving</a> and the lightning network advancement, the future looks bright for the coin. As more and more people adopt it, there&#8217;s potential for it to reach new heights in 2024, potentially even reaching a remarkable <strong>$62,000</strong> by the end of 2024.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025: </strong>Our analysis estimates that the BTC price could hit <strong>$83,000</strong> by the end of 2025, with spot Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption likely to have been introduced and the effect of the 2024 Bitcoin Halving expected to be felt in this year.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2030</strong>: The uptake of cryptocurrencies continues to surge, and merchants may soon start accepting Bitcoin as payment for goods and services. This could lead to even greater adoption, and if all goes well, Bitcoin could cross <strong>$150,000</strong> by 2030, breaking the $100,000 mark.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>History of the Price of Bitcoin</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>More people than ever are considering whether to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoins.htm">buy Bitcoin</a> in the hope of generating a solid return, which is becoming hard to do in today’s harsh economic environment. However, like most crypto-assets, Bitcoin was negatively affected by rising interest rates in 2023 and the prevailing ‘risk-off’ nature of investors in this environment has lead many to liquidate their holdings in search of ‘safer’ assets.</p>
<p>To explain the coin’s current situation, it&#8217;s best to look back at the Bitcoin price history. For those unaware, Bitcoin was created as a result of a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper authored by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto</a>. This paper, titled &#8216;Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System&#8217;, was published in October 2008, with BTC&#8217;s source code released a few months later.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88985/223515/history-1.jpg" alt="Bitcoin price prediction in USD" /></figure>
<p>The first BTC transaction occurred in January 2009, and in the years that followed, Bitcoin became increasingly popular amongst internet users that wished to remain anonymous. This anonymity was made possible through Bitcoin’s innovative use of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/blockchain/">blockchain technology</a>, which allowed network users to send and receive BTC without providing personal information.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin crypto price had its first &#8216;bull run&#8217; in late 2013, a year after the 2012 Bitcoin Halving event, and saw the Bitcoin price increase by almost 10,000% in just a few months. The next upwards surge didn&#8217;t occur until mid-2017, a year after the 2016 Halving event, when the price of Bitcoin rocketed by 1,694% in under 11 months. By December 2017, Bitcoin was trading around the $20,000 level.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88985/329309/btc-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="BTC to USD historic price chart" /></figure>
<p>After a few more years of peaks and troughs, Bitcoin really entered the limelight, as the coin’s price went on a huge bull run between March 2020 and April 2021, hitting highs of $59,890.02. After a temporary fall, BTC’s price recovered and surged to an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, as seen on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s price page on CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>However, the Bitcoin stock price couldn&#8217;t sustain these remarkable highs and immediately plummeted, entering a sustained bear phase which saw the coin lose 50% of its value. After a brief hiatus, the second leg of this bear phase commenced, causing BTC&#8217;s price to drop to the $18,000 region. This continued until the start of 2023, which is when the leading crypto started spiking in value once again.</p>
<p>The first half of 2023 was excellent for BTC, with the price almost doubling since the start of the year, reaching $31,000 at the end of June. This was due to a slew of institutional interest, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/blackrock-files-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-with-coinbase-as-a-crypto-custodian.html">major asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and WisdomTree applying for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/how-close-are-crypto-markets-first-spot-bitcoin-ether-etfs-2023-11-20/">Numerous Bitcoin ETF applications</a> are currently being held up by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is expected that the SEC will approve one or more of these ETFs in early 2024, and that, along with the Bitcoin Halving coming at the end of the Q1 2024, could be the catalyst for another bull run.</p>
<p>The current Bitcoin price sits between $37k–38k – a 45% decrease from the all-time high attained in 2021. However, it&#8217;s important to note that this steep decline in price has more to do with macroeconomic factors than Bitcoin itself, as most (if not all) major altcoins and tokens have also experienced value decreases.</p>
<p>Before moving on to our Bitcoin price predictions for the years ahead, let’s briefly recap the key points to bear in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC) was conceptualized in late 2008 and officially ‘launched’ in early 2009</li>
<li>BTC&#8217;s first bull run occurred in 2013 when the coin&#8217;s price rose by 10,000%</li>
<li>BTC’s second major bull run was in 2017, when the coin’s value rose by 1,694% in just under 11 months</li>
<li>Bitcoin showed sustained bullish momentum in 2020 and 2021, reaching an all-time high of $68,789 on November 10, 2021</li>
<li>Immediately after hitting this all-time high, BTC’s price sank by 67% between November 2021 and February 2022.</li>
<li>Hope for a more moderate stance by the Fed towards rate hike as well as other macroeconomic conditions, pushed the value of Bitcoin above $20k at the beginning of 2023. </li>
<li>The first half of 2023 was excellent for BTC as the price nearly doubled from January to July, reaching a local high just shy of $32k amid a flurry of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from major asset managers.</li>
<li>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has since dipped, but with the next halving approaching, and ETF approvals around the corner, bullish sentiment is expected to grow into 2024. </li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Will Bitcoin Ever Recover?</span></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Since mid-October, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has increase by over 40%, calming fears that Bitcoin&#8217;s stint above $30,000 might be short lived and increasing speculation that Bitcoin could finish 2023 on a high heading into next year. Bitcoin is currently trying to climb above $38,000 for the first time this year, and it is yet to see if it can sustain these prices. This is a more than 145% increase from the lows of $15,476 in November 2022, but still 45% down from it November 2021 highs.</p>
<p>While the global economy and cryptocurrency markets seem to have weathered the economic storm of the past few years well, there is still uncertainty about the future. However, with a Bitcoin Halving event in coming 2024—events which have historically been followed by a bull market that peaks 12–18 months afterwards—,a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/20/first-mover-americas-crypto-friendly-javier-milei-wins-argentine-presidency/">new crypto friendly president  in Argentina</a>, and Bitcoin ETFs poised for approval at some point in 2024 in the USA, and regulations for cryptocurrencies taking shape around the world, many would say Bitcoin&#8217;s road to recovery is well paved.</p>
<p>There is, of course, nothing set in stone—especially in the wild world of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A glance at the Bitcoin price chart will show that every time there has been an extended ‘bear market’, the coin’s price has rebounded and surpassed the previous highs. This fact adds optimism that BTC can still be regarded as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">crypto with the most upside</a>, with many eager to get involved once the bullish momentum begins picking up once more.</p>
<p>Two catalysts for this momentum in late 2023 have been the Federal Reserve opting to halt interest rate increases and speculation surrounding the approval of Bitcoin ETFs—with a false ETF approval report from Coin Telegraph sending Bitcoin climbing over 10% in one day. Most <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/altcoins/">altcoins</a> have also followed Bitcoin as it has climbed higher.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88985/223518/2023-1.jpg" alt="Central bank building" /></figure>
<p>Even though the Bitcoin price today is well below November 2021&#8217;s all-time highs, many investors are actually viewing this as an opportunity to acquire BTC at a discount. But just <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-many-bitcoins-are-there.htm">how many Bitcoins are there</a> right now?</p>
<p>As Bitcoin remains one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-work-coins.htm">best proof-of-work coins</a>, along with DOGE and LTC, we’ll likely see some pushback in the coming years due to its vast energy requirements. However, it&#8217;s implausible that BTC would fall entirely by the wayside, as the coin is too firmly ingrained in the crypto culture. This adds further belief that Bitcoin&#8217;s price could experience another bull run. </p>
<p>Bitcoin seemed to have peaked in July, but with an improves economic climate, news swirling about Bitcoin ETF approvals and a Bitcoin Halving on just around the corner the markets have perked up at the end of the year. Indeed, the <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/">Crypto Fear and Greed Index</a> has risen steadily from Fear (37/100) in mid-August to Greed (66/100), hitting a high of 74/100 in early November. This shows increased interest and bullish sentiment in the crpyto markets as the year comes to a close.</p>
<p>Given all this information, our Bitcoin price prediction for 2023 estimates the coin&#8217;s value could reach a high of <strong>$43,000 </strong>by the end of the year, or, should some bad news occur, the Bitcoin crypto price could slide to lows around $30,000 by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>Other analysts, like <em>AMBCrypto</em>, predict that the Bitcoin price could hit a high of $45,822.48 by the end of the year, while the like of <em>DigitalCoinPrice</em> offer very bullish predictions that depict a new all-time high by the end of the year, with a median price prediction of $76,066.63 and a potential high of $83,880.48.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking at Bitcoin&#8217;s price chart, it could seem like the world&#8217;s top cryptocurrency is ready to initiate—some would say has started—a bull run. Certainly, as mentioned, the scales seem to be tipping this way way as we head into 2024.</p>
<p>The most hyped Bitcoin Halving event is going to occur as the world, seemingly and hopefully, continues to recover from the economic crisis that has come in the aftermath of the global pandemic. This event is expected to occur—partially at least—in the background, obscured by the actions of the SEC&#8217;s around the many Bitcoin ETFs it has to approve or deny in 2024.</p>
<p>The regulator framework for cryptos around the globe is continuing to improve, and, with Argentina electing a crypto friendly president at the end of 2023, we could see a second country declare some form of cryptocurrency as legal tender in 2024—with Bitcoin and/or stablecoins the most likely candidates.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88985/255418/thought-catalog-i0tdrp0fj6y-unsp.jpg" alt="Bitcoin coin" /></figure>
<p>It is expected that the SEC will approve one, if not multiple, spot Bitcoin ETF applications in 2024, which will help to drive institutional money into Bitcoin and the price even higher. While the price impact of the Halving is, historically, not felt until 12–18 months after the actual event itself all the hype around Bitcoin adoption and ETF approvals could change that narrative, and the Halving might be a catalyst for the bull market 12 months earlier than many think.</p>
<p>Provided that nothing untoward happens, our prediction for Bitcoin&#8217;s price in 2024 is a staggering <strong>$62,000</strong>, not far short of its all-time high. Our potential low prediction for Bitcoin in 2024 is $36,000. Other predictions, like one from investment bank Standard Chartered, predict BTC can break six figures by the end of 2024.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Finally, how does our Bitcoin forecast look over the longer term? As with all assets, it&#8217;s challenging to make accurate assumptions many years into the future. However, there are certain factors at play that hint at where BTC&#8217;s price could head in the coming years. </p>
<p>The first of these factors is the growth of the crypto market as a whole. Institutional interest has spurred this growth, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/crypto-market-outlook-forecast/">Forbes</a> reporting that BlackRock has launched its own platform, called ‘Aladdin’, which allows investors to gain exposure to major cryptocurrencies. If more financial institutions follow suit, it’ll dramatically increase demand for coins like BTC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88985/223520/2025-1.jpg" alt="Aladdin platform by BlackRock" /></figure>
<p>Bitcoin also remains one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto</a> projects due to its appeal amongst retail investors and those with limited market knowledge. Whenever newcomers wish to get involved with crypto, they naturally gravitate towards BTC, as it is viewed as the &#8216;safest&#8217; option due to its popularity. Again, this is another factor that will play a role in sustaining demand.</p>
<p>In addition to all of this, our Bitcoin price prediction remains optimistic due to how well-placed the coin is to weather any storm. Not only is Bitcoin becoming more popular amongst investors, but it is also becoming more popular amongst politicians, as they realize that Bitcoin and crypto are becoming more popular with their constituents—a trend we expect to see continue into 2025 and beyond. There are also more than 38,000 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide, highlighting that the coin isn’t going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>All these points seem to point towards a future where Bitcoin no longer experiences the exponential price increases of days past. However, there is one final factor affecting a Bitcoin price forecast for 2025, and that is the Halving event of 2024. Based on data from Bitcoin&#8217;s last 4 Halving, Bitcoin experiences explosive growth 12–18 months after the Halving event occurs, which means that this is set to happen in the middle of 2025—meaning that a bull run akin to 2017 or 2021 is potentially on the cards.</p>
<p>All of these elements combine to add confluence to the idea that, although Bitcoin&#8217;s exponential price increases may be a thing of the past, the coin still has investment potential. Given the historical boom-bust cycle that has been present during Bitcoin&#8217;s lifetime, it could be expected that BTC and the rest of the crypto space will be in a bull run akin to 2021 by 2025.</p>
<p>As such, our Bitcoin price prediction 2025 estimates the coin&#8217;s price could hit high of <strong>$83,000</strong> in 2025, with a predicted low of $55,000. Moreover, our Bitcoin price prediction 2030 forecasts that the price could exceed this level – thereby leading to another new all-time high. Other analysts have also weighed in on the future price of Bitcoin, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/31/bitcoin-could-hit-150000-by-2025-predicts-bernstein.html">Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani stating that the firm believes Bitcoin could hit $150,000 by 2025</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s delve into the future of Bitcoin&#8217;s price over the long term. Bitcoin is currently the only coin to be receiving supported from both the crypto and traditional financial sectors, which sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies and bodes well for its long-term prospects. Today it is widely seen as &#8216;digital gold&#8217; by members of both the crypto and traditional finance sectors, and we can expect this narrative to persist into the long term and help to support higher prices for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We also expect the availability, accessibility and, most importantly, the use of crypto to continue to grow. We don&#8217;t expect Bitcoin&#8217;s position as the flag bearer for the crypto movement to falter, and this position will likely only be strengthened as the adoption of cryptocurrencies grows. All boding well for the future price of Bitcoin to remain strong.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88985/255419/dmitry-demidko-og3a-ilg8ay-unspl.jpg" alt="Bitcoin physical coins" /></figure>
<p>One final thing affecting the Bitcoin price in 2030 might be the Bitcoin Halving event of 2028. If, as said before, we follow historical trends, then Bitcoin is likely to peak in 2029 with new all-time highs induced  by the Halving of 2028, and 2030 is when we&#8217;ll be coming down from these highs. While the Bitcoin price might not be as high as it would in 2029, we predict that Bitcoin will still be sustaining much higher prices than it currently holds today.</p>
<p>As a result, our 2030 prediction for the price of Bitcoin is a high of <strong>$150,000</strong>, and a low of $100,000, as Bitcoin spends its second year  (with 2029 being the first) above $100,000 per coin. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKD_6e_HDBs">The CEO of Ark Invest, Cathie Woods, stated on the Coin Stories podcast that her company forecasts Bitcoin trading hands for as much as $1.48 million by 2030</a>.</p>
<div class="raw-html-embed"> </div>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Potential Highs &amp; Lows</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin will likely remain one of the market’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-trending-cryptos.htm">top trending cryptos</a> for years to come, providing a solid platform for sustained growth in the Bitcoin price. With that in mind, the table below presents an overview of our price forecasts for the coming years, ensuring investors know which levels could act as support or resistance.</p>

<h2>What Other Analysts Predict for Bitcoin&#8217;s Price</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As it might&#8217;ve been noticed, we are not alone in making Bitcoin price predictions. With that said, here we&#8217;ve rounded up some Bitcoin price predictions from other website and analysts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">On the Changelly blog, Daria Morgen predicts that Bitcoin will surpass $100,000 in 2025 and be worth over half a million dollar in 2030, with a high of $678,373.74, and a low of $570,856.33 in 2030.</p>

<h2><strong>Is Bitcoin the Best Crypto To Invest in Today?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before rounding off our Bitcoin price prediction, it’s important to discuss whether BTC is the best crypto to invest in right now, given the ongoing macroeconomic situation. </p>
<p>From our perspective, although Bitcoin will likely rebound in the future, there may be better alternatives out there for investors seeking outsized returns, even if Bitcoin remains one of the &#8216;safest&#8217; investments in crypto.</p>
<p>Consider it in these terms, with BTC currently priced at around $37,000 an increase in price to $100k—which would take considerable volume and would mean that crypto was in a full bull run—would equate to a 170% return on profit, or $270 for every $100 invested.</p>
<p>However, even throughout the ongoing bear market, many projects have provided significantly higher ROI because they offer a high risk-high reward opportunity.</p>
<p>Examples include the likes of Pepe, Sponge, Wojak and Mildays, which all offered returns in the thousands of percent in days or weeks rather than just the hundreds.</p>
<p>One new project that could outpace Bitcoin in the coming months is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a>, a unique project gaining traction in the investor community.</p>
<h2>Binance &#8211; Overall Best Place To Buy Bitcoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<h2><b>Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; New Bitcoin Alternative Speculating the Release of the Upcoming Bitcoin Spot ETF</b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in the world, many investors are interested in new alternatives that could potentially offer high growth potential. One such cryptocurrency asset is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) &#8211; a new project that has been created to celebrate the expected arrival of Bitcoin Spot ETFs. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1321" height="615" class="aligncenter wp-image-127808" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am.png 1321w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-1024x477.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-768x358.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1321px) 100vw, 1321px" /></p>
<p>Investors have been awaiting the confirmation of a Bitcoin Spot ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) &#8211; allowing one to trade Bitcoin without holding the underlying asset. However, the markets are awaiting approval by the SEC. Bitcoin ETF Token is not associated with any Bitcoin ETF, but has set 5 predetermined milestones related to the ETF. </p>
<p>Upon reaching each of these milestones, it will burn 5% of its token supply. The 5 milestones are related to Bitcoin and the awaited ETFs. For instance, one of the milestones is the official confirmation of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. Others include the official release of the ETF, and the ETF crossing $1 billion in assets under management. </p>
<p>While Bitcoin ETF Token has a 2.1 billion token supply, this will reduce by 25% as the milestones are reached. This ERC-20 token also offers passive income through its staking contract. $BTCETF token holders can stake their holdings on a verified Ethereum-based smart contract and generate high APYs (Annual Percentage Yield). </p>
<p><iframe title="New BITCOIN ETF 10X Potential Crypto Presale?! (WHY THIS MIGHT 10X?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NhSSPSzmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The APYs are highest during the presale—reaching as high as 5,800%. So far, more than 5 million tokens have been staked on the smart contract. 40% of the 2.1 billion token supply has been allocated for the presale and the $BTCETF presale price is currently just $0.0058 per token. The price 0f the token will rise steadily as the presale progresses, and the price will be $0.0068 per token in the final stage of the presale. So far $1.8 million out of a target of $2.1 million has been raised. </p>
<p>Once this crypto lists on exchanges, it could explode in price as the supply reduces and the staking rewards start being distributed. Bitcoin ETF Token’s smart contract has been verified by Coinsult.

<h2><strong>A Closer Look at the Most Eco-Friendly Cryptos to Invest</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When looking for the most energy-efficient cryptocurrency, investors must ensure that the development team places sustainability on their list of priorities. Projects where this is the case will often employ leading technologies to reduce their energy requirements – or even offset their carbon footprint completely.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s dive in and explore the most eco-friendly cryptocurrency projects on the market right now:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Overall Best Eco-Friendly Crypto</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is our overall best eco-friendly crypto and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy now</a>. It is an environmentally friendly token due to its staking features, meaning you earn additional tokens by staking them instead of mining them with expensive hardware and copious amounts of electricity. I</p>
<p>In fact, you can earn a generous 165% annual percentage yield by simply locking up your tokens. Of course, this number will drop as more tokens get staked, which makes it prudent to stake your tokens early in the presale to take advantage of the higher yields.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-128538 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale homepage" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token-768x395.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>At the moment, you can only buy $BTCETF tokens on the Bitcoin ETF Token website by connecting your MetaMask wallet. Use your ETH, USDT or card to complete the transaction. MATIC and BNB coins are also supported to buy $BTCETF, but you won&#8217;t be eligible to use the staking mechanism if you buy the presale with these two coins.</p>
<p>The $BTCETF token presale runs in 10 stages. Each stage will increase the token price starting from $0.0050 in the first stage all the way up to $0.0068 in the last stage &#8211; the current price is $0.0056 and more than $1.5million has been raised in just two weeks.</p>
<p>This makes buying as early as possible and staking your tokens the most potentially rewarding option.</p>
<p>The team behind the Bitcoin ETF Token will also use deflationary mechanics such as token burning. This will start with a burn tax of 5% for every transaction, which will drop to 0% once each of the five milestones around the Bitcoin spot ETF approval have been reached.</p>
<p><iframe title="New BITCOIN ETF 10X Potential Crypto Presale?! (WHY THIS MIGHT 10X?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NhSSPSzmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>These milestones themselves will see a 5% of the total token supply getting burned. The approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs is the first milestone along with the launch of the first Bitcoin spot ETF.</p>

This cryptocurrency adopts a unique stake-to-mine concept &#8211; allowing everyday people to earn mining rewards by accessing tokenized cloud mining credits. </p>
<p>Cloud mining is a process through which companies rent out mining time to individuals. This reduces the need for mining rigs and hardware. In abundance, these plants can lead to an increase in pollution. By promoting cloud mining, Bitcoin Minetrix is allowing users to rent out mining equipment in a cost-effective manner. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/334786/screen-shot-2023-10-24-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" width="1304" height="685" /></figure>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is the first to decentralize this process &#8211; by offering ERC-20 credits representing the cloud mining credits. These can be earned by buying and staking $BTCMTX on an Ethereum-based smart contract. The credits you collect can be burned on the ecosystem to earn Bitcoin cloud mining power. </p>
<p>With this, users can get allocated mining times and earn a portion of the crypto mining revenues. Therefore, Bitcoin Minetrix plays an integral role in promoting crypto mining in an environment-friendly and efficient manner. Furthermore, staked token holders can also generate APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) as high as 140% with $BTCMTX. </p>

<p>From a total supply of 4 billion &#8211; 2.8 billion tokens have been allocated for the ongoing $BTCMTX presale. The presale will consist of 39 rounds &#8211; and look to raise more than $34 million. Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0117 per token, but will rise to $0.0148 by the final round. This equates to a price jump of 26.5%. </p>
<p>Since the presale launched, Bitcoin Minetrix has raised more than $4.3 million. Interested investors could choose to acquire $BTCMTX before the price rises each round.

<h3><strong>4. Chimpzee &#8211; Best Crypto for Protecting Wildlife</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/chimpzee/">Chimpzee</a> is a new eco-friendly cryptocurrency project designed to incentivize investors with rewards while also encouraging them to take measures to protect the environment and shield the endangered species from harm. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The project works with multiple charities and has already planted 1,200 trees to restore Brazilian rainforest, has planted 20,000 trees in Guatemala, and donated $15,000 towards saving elephants with the WILD Foundation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/311883/chimpzee-eco-friendly-crypto.jpg" alt="Chimpzee crypto project" /></p>
<p>According to the official whitepaper, this revolutionary Web3 project has taken a &#8220;trilateral&#8221; approach to ensure that you don&#8217;t have one, but three ways to earn while engaging with the Chimpzee ecosystem. Those three ways consist of two main components &#8211; the CHMPZ coin and the Chimpzee NFT Passport. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The CHMPZ coin is an ERC-20 asset with a total supply of 200 billion. It powers the Chimpzee ecosystem and helps with the creation of the Chimpzee NFT Passport, a unique NFT with many utilities and upsides. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The three earning mechanics that Chimpzee has implemented consist of the following:</p>

<h3><strong>5. Tezos (XTZ) – Best for Rapid Transaction Speed and Energy Efficiency</strong></h3>
<p>Tezos has made a name for itself in the past year through high-profile partnerships with Manchester United and McLaren Racing, helping raise awareness of this exciting project. This awareness has helped Tezos’ team expand the network and make it more eco-friendly.</p>
<p>Tezos’ recent TezDev Conference saw the development team highlight plans to make the network capable of handling an incredible one million transactions per second (TPS) in the coming years. This will be achieved with sustainability in mind since the Tezos network uses the same amount of energy per year as just 17 global citizens.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222055/tezos.jpg" alt="Tezos total contract operations" /></figure>
<p>These elements have made Tezos one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-searched-crypto.htm">most searched crypto</a> projects on the market, with investors also appealed by the development team&#8217;s assertion that the network will use less power as it grows. Finally, Tezos&#8217; team even provides accurate emissions data for the blockchain every month – with emissions clearly trending lower as the years have gone on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy XTZ with eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>6. Ethereum (ETH) – Best for Developing Sustainable dApps</strong></h3>
<p>Another of the most eco-friendly cryptocurrencies to be aware of is Ethereum. For the longest time, Ethereum used the ‘Proof-of-Work’ (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on energy-intensive ‘mining’ to secure the network. However, Ethereum has recently transitioned to a ‘Proof-of-Stake’ (PoS) consensus mechanism, which uses much less energy. </p>
<p>Due to this change, Ethereum has been touted as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next cryptocurrency to explode</a>, as the network now uses 99.9% less energy than before. What&#8217;s more, Ethereum&#8217;s team now clearly focuses on sustainability, even calling the network a &#8216;green blockchain&#8217;.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222056/ethereum-1.jpg" alt="Ethereum coin most eco friendly cryptos" width="1280" height="960" /></figure>
<p>This eco-friendly crypto also offers additional benefits to investors since moving to a ‘greener’ consensus mechanism, such as the ability to generate a yield through staking. What’s more, Ethereum’s team plans to implement a ‘sharding’ approach sometime in 2023. This approach will make the network even more efficient and accessible – helping boost its positive environmental impact.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>7. Solana (SOL) – Carbon Neutral and Efficient Blockchain Network</strong></h3>
<p>Solana is one of the few environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies that looks to improve on the services offered by the Ethereum network. Like Ethereum, Solana is a smart contract-enabled blockchain that provides a foundation for decentralized app (dApp) developers and NFT creators. However, Solana is much more scalable due to its unique consensus algorithm. </p>
<p>This algorithm is a hybrid of PoS and &#8216;Proof-of-History&#8217;, meaning that the Solana network can reportedly handle 65,000 TPS, with each costing less than a fraction of a penny. Solana can also be considered an eco-friendly crypto since one Solana transaction uses just 3,290 Joules of electricity. To put this into perspective, this is less than four Google searches.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222057/solana-1.jpg" alt="Solana blockchain eco freindly crypto" width="1132" height="628" /></figure>
<p>Many believe that Solana is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">crypto with the most upside</a> due to its scalability and sustainability. This latter point is strengthened further through Solana’s partnership with Watershed Climate, which sees Solana offset its emissions by funding refrigerant destruction. Through this process, the Solana network has become carbon neutral, with the developers aiming to remain this way over the long term.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>8. IOTA (MIOTA) – Energy Efficient Crypto with No Transaction Fees</strong></h3>
<p>IOTA differs from the other environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies on our list due to its novel approach concerning the &#8216;Internet of Things&#8217; (IoT). Put simply, IOTA is a distributed ledger that allows devices to interact and transact with one another. As noted by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-iota/">Forbes</a>, IOTA validates transactions through a new technology called ‘the Tangle’.</p>
<p>This technology doesn&#8217;t require mining and completely removes transaction fees, ensuring it is highly scalable. Due to this, IOTA can be considered one of the most environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies in 2023, as a recent <a href="https://blog.iota.org/energy-consumption-of-iota-2-0/">IOTA blog post</a> noted that a transaction on the network only consumes around 0.00678 Joules.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222058/iota-1.jpg" alt="IOTA energy consumption efficiency " width="1101" height="575" /></p>
<p>For context, this is less energy than it takes to light a Christmas tree light for one second – highlighting the network’s energy efficiency. What’s more, IOTA’s recent software upgrade means the network now consumes just under 205 TWh of electricity per year, which is about 0.000009% of Bitcoin’s annual energy requirement. </p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>9. Polkadot (DOT) – Best Network for Interoperability</strong></h3>
<p>Polkadot has garnered a reputation as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/12-most-volatile-cryptos-trade-invest-2022.htm">most volatile cryptos</a> on the market yet has remained popular with investors due to its low-power approach. For those unaware, Polkadot is an innovative protocol that promotes interoperability between blockchains. The protocol has a central hub, called the relay chain, that can process the transactions on chains surrounding it.</p>
<p>These surrounding chains are called ‘parachains’, which are essentially blockchains with specific use cases. Since the relay chain handles all verification, developers on these parachains can focus solely on expanding the network rather than its security.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222062/polkadot.jpg" alt="Polkadot energy-efficient protocol" width="1554" height="724" /></figure>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-02/polkadot-has-smallest-carbon-footprint-crypto-researcher-says">Bloomberg</a>, Polkadot has the lowest total electricity consumption and carbon emissions of the six leading PoS chains. What’s more, Polkadot’s innovative Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) mechanism means that it uses a fraction of the energy that Bitcoin does – highlighting how eco-friendly this project is.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Algorand (ALGO) &#8211; Carbon-Negative Project with Environmentalist Founder</strong></h3>
<p>Rounding off our list of the most environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies in 2023 is Algorand. Algorand is a smart contract-enabled blockchain founded by MIT professor Silvio Micali. Micali won the Turing Award back in 2012 and has ensured the Algorand network employs eco-friendly technology to remain sustainable.</p>
<p>Algorand uses a unique ‘Pure Proof-of-Stake’ (PPoS) consensus mechanism, meaning that each transaction on the network uses just 0.0000004 kg of CO2. This means Algorand’s annual energy requirements are roughly the same as just seven average households.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222064/algorand.jpg" alt="Algorand energy efficient blockchain" width="1373" height="546" /></p>
<p>In addition, Algorand’s team actively offset the network&#8217;s carbon footprint by using smart contracts to buy carbon credits. Through this process, Algorand has become carbon negative on a net basis, making this one of the most eco-friendly cryptocurrencies on our list.</p>

<h2><strong>What Makes a Cryptocurrency Eco-Friendly?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we’ve highlighted which eco-friendly cryptocurrencies are worth checking out, let’s take a closer look at what these cryptos actually do. Many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects claim to be eco-friendly &#8211; yet there’s a crucial difference between those that aim to be and those that actually are.</p>
<p>There’s no escaping the fact that blockchain networks consume electricity. Since there’s no way around this, leading blockchains have continued to innovate over the past few years and develop ways in which they can limit their electricity use. By limiting their electricity requirements, these blockchains can reduce (or eradicate) their carbon footprint.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222065/what-is-1.jpg" alt="eco friendly cryptos network" width="940" height="627" /></p>
<p>The primary way developers can make their projects eco-friendly is by using an alternative to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol popularized by Bitcoin. According to a recent report by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf">The White House</a>, the Bitcoin network accounts for between 60% and 77% of the total global crypto-asset electricity usage.</p>
<p>Naturally, Bitcoin&#8217;s huge energy requirements have created a demand for alternatives, which is where these eco-friendly projects come in. Most use a consensus protocol called &#8216;Proof-of-Stake&#8217; (PoS), which removes the need for the energy-intensive computing hardware used during the mining process. In turn, this drastically reduces the electricity requirements for PoS chains.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222066/what-is-2.jpg" alt="Solana energy useage per transaction" width="1147" height="564" /></figure>
<p>Although many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> now employ a PoS protocol, some even take things one step further. For example, Solana uses a ‘hybrid’ protocol that allows the network to be eco-friendly whilst remaining highly scalable. Solana&#8217;s team also actively reduces the network’s carbon footprint by funding refrigerant destruction – one of the best ways to offset CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, the main characteristic of eco-friendly cryptos is that they employ technologies designed to reduce electricity consumption. This approach has become more prevalent recently, seeing PoW projects like Bitcoin and Litecoin receive less attention. Given the growing need for positive environmental change, this trend shows no signs of slowing.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Environmentally-Friendly Cryptocurrency is Important</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">best future cryptocurrency projects</a> will likely focus heavily on sustainability – yet why is this so important? To answer this question, detailed below are four reasons why eco-friendly cryptos will continue to be vital over the long term:</p>
<h3><strong>Is Appropriate for ESG-focused Investors</strong></h3>
<p>Eco-friendly cryptos are crucial since they offer a viable alternative for investors interested in sustainable projects. These investors have had their hands tied in recent years, as most projects were energy-intensive compared to today&#8217;s networks, yet this has begun to change.</p>
<p>ESG-focused investors now have an array of investment opportunities since leading cryptos like Tezos, Solana and Ethereum all utilize energy-efficient technology. What&#8217;s more, as these cryptos grow in popularity, other new projects will likely follow suit and take a sustainable approach – thereby boosting the positive environmental impact.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Helps Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions</strong></h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA), 65% of global greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and industrial processes. This means that electricity generation is a considerable burden on the environment, which is why energy-intensive cryptos like Bitcoin have got such a bad rap.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222068/reduces-co2.jpg" alt="Global greenhouse gas emissions by gas" width="790" height="1082" /></figure>
<p>However, environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies look to reverse these adverse effects by limiting their energy requirements. In addition, many cryptos also remove their carbon footprint by purchasing offsets – highlighting how important these projects are in the battle against climate change.  <strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Promotes Innovation in the Crypto Market</strong></h3>
<p>The rise of eco-friendly cryptocurrencies has also helped the market as a whole. Due to the competitive nature of the market, whenever a project leaps ahead of the others in terms of sustainability, it naturally prompts those that have been left behind to look for ways that they can improve.</p>
<p>On a macro level, this enables the entire market to become more energy-efficient, leaving energy-intensive projects by the wayside. If this trend continues over the long term, we’ll likely see new and exciting technologies emerge that improve on those of today.</p>
<h3><strong>Generates Good Publicity for Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, as more and more cryptos become eco-friendly, it helps to change people&#8217;s perception of the crypto market. Due to Bitcoin&#8217;s size and pop culture appeal, most people focus solely on its environmental impact rather than considering the good done by other projects.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222069/good-publicity.jpg" alt="Newspaper eco friendly crypto news" width="940" height="627" /></figure>
<p>However, as these eco-friendly cryptocurrencies continue to grow, less attention will be paid to BTC and more will be paid to these sustainable projects. In turn, this should naturally create positive publicity for the crypto market as a whole – which benefits all stakeholders.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Provides Scope for High Returns</strong></h3>
<p>Investing in sustainable crypto can also be lucrative, as these projects often have the most extended lifespan. This is because sustainable cryptos tend to employ the latest technology to reduce their electricity consumption, helping them stay ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, a growing number of investors are becoming environmentally conscious, meaning these sustainable projects are even more appealing than before. As more investment flows into these projects, it&#8217;ll help them expand and improve – providing scope for higher investor returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Helps Futureproof the Market</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, the rise of sustainable cryptocurrencies has undoubtedly helped the crypto market’s longevity, which was at risk when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> was the only viable option. With more projects than ever utilizing sustainable practices, the market&#8217;s future looks exceedingly bright.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88287/221779/futureproof.jpg" alt="Computer hardware parts eco friendly " width="896" height="671" /></figure>
<p>Furthermore, due to the market’s competitive nature, these projects will naturally continue to innovate to stay ahead of the pack. Not only will this benefit the project individually, but it&#8217;ll prompt other projects to follow suit – helping boost the positive environmental impact.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>How to Find Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrency</a> projects on the market utilize eco-friendly technologies, making them appealing to environmentally-conscious investors. Those looking to get involved in these projects can identify them using the following approaches:</p>
<h3><strong>Analyze Industry Reports</strong></h3>
<p>A great way to find eco-friendly cryptos is to look for industry reports that analyze the energy usage of leading blockchains. A great place to start is with the <a href="https://carbon-ratings.com/">Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute</a> (CCRI), which regularly authors reports on blockchain networks, tokens, and NFTs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222070/industry-reports.jpg" alt="Crypto Carbons Rating Institute" width="990" height="314" /></figure>
<p>By reviewing the information in reports like those authored by the CCRI, investors can gain verifiable insight into which cryptos are doing the most for the environment – and which aren’t.</p>
<h3><strong>Research the Underlying Technology</strong></h3>
<p>Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-coins.htm">best metaverse coins</a> use cutting-edge technologies, and eco-friendly cryptos are no different. Thus, investors looking to find these cryptos can keep tabs on the latest technological innovations and seek out projects that utilize them.</p>
<p>For example, the Chia network&#8217;s &#8216;Proof-of-Space-and-Time&#8217; consensus algorithm is a relatively new innovation that offers an alternative to PoW and PoS mechanisms. Furthermore, some blockchains look to improve already-established technologies – an example being Algorand’s Pure Proof-of-Stake consensus.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Review the Project’s Website/Whitepaper</strong></h3>
<p>Like when searching for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-upcoming-icos.htm">best upcoming ICOs</a>, investors looking to identify eco-friendly cryptos can review the project&#8217;s website and whitepaper. Both of these elements are great resources for learning about the project and the values the development team holds.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88390/222071/whitepaper.jpg" alt="Chia project green paper eco friendly" width="879" height="438" /></p>
<p>The whitepaper is especially important since this document will detail the technology underlying the project. Thus, by reviewing the whitepaper thoroughly, investors can clearly see whether the project is sustainable or not.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep Tabs on Social Media Platforms</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, investors can also use Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram to keep tabs on various crypto projects and identify which have eco-friendly principles. Due to the importance of these principles, projects that aim to improve the environment will often display their efforts on social media for all to see.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some projects may even quote third-party institutions that have reported positive information about them. Thanks to this, it’s relatively easy for investors to see which projects are actively helping the environment. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Most Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrencies – Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In summary, this guide has taken an in-depth look at the most eco-friendly cryptocurrencies on the market, exploring how they reduce their energy requirements and make a positive impact on the global environment. </p>
<p>Many of these eco-friendly cryptos can be purchased using eToro – one of the world&#8217;s top online trading platforms. eToro serves more than 28 million clients worldwide and is regulated by tier-one entities like FinCEN, FINRA, CySEC, and the FCA. Moreover, eToro allows clients to open positions from just $10, with full support for credit/debit card, PayPal, Skrill, and Neteller deposits.</p>
<p>However, our top choice for the most eco-friendly crypto is Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; a presale token that earns over 165% staking APY. You can buy the token for a price of $0.0056 in the early stages of the presale, which has raised more than $1.5 million in two weeks.</p>

<h2><strong>How We Select the Best Aviator Gambling Sites</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When looking for the best aviator gambling site, it&#8217;s crucial to analyze various criteria. Detailed below are the areas that we focused on during our research for this guide:</p>
<h3><strong>Safe Crypto Payments</strong></h3>
<p>All the best aviator casino games sites feature safe and speedy crypto payments. These sites often don&#8217;t require KYC checks since crypto deposits are made using digital currency wallets. As a result, there&#8217;s no chance of a user&#8217;s personal data being obtained by cyber attackers.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Streamlined Deposit &amp; Withdrawals Process</strong></h3>
<p>The top Aviator game gambling sites also have a streamlined deposit and withdrawal process. Again, this is because these sites operate using crypto, which doesn’t utilize the traditional banking network. Due to this, users can benefit from instant deposits – and withdrawals also tend to be facilitated in minutes.</p>
<h3><strong>Attractive Cryptocurrency Bonuses &amp; Promos</strong></h3>
<p>Like the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metamask-casino-sites.htm">best MetaMask casino sites</a>, online Aviator casinos often feature attractive bonuses and promotions to entice new players to join. This can come in the form of a deposit match bonus, free spins, or even a no-deposit bonus. Given how important they are, we&#8217;ll explore these bonuses in more detail later in this guide.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/97349/242097/bonuses-and-promos.jpg" alt="$10K LBLOCK Airdrop Giveaway" /></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Minimal Crypto Transaction Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Playing the Aviator game online with real money can sometimes accrue hefty fees – yet this isn&#8217;t the case with crypto-based casinos. Most of the casinos on our list allow free deposits, yet it&#8217;s essential to be aware of network fees. These are charged by the associated blockchain network and vary depending on the network&#8217;s congestion level.</p>
<h3><strong>Acceptable Deposit &amp; Withdrawal Limits</strong></h3>
<p>The top Aviator casinos offer low deposit and withdrawal limits so anyone can get involved. For example, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lucky-block-casino/en">Lucky Block Casino’s</a> minimum deposit threshold is just $1 – ensuring it’s accessible to the masses.</p>
<h3><strong>An Array of Crypto Betting Markets</strong></h3>
<p>Although the Aviator betting game may be the main focus, it’s still wise to partner with a casino that offers alternative betting markets. These may include traditional table games, slots, live dealers, lottery-style games, dice games, and video poker. Some casinos will also feature a comprehensive sportsbook for sports betting enthusiasts.</p>

<h3><strong>Unique Betting Features &amp; Services</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, the top Aviator platforms all feature unique tools and services that help them stand out. For example, Lucky Block Casino is hosting a $10,000 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-airdrops.htm">crypto airdrop</a> for all new users who place a bet. On the other hand, BC.Game has a dedicated VIP Club feature that rewards active users with regular bonuses and perks.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Aviator Gambling?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Aviator is an online casino game developed by Spribe and launched in 2019. The game involves a 2D plane taking off, with gamblers placing bets on when the aircraft will &#8216;fly away&#8217;. The longer the plane stays in the air and doesn&#8217;t fly away, the larger the bet multiplier.</p>
<p>This unique approach means gamblers can place wagers before the plane takes off and cash out before it &#8216;flies away&#8217;. There&#8217;s no telling when the aircraft will fly away – so if a gambler doesn&#8217;t cash out in time, they&#8217;ll lose the bet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/97349/242099/what-is.jpg" alt="Aviator Game Snapshot" /></figure>
<p>The Aviator game also incorporates social features, as gamblers can see who else is playing at the same time. The pane on the left of the screen highlights who has cashed out in each round and who still has their bet running – with some platforms also showing a leaderboard of who has multiplied their stake the most.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Play Aviator Online with Crypto</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-tether-casino-sites.htm">best Tether casino sites</a> will offer Aviator, including Lucky Block Casino. However, those who have never played Aviator before may find it very different from &#8216;traditional&#8217; casino games. With that in mind, let&#8217;s take a closer look at how the game works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the plane takes off, players can place two separate bets of the same (or different) stakes</li>
<li>Once the plane takes off, the multiplier will gradually increase – and players can opt to cash out their wager at any time</li>
<li>The longer the plane goes, the higher the winnings will be – so players must decide whether to risk waiting a little longer</li>
<li>If the plane &#8216;takes off&#8217; before the player has cashed out, the player will lose the stake.</li>
<li>Aviator is a randomized game, meaning there&#8217;s no way of forecasting the point at which the plane will &#8216;take off&#8217; – each new run is unique </li>
</ul>
<p>Most Aviator platforms incorporate an ‘auto-bet’ feature that automatically places the same bet for each round. Some even include an ‘auto cash out’ button, which allows players to specify a multiplier amount where their stake will be cashed out in each round.</p>
<h2><strong>Aviator Gambling Strategy</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Choosing an Aviator gambling strategy can be challenging since this game is entirely randomized. However, some approaches can help minimize risk, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the auto cash out button to 1.2x for each round. By doing this, the risk is minimized – yet returns are also significantly decreased</li>
<li>Placing one large bet and cashing out almost immediately whilst also making a small bet and letting it run. This has the added benefit of ensuring the gambler doesn&#8217;t &#8216;leave money on the table&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/97349/242100/aviator-strategy.jpg" alt="Aviator Gambling Game " /></figure>
<p>Ultimately, no strategy can increase a player&#8217;s odds since there&#8217;s no way of predicting the point at which the plane will take off. However, many players will skip rounds until there have been a few low multipliers in a row – in the hope that the next run will feature a high multiplier.</p>
<h2><strong>Aviator Bitcoin Bonuses</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before concluding our discussion of the best Aviator gambling site, it&#8217;s important to touch on the various bonuses offered by these sites. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at these bonuses below:</p>
<h3><strong>Matched Deposits</strong></h3>
<p>Matched deposit bonuses are the most common bonus offered by Aviator casinos. As the name implies, this involves matching a new user&#8217;s first deposit by a certain percentage – usually 100% or more.</p>
<p>A great example of this is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/en">BC.Game</a>, which offers a bonus on a user’s first four deposits. However, it’s important to note that these bonuses will have a wagering requirement before the user can withdraw any accrued funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Free Spins on Slots</strong></h3>
<p>Aviator casinos often offer free spins on slot machines to new users. This means that users can place bets on slot machines for free – without needing to use any of their own cash. Again, like deposit match bonuses, these often come with high wagering requirements before being able to withdraw.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/97349/242101/free-spins.jpg" alt="Welcome Slots Bonus" /></figure>
<h3><strong>No-Deposit Promotions</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, a few casinos offer no-deposit bonuses. As the name suggests, this is a cash (or crypto) bonus given to new users without them having to fund their accounts first.</p>
<p>In essence, these bonuses equate to ‘free money’ to gamble with – but there are strings attached. For example, the wagering requirements to withdraw these bonuses are usually very high, so players may wish to utilize alternative platforms with more achievable requirements.<strong> </strong></p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What is Aviator gambling?</strong></p>
<p>Aviator is a 2D gambling game where players place wagers on when they believe a virtual plane will ‘fly off’. The longer the plane goes, the higher the betting multiplier; however, if players don’t cash out before the plane flies off, they lose their stake.</p>
<p><strong>Is Aviator game real or fake?</strong></p>
<p>The Aviator game is fake, as it is a virtual representation of a plane taking off. The point at which the plan ‘flies away’ is random and not pre-determined.</p>
<p><strong>How can I play Aviator?</strong></p>
<p>Those looking to play Aviator can create an account with an online casino that offers the game. We recommend Mega Dice, as the sign-up process can be completed in minutes, and users can fund their accounts with as little as $1.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I play Bitcoin Aviator?</strong></p>
<p>There is now an abundance of casinos that offer Bitcoin Aviator, although our top pick is Mega Dice. This is because users can fund their accounts easily using BTC and only need to deposit a minimum of $1 to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Is Aviator free?</strong></p>
<p>Aviator is free to play, although users must wager real money to participate. However, some platforms offer a free-to-play version that uses virtual currency.</p>
<p><strong>What is the strategy of Aviator game?</strong></p>
<p>There is no specific strategy since each &#8216;run&#8217; is entirely random. However, some players opt to set the auto-cash out feature to its lowest level – thereby minimizing risk.</p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/113042/273590/sponge-token-1.jpg" alt="Spongebob Token Price Prediction" /></figure>
<p>Meme coins have taken the crypto market by storm over the past few weeks, with projects like Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Turbo (TURBO) both producing enormous returns for investors.</p>
<p>Given the price explosions of these coins, many alternative projects have sprung up looking to match (or exceed) their growth.</p>
<p>One coin currently making waves in this regard is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/spongebob-site/en">Sponge (SPONGE)</a> – a brand-new, SpongeBob-themed meme coin that looks set to go viral in the coming days.</p>
<h2><strong>$SPONGE Soars Over 300% Following Uniswap Listing. Could This be the Next Meme Coin to Explode?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>SPONGE was launched on May 4<sup>th</sup> with little to no fanfare, taking a different approach than most new cryptocurrencies. Rather than establish itself through a presale phase, SPONGE instead quietly became available on Uniswap.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">CoinMarketCap</a>, Uniswap is the world’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX), facilitating over $650 million in daily trading volume. Moreover, Uniswap controls nearly 20% of the DeFi trading market, making it the ideal platform for a SPONGE price pump. </p>
<p>In less than 12 hours of the SPONGE token being live on Uniswap, the price had soared over 320%. Since then, SPONGE&#8217;s price has risen even higher, reaching the $0.0001253 level. </p>
<p>This means SPONGE is up an incredible 358% from its launch price in less than one day of trading.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/113042/273591/sponge-token-3.jpg" alt="SPONGE Token Trading Information" />
<figcaption>Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sponge/</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Per blockchain data site <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xf935f557e06a7d040dea4691f90c9a755301818b">DEXTools.io</a>, over $2.5 million worth of SPONGE tokens has been traded since the token launched. Moreover, the project now boasts a market cap of $5.07 million.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the buy orders keep coming in for SPONGE tokens – with one high roller even investing $19,000 in the project in the last two hours.</p>
<p>The hype around SPONGE has even led to the token being listed on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sponge/">CoinMarketCap</a>, which is an accolade that usually takes weeks (if not months) to achieve. </p>
<p>Given SPONGE’s remarkable rise, many are already speculating that it could follow in Pepe Coin’s footsteps and produce quadruple-digit gains for early investors.</p>

<h2><strong>Exponential Returns Potentially on the Horizon for Early SPONGE Investors</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As investors have seen recently, meme coins are back with a bang.</p>
<p>Ever since Elon Musk decided to change the Twitter logo to Dogecoin’s logo, the interest in meme coins and tokens has skyrocketed. As touched on earlier, Pepe Coin and Turbo are the two that have benefitted most from this interest, with the PEPE price up over 3,000% from mid-April.</p>
<p>The exciting thing about these meme coins is that they don&#8217;t abide by &#8220;typical&#8221; asset pricing laws because the price is solely fueled by hype and buzz from retail traders.</p>
<p>Although this may seem illogical, it can often produce exponential price growth in the situations that it succeeds – as investors are seeing currently.</p>
<p>However, many meme coins experience tremendous price pumps, then fall dramatically, meaning investors always need to be aware of the “next big thing” in the market.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/113042/273592/sponge-token-2.jpg" alt="SPONGE/USD Price Chart" />
<figcaption>Source: https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xf935f557e06a7d040dea4691f90c9a755301818b</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>SPONGE could be a viable option in this regard since it has only just launched, meaning the broader investment community hasn&#8217;t yet got its hands on the token. </p>
<p>The token isn&#8217;t yet a day old, so there&#8217;s no telling how high the price could go. However, based on its current trajectory, there&#8217;s every chance SPONGE could produce similar gains to PEPE and TURBO. </p>
<p>Realistically, there’s scope for SPONGE’s price to hit the $0.00035 mark in the coming days if buyer momentum continues. This would represent an incredible 1,172% increase from its launch price. </p>
<p>If this occurs, we&#8217;d likely see the SPONGE token be listed on additional DEXs – and perhaps even CEXs. </p>
<p>The increased liquidity and accessibility this would provide can’t be understated. Due to this, SPONGE could even reach the $0.0006 level before the end of the year – which would be 2,123% higher than its launch price. </p>
<p>As with all new crypto projects, there&#8217;s no telling where the price could head – or whether the bullish momentum will continue to play out. Given this, investors must be prepared to do their own research before investing.</p>
<h2>Best Place To Buy Cryptocurrencies</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although SpongeBob is not yet listed on Binance, it has prospects for a Binance listing, which could significantly improve its visibility and trading volume. Binance has one of the largest pairs of cryptos for trading, offering users access to various digital assets.</p>
<p>It provides advanced trading options, including spot, margin, and futures trading, catering to diverse trading strategies. Despite its advanced features, Binance maintains a user-friendly interface, making it accessible for beginners.</p>
<p>Moreover, Binance’s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading platform stands out for its ease of use. It allows users to buy and sell cryptos directly with each other, supporting multiple payment methods and fiat currencies. This feature is particularly beneficial in regions where direct access to cryptos is restricted or complicated.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="462" class="alignnone wp-image-136746 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="Binance buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto-768x394.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The platform is known for its competitive fee structure, charging a standard 0.1% for both makers and takers. This low fee makes it an attractive option for high-volume traders. Additionally, users holding Binance Coin (BNB) can receive discounts on trading fees.</p>
<p>Binance also offers staking services, where users can earn rewards by holding certain cryptos. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) varies depending on the crypto and the duration of the stake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Binance</a>
<p><em>Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>
<h2><strong>SPONGE Token – Why the Incredible Hype?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Wondering why so many investors are flocking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-spongebob-token.htm">buy Spongebob token</a> right now? Given the coin’s remarkable rise, many investors are already asking: what is the $SPONGE token?</p>
<p>Put simply, SPONGE is an homage to the beloved SpongeBob SquarePants character, which became famous due to the TV show that shares its name.</p>
<p>As noted on the SPONGE token’s <a href="https://twitter.com/spongeoneth">Twitter page</a>, this project aims to be the “Krabby Patty of meme coins.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/113042/273593/sponge-token-4.jpg" alt="$SPONGE crypto presale" width="2210" height="1350" />
<figcaption>Source: Sponge (SPONGE)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The total supply of SPONGE is fixed at 40,400,000,000, with the project featuring no roadmap – a setup popularized by numerous meme coins over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, SPONGE tokens don&#8217;t have any utility yet &#8211; they&#8217;re simply driven by community spirit and the love of the SpongeBob character. </p>
<p>Those looking to invest in the SPONGE project can do so through Uniswap or the <a href="https://spongebobtoken.io/">Sponge Token website</a>, which features a handy widget enabling eager investors to make purchases using hundreds of different ERC-20 tokens.</p>

<p>Is Bitcoin a good investment? This is a question posed relentlessly in today&#8217;s market, given the tremendous growth in the BTC price over the past decade. However, the coin&#8217;s high volatility and colossal carbon footprint have pushed crypto investors towards other projects in recent times – leading many to speculate whether Bitcoin can thrive in the long term. </p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll take an in-depth look at Bitcoin and its place in today&#8217;s crypto market, covering its price history and looking at its prospects. We&#8217;ll also detail where investors can buy Bitcoin today before providing our thoughts on whether BTC represents a good investment, given the current market conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>Is Bitcoin a Good Investment? Our Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>So, is investing in Bitcoin a good idea? There’s no questioning that Bitcoin has been one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-crypto-gainers.htm">top crypto gainers</a> since it hit the public consciousness in the early 2010s – yet it’s hard to imagine the coin providing the same level of returns as it did back then.</p>
<p>Most retail traders gravitate towards Bitcoin for two reasons – they&#8217;re interested in the world of cryptocurrency, and they&#8217;re hopeful of generating market-beating returns. However, what these traders often don&#8217;t realize is that Bitcoin is now a relatively &#8216;mature&#8217; asset within the context of the market. As such, the days of 2,500% returns are likely in the past.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234881/btc.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Coin" /></figure>
<p>There are some good points concerning Bitcoin, such as the fact that it&#8217;s now part of many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-index-funds.htm">crypto index funds</a>, making it the first cryptocurrency to be adopted by the traditional financial markets. From this perspective, BTC may actually represent a good opportunity for investors with a higher risk tolerance and who wish to gain exposure to digital currencies.</p>
<p>However, those looking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-get-rich-off-crypto.htm">get rich off crypto</a> will need to look elsewhere. Yes, Bitcoin has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in six of the last seven years. This is over 3x more than the S&amp;P 500’s drawdown and hints that Bitcoin’s time as a rapidly-growing asset could be coming to an end.</p>
<h2><strong>How Bitcoin Has Performed Since Launch &amp; in 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>People often ask, &#8220;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/should-i-buy-bitcoin.htm">Should I buy Bitcoin now</a>?&#8221; yet fail to understand what the coin is and its price history. As defined by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/">Forbes</a>, Bitcoin is a digital version of cash that exists outside the framework of banks and governments. Two parties can exchange Bitcoin without the need for an intermediary – making it ‘decentralized’.</p>
<p>The mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto created the concept of Bitcoin in the paper titled &#8220;Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System&#8221;. The Bitcoin code was released in January 2009 and was initially used by murky websites like Silk Road to facilitate anonymous payments.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234882/how-has-btc-performed-1.jpg" alt="US Dollar Vs Bitcoin" /></figure>
<p>Over the following years, Bitcoin expanded and entered the public consciousness. People started wondering, &#8220;Should I invest in Bitcoin?&#8221; as the coin&#8217;s value began to rise exponentially. To put this into perspective, BTC was valued at $13.30 in 2013 yet rose to $770 by early 2014 – a remarkable 5,689% increase. </p>
<p>This growth continued in the following years, prompting many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects to spring up (dubbed ‘altcoins’). The popularity of altcoins grew in tandem with Bitcoin, helping set the stage for crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase to expand. By 2020, high-profile names like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey had publicly expressed their optimism for BTC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/331914/bitcoin-all-time-2809.jpg" alt="BTC Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>All told, if an investor had bought BTC at the beginning of its rise in early 2017 and the coin’s all-time high in November 2021, they’d have generated a return of 7,297%. To put this another way, an investment of $1,000 would have been worth $73,970 at the end of the bull run – highlighting why investors began clamoring to get involved in the crypto market.</p>
<p>However, since November 2021’s peak, it’s been challenging for BTC to maintain its status. The combination of rising inflation and interest rate increases has created a ‘risk-off’ environment, making cryptocurrency much less popular. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, since the start of 2023, BTC has performed quite well after rebounding from the $16.2K support. It almost re</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick summary of the key points to be aware of regarding Bitcoin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Satoshi Nakamoto came up with the concept of Bitcoin in 2008</li>
<li>Bitcoin&#8217;s source code was released in January 2009</li>
<li>Dubious online sites initially used BTC to facilitate anonymous payments</li>
<li>Bitcoin began entering the mainstream as an investment asset and helped kickstart the growth of the entire crypto market</li>
<li>After peaking in November 2021, BTC has been on an extended downtrend<strong> </strong></li>
<li>Since the start of 2023, it has witnessed an uptrend before facing resistance at the $30.9K level.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Given the coin&#8217;s past, is it a good time to buy Bitcoin today? To answer this question, it&#8217;s essential to look more closely at the coin&#8217;s price history to determine whether what we&#8217;re seeing today has been seen before.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, Bitcoin&#8217;s first real &#8216;spike&#8217; was between 2017 and 2018, when the price surged by over 5,600%. However, this peak was short-lived, and BTC&#8217;s value gradually decreased over the following year.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/319663/screenshot-2023-07-24-at-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Yearly Price History" /></figure>
<p>However, many believed Bitcoin was the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto</a> due to its size and reputation relative to others in the market. This helped BTC generate some momentum in late 2019 – yet it wasn&#8217;t until the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 that the coin&#8217;s true potential was unveiled.</p>
<p>Between March 2020 and November 2021, Bitcoin’s price rose by 1,657%. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, this led BTC to create an all-time high of $68,789. At this point, the bullish sentiment around Bitcoin was at its peak – but this peak would be short-lived. </p>
<p>Between November 2021 and November 2022, Bitcoin&#8217;s value fell by 74%. The year 2022 has been challenging for BTC investors, as regulatory issues and rising interest rates have hampered price momentum. </p>
<p>However, 2023 has helped the king coin regain some momentum. Starting at around $16.5k, BTC almost doubled in price by July 2023, gathering huge momentum as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-accepts-six-spot-bitcoin-etf-proposals-review-2023-07-19/">major asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Wisdom Tree applied for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>.</p>
<p>The US SEC is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/etfs-may-face-approval-delays-volatility-if-us-govt-shuts-down-2023-09-26/">seemingly dragging its heels on a decision over the ETFs</a>, but it appears likely they will be approved, it is more a matter of when. Bitcoin has lost a bit of momentum in August and September &#8211; which has historically been one of the worst months for the coin and has not posted a green candle in six years.</p>
<p>However, with the next Bitcoin halving approaching in mid-2024 &#8211; a catalyst for all previous bull runs &#8211; there could be light at the end of a tunnel after two painful years in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Highs &amp; Lows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High of $19,735 in December 2017</li>
<li>Low of $3,270 in December 2018</li>
<li>High of $13,910 in June 2019</li>
<li>Low of $3,881 in March 2020</li>
<li>All-time high of $68,789 in November 2021</li>
<li>Current low of $18,120 in November 2022</li>
<li>Regained High of $30,000 in July 2023</li>
<li>Dipped to $26,300 in September 2023</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin Price Forecast</strong></h3>
<p>Is Bitcoin worth buying at today&#8217;s price? There&#8217;s an argument that BTC is relatively &#8216;undervalued&#8217;, given its worldwide adoption and popularity with institutional investors. It&#8217;s clear that BTC&#8217;s downtrend is more to do with external factors rather than internal ones, leading many to speculate that another price rise could be looming. </p>
<p>However, deciding <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-much-to-invest-in-bitcoin.htm">how much to invest in Bitcoin</a> is crucial, as there&#8217;s also the chance that the price will keep dropping. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue increasing interest rates into early 2023, which makes &#8216;risky&#8217; assets like Bitcoin less appealing. Naturally, this could lead to more bearish pressure over the next six months.</p>
<p>So, will Bitcoin go up, or will it continue plummeting? Given the points raised above, we forecast that BTC will continue to hover around this area for the next 6-12 months. However, we do believe that Bitcoin will rise again in the years that follow – just not to the same level as before. Here are our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price predictions</a> for the following years:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC Prediction for End of 2023: </strong>$30,000</li>
<li><strong>BTC Prediction for End of 2024: </strong>$62,000</li>
<li><strong>BTC Prediction for End of 2025: </strong>$83,000</li>
<li><strong>BTC Prediction for End of 2030: </strong>$150,000</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin’s Utility &#8211; What Does the Future Hold?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Answering the question &#8220;Is Bitcoin still a good investment?&#8221; involves taking a closer look at the coin&#8217;s utility – or lack thereof. Naturally, Bitcoin&#8217;s primary use case is to allow individuals and businesses to transfer cash in a decentralized manner. Not only is this considered safer by many, but it&#8217;s often a lot cheaper, too.</p>
<p>For the longest time, Bitcoin&#8217;s popularity revolved around this aspect. People no longer had to rely on centralized banking institutions to handle their payments – they could ‘step outside’ the system and use Bitcoin instead. Furthermore, since BTC had first-mover status in this regard, it was often the go-to for those looking to make decentralized payments.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234887/bitcoin-utility-1.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Utility " /></figure>
<p>However, as more people opted to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-much-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency.htm">invest in cryptocurrency</a>, new and exciting projects began to spring up that challenged Bitcoin. Projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano implemented ‘smart contract’ functionality, which created limitless possibilities for decentralized application (dApp) developers. In turn, this began to affect Bitcoin’s reputation.</p>
<p>The critical issue is that Bitcoin&#8217;s utility is lacking relative to these other projects. As stated by <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/25/bitcoin-btc-value-drop-use-case-currency-digital-gold/">Fortune.com</a>, the Bitcoin network is hobbled by a lack of capacity. Moreover, Bitcoin&#8217;s network still relies on the outdated &#8216;mining&#8217; process, which is exceptionally energy-intensive and has been roundly criticized by all corners of the media.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234888/bitcoin-utility-2.jpg" alt="Rack of BTC Servers" /></figure>
<p>All of these factors play into the increasingly bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin. Although the coin has had some significant milestones in recent years, such as becoming legal tender in El Salvador, many believe this to be a result of its first-mover status. When compared to other crypto projects, Bitcoin can&#8217;t really compete.</p>
<p>So is Bitcoin a good investment when taking these points into account? In our eyes, Bitcoin is now deriving its value from its scarcity rather than its utility. Over time, it&#8217;s unlikely that this approach will hold up – meaning investors may need to look elsewhere for high returns.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Is Bitcoin a Good Long-Term Investment or Short-Term Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Following on from the previous section, there’s a school of thought that Bitcoin has evolved from being a long-term investment to a short-term investment. Although it might not be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next cryptocurrency to explode</a>, BTC has still shown itself capable of outperforming equities on the smaller timeframes.</p>
<p>For this reason, many people opt to day trade Bitcoin, as it’s not uncommon for the coin’s value to rise by 5% (or more) in a matter of hours. The image below highlights this, yet this isn&#8217;t an isolated incident – moves like this occur regularly.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/331921/btc-all-time-28091.jpg" alt="Bitcoin/USD Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s important to remember that bearish moves are just as common. The crypto market is inherently volatile, so day trading BTC is best-suited to risk-seeking traders. However, those happy to trade both sides of the market may find an abundance of opportunities – making it a viable alternative to the FX market.</p>
<p>But is Bitcoin a good investment over the long term? We struggle to believe that BTC has superior long-term value due to its reliance on high-energy mining processes and the lack of utility. As such, we believe BTC is best for short-term traders – investors with a long-term investment horizon may find better opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<h3><strong>BTC 2024 Halving</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/halving/">next Bitcoin halving will take place in 2024</a>. This event will limit the influx of new BTC tokens into the market. </p>
<p>This halving will halve mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Historically, halvings significantly influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price. </p>
<p>After the 2012 halving, we saw an incredible four-digit rise. Post-2016 halving, the price grew by over 280% in the following months. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/326707/bitcoin-price-index/">After 2020&#8217;s halving, Bitcoin surged by more than 500% and peaked at a record $69,000 in November 2021</a>. Should Bitcoin demand escalate, BTC coins&#8217; value might potentially surge significantly.</p>
<h2><strong>What Experts Say on Whether You Should Invest in Bitcoin</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Experts often weigh in on the debate of &#8220;Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin?&#8221; which tends to influence the minds of retail investors. This is understandable, as when a high-authority figure places their backing behind an asset, it&#8217;s likely that a sizable percentage of the investment community will follow what they are saying.</p>
<p>With that in mind, detailed below are three high-profile names that have discussed Bitcoin in the past, along with their thoughts on the coin:</p>
<h3><strong>Elon Musk</strong></h3>
<p>Elon Musk needs no introduction, as the CEO of Tesla (and the new owner of Twitter) is regularly in the headlines for a myriad of reasons. In 2021, Musk revealed that Tesla had invested significantly in Bitcoin. However, as reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62246367">BBC</a>, Tesla has since offloaded 75% of its BTC holdings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234890/elon-musk.jpg" alt="Elon Musk Twitter Owner" /></p>
<p>Whether this was to raise capital or because insiders believed Bitcoin was past its peak remains to be seen. However, Musk has stated in the past that he wants to see Bitcoin &#8220;succeed&#8221; and that he wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;dump&#8221; the coin. </p>
<h3><strong>Michael Saylor</strong></h3>
<p>Michael Saylor is the co-founder of MicroStrategy, a US-based business intelligence firm. Saylor is estimated to have a net worth of roughly $500m and is a strong advocate for Bitcoin. In fact, MicroStrategy has become the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, owning around 130,000 BTC at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Saylor has been quoted as saying that Bitcoin represents “the digital transformation of money, property, currency, energy &amp; matter”. The entrepreneur has also stated that he believes BTC could be valued at more than $65,000 in the next four years, highlighting his bullish stance.</p>
<h3><strong>The Winklevoss Twins</strong></h3>
<p>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are best known for suing Mark Zuckerberg, claiming that he stole their idea for Facebook. However, the Winklevoss Twins have gone on to become prominent crypto investors and founded Gemini – one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234891/winklevoss-twins.jpg" alt="The Winklewoss Twins" /></p>
<p>Tyler Winklevoss has been quoted as saying that “Bitcoin is better than gold”, whilst Cameron Winklevoss has stated that the coin has “a tremendous power of social good behind it”. Moreover, the Twins are reportedly one of the world’s largest BTC holders, owning around 1% of the total supply.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Where to Buy Bitcoin</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors wondering, &#8220;Should I sell my Bitcoin – or should I buy more?&#8221; will need to partner with a safe and reliable platform to facilitate their trades. All top crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">exchanges</a> will offer Bitcoin trading services because it is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-trade.htm">most-traded crypto</a> globally. However, given the abundance of options, deciding which platform to use can be challenging. </p>
<p>Fortunately, we’ve completed the necessary research and testing and found that <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> is one of the best places for investors looking to get involved in the crypto market. For those unaware, eToro is one of the world&#8217;s largest online brokers and serves more than 28 million users worldwide.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234892/etoro-1.jpg" alt="eToro Crypto Portfolio" /></figure>
<p>Are you wondering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-cryptocurrency-safe.htm" rel="nofollow">if cryptocurrency is safe</a>? Regarding the issue of safety, eToro is regulated by several top-tier organizations, including the FCA, ASIC, CySEC, FinCEN, and FINRA. eToro users can trade 78 different coins, including Bitcoin and a selection of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a>. When buying or selling crypto, users simply have to pay a 1% transaction fee plus the bid/ask spread.</p>
<p>eToro also streamlines the trading process by enabling users to create custom watchlists and analyze coins with real-time price charts. Users can employ a selection of technical indicators and even lock up the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">best staking coins</a> to generate recurring income using eToro’s dedicated staking service.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234893/etoro-2.jpg" alt="eToro Benefits" /></p>
<p>Those looking to buy Bitcoin right away can fund their accounts with as little as $10 using a credit/debit card, bank transfer, or e-wallet (e.g. PayPal, Skrill). Deposits are free to make, and eToro even offers &#8216;fractional investing&#8217; – meaning users can invest in BTC from just $10 per position.</p>

<h2><strong>Should I Buy Bitcoin Now? Our Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In conclusion, is Bitcoin a good investment? Like many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">best future cryptocurrency projects</a>, Bitcoin&#8217;s value has decreased substantially over the past year due to adverse macroeconomic factors. Whilst sentiment towards the coin may have been bullish before, it certainly isn&#8217;t now.</p>
<p>In our opinion, Bitcoin undoubtedly still has a role to play in the crypto market&#8217;s growth – yet not as big a role as it has had previously. Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8216;first-mover&#8217; status has paved the way for new and exciting projects to take centre stage, gradually pushing the coin towards the back of the pack.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/234894/should-i-buy-bitcoin.jpg" alt="Bitcoin vs US Dollar" /></figure>
<p>The coin’s lack of utility and outdated validation process has made it difficult for the project to innovate and keep up with the likes of Ethereum and Solana. Moreover, there are now hundreds (if not thousands) of tokens that can facilitate decentralized payments, so Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8216;unique selling point&#8217; (USP) is no more.</p>
<p>We do believe that Bitcoin can increase in value over the coming years since it is favored by financial institutions, meaning that it&#8217;ll likely be the go-to for investment products (e.g. ETFs) focused on crypto. However, retail investors looking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-get-rich-off-crypto.htm">get rich off crypto</a> are best looking elsewhere.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Alternatives</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve provided our thoughts on the question of &#8220;Is Bitcoin a good investment?&#8221;, let&#8217;s look at some alternative coins. </p>
<p>Given the saturated nature of the market, finding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-big-crypto.htm">next big crypto</a> can be challenging. </p>
<p>However, investors should consider that even should Bitcoin reach $100,000 in the next bull run &#8211; a figure that would require an incredible pump and huge volume &#8211; that would only represent a 4x ROI.</p>
<p>Nothing to be sniffed at, certainly, but there are other opportunities in the market to make larger gains, although they can come with larger risks.</p>
<p>Investing in top altcoins or new cryptos is a potentially lucrative way to earn ROI from crypto, as they can offer lower entry points and larger room for growth.</p>
<p>We would always recommend having a diverse investment portfolio that includes safer assets, such as Bitcoin, as well as some riskier ones. The sections below discuss a few alternative investments to Bitcoin. Both the cryptos are currently available to buy on presale. </p>
<h3><b>Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; New Bitcoin Alternative Will Burn Tokens and Offer Staking Rewards After the Approval of the First Bitcoin ETF </b></h3>
<p>One of the best alternatives to Bitcoin at this time is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) &#8211; a new ERC-20 token. This cryptocurrency is available to buy during its first presale stage for just $0.005 per token. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1316" height="604" class="aligncenter wp-image-128482" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699437443-bitcoin-etf-token-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699437443-bitcoin-etf-token-presale.png 1316w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699437443-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699437443-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-1024x470.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699437443-bitcoin-etf-token-presale-768x352.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1316px) 100vw, 1316px" /></p>
<p>Notably, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn a portion of its token supply depending on the first Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) schedule. For instance, once the first Bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC &#8211; Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 5% of its token supply. Another 5% will be burned after the ETF is launched. </p>
<p>There will be 5 burning events in total &#8211; resulting in a total burn of 25% of the token supply. Furthermore, Bitcoin ETF Token will also offer staking rewards as each milestone is complete. Currently, Bitcoin ETF Token has a 2.1 billion token supply &#8211; and has allocated 40% of the tokens for a ten-stage presale. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, the first round is allocating $BTCETF at just $0.005 per token. By the final round, the price will increase by 36% to $0.0068. Early investors can also access higher staking rewards by locking tokens on a smart contract. </p>
<p><iframe title="New BITCOIN ETF 10X Potential Crypto Presale?! (WHY THIS MIGHT 10X?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NhSSPSzmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>At press time, the staking APYs (Annual Percentage Yield) is 2,650%. Over 10.7 million tokens have already been locked on the verified smart contract. Thus, the staking APYS and deflationary tokenomics can make $BTCETF a good alternative to Bitcoin. </p>
<p>By the end of the presale, Bitcoin ETF Token aims to raise nearly $5 million. A successful crypto exchange listing could help push the price upwards in the long run.

<h3><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; New Stake-to-Mine Crypto Offering 11,000% APY</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a> is a new crypto ICO that has just launched but quickly raised more than $200,000.</p>
<p>It is the world&#8217;s first stake-to-mine project and allows token holders to enter into the ecosystem for just $10 and be part of a safe, secure and tokenized cloud mining project.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/331929/bitcoin-minetrix-mining.jpg" alt="Mine Crypto With Bitcoin Minetrix" /></figure>
<p>Traditional Bitcoin mining has become too expensive &#8211; due to the hardware required and soaring energy prices &#8211; for average investors to take part in.</p>
<p>Cloud mining has been a popular alternative but the market has become riddled with scammers, with high entry fees, fixed-term contracts that cannot be broken, and hidden fees that make it unclear how much BTC will actually be earned.</p>
<p>By tokenizing the process, Bitcoin Minetrix allows retail investors to mine BTC while also keeping autonomy and control by holding onto their tokens.</p>
<p>The project works by BTCMTX holders staking their tokens to generate cloud mining credits which can then be burnt for allocated cloud mining time &#8211; allowing a holder to earn BTC. The whole process is easily managed by a dedicated mobile app that is currently in development.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94105/331930/stake-to-mine.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Cloud Mining" /></figure>
<p>Token holders are also able to stake tokens to earn incredible annual percentage yield with the current APY at over 11,000% &#8211; although that will drop.</p>
<p>The ICO has only just launched and is already making huge waves in the space, with almost $250k raised.</p>
<p>Tokens cost $0.011 during the first stage of the presale, with 10 stages in total, with the price to increase 8% to $0.0119 in the final stage.</p>

<h2>Is Bitcoin a Good Investment in 2023? Verdict</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Despite its huge drop since its 2021 peak price, Bitcoin remains one of the safest and best cryptocurrency investments, especially for those with a long-term view.</p>
<p>Institutional investors continue to look at BTC as &#8216;digital gold&#8217; with the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity &#8211; companies with trillions of dollars of assets under management &#8211; even moving to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs, showing their confidence in its future.</p>
<p>With the next Bitcoin halving due in mid-2024, a major catalyst in previous bull runs, many consider BTC&#8217;s current price to be a discount ahead of future gains.</p>
<p>We would always recommend having a diverse portfolio that includes Bitcoin &#8211; a relatively &#8216;safe&#8217; crypto investment &#8211; as well as some riskier projects that could outperform BTC. As outlined above, Bitcoin ETF Token is a new cryptocurrency and potential alternative investment opportunity to Bitcoin. </p>
<p>With $BTCETF, investors can earn huge staking yields, and buy the token before the price increases throughout the presale. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Is Bitcoin still worth investing in?</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin may still be worth investing in for those seeking exposure to the digital currency market. Although Bitcoin&#8217;s explosive growth may be a thing of the past, it has shown an ability to outperform other asset classes – making it a suitable option for risk-seeking investors.</p>
<p><strong>Is Bitcoin a good investment long term?</strong></p>
<p>If Bitcoin were to be considered a good investment over the long term, we&#8217;d need clarity in the regulatory landscape. The rules around BTC are still unclear in many countries, which has stifled growth. If this were to clear up, we could see the sentiment around BTC become bullish once more.</p>
<p><strong>Will Bitcoin go back up in 2023?</strong></p>
<p>September is typically a bad month for Bitcoin &#8211; historically posting a losing month for the last six years. It is possible, therefore, that BTC could recover by the end of the year. 2024 is expected to be a good year for Bitcoin, perhaps even the start of a bull run, as the next halving is due around April.</p>
<p><strong>Can you make money from Bitcoin?</strong></p>
<p>Yes – like all investment assets, Bitcoin has a value dictated by supply and demand forces. This means that if someone were to buy Bitcoin and the price increased, they could sell their Bitcoin holdings and make a profit.</p>

<h2><strong>A Closer Look at the Best Cryptos to Invest in on Reddit</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those who opted to invest in Bitcoin a few years back were able to get in at a low price – ensuring they could benefit from the exponential price increases that followed. Although Bitcoin’s dramatic price swings may be a thing of the past, there are still many exciting projects that could offer similar returns.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at these trending ICOs and existing crypto projects, discussing what they are, how they work, and their valuation potential for the future.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Most Popular Reddit Crypto Tied To SEC Approval of BTC ETFs</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is the top Reddit coin at the present time, offering a 450% dynamic yield and an aggressive 25% token burn. But these are not the reasons why it&#8217;s the most popular crypto among Redditors. </p>
<p>The campaign is concerned with SEC approval of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds in the USA. If this happens, something which many experts are suggesting, it will have massive implications for the entire crypto economy. </p>
<p> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130890" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Homepage" width="900" height="439" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-768x375.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>It could open up the market by hundreds of billions of dollars, and push forward a new crypto bull run. The price of individual tokens could all increase significantly. And Bitcoin ETF Token could appreciate by far more than other tokens. </p>
<p>This is because it is specifically designed to increase should the approval materialize. The campaign has a roadmap that coincides with key events in the wider market, chiefly the Bitcoin ETF ratification by the SEC. So it could easily 10x if it takes place, which may happen as soon as December 2023. </p>
<p>Aside from the APY and the 25% token burn, the campaign provides an automatic price increase of nearly 40% from round one to round ten. There are ten presale rounds. The first round price is $0.0050 while the final round price is $0.0068.</p>
<p>A total of 840 million tokens are available in the presale, which is 40% of the 2.1 billion supply. Of the remaining allocation, 25% is set aside for staking, 25% for burning, and 10% for DEX liquidity. </p>
<p><iframe title="New BITCOIN ETF 10X Potential Crypto Presale?! (WHY THIS MIGHT 10X?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NhSSPSzmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is definitely a token to buy before any regulatory approval takes place, and not after. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; New Stake-to-Mine Crypto Offering High Staking Yields, Presale Soaring in Popularity </strong></h3>
<p>Redditors are looking for the next new cryptocurrency token in 2023. Some believe that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> can potentially be the next big presale and alternative to Bitcoin in the future. By leveraging $BTCMTX, the native token, Bitcoin Minetrix will revolutionize the cloud mining space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/334828/screen-shot-2023-10-24-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Presale" />Bitcoin Minetrix has one goal &#8211; to reduce the entry barrier and costs of mining cryptocurrency tokens. While cloud mining corporations rent mining power to customers, they are unreliable due to the large-scale prevalence of dubious activities taking place. Bitcoin Minetrix will offer transparency to its customers by leveraging blockchain technology to tokenize cloud mining into ERC-20 credits. </p>
<p>These credits can be earned by staking $BTCMTX into an Ethereum-based smart contract. Since the credits are recorded on the blockchain, they cannot be tampered with or duplicated. Thus, investors have autonomy and control over their holdings. </p>
<p>By burning your credits, you receive Bitcoin mining power. This is used to get allocated mining times and earn a portion of mining revenues. Your staked tokens will also offer annual yields as high as 270%. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/332638/bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics.jpg" alt="bitcoin minetrix tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>For all these reasons, Bitcoin Minetrix is gaining traction in crypto circles on Reddit. The newly launched $BTCMTX token is off to a buzzing start &#8211; having raised more than $2.2M in just over 3 weeks. The token is priced at $0.012 at the present time. </p>
<p>From a total supply of 4 billion, 2.8 billion tokens are being allocated through the presale. Bitcoin Minetrix aims to raise $32 million by the end of the presale before listing on crypto exchanges.

<h3><b>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Play-to-Earn Battle Arena Offering Wagering Rewards and High Staking APYs</b></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK). This new meme coin is soaring in popularity after the recent launch of the $MK presale. Meme Kombat is offering an AI-driven play-to-earn environment known as the battle arena. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-124026" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home.png" alt="Meme Kombat home" width="900" height="418" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home.png 1439w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>On this virtual ecosystem, players can fight against each other’s meme coin avatars. According to the Meme Kombat roadmap, the battle arena will host different meme coin characters such as Spongebob, Pepe, and Doge. Users can select their preferred avatars, and battle against each other to earn rewards. </p>
<p>Notably, $MK tokens can be wagered on Player vs Player battles, or against the CPU on Player vs Game modes. Bets can be made to predict the game outcomes and the next moves of your opponent. This feature adds a financial incentive to the battles, which can help increase the token’s adoption. </p>
<p>Token holders can also stake $MK to generate high APYs. For the duration of the presale, Meme Kombat is offering 112% APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) to staked token holders. After the presale ends, passive income will be offered through dynamic staking. In this scenario, your annual yields depend upon the total amount of tokens staked within the staking pool. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Hot New Meme Token With 30% Token Supply Reserved For Community Rewards, Raised Over $25 Million on Sold-Out Presale</strong></h3>
<p>Leading the latest wave of meme-coin popularity, Wall Street Bulls, a famous Ethereum NFT collection, has announced their new meme coin, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> ($WSM). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/332636/wsm-popular-memes.jpg" alt="wall street memes crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Leveraging their successful NFT collection, which sold out in just 30 minutes in 2021, the team plans to launch $WSM in line with current crypto trends. Recently, Wall Street Memes finished its successful presale &#8211; raising more than $25 million. On 26 September 2023, the $WSM token was listed on OKX &#8211; one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. </p>
<p>Now, the token is also trading on the Huobi exchange.</p>
<p>Usually, robust community support can ensure a platform&#8217;s long-term success despite presale risks. With one million followers across five social media platforms, Wall Street Memes highlights its wide acceptance and solid community backing.</p>
<p>This rapid growth has caught the attention of investors and influential figures like Elon Musk. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/277446/screenshot-2023-05-26-at-.jpg" alt="$WSM token fundamentals" /></figure>
<p>A cap of 2 billion tokens has been set for the total $WSM supply, and all tokens are reserved for the community. 50% was allocated for the presale, 30% for community rewards, and 20% for exchange liquidity. </p>
<p>Notably, there&#8217;s no team allocation, eliminating the risk of a rug pull and making it a fully community-driven project.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Launchpad XYZ &#8211; Cryptocurrency Giving Access to Multiple Web3 Experiences</strong></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency on our list is a portal for accessing multiple Web3 services and experiences. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a> informs and gives users access to different blockchain technology elements such as the metaverse, P2E hubs, and presales. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86643/273479/launchpad-xyz-3.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ market insights" /></figure>
<p>The $LPX token, which is currently on presale, can be used and staked within the ecosystem. Launchpad XYZ hosts a decentralized exchange (DEX) where $LPX can be leveraged to gain discounts on trading fees. </p>
<p>On the DEX, members can also trade fractionalized assets. This gives you part ownership in real-world assets offering historical value, such as cars, real estate, and art. The platform also allows members to search through all the NFT marketplaces and curate your own collection through the NFT gallery. </p>
<p>By making users stake $LPX to sell their NFTs on the ecosystem, Launchpad XYZ looks to increase the demand and use cases of the native cryptocurrency. This utility token can also be staked to access data on trading insights. Users can collect in-depth data on some of the top digital assets and compare the liquidity of different exchanges. </p>
<p>Users can browse and watch others participate in top P2E environments through the play-to-earn hub and wager on the outcomes. To learn more about the metaverse, Launchpad XYZ lets members check out other virtual environments through the metaverse experience library. </p>

<h3><strong>6. Chimpzee &#8211; Save The Planet With This Crypto Token</strong></h3>
<p>While many crypto initiatives are working on innovative financial solutions, there is a dearth of functioning environmental and social solutions. However, a new trend is on the rise, with a few trailblazing projects leading the way.</p>
<p>Chimpzee is one such project, with a focus on the preservation of the planet and its wildlife. Chimpzee offers a range of features that allow users to earn passive income while also contributing to environmental causes. These features include Play-to-Earn, Shop-to-Earn, and Trade-to-Earn, all of which are accessible via the Chimpzee shop, NFT marketplace, and Zero Tolerance Game. The team has reserved 10% of the token supply and a portion of profits to support organizations dedicated to these causes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/275718/image1.jpg" alt="Chimpzee ecofriendly crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Users can earn passive income most lucratively by holding a Chimpzee passport, which enables them to earn more CHMPZ tokens, rewards and advantages by engaging with various elements of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Chimpzee initiative will also launch a mobile application that employs AI technology to create personalized chimpanzee avatars for its users. These personalized passports will share some of the benefits of the Diamond NFT Passport.</p>
<p>To participate in the Chimpzee presale and procure these exclusive passports when they become available after, a total of 40 billion CHMPZ tokens will be offered across four rounds. In the present round, the cost per 1 CHMPZ is set at a starting price of $0.00125. It will be listed at $0.00185. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/275719/image1.jpg" alt="chimpzee crypto project promoting sustainability" /></figure>
<p>Receiving an opportunity to mint The Chimpzee Diamond NFT passport after the presale will provide users with the greatest rewards and highest earning potential, as the supply is restricted. Those who are unable to participate in the presale will pay a higher price for the passports and wait until after the whitelist NFT passport prelaunch, which is only accessible to presale investors. </p>
<p>Only individuals who took part in Stage 1 of the presale will be granted access to mint the Diamond NFT passport. Chimpzee has the ability to have a significant influence on environmental initiatives and is certainly worth observing. Seizing the opportunity to participate in the presale early on provides benefits that are difficult to resist.</p>

The project is on a mission to build the number-one social online gambling platform where users can earn a daily yield based on the casino’s performance &#8211; making it the future leading eGambling platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/276952/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="scorpion casino presale " /></p>
<p>The platform aims to provide its users with a seamless and fun gaming experience with its 210 casino games and 160 live games. The games are highly polished as the casino is connected with all major gaming providers, including Evolution, NetEnt, and AMATIC. As a result, everybody’s favorite casino games are available on the platform, including blackjack, roulette, poker, and slots.</p>
<p>In addition, Scorpion Casino also has a separate sports betting product, allowing users to place bets on the outcome of their favorite sports games. The product includes all major sports leagues for sports like football, basketball, tennis, horse racing, boxing, and MMA. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/276953/scorpion-football-min.jpg" alt="scorpion casino sports betting " /></figure>
<p>The casino is fully regulated and licensed by the Curacao EGaming licensing entity, making the casino completely transparent and provably fair. It also works with reputable platforms like BetRadar and CoinsPaid to provide the best possible experience.</p>
<p>The SCORP token is the native token behind the platform and is the exclusive payment method for the entire ecosystem. It’s also the default currency for betting on the sports and casino products.

<h3><strong>9. DeFi Coin (DEFC) – Leading DeFi Token Offering Passive Income Potential</strong></h3>
<p>Those looking for the best crypto to buy right now on Reddit within the decentralized finance (DeFi) niche should consider checking out <a href="https://deficoins.io/">DeFi Coin</a>. DEFC is the native token of DeFi Swap, a new decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers static rewards, automatic liquidity pools, and token swapping services. </p>
<p>DEFC holders receive regular income through the aforementioned static rewards system. A tax of 10% is levied on DEFC-based transactions, with 5% of this amount being distributed back to token holders. The remaining 5% is used to provide liquidity to the DeFi Swap exchange.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/218887/defi-coin.jpg" alt="DeFi coin candlestick chart" /></figure>
<p>In addition, DeFi Coin also has an integrated ‘manual burn’ mechanism designed to reduce the token supply over time. Unlike other projects, the exact number of tokens to be burned will be decided by DEFC’s development team through discussions with the community – ensuring the proposed solution suits all parties.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, DeFi Coin&#8217;s price is hovering around the $0.0024 level – substantially lower than September 2021&#8217;s highs. However, many believe this is an ideal opportunity to acquire DEFC tokens at a discount before the crypto market picks up steam once more.</p>

<h3><strong>10. PancakeSwap (CAKE) – Popular DEX Regularly Discussed on Reddit</strong></h3>
<p>PancakeSwap is a leading DEX focused on BEP-20 tokens hosted on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The exchange has become a go-to for investors interested in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-yield-farming.htm">yield farming</a> due to its high staking rewards and low fees.</p>
<p>CAKE is the native token of the PancakeSwap exchange, which can be used in the offered &#8216;syrup pools&#8217; to generate rewards. The token is crucial to providing the liquidity needed to facilitate token swaps since PancakeSwap operates as an automated market maker, doing away with the traditional order book method.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/218888/pancakeswap.jpg" alt="CAKE token candlestick TradingView chart" /></figure>
<p>Thanks to CAKE’s utility, it has become a popular token on Reddit over the past year, leading to it being listed on several centralized exchanges (CEXs), including Binance, Huobi, and Gate.io. </p>
<p>As the crypto market continues to grow and DeFi begins to take over, PancakeSwap is expected to increase in size – meaning investing in CAKE could prove to be a wise move over for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long-term crypto investment</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Ethereum (ETH) – Respected Blockchain Network with Major Upgrade Scheduled</strong></h3>
<p>No discussion of the best crypto to buy now Reddit would be complete without mentioning Ethereum. As noted by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, Ethereum remains the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of over $188 billion.</p>
<p>Many investors on Reddit are clamoring to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ethereum.htm">buy Ethereum</a> ahead of ‘the Merge’, which refers to the upcoming transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. This transition will make the Ethereum network much more scalable, helping reduce the high GAS fees which have plagued it over the past year.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/218889/ethereum.jpg" alt="ETH token candlestick TradingView chart" /></figure>
<p>The move to &#8216;Ethereum 2.0&#8217; can only be good news for ETH investors, as the hope is that it will attract more dApp developers than ever to the network. This will increase demand for ETH, helping push the price higher. Since Ethereum is still trading well below November 2021&#8217;s all-time highs, this may be the ideal time to obtain ETH at a discount.</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>12. Bancor (BNT) – Top DeFi Protocol Trading at a Discount</strong></h3>
<p>Bancor is another DeFi protocol popularized through Reddit thanks to its automated market maker (AMM) approach. Much like other protocols, Bancor uses smart contracts to facilitate trades without an intermediary through &#8216;liquidity pools&#8217;. </p>
<p>However, Bancor differentiates itself by offering protection from ‘impermanent loss’. This is achieved by matching users’ liquidity pool deposits with BNT, Bancor’s native token, which enables users to be partially or fully compensated in the unlikely instance that they lose funds.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/218890/bancor.jpg" alt="BNT candlestick TradingView chart" /></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bancor-tvl-down-30-since-045931890.html#:~:text=Bancor%20TVL%20Drops%2030%25%20After%20Suspending%20Protection%20from%20Impermanent%20Loss,-Owen%20Fernau&amp;text=Total%20value%20locked%20(TVL)%20in,Defiant's%20newly%20released%20chart%20feature.">Yahoo Finance</a> reported in July that Bancor&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) dropped by around 30% after the protocol paused this impermanent loss protection. However, this protection service is expected to be upgraded and resume in the future – with many Redditors believing this could be a catalyst for tremendous growth.</p>

<h3><strong>13. Bitcoin (BTC) – World’s Largest Cryptocurrency Set for a Rebound</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin remains one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies on Reddit, even after its dramatic fall from grace in recent months. It’s important to note that BTC’s price decreases appear to be related more to external economic events than the technology itself.</p>
<p>This means Redditors continue to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin.htm">invest in Bitcoin</a>, hoping for a rebound soon. Bitcoin is by far the most-adopted digital currency worldwide, meaning it’s the most in-demand crypto – providing a platform for a future rebound.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/218891/bitcoin.jpg" alt="BTC candlestick TradingView chart" /></figure>
<p>Another factor that may hint at a reversal in fortunes is that the Fed looks to be easing its aggressive monetary policy. Interest rates have continued to rise to combat inflation, which has taken its toll on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With these rate increases slowing (or stopping altogether), BTC and other crypto-assets are primed to benefit. Some analysts have suggested that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price prediction</a> for 2025 could see the world&#8217;s largest PoW coin climb back up to its ATH of $68.8k in November 2021.</p>

<h2><strong>Best Reddit Crypto Groups</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>Reddit crypto groups, referred to as ‘subreddits’, are a place for crypto investors to come together and discuss anything and everything related to the digital currency markets. Discussions often revolve around the best crypto to buy on Reddit and the projects with the highest potential.</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presented below are four leading Reddit crypto groups that investors can participate in to identify cryptocurrencies that could explode in the future:</p>
<h3><strong>r/CryptoCurrency</strong></h3>
<p>One of the top places to find the best crypto on Reddit is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/">r/CryptoCurrency</a>. This subreddit has almost 6 million members and has been operating since March 2013. All market areas are covered on r/CryptoCurrency, ranging from altcoins to metaverse tokens.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/218895/cryptocurrency.jpg" alt="r/cryptocurrency subreddit" /></figure>
<p>The &#8216;Daily General Discussion&#8217; thread is a great way to find popular crypto projects since this thread is updated every day with the latest information. Users can also filter the threads by the &#8216;Discussion&#8217; flair to quickly find serious and objective analyses of cryptos.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>r/binance</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>As the name suggests, </strong></i><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/"><i><strong>r/binance</strong></i></a><i><strong> is a subreddit dedicated to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, </strong></i><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/"><i><strong>Binance</strong></i></a><i><strong>. This exchange lets users trade over 350+ cryptos, and has a daily trading volume of more than $7 billion. </strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, although many threads focus on exchange-related topics, Redditors still use this subreddit to highlight their opinions on specific coins. </p>
<p>Since the best crypto to buy on Reddit are often listed on Binance, discussions tend to gravitate towards price predictions for altcoins, DeFi tokens, and other digital assets. Beginners will also find r/binance helpful since the community seems more than happy to help with any questions.  </p>
<h3><strong>r/SatoshiStreetBets</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/">r/SatoshiStreetBets</a> occupies a unique position regarding subreddits since it combines real-world analysis with humorous memes. As its name implies, this subreddit draws inspiration from the super-popular r/WallStreetBets community, which has over 12.5 million members.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86938/218896/satoshistreetbets.jpg" alt="r/satoshistreetbets subreddit" /></figure>
<p>Unlike r/WallStreetBets, r/SatoshiStreetBets focuses exclusively on cryptocurrency. More specifically, this subreddit tends to lean towards <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-penny-crypto.htm">penny cryptos</a> and those with high potential rather than &#8216;established&#8217; cryptos like BTC and ETH.</p>
<h3><strong>r/CryptoMarkets</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/">r/CryptoMarkets</a> is also a great place to identify the best crypto to invest in on Reddit for those with a bit more market experience. This is because r/CryptoMarkets often presents in-depth discussions that may be difficult for newcomers to understand. </p>
<p>Redditors will usually post articles from Bloomberg and other high-profile media outlets to support the points made. In addition, a significant portion of the threads is devoted to technical analysis, with clear reasoning given for users&#8217; predictions.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>How to Buy $BTCETF Tokens &#8211; Best Reddit Crypto</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<p>Given the rapid expansion of the crypto market in the past few years, the need for accurate and reliable analysis systems is more significant than ever – and Dash 2 Trade looks set to meet this need. The project&#8217;s presale raised around $500,000 in its first 24 hours after going live and has already raised almost $7.5 million.</p>
<p>Within Dash 2 Trade’s platform, users can benefit from a wide range of services, including regular trading signals, on-chain analysis tools, social sentiment indicators, trading competitions, and even a strategy backtesting tool. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91649/229272/what-is-1.jpg" alt="Dash 2 Trade Tools And Features" /></figure>
<p>The exciting thing about Dash 2 Trade is that all of these features are suited to both beginners and experienced traders, ensuring there’s something for everyone. </p>
<p>We’ll explore these services in detail later in the article, but for now, it’s important to note that the Dash 2 Trade ecosystem is powered by D2T. </p>
<p>This ERC-20 token has the potential to become the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-trade.htm">best crypto to trade</a> since those wishing to access Dash 2 Trade&#8217;s most advanced features must pay a monthly subscription fee that is denominated in D2T.</p>
<p>Dash 2 Trade’s team is currently hosting a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presale</a>, which allows investors to acquire D2C tokens at a discount before they&#8217;re listed on centralized or decentralized exchanges. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at this presale, explicitly focusing on the investment process.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Buy Dash 2 Trade – Full Tutorial</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those looking to buy Dash 2 Trade can do so through the ongoing presale. Presales are a popular way for new crypto projects to raise capital and generate momentum ahead of any proposed CEX or DEX listing.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, D2C tokens are priced at just $0.0513. So, without further ado, detailed below are the five quick steps investors must take to buy Dash 2 Trade tokens today:</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 – Create a Crypto Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>The first thing investors must do is set up a crypto wallet. These wallets are designed to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-store-cryptocurrency-safely.htm">store cryptocurrency safely</a>, although it’s crucial that the chosen wallet is able to support ERC-20 tokens – as this is the token standard used by D2C.</p>
<p>There are many wallets with this functionality, although we recommend using MetaMask, as it’s free to use and can be set up in minutes. To get a MetaMask wallet, head to the <a href="https://metamask.io/">official website</a> and click &#8216;Download&#8217;. Choose the appropriate operating system on the following page and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91649/229276/download-metamask.jpg" alt="Metamask For iPhone" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2 – Acquire ETH or USDT</strong></h3>
<p>Investors must then acquire some Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT), as these are the tokens used to exchange into D2T. These digital currencies can be bought using most top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">exchanges</a> and then transferred to the wallet created in Step 1.</p>
<p>Alternatively, investors can buy ETH directly through the Dash 2 Trade website. Dash 2 Trade&#8217;s team has partnered with the payments gateway Transak, meaning that investors can obtain ETH using a credit/debit card or bank transfer.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 – Connect Wallet to Presale Dashboard</strong></h3>
<p>Head to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/">Dash 2 Trade’s website</a> and click the ‘Connect Wallet’ button. A pop-up box will appear, in which investors can choose their wallet provider and link their wallet to the presale dashboard.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91649/229274/connect-wallet.jpg" alt="Presale Wallet Provider Options" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 4 – Buy Dash 2 Trade Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>An order box will appear on-screen, in which investors can choose whether to make the exchange using ETH or USDT. Investors must also decide how many D2T tokens they’d like to obtain – the minimum investment threshold is 1,000 D2T. Once everything has been double-checked, follow the instructions to confirm the exchange.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 5 – Claim Dash 2 Trade Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>Once Dash 2 Trade&#8217;s presale has ended, there will be a Token Generation Event (TGE), which is when the tokens are actually created. Following this, investors can claim their purchased tokens by clicking the &#8216;Claim&#8217; button on Dash 2 Trade&#8217;s homepage.</p>

<h3><strong>D2T Tokens – The Heart of Dash 2 Trade</strong></h3>
<p>Dash 2 Trade is powered by D2T – the ecosystem’s native ERC-20 token. According to <a href="https://dash2trade.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf">Dash 2 Trade’s whitepaper</a>, this token has several essential use cases within the platform. However, its primary use case is enabling holders to access Dash 2 Trade&#8217;s advanced tools and features, which are reserved for members of the &#8216;Starter&#8217; and &#8216;Premium&#8217; tiers.</p>
<p>Since D2T acts as an ‘entry pass’ to these tiers, it looks likely to become the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hottest-crypto-to-buy.htm">hottest crypto to buy</a> for those interested in upping their trading performance. The Starter tier requires a monthly membership fee of 400 D2T, whilst the Premium tier costs 1,000 D2T per month.</p>

<p>Alternatively, investors can utilize the Free tier to get an idea of what Dash 2 Trade can offer. This tier offers a selection of basic tools and features, yet it is designed to act as a &#8216;trial&#8217; for the paid tiers – as these are the ones that contain the most beneficial perks.</p>
<p>A final point to note on Dash 2 Trade is that the development team has been KYC-verified on CoinSniper, and the smart contract code has been thoroughly audited by SolidProof – providing a high degree of credibility to the project. </p>

<h2><strong>Is Dash 2 Trade a Good Investment? Key Points</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Like most <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects, Dash 2 Trade looks to offer something different, ensuring it stands out within the ultra-competitive crypto market. With that in mind, detailed below are some of the main reasons why Dash 2 Trade could represent a good investment opportunity:</p>
<h3><strong>World-Class Analysis Tools</strong></h3>
<p>The platform&#8217;s suite of world-class tools and features is one of the key justifications for Dash 2 Trade being a stellar investment opportunity. These days, investors looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-on-the-dip.htm">best crypto to buy on the dip</a> must use numerous platforms and data sources to inform their decisions, which can complicate matters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91649/229279/returns-potential.jpg" alt="Trading Signals Dash 2 Trade" /></p>
<p>Dash 2 Trade offers a much more streamlined solution by providing trading signals, on-chain analysis, strategy testing, and sentiment indicators in one platform. This means traders don&#8217;t need to go anywhere else to conduct their asset research.</p>
<h3><strong>Huge Price Potential</strong></h3>
<p>Since D2T tokens are inextricably linked to the Dash 2 Trade platform, their value will naturally rise as the platform expands. Given the growing need for Dash 2 Trade’s features, this expansion could be rapid – meaning an investment in D2T could prove fruitful. </p>
<p>Due to this, D2T is undoubtedly one of the top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm">cryptos to watch</a> in the months ahead, especially if the development team obtains some major CEX or DEX listings. If this occurs, it&#8217;ll significantly increase liquidity and accessibility – which are two of the major catalysts for price momentum.</p>
<h3><strong>Rewards Potential Through Trading Competitions</strong></h3>
<p>One of Dash 2 Trade&#8217;s most exciting features is its trading competitions. Members of the Premium tier can access these competitions through an exclusive Discord server, with regular D2T-denominated prizes given to competition winners.</p>
<p>Naturally, this feature will appeal to experienced traders, as it could supply another income stream. Furthermore, these competitions also enable traders to network, providing scope for collaboration and more effective trading.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>No Tax on Trades</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, D2T could be a good investment since the development team has opted to make transactions tax-free. Since there’s no tax on buy or sell transactions, this reduces the barriers to entry for traders, helping boost liquidity massively.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91649/229280/d2t-tokens.jpg" alt="D2T Token Benefits" /></figure>
<p>The majority of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto projects</a> offer tax-free trades, as it makes tokens more appealing to scalpers and day traders. Although this aspect of the token may not be relevant during the presale phase, it will likely be crucial to D2T’s price potential.</p>
<h2><strong>Dash 2 Trade Price Action – What to Know</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Like many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-under-1-dollar.htm">best cryptos under $1</a>, the Dash 2 Trade project has been introduced via a presale phase. This means tokens are sold directly through the Dash 2 Trade website, meaning they are not publicly listed on exchanges yet. </p>
<p>Presales are a popular way for new projects to generate capital, and development teams tend to offer tokens at a discounted rate to entice investment. </p>
<p>This is the case with Dash 2 Trade, as investors can purchase tokens for just $0.0513 during stage three of the presale.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91649/239701/dash-2-trade-team.jpg" alt="Dash 2 Trade Team Profiles" /></figure>
<p>The presale was originally meant to last for nine presale phases but has been cut short much ahead of schedule with the developers ready to bring the protocol to market sooner than anticipated.</p>
<p>With the wider crypto market in chaos following the fall of FTX, investors and traders are crying out for tools and platforms that help them invest with confidence and maximize profit potential, with Dash 2 Trade a prime example of that.</p>
<p>The presale is now running for only four stages and while there was originally set to be 665 million tokens allocated, there are now just 262.5 million allocated for the presale &#8211; with 150 million of those already sold.</p>
<p>The final stage will see tokens sell for $0.0513, with a hard cap of around $13.5 million and no vesting period on presale tokens.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/"><strong>Visit Dash 2 Trade Now</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Dash 2 Trade Price Forecast</strong></h3>
<p>The minimum number of D2T tokens that investors can purchase through the presale is 1,000.</p>
<p> Owning 1,000 D2T tokens enables investors to access the Premium tier of the Dash 2 Trade ecosystem and puts them in line to benefit from any future price increases.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91649/229281/price-prediction.jpg" alt="Dash 2 Trade Roadmap" /></p>
<p>Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ieo-cryptos.htm">best IEO cryptos</a> get their start through a presale phase and then become listed on CEXs and DEXs. This appears to be the approach that Dash 2 Trade&#8217;s team is taking, as the project&#8217;s roadmap notes plans for an exchange listing drive in Q1 2023. </p>
<p>The project has already confirmed listings with LBank and BitMart and more exchange partnerships are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>A common theme with new token listings is that price rises almost immediately. This is due to several factors, including increased accessibility and pent-up demand from those unable to invest during the presale phase. Naturally, this is great news for early investors, as they can often generate triple-digit (or quadruple-digit) returns. </p>
<p>Ultimately, there&#8217;s no way to accurately estimate Dash 2 Trade&#8217;s future price due to it being so early in the project&#8217;s lifespan. However, given the success of previous major token listings like Tamadoge and Battle Infinity, risk-seeking investors may wish to get involved for the chance to generate market-beating returns.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Verdict?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In conclusion, this guide has covered everything investors need to know when buying Dash 2 Trade tokens, ensuring purchases are made as quickly and safely as possible.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Dash 2 Trade tokens are still available for $0.0513  – the lowest price that investors will now be able to acquire them. </p>
<p>Due to the collapse of FTX the developers will now bring Dash 2 Trade to the market much sooner than anticipated, with crypto investors crying out for a tool that can help them invest with confidence and maximize treading.</p>

<h2><strong>A Detailed Look at the Most Energy Efficient Cryptos for 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The lowest energy crypto projects are located in various market niches, highlighting the growing need for eco-friendly technologies across the board. Even many of the best metaverse coins now focus on sustainability, which has become an essential consideration for many investors. </p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the safe energy crypto projects listed above, exploring how their technology helps limit their carbon footprint.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong><strong>Number #1 Most Sustainable Crypto</strong> <strong>With </strong><strong>Over 2,000% Staking APY And</strong><strong> Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is an ERC20 token presale aiming to reward holders based on events around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Instead of using expensive computer hardware and lots of electricity to mine new tokens, $BTCETF token can be staked to earn a massive 2,000% APY, which makes it more energy efficient than Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Participate in the token presale by connecting your Ethereum-based wallet to the Bitcoin ETF Token presale page and use ETH, USDT or card to buy $BTCETF tokens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="460" class="alignnone wp-image-129625 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699610761-bitcoin-etf-token-2.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699610761-bitcoin-etf-token-2.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699610761-bitcoin-etf-token-2-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699610761-bitcoin-etf-token-2-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token presale will run in 10 stages where each consecutive stage will bring a higher token price. For the first stage, you can buy $BTCETF at a price of $0.0050 apiece, which will go as high as $0.0068 in the last stage. This makes purchasing the tokens as early as possible potentially the most rewarding outcome.</p>
<p>When you buy the tokens, you may want to consider staking. The APY stands at 2,000% in the early presale stages. However, expect this number to drop as more tokens get staked, meaning it&#8217;s best to stake as early as possible to take advantage of the high APY.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="348" class="alignnone wp-image-128560 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699443007-btcetf-staking.jpg" alt="BTCETF token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699443007-btcetf-staking.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699443007-btcetf-staking-300x116.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699443007-btcetf-staking-768x297.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The team will also use deflationary mechanics in the form of token burns, which forever remove a certain number of tokens from circulation. This will run in five stages as each stage removes 5% of the total supply. Each stage is connected to the Bitcoin spot ETF approval where some of the stages include the ETF approval itself, the first Bitcoin spot ETF launch as well as a total of $1 billion in assets under management by these ETFs.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) &#8211;  A Toke Presale That Targets BTC Cloud Mining By Staking Your Tokens</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</u></a> is our top pick in terms of sustainability, with an eco-friendly Ethereum design to provide an alternative to the harmful model of Bitcoin mining. </p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is known for its use of environmentally damaging hardware machines known as ASICs. They are terrible for the environment, guzzle up electricity, and need fans to keep cool. The industry is dominated by mining companies with huge financial resources.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/332962/screen-shot-2023-10-06-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix stake to mine dashboard" /></figure>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is run over Ethereum, which is known to be much more efficient and environmentally friendly in comparison to Bitcoin’s Proof-Of-Work design. Users stake their BTCMTX, which in turn generates non transferable ERC20 mining credits. These are then burned in return for BTC. The more mining credits burned, the more that is earned in total.</p>
<p>It’s an eco-friendly and simple concept that could prove to be a perfect alternative to Bitcoin mining. Even existing cloud mining industries do not have the ease or low investment cost of Bitcoin Minetrix. All that is required is a $10 investment and a compatible Web3 wallet to connect with the presale, such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect.</p>
<p>The token further retails at a discount right now, at $0.011. In the final stage (stage 10), this cost will rise to $0.0119. This is a genuine utility token that can assist the environment by using Ethereum instead of Bitcoin to cloud mine BTC rewards. Users can easily earn passive income while contributing to the environment, with the ease of one click staking.</p>
<p>Investors should read the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>official Bitcoin Minetrix Whitepaper</u></a> to understand all the details of this new stake-to-mine infrastructure.</p>
<p>The project socials (<a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinminetrix?s=21"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix"><u>Telegram</u></a>) are useful to keep abreast of all developments. </p>

<h3><strong>3. eTukTuk (TUK) &#8211; Offering Energy-Efficient EVs That Help Increase Driver Earnings By 4x</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/"><u>eTukTuk</u></a>, an energy-efficient crypto project based on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain, is paving the way toward a carbon-neutral future.</p>
<p>The project is driven by a desire to improve Sri Lanka&#8217;s conventional TukTuk vehicles. It integrates electric vehicles (EVs) with blockchain technology. This transformation, replacing high-emission vehicles with electric versions, is guided by eTukTuk&#8217;s mission of advancing safe, green transport.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315137/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk electric vehicle" /></figure>
<p>According to the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf?"><u>eTukTuk whitepaper</u></a>, the EVs feature a unique roll cage design for safety and sustainability. Moreover, the platform&#8217;s native crypto, $TUK, is currently in the whitelisting phase, a critical milestone before it is available on exchanges.</p>
<p>An essential feature of eTukTuk&#8217;s strategy is establishing a comprehensive charging network across Sri Lanka. This plan ensures economical EV charging, resulting in lower operational costs for drivers. The Capital Maharaja Group, a key Sri Lankan corporation, backs this vision. Their partnership facilitates local production, further lowering expenses and boosting drivers&#8217; income by 4x.</p>
<p>The platform also offers a new staking mechanism for its token owners. By allocating their tokens to power nodes, they can help in the functioning of charging stations and receive a yearly yield percentage (APY) from a staking pool, which increases as the transaction volume expands.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Ethereum (ETH) – Most Popular Energy-Efficient Cryptocurrency</strong></h3>
<p>Taking the next spot on our list of the most energy-efficient cryptocurrency projects is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. Most crypto investors will have heard of Ethereum, as it remains the second-largest cryptocurrency as measured by market cap (behind Bitcoin). </p>
<p>However, many believe Ethereum is actually more valuable than Bitcoin due to its many use cases and the huge number of projects that are built on the blockchain.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221421/ethereum.jpg" alt="Ethereum blockchain home page" /></figure>
<p>As a smart contract-enabled blockchain, Ethereum provides the foundation for decentralized app (dApp) developers to host their creations. This has led to massive innovation in various high-growth sectors, including NFTs, the metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-could-trigger-surge-of-interest-staking-entice-institutional-buyers.htm">Ethereum merge</a> saw the network move to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol. This removes the problems associated with crypto mining energy consumption since Ethereum&#8217;s blocks are now validated through staking. As a result, Ethereum&#8217;s energy requirements are now drastically lower than before. </p>
<p>To put this into context, a recent report by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/tech/ethereum-merge-crytocurrency-energy-consumption-hnk-intl/index.html">CNN</a> notes that the network will now use around 99.95% less energy than when it used a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. In turn, this reduced crypto energy consumption has driven Ethereum into the limelight, helping change people&#8217;s perceptions of the crypto market. </p>
<p>Overall, this energy-efficient crypto cryptocurrency tops our list due to its sheer size, making the team&#8217;s focus on sustainability even more impressive. Finally, given that Ethereum&#8217;s change to a PoS consensus protocol also makes the network much more scalable, this provides a solid foundation for further growth and the potential for ETH to become the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/greenest-cryptocurrency.htm">greenest cryptocurrency</a> on the market.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>6. Stellar (XLM) – Promising Energy-Efficient Cryptocurrency for Payment Processing</strong></h3>
<p>Another environmentally energy-efficient cryptocurrency to be aware of is Stellar. Stellar remains one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-searched-crypto.htm">most-searched crypto</a> projects globally due to its first-mover status. For those unaware, Stellar has made a name for itself in the payment processing space, attempting to revolutionize cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>Thanks to Stellar’s super-fast system, network users can send money anywhere, with transactions taking just five seconds to be processed. What’s more, these transactions cost just a fraction of a cent to complete – much cheaper than using the SWIFT network. Thanks to this innovative technology, Stellar has gone on to partner with leading institutions like IBM and MoneyGram.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221438/stellar.jpg" alt="Stellar crypto features" /></figure>
<p>Stellar can also be considered an energy-efficient cryptocurrency, as the network uses a unique ‘Proof-of-Agreement’ (PoA) consensus mechanism. According to the <a href="https://stellar.org/foundation/sustainability?locale=en">Stellar Foundation</a>, the network consumes just 0.173 Wh of electricity per transaction. Moreover, nodes that help validate transactions only consume around 261,435 kWh of electricity annually.</p>
<p>In addition to its low-energy nature, Stellar has partnered with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to create a solid framework to accurately measure the network&#8217;s energy use. Thanks to this, Stellar can now establish a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) commitment, helping reduce the network&#8217;s carbon footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy XLM with eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>7. Avalanche (AVAX) – Energy-Efficient Crypto with High Scalability</strong></h3>
<p>Avalanche is a super-fast blockchain network that emerged as a viable alternative to Ethereum in 2021. Instead of using just one chain, Avalanche adopts a &#8216;multi-chain&#8217; approach, allowing it to increase its scalability significantly. To put this into context, Avalanche can handle 4,500 transactions per second (TPS), whilst Ethereum could previously only manage around 30 before ‘the Merge’.</p>
<p>Like many other energy-efficient cryptos, Avalanche uses a PoS mechanism to validate blocks. This makes AVAX one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-stake-coins.htm">best proof-of-stake coins</a> since transaction finality is achieved in less than two seconds. As a result, Avalanche has become a popular option for dApp developers and NFT creators looking for high scalability.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221423/avalanche.jpg" alt="Avalanche features" /></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Avalanche is also an energy-efficient energy crypto backed by a recent report from the <a href="https://www.carbon-ratings.com/">Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute</a> (CCRI). This report found that the Avalanche blockchain uses just 0.0005% of the energy that the Bitcoin network does. It also uses just 0.0028% of Ethereum’s energy requirements – although this data was gathered before ‘the Merge’.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, the total annual energy consumption of the Avalanche network equates to that of just 46 US households. This puts Avalanche in the third spot in the list of the most energy-efficient cryptocurrency projects, ahead of leading entities like Algorand and Cardano.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy AVAX with eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>8. Solana (SOL) – Emerging Energy-Efficient Crypto for dApp Developers</strong></h3>
<p>Solana has long been considered one of the best <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/altcoins/">altcoins</a> on the market, rising to prominence in 2021 thanks to its high level of scalability. Much like Ethereum, Solana has full support for smart contracts, making the network a viable option for dApp developers. </p>
<p>However, Solana differentiates itself by using a hybrid consensus mechanism. This approach combines the benefits of Proof-of-Stake and &#8216;Proof-of-History&#8217;, which means the network can theoretically handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), with finality of just 2.5 seconds.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221424/solana.jpg" alt="Solana blockchain energy efficiency" /></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Solana’s unique approach also makes the network extremely energy-efficient. As noted on <a href="https://solana.com/environment">Solana’s website</a>, one network transaction uses just 2,707 Joules of energy – which is less power than three Google searches. In addition, minting an NFT on the Solana network uses around three times less energy than having an LED lightbulb on for an hour. </p>
<p>The Solana Foundation has also pledged funds to aid refrigerant destruction, which has been shown to be one of the best ways to reduce carbon emissions. In turn, this meant the Solana network achieved carbon neutrality in 2021.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>9. Cardano (ADA) – Low-Energy Blockchain with Peer-Reviewed Technology</strong></h3>
<p>Investors interested in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> may wish to consider Cardano. Cardano has been in the limelight over the past few years due to its systematic approach, which sees the development team rely heavily on peer-reviewed literature. </p>
<p>This approach, combined with the leadership of Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, has made Cardano an appealing option for dApp developers in various industries. Transactions on the Cardano network are validated using a PoS protocol called ‘Ouroboros’, which sees network participants stake their ADA tokens to receive block rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221425/cardano.jpg" alt="Cardano blockchain" /></figure>
<p>This energy-efficient crypto mining alternative has made Cardano one of the most sustainable blockchains – so much so that the development team has even appointed a &#8216;Group Head of Sustainability&#8217;. Moreover, Cardano&#8217;s team also vets every single investment to ensure any pledged funds will make a positive real-world impact. </p>
<p>From an energy use perspective, Cardano uses a reported 48,851 kWh of electricity per year – which is less than that of five US households. Finally, Cardano&#8217;s team even places significant emphasis on carbon offsetting, opting to use a green energy supplier for the Rotterdam office and urging employees to take the train where possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy ADA with eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>10. IOTA (MIOTA) – The Crypto with the Least Energy Consumption in the IoT Niche</strong></h3>
<p>IOTA is a crypto with low energy consumption that aims to promote the idea of the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT refers to the communication between different devices used in everyday life, ranging from TVs to smartphones and even refrigerators.</p>
<p>Many believe the concept of the IoT will become more evident in the years ahead, making IOTA one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto</a> projects to invest in. This is because IOTA helps facilitate transactions between devices using &#8216;The Tangle&#8217; – a distributed ledger that does not rely on mining for validation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221439/iota.jpg" alt="IOTA effect on climate" /></figure>
<p>Not only does this altogether remove transaction fees, but it also makes these transactions extremely energy-efficient. To put this into perspective, a recent <a href="https://blog.iota.org/energy-consumption-of-iota-2-0/">blog post</a> from IOTA’s team found that running the network&#8217;s underlying software for an entire year would mean node operators only consume around 0.000009% of what the Bitcoin network does. </p>
<p>This means IOTA&#8217;s annual node energy requirements are less than that of a typical German citizen’s – highlighting that this is a cryptocurrency that uses less energy than most. Moreover, IOTA&#8217;s team has placed significant focus on transparency, pledging to continue showing accurate energy consumption data for the network.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy MIOTA with eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>11. Hedera (HBAR) – Energy-Efficient Alternative to Blockchain Networks</strong></h3>
<p>Those looking for the crypto that uses the least energy may also wish to consider Hedera. Hedera occupies a unique position in the cryptocurrency market since this network doesn&#8217;t actually use blockchain technology. Instead, Hedera uses a unique &#8216;hashgraph&#8217; consensus mechanism designed by co-founder Leemon Baird.</p>
<p>This ‘hashgraph’ technology is relatively complex, although it is claimed to be faster and more secure than blockchain-based systems. Due to this, Hedera is highly scalable and can handle around 10,000 TPS with finality of just a few seconds.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221427/hedera.jpg" alt="Hedera smart contracts" /></figure>
<p>Hedera has also emerged as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-trending-cryptos.htm">top trending cryptos</a> due to the development team&#8217;s focus on sustainability. This focus has resulted in Hedera becoming carbon negative thanks to the regular purchase of carbon offsets. Offset amounts are determined through Hedera&#8217;s partnership with Terrapass to ensure accuracy and transparency. </p>
<p>What’s more, Hedera is also extremely energy-efficient and can process the equivalent of 10,000,000 transactions for the same amount of energy it takes the Bitcoin network to process one. Due to its low cryptocurrency energy consumption, Hedera will likely become increasingly popular as the need for sustainable networks grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy HBAR with eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>12. Tezos (XTZ) &#8211; Low-Power Blockchain with Innovative ‘Liquid Proof-of-Stake’ Protocol</strong></h3>
<p>Rounding off our list of the lowest energy crypto projects is Tezos. Tezos is often considered the best crypto by energy consumption due to its low carbon footprint, making the network appealing to dApp developers and NFT creators worldwide.</p>
<p>Tezos uses a &#8216;liquid Proof-of-Stake&#8217; system to validate transactions, which is very similar to traditional PoS mechanisms, yet makes the validation process even more accessible. With this system, network participants can become &#8216;bakers&#8217; if they hold more than 8,000 XTZ tokens or become delegators if they own less than this amount.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221428/tezos.jpg" alt="Tezos blockchain carbon footprint" /></figure>
<p>Each approach allows network participants to receive staking rewards, although the former obtains a higher percentage. In addition, this liquid PoS approach is extremely energy-efficient, consuming the same amount of energy per year as just 17 global citizens.</p>
<p>What’s more, Tezos’ technology will actually become more efficient as the network expands and transaction numbers increase, providing an incentive for environmentally-conscious dApp developers to get involved. Tezos has even partnered with PwC to assess the network’s carbon footprint, with the report freely available to all. </p>

<h2><strong>How Does a Cryptocurrency Become Energy Efficient?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although Bitcoin BSC and Ethereum top our list of the lowest energy crypto projects, all of the networks listed in the previous section can be considered energy-efficient. But what does being energy-efficient actually mean? Let’s dive in and explore this question in more detail.</p>
<p>Many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects focus on sustainability to improve the crypto market&#8217;s reputation. This reputation has unfortunately been damaged by Bitcoin&#8217;s colossal energy requirements, which have caught the attention of the mainstream media. In a sense, this is understandable, considering the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy as a small country.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221429/what-is-1.jpg" alt="Bitcoin energy consumption" /></figure>
<p>The reason for Bitcoin’s colossal energy requirements is the network’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on complex computing hardware to validate transactions. As the Bitcoin network has expanded, the need for more advanced equipment has also increased – leading to higher electricity requirements.</p>
<p>This is where the most energy-efficient crypto projects come in, as these projects offer an alternative to Bitcoin’s PoW consensus mechanism. The most common alternative is Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which completely eradicates the need for mining. As noted in a report by the <a href="https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/education_proof_of_stake_paper_v6_0.pdf">FTSE Russell</a>, PoS blockchains also offer yield opportunities, providing yet another benefit over PoW blockchains.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221441/what-is-2.jpg" alt="Bitcoin physical coin" /></figure>
<p>The result of using a PoS mechanism is that the associated network consumes much less electricity annually. Not only does this help repair the damage to the crypto market&#8217;s reputation, but it also reduces the carbon footprint of these networks. Given the rapid growth of the crypto market, the latter point will be crucial in the years ahead.</p>
<p>However, just because a blockchain uses a PoS consensus mechanism doesn&#8217;t mean it is entirely energy-efficient. There will always be energy requirements, which is why some blockchains, such as Solana, take additional measures to reduce (or remove) their carbon footprint. This trend is becoming more popular with low-energy cryptos, making these projects even more appealing to eco-conscious investors.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why is Energy-Efficient Crypto So Important?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> now have a considerable focus on sustainability, enabling them to offer compelling use cases whilst remaining eco-friendly. But why are these energy-efficient cryptos considered so crucial in today&#8217;s world?</p>
<p> Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the most prominent reasons below:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Reduces Carbon Dioxide Emissions</strong></h3>
<p>Energy-efficient cryptocurrencies are crucial when it comes to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/526002/energy-related-carbon-dioxide-emissions-worldwide/">Statista</a>, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions reached 36.3 billion metric tons in 2021. For context, this was a 6% increase from the previous year.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221431/reduces-co2.jpg" alt="CO2 emissions in billion metric tons" /></figure>
<p>However, the rise of energy-efficient cryptos can help reduce these CO2 emissions, as they make energy-intensive networks less popular. In addition, as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-sustainable-cryptocurrency.htm">sustainable cryptocurrencies</a> become ‘the norm’, this will naturally make other industries sit up and take notice – prompting them to take action.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Provides an Option for Environmentally-Conscious Investors</strong></h3>
<p>The lowest-energy cryptocurrency projects also provide an option for environmentally-conscious investors. When Bitcoin was the ‘go-to’ in the market, this demographic of investors had their hands tied, meaning many had to sit on the sidelines.</p>
<p>This is no longer an issue, as there are now dozens of crypto projects that utilize energy-efficient technology. Additionally, as more capital flows to sustainable projects, less money will flow to energy-intensive projects, increasing the positive effects on the environment.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Helps Improve the Crypto Market’s Reputation</strong></h3>
<p>As touched on earlier, the growth of energy-efficient cryptos has had a hugely positive impact on the broader market’s reputation. Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrency</a> projects have raised awareness of the market&#8217;s changing nature – and leading media outlets are beginning to take notice.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221442/improves-reputation.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency coins and gold bars" /></figure>
<p>As the perception of the crypto market swings positive, this will naturally make cryptocurrencies a more attractive prospect for different investor demographics. In turn, as more capital flows into the market, energy-efficient crypto projects will have more significant resources to boost their sustainability agendas.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Promotes Technological Innovation</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, energy-efficient cryptocurrency projects are also vital for promoting technological innovation. This is clearly evidenced by the dramatic shift away from PoW consensus mechanisms, meaning that the likes of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin are being left behind.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the competitive nature of the crypto market, energy-efficient networks will be vying for the top spot regarding their positive environmental impact. This &#8216;race to the top&#8217; provides a solid platform for innovation, which will undoubtedly have a positive effect on the environment as a whole. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>How to Identify Energy-Efficient Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">best crypto to buy Reddit</a> may wish to consider energy-efficient cryptocurrencies since they often use technology that reduces the chance of them becoming obsolete in the short term. With that in mind, detailed below are some of the best ways that investors can identify these cryptocurrencies:</p>
<h3><strong>Review the Underlying Technology</strong></h3>
<p>The easiest way to identify whether a cryptocurrency is energy-efficient is to review its technology. As noted throughout this article, environmentally-conscious investors should avoid PoW chains as this mechanism requires a tremendous amount of electricity. On the other hand, these investors may wish to consider PoS chains, which require far less electricity.</p>
<p>However, there are also technological innovations that &#8216;improve&#8217; PoS mechanisms even further. For example, Solana uses a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; system that incorporates Proof-of-Stake and &#8216;Proof-of-History&#8217; elements. By looking for projects that focus on similar innovations, investors can easily identify which cryptos are doing their best to be energy-efficient.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Evaluate the Development Team</strong></h3>
<p>When looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> for energy efficiency, investors may also wish to evaluate the development team behind a potential project. Lead developers can easily be found on sites like LinkedIn, allowing investors to gain insight into their values and ambitions.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88160/221433/development-team.jpg" alt="Cardano team" /></figure>
<p>If one (or more) of the lead developers has a clear focus on sustainability, there&#8217;s a good chance that they will be looking to ensure the project is as energy-efficient as possible. In addition, some projects (e.g. Cardano) even have roles that specifically focus on the project&#8217;s carbon footprint.</p>
<h3><strong>Consider the Project’s Whitepaper &amp; Roadmap</strong></h3>
<p>A project&#8217;s whitepaper and roadmap are two crucial elements to consider before investing. However, they are just as important for investors looking to determine a project’s sustainability, as both should detail the project’s impact on the environment.</p>
<p>The whitepaper is especially important for this, as it will showcase the technology underpinning the project, allowing investors to determine whether it can be considered energy-efficient relative to similar projects. If a project&#8217;s whitepaper doesn&#8217;t mention its environmental impact whatsoever, then there&#8217;s a good chance that energy efficiency isn&#8217;t one of its top priorities.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep Tabs on Eco-Friendly Partnerships</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, investors can also uncover energy-efficient projects by looking out for partnership announcements in the crypto sector. When a project partners with a leading environmentally-conscious institution, it’s fair to say that sustainability is likely one of the development team’s core values.</p>

<p>An example is Solana&#8217;s partnership with <a href="https://watershed.com/">Watershed</a> – a company that aims to help other companies reduce their carbon footprint. Through this partnership, Solana will be funding the destruction of refrigerants, which has been shown to have an immediate impact on reducing CO2 emissions.</p>

<h2><strong>An In-Depth Examination of the Most Green Cryptos to Invest In</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Many of the projects listed above are thought of as the cryptos with the most potential since their low energy requirements make them appealing to ethical investors with a focus on longevity. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at these green energy crypto projects, exploring the technology that makes them so eco-friendly:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong>New Eco-Friendly Crypto Presale <strong>With </strong><strong>Over 2,000% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is an ERC20 token built around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). What makes this token eco-friendly is the use of staking mechanics instead of mining with expensive hardware and a lot of electricity.</p>
<p>Because of that, early supporters get to enjoy a generous staking APY of over 2,000%. Of course, this number will drop as more tokens are staked, which makes it prudent to stake early.</p>
<p>Buy $BTCETF tokens on the Bitcoin ETF Token website by connecting your Ethereum-based wallet. You need ETH, USDT or card to complete the transaction. There&#8217;s the option to buy with MATIC and BNB as well, but you won&#8217;t be eligible for the staking APY if you buy with these two coins.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="460" class="alignnone wp-image-129625 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699610761-bitcoin-etf-token-2.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699610761-bitcoin-etf-token-2.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699610761-bitcoin-etf-token-2-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699610761-bitcoin-etf-token-2-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The token presale runs in 10 stages with each stage having a slightly higher token price. During the first stage, you can buy $BTCETF tokens at a price of $0.0050 apiece, which goes up to $0.0068 in the last stage. If you&#8217;re looking to buy the presale, it may be prudent to do so in early stages.</p>
<p>Another potentially rewarding feature is the token burn mechanics. This will start as a 5% burn tax on every transaction, which will drop to 0% once all five milestones around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval have been reached. These milestones will also remove 5% of the total token supply each. This includes milestones like the ETF approval, the launch of the first ETF and a total of $1 billion in assets under management by the spot Bitcoin ETFs. </p>

<h3>2<strong>. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Sustainable ERC20 Crypto To Upgrade BTC Mining, Raises $100k Within Hours of Launch </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</u></a> is a recently launched Ethereum powered campaign aimed at cleaning up the Bitcoin mining industry while providing a legitimate means of passive income for users. It introduces the world’s first stake-to-mine, whereby BTCMTX tokens are staked, cloud mining credits are generated, and these credits are burned in return for Bitcoin.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/332914/screen-shot-2023-10-06-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" /></figure>
<p>This is done over an Ethereum architecture, which is known to be far more eco-friendly in comparison to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work blockchain. But it also offers impressive yields (currently 1,106%) with good price appreciation potential. This is due to its new mechanism which introduces non-transferrable ERC20 cloud mining credits.</p>
<p>The users have complete control over the assets through a neat interface with all relevant metrics on display. They can select whether to burn, stake, or burn tokens. So users can benefit from staking, from price appreciation, or from BTC rewards in this new platform. A mobile application is set to be released in the near future, which will add to the user experience significantly.</p>
<p>Now only is Bitcoin mining damaging to the environment, but it is also very expensive and requires significant technical expertise. Bitcoin Minetrix breaks it up with Ethereum-based tokenization, with just a $10 upfront investment. The campaign has also completed a <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/audit.pdf"><u>smart contract audit</u></a> from a reliable third party and zero issues were located throughout the rigorous tests.</p>
<p>The price per token is discounted to $0.011 in its early presale stage, but this will rise to $0.0119 by the final stage.</p>
<p>For more information, users should read the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>official Bitcoin Minetrix Whitepaper.</u></a></p>

<h3><strong>3. Chimpzee &#8211; Greenest Crypto with Multiple Earning Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/chimpzee/">Chimpzee</a> is a new Web 3 project that aims to revolutionize the green crypto ecosystem by introducing a unique mechanic which gives multiple ways for investors to earn passive income while also protecting the environment and the endangered species. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/311886/chimpzee-green-crypto.jpg" alt="Chimpzee crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Built on the top of the Ethereum blockchain, the Chimpzee ecosystem is powered by the CHMPZ token. And at the core of this ecosystem exists the Chimpzee NFT passports. Chimpzee NFT passports are the key to enhancing your gains in the three earning mechanics present in this project. </p>
<ol>
<li>Trade2Earn &#8211; Trade2Earn stems from Chimpzee&#8217;s unique NFT marketplace that shares trading fee profits with everyone interacting with the platform. While traders will receive a fair share of CHMPZ coins for interacting with the ecosystem, those holding with Chimpzee NFT passport will earn more tokens and more perks. </li>
<li>Shop2Earn &#8211; The Shop2Earn mechanic signifies the commerce hub of the ecosystem. Buying a variety of Chimpzee gear available in this ecosystem will allow users to earn CHMPZ coins. And those holding the Chimpzee NFT passport will get more coins and additional perks. </li>
<li>Play2Earn &#8211; The Chimpzee ecosystem constitutes a game known as the Zero Tolerance Game. The Zero Tolerance game will focus on how the Chimpzee and his &#8220;army&#8221; has zero tolerance against those who try to harm the environment. While the activities that will be added to this game are yet to be introduced, what we know is that playing the game will allow users to earn CHMPZ coins.</li>
</ol>
<p>Chimpzee is currently organizing a presale, in which it is selling 45 percent of its total supply of 200 billion CHMPZ coins. Those who participate in the first stage will make gains as early movers as well as get the opportunity to get their hands on unique Chimpzee Diamond NFT passports and additional perks. </p>

<h3><strong>4. eTukTuk &#8211; Platform Offering Greenest Crypto Solutions By Incentivizing Switch To EVs &amp; Staking Rewards For $TUK</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/"><u>eTukTuk</u></a>, a new green crypto, is set to launch in Sri Lanka with a mission to address two significant concerns: carbon emissions and financial exclusion. The project focuses on transitioning traditional TukTuks from fossil fuel-reliant vehicles to electric ones.</p>
<p>The benefits of this transition are twofold: environmental and economic. Electric vehicles, unlike their combustion engine counterparts, emit no carbon. Moreover, eTukTuks are cost-competitive, reducing operational expenses and potentially increasing driver income by a staggering 400%.</p>
<p>The upcoming presale of the $TUK token is currently in the whitelisting stage while it prepares for launch. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315137/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk electric vehicle" /></figure>
<p>With its extensive TukTuk fleet and growing environmental concerns, Sri Lanka is an ideal launch pad for this eco-friendly project. </p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf?"><u>eTukTuk whitepaper</u></a>, it intends to make electric vehicles and charging stations affordable and accessible. </p>
<p>The platform also has backing from a large Sri Lankan conglomerate, The Capital Maharaja Group, with a 20% stake in eTukTuk.</p>
<p>It leverages the power of blockchain to assign digital identities, promoting financial inclusion for all. Thus, eTukTuk serves as a socio-economic tool that seeks to narrow the economic divide.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315136/etuktuk-staking.jpg" alt="Ways to earn TUK token" /></figure>
<p>Token holders can stake their tokens, supporting charging stations&#8217; operation, and earn annual yields.</p>
<p>With a vision of a future where transport and economic gains coexist without risking planetary health, eTukTuk looks to sets a benchmark for industries navigating the blockchain era.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Chia (XCH) – Popular Green Cryptocurrency of 2023</strong></h3>
<p>The Chia blockchain network has a clear focus on its environmental impact, aiming to offer a more eco-friendly alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Chia does this through an innovative ‘Proof-of-Space-and-Time’ mechanism.</p>
<p>This green crypto mining alternative utilizes free space on network participants&#8217; hard drives, writing 10GB &#8216;plots&#8217; on them. These plots are then used to validate new blocks on the network, albeit in a low-energy manner. According to <a href="https://www.chia.net/2021/10/20/mining-vs-farming.en.html">Chia’s website</a>, this approach means that Chia consumes up to 500 times less power than the Bitcoin network.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220814/chia.jpg" alt="Chia blockchain features" /></figure>
<p>Due to this, Chia is considered one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto projects</a>, with the network’s native token, XCH, experiencing multiple bull runs. For example, Chia’s price surged over 110% in June 2022 after generating immense publicity through social media.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, this environmentally green cryptocurrency project looks likely to continue gathering momentum – mainly due to the &#8216;Green Paper&#8217; authored by creator Bram Cohen. This academic journal presents in-depth information on how Chia&#8217;s network will continue to expend low amounts of energy over the long term, making it the greenest cryptocurrency on our list.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy Chia on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>6. Ethereum (ETH) – Best Green Cryptocurrency for dApp Developers</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum needs no introduction, as this green cryptocurrency remains the go-to for decentralized application (dApp) developers worldwide. As a smart contract-enabled blockchain, developers can create applications operating in various niches, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. </p>
<p>ETH also emerged as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-coins.htm">best metaverse coins</a>, as this sector exploded in popularity. However, the network’s PoW consensus mechanism has hindered its growth, prompting other blockchains to pick up the slack. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220816/ethereum.jpg" alt="Annual energy consumption" /></figure>
<p>This trend looks to have reversed following ‘the Merge’, which has seen Ethereum transition to a PoS consensus mechanism. This removes the need for energy-intensive crypto mining, significantly reducing Ethereum’s carbon footprint. </p>
<p>According to Ethereum’s website, the network will now expend only around 0.01 TWh per year – a reduction of 99.9% according to the Ethereum Foundation.</p>
<p>In addition, this transition also makes becoming a validator more accessible since it doesn’t require advanced computing hardware. Due to this, Ethereum can now be referred to as an environmentally green cryptocurrency – paving the way for others to follow suit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy ETH on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>7. Solana (SOL) – Greenest Crypto with Low Energy Requirement</strong></h3>
<p>Another of the greenest cryptocurrencies to be aware of is Solana. Solana emerged as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-trending-cryptos.htm">top trending cryptos</a> in 2021 due to the network&#8217;s high level of scalability. This is evidenced by the fact that Solana can theoretically handle 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) – far higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum. </p>
<p>Solana achieves this by using a hybrid consensus model, employing ‘Proof-of-Stake’ (PoS) and ‘Proof-of-History’ (PoH) mechanisms simultaneously. The latter was introduced in 2017 by Solana&#8217;s founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, to significantly increase transaction times.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220815/solana.jpg" alt="Solana carbon neutral network" /></figure>
<p>As an added benefit, this approach to scalability has arguably made Solana the most green crypto in the blockchain space. According to a recent <a href="https://solana.com/news/solanas-energy-use-report-march-2022">energy use report</a> from Solana, an average transaction on the network uses just 2,707 Joules – which is less energy than three Google searches. </p>
<p>This green crypto cryptocurrency is also fully transparent, as everyone can see the network’s energy usage on its website, with data verified by an independent energy and climate advisor. Solana is even funding refrigerant destruction in conjunction with Watershed Climate, which has been shown as one of the best ways to offset CO2 emissions.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Tezos (XTZ) – The Most Green Cryptocurrency with Minimal Carbon Footprint</strong></h3>
<p>Tezos is a green energy crypto blockchain similar to Ethereum in that it supports smart contracts and can be used to mint NFTs. However, Tezos differentiates itself by being as decentralized as possible, allowing XTZ holders to make proposals and vote on potential upgrades.</p>
<p>Tezos isn’t a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a>, having been around since 2017 when it raised over $230 million through its initial coin offering (ICO). The developers opted to use a ‘liquid Proof-of-Stake’ protocol, which means that anyone with at least 8,000 XTZ tokens can become a validator.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220817/tezos.jpg" alt="Tezos total contract operations" /></figure>
<p>However, those with less than 8,000 XTZ can still become a &#8216;delegator&#8217;, meaning they can receive a share of the staking rewards from the associated validator – also known as a &#8216;baker&#8217;. According to the <a href="https://tezos.com/carbon/">Tezos website</a>, this approach means the network has an annual carbon footprint of only 17 global citizens.</p>
<p>What’s more, Tezos also has ‘scalable efficiency’, meaning that as on-chain activity increases, the network’s energy consumption actually decreases. Finally, this green cryptocurrency ensures the validity of all energy use data by employing PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory to analyze the network’s carbon footprint.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Avalanche (AVAX) – Eco-Friendly Blockchain Offering High Throughput</strong></h3>
<p>Those looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> for long-term potential may wish to consider Avalanche. Avalanche is an innovative blockchain network that uses multiple chains to increase scalability. Due to this multi-chain approach, Avalanche can handle an impressive 4,500 TPS.</p>
<p>Avalanche also has near-instant transaction finality, which means the network is ideal for dApp developers operating in high-growth niches. Interestingly, Avalanche even has a feature called the &#8216;Avalanche Bridge&#8217;, which allows developers to port their creations to Avalanche if they wish.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220818/avalanche.jpg" alt="Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute" /></figure>
<p>In addition, Avalanche is also one of the greenest cryptos on the market, as a recent report by the <a href="https://www.carbon-ratings.com/">Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute</a> (CCRI) found that it uses only 0.0005% of the energy that Bitcoin does. This equates to an annual energy consumption of just 46 US households.</p>
<p>In addition, the leading crypto analytics firm, Messari Crypto, also found that Avalanche&#8217;s annual energy consumption is actually less than many other green crypto mining alternatives, such as Solana and Cardano. Thus, although the AVAX token has taken a dip in recent months, Avalanche is still an appealing prospect for environmentally-conscious investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy AVAX on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>10. Algorand (ALGO) – One of the Greenest Crypto Projects in the Blockchain Sector</strong></h3>
<p>Algorand has long been considered one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-stake-coins.htm">best Proof-of-Stake coins</a> on the market, thanks to the network&#8217;s advanced technology. However, Algorand’s consensus mechanism is actually defined as ‘Pure Proof-of-Stake’, which bases a validator’s influence on the number of ALGO tokens they have staked. </p>
<p>However, those with a lower stake can still be chosen, meaning that the network&#8217;s security level is based on all participants rather than just those with the most ALGO. Algorand’s team believes this approach is superior to all other consensus mechanisms and has backed this claim with a well-researched whitepaper.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220819/algorand.jpg" alt="Algorand carbon footprint" /></figure>
<p>This approach makes Algorand one of the greenest cryptocurrency projects on our list since the network is entirely carbon neutral. In a recent <a href="https://www.algorand.com/resources/algorand-announcements/carbon_negative_announcement">press release</a>, Algorand’s team also announced a partnership with ClimateTrade to ensure that emissions data is as accurate and transparent as possible. </p>
<p>What’s more, Algorand has actively promoted its blockchain to eco-friendly organizations, with PlanetWatch and Global Carbon Holding just two of the many enterprises to leverage the power of the network. Given founder Silvio Micali’s clear desire to minimize Algorand’s carbon footprint, this green crypto cryptocurrency is a viable option for ESG-focused investors. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy ALGO on eToro</a>

<h3><strong>11. Flow (FLOW) – Low-Energy Blockchain for NFT Creators</strong></h3>
<p>One of the greenest cryptocurrencies to emerge over the past year is Flow. The Flow blockchain was created by the founders of CryptoKitties – one of the first-ever blockchain games. Thanks to Flow&#8217;s super-fast PoS consensus mechanism, the network has been able to partner with leading entities like the NBA, UFC, NFL, and LaLiga. </p>
<p>More than 8,000 developers have now hosted their creations on Flow, with a total of 14 million active wallet accounts. Flow&#8217;s popularity has skyrocketed recently due to the &#8216;Flow Ecosystem Fund&#8217;, which offers $725 million in grants to support growth and innovation on the blockchain.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220820/flow.jpg" alt="Flow annual energy usage" /></figure>
<p>Flow is also one of the greenest cryptos on our list, with the network using just 0.18 GWh of energy each year. Furthermore, Flow&#8217;s energy use has been independently verified by Deloitte, ensuring accuracy and transparency.</p>
<p>Those looking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm">get started with NFTs</a> can also use Flow to mint their creations with super-low energy expenditure. To put this in perspective, minting one NFT on the Flow blockchain uses less energy than posting on Instagram – making the network more energy-efficient than Solana and Polygon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy Flow on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>12. Polkadot (DOT) – Environmentally-Friendly Blockchain Focused on Interoperability</strong></h3>
<p>Polkadot is an open-source blockchain platform that occupies a unique place in the sector. Instead of focusing solely on the network’s growth, Polkadot’s developers have placed great emphasis on interoperability, allowing different chains to interact and share information.</p>
<p>Polkadot does this by offering &#8216;parachains’ which connect to a central ‘relay chain’. These parachains operate like individual blockchains, yet their transactions are processed on the relay chain. In turn, this means developers do not need to focus on the validation aspect and can place more attention on dApp creation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220821/polkadot.jpg" alt="blockchain electricity consumption comparison" /></figure>
<p>Interestingly, a recent article from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-02/polkadot-has-smallest-carbon-footprint-crypto-researcher-says?leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> highlighted that Polkadot has the lowest total electricity consumption and carbon emissions of the six leading PoS chains. Although Solana was found to use the least energy per transaction, Polkadot was deemed to have the lowest carbon footprint. </p>
<p>Finally, DOT holders are the ones who vote on governance proposals, meaning there’s every chance that further upgrades could be implemented that make Polkadot even more eco-friendly. Therefore, those looking for the greenest cryptocurrency from a carbon footprint perspective will likely find Polkadot an appealing prospect.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>13. Polygon (MATIC) – Popular Carbon-Negative Layer-2 Blockchain</strong></h3>
<p>Polygon emerged as one of the best <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/altcoins/">altcoins</a> of 2021 due to the scalability services it offers the Ethereum network. As a ‘Layer-2 blockchain’, Polygon works in tandem with Ethereum to improve transaction speeds and lower network fees.</p>
<p>Through Polygon&#8217;s PoS consensus mechanism, dApps hosted on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain could process their transactions through the Polygon network. Since Polygon can process around 65,000 TPS, this approach became much more popular after the explosion in popularity of NFTs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220822/polygon.jpg" alt="Polygon going carbon neutral in 2022" /></figure>
<p>Polygon is also making waves regarding its positive environmental impact, with a recent <a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-is-going-carbon-negative-in-2022-with-a-20-million-pledge/">blog post</a> noting that the network aims to go carbon-negative in 2022. In addition, Polygon&#8217;s team is freeing up $20 million in funding, which will be given to various initiatives that use technology to combat climate change.</p>
<p>Polygon has even pledged to buy $400,000 worth of carbon credits, aiming to gradually retire these to effectively &#8216;remove&#8217; CO2 from the atmosphere. Finally, these moves are coming directly from Polygon&#8217;s co-founders, highlighting how important sustainability is to Polygon&#8217;s team.</p>

<h3><strong>14. Cardano (ADA) – Leading Blockchain with Dedicated Sustainability Director</strong></h3>
<p>Concluding our list of the most green cryptocurrency projects is Cardano. Cardano is a smart contract-enabled blockchain network that bases all of its technology on peer-reviewed research.</p>
<p>Cardano uses a PoS protocol called &#8216;Ouroboros&#8217;, which selects validators based on the number of ADA tokens they have staked. The more tokens stakes, the more likely a network participant will be chosen and given validation rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220823/cardano.jpg" alt="Cardano blockchain" /></figure>
<p>This network also aims to become the most green cryptocurrency on the market, as it targets net zero emissions whilst still providing solid returns for investors. Moreover, <a href="https://www.cardano.co.uk/our-approach-to-sustainability/">Cardano’s website</a> also notes that any investments made by the management team are thoroughly vetted to ensure they make a positive real-world impact. </p>
<p>Interestingly, sustainability is so essential to Cardano that the network even has a dedicated &#8216;Group Head of Sustainability&#8217; who works with climate-change academics to ensure Cardano is as green as possible. Combine this with Cardano&#8217;s low energy requirements, and it&#8217;s clear why the network is considered one of the greenest cryptos on the market.</p>

<h2><strong>Overview of Green Cryptocurrency</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve listed the most green crypto projects of 2023, let&#8217;s focus on what green cryptocurrency actually are. In essence, green cryptocurrencies tend to be blockchain projects that limit their energy use. Although blockchains offer numerous benefits, such as transparency and anonymity, they do require considerable resources to run.</p>
<p>A famous example is Bitcoin, which uses a PoW consensus mechanism. This mechanism requires &#8216;miners&#8217; to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions on the network. As expected, this uses vast amounts of electricity, which has harmed Bitcoin&#8217;s reputation from an eco-friendly perspective.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220813/what-is-1.jpg" alt="Wind turbines" /></figure>
<p>To put this into context, a report from the <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index">University of Cambridge</a> found that the Bitcoin network consumes around 97.11 TWh of electricity per year – more than the entire country of Argentina. Once this revelation began filtering throughout the community, blockchain developers worldwide began altering how their networks run.</p>
<p>This is where green crypto comes in, which tends to refer to blockchains that use an alternative to the PoW mechanism that Bitcoin employs. The most common option is &#8216;Proof-of-Stake&#8217; (PoS), which completely removes the mining process in favour of staking. This drastically reduces the energy requirements needed to operate the blockchain.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220812/what-is-2.jpg" alt="Historical Bitcoin power demand" /></figure>
<p>However, many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology.htm">blockchain technology</a> innovations have occurred over the past year that aim to improve energy efficiency even further. For example, the previously-mentioned ‘Proof-of-Space-and-Time’ mechanism employed on the Chia network utilizes unused disk space for validation. In addition, Solana’s ‘Proof-of-History’ protocol helps reduce electricity consumption while remaining scalable.</p>
<p>Aside from technology, many green cryptos are also identifiable by their partnerships with climate change enterprises. Cardano and Polygon are two prominent blockchains that make targeted investments to reduce the effects of climate change, making them popular with environmentally-conscious investors.</p>
<h2><strong>Why is Green Crypto So Popular?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Green cryptocurrency projects have had a dramatic uptick in popularity over the past year – but why is this? To answer this question, detailed below are four reasons why investors have gravitated toward these projects:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Has a Lower Carbon Footprint</strong></h3>
<p>Needless to say, green cryptos have a much lower carbon footprint than their non-green counterparts. This is because the reduced electricity consumption directly leads to less carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere. In turn, this means green cryptos have less of an impact on global warming.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220811/carbon-footprint.jpg" alt="Ethereum coin" /></figure>
<p>Following ‘the Merge’, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum-2-0.htm">Ethereum 2.0</a> now has a much lower carbon footprint than it did when using the PoW consensus protocol. According to reports, Ethereum’s carbon emissions are now 99.9% lower than they were previously.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Encourages Eco-Friendly Investing</strong></h3>
<p>Green crypto is also popular because it encourages investors to include an asset&#8217;s environmental impact in their decision-making. Although a considerable percentage of investors still focus solely on financial gain, the growth of green crypto has helped change many people&#8217;s minds on what is really important.</p>
<p>As green cryptos become more prominent, the non-green cryptos will naturally become less popular. As they fall by the wayside, so too will their negative impact on the environment.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Promotes Technological Innovation</strong></h3>
<p>According to an article by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/climate/climate-change-acceleration.html">New York Times</a>, climate change continues to accelerate, bringing the world ever closer to irreversible effects. Due to this, the technological innovations brought about by green cryptos have become more critical than ever. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220810/technological-innovation.jpg" alt="Blockchain network" /></figure>
<p>The crypto market is an inherently competitive space, which is seen as a good thing for the environment. As crypto projects attempt to outdo each other, the technological upgrades will naturally make them more sustainable – leading to lowered carbon footprints across the board and more <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-sustainable-cryptocurrency.htm">sustainable cryptos to invest in</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Changes People’s Perception of Crypto</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, the growth of green crypto is also essential in terms of changing people&#8217;s perceptions of the market. Bitcoin&#8217;s colossal energy use has undoubtedly soured people&#8217;s views on crypto, yet the emergence of green projects like Chia has begun to change these views.</p>
<p>If this trend toward sustainable technology continues, there&#8217;s no doubt that people will begin looking at cryptocurrency in a more positive light. Especially the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-energy-efficient-cryptocurrency.htm">most energy efficient cryptocurrencies</a>. Not only will this benefit green cryptos directly, but it will also benefit the market as a whole.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Strategies to Find the Greenest Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubting the positive impact of green cryptocurrencies on the environment. Yet, investors looking to gain exposure to these projects must conduct additional research to ensure they are as eco-friendly as they claim. Listed below are three strategies investors can employ to identify these green cryptos:</p>
<h3><strong>Be Aware of Current Affairs</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best ways to identify green cryptocurrencies is to be aware of the pressing issues in today’s world. By being aware of the hot topics, investors can identify which crypto projects are looking to offer solutions. </p>
<p>For example, reforestation has become a widely-discussed topic in eco-friendly circles, leading Cardano’s developers to partner with the leading sustainability firm, veritree. Through this partnership, Cardano has created its own ‘Cardano Forest’, with the overarching goal being to plant one million trees.</p>
<h3><strong>Review a Project’s Whitepaper</strong></h3>
<p>Green cryptos can also be uncovered by thoroughly reviewing the project&#8217;s whitepaper. The whitepaper is an excellent resource for investors as it discusses the technology underpinning the project and its roadmap for the future.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87826/220809/review-whitepaper.jpg" alt="Chia green paper" /></figure>
<p>The latter is crucial for eco-conscious investors, as any sustainability plans and goals should be noted here. If a project doesn&#8217;t mention anything related to sustainability or the environment, chances are that these elements are not important to the developers.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Look for Eco-Friendly Partnerships</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, investors can find green cryptos by keeping an eye out for partnerships that look to foster improvements in the environment. When crypto projects partner with other enterprises, it allows them to put their resources to good use and helps increase awareness of the project.</p>

<h2><strong>A Closer Look at the Next Big Cryptocurrency Coins</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>All the projects listed above have already generated substantial momentum on social media, with investors eager to see whether they can provide positive returns during the ongoing &#8216;crypto winter&#8217;.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these projects, covering the reasons why many market participants believe them to be contenders for the next big crypto to buy:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong>Latest Crypto Presale <strong>With </strong><strong>Over 2,000% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Up To 25% Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is a new token presale built around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This includes token burn mechanics that will permanently remove up to 25% of the total token supply as events around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval unfold.</p>
<p>For example, 5% of the total token supply will be removed when the first spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC. Another 5% will be burned when such an ETF is launched, and three more milestones will remove an additional 15%.</p>
<p>Participate in the $BTCETF presale by connecting your Ethereum-based wallet to the token presale site and use ETH, USDT or card to buy as many tokens as you want.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="461" class="alignnone wp-image-130203 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Early in the presale, the token price will be lowest starting from $0.0050 in the first presale stage. The more you wait to buy the tokens, the higher the price it will be, reaching to $0.0068 in the last stage of the presale. This makes it prudent to buy as early as possible if you want to participate in this project.</p>
<p>Thanks to the staking feature, you can earn more tokens by staking them. The APY in the early stages is 2,000%. However, this number will drop as more tokens are staked. Make sure to stake early if you buy $BTCETF tokens to maximize your potential rewards.</p>

<h3>2<strong>. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Exciting New Stake-to-Mine Cryprto Presale Offering BTC Mining and 9,000% APY</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a> is a newly launched presale that could be the next big crypto as it is opening up Bitcoin mining to all.</p>
<p>Previously, Bitcoin mining has been a closed shop with only those that can afford powerful mining rigs and huge energy bills able to mine BTC, while cloud mining has been filled with scammers.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/331984/stake-to-mine.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix stake to mine BTC" /></figure>
<p>While the price of mining one Bitcoin is now estimated to be $42,000, Bitcoin Minetrix allows investors to join their ecosystem for just $10.</p>
<p>The protocol works by staking BTCMTX, which generates cloud mining tokens &#8211; they can then be burnt to earn allocated cloud mining time, with the BTC rewards distributed to stakers.</p>
<p>The whole process is managed via an upcoming dedicated mobile app and breaks down a huge barrier to mining BTC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin Minetrix is also offering incredible annual percentage yields during the presale, with the current APY more than 9,000%.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The presale has just launched with tokens available for $0.011 during stage 1, with the price to rise by 8% to $0.0119 by stage 10.</p>
<p>More information on the project can be found in the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> or on <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix">Telegram</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; New Meme Coin with Huge Utility through Staking and P2E Wagering</strong></h3>
<p>Meme Kombat ($MK) is a meme coin project and play-to-earn ecosystem that has also just launched its presale.</p>
<p>It could be the next big crypto because, despite being a meme coin, is offering unique utility and tokenomics to many rival meme coins.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/331991/meme-kombat.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The project, which has been developed by a doxxed and public-facing team, allows users to stake tokens for rewards, with 112% APY available during the presale.</p>
<p>Its biggest draw, however, is its play-to-earn Battle Arena, which will allow players to wager on the outcome of battles between characters representing popular meme coins such as Pepe and Wojak.</p>
<p>The Battle Arena is powered by blockchain technology and AI and ensures that all results are immutable and transparent, with winning payments made instantly.</p>
<p>The Battle Arena will also be seasonal meaning new characters, themes and game modes are released, while there will also be lots of side markets to add depth and variety to the play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meme Kombat: Why I Am BULLISH On MK" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J33NeLWR8D4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>There is a limited supply of just 12 million $MK tokens with 50% of those available during one presale round, with a fixed cost of $1.667 per token.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Chimpzee (CHMPZ) &#8211; Environmentally Focused Project That Has Planted 20,000 Trees and Donated $15,000 During Presale, $1.35M Raised So Far</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/chimpzee/en"><u>Chimpzee (CHMPZ)</u></a> is a project that has already made quite an impact. It’s a rarity that projects contribute before the presale has even finished, but this is exactly what Chimpzee has done. It has planted over 20,000 trees to save the rainforest and further donated $15,000 to protect elephants. This is in line with its commitment to donate 10% of the proceeds to charity. </p>
<p>Unlike other projects that make a lot of promises, Chimpzee has already delivered and demonstrated goodwill. Plus, the project has attained a third-party <a href="https://solidity.finance/audits/ChimpzeeCoin/"><u>smart contract audit </u></a>from Solidity Finance and a <a href="https://github.com/coinscope-co/kyc/blob/main/chmpz/kyc.png"><u>KYC accreditation</u></a> from Coinscope. The project is serious in its commitment to saving the environment and its whitepaper outlines in detail some of the species that are in danger, as well as the damage that deforestation is doing. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/327206/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="Chimpzee token presale page" /></figure>
<p>With Chimpzee, it’s possible to earn a 20% APY through a Diamond NFT passport. This is the quickest way for users to earn an income. Other NFT passports include Gold, Silver, and Bronze, but these confer less privileges than the Diamond NFT passport. In total Chimpzee provides three ways to earn an income. </p>
<p>These are the Shop-To-Earn, Play-To-Earn, and Trade-To-Earn components. Chimpzee also intends to burn its token supply down to 50 billion, which could serve to increase the overall price due to token scarcity.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/327207/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="Chimpzee crypto project" /></figure>
<p>To take part in the presale, users will need to have a Web3 wallet (Chimpzee accepts a wide number) as well as ETH or USDT. It’s also recommended to join the project socials &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/RealChimpzee"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/qCmN7XJs"><u>Discord</u></a>, <a href="https://t.me/officialchimpzeetelegramgroup"><u>Telegram</u></a>, <a href="https://linktr.ee/chimpzee"><u>Link Tree</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chimpzee.io/"><u>Instagram</u></a>. The <a href="https://www.chimpzee.io/assets/chimpzeeWhitepaper.pdf"><u>whitepaper</u></a> should also be explored in detail prior to investment. </p>
<p>Thus far, Chimpzee is over 66% of the way towards meeting its hard cap, having raised $1.35 million out of its $1.8 million target. </p>

<h3><strong>8. eTukTuk (TUK) &#8211; Sustainability Sourced Electric Vehicle Transport For Developing Economies, Brand New Presale With $60k Raised</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/en">eTukTuk (TUK)</a> aims to help TukTuk drivers from developing economies start using more sustainable practices by making the switch to electric vehicles (EVs). TukTuks are a form of transport very common in Asian countries, though they are currently not the most eco-friendly. </p>
<p>Currently, Internal Combustion Engines are used to run most TukTuks &#8211; releasing significant levels of CO2 into the air as compared to cars. eTukTuk wants to set a new standard in EV production and maintenance, and these new TukTuks will be more affordable for drivers. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/327232/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token presale page" /></figure>
<p>For this reason, eTukTuk intends to create EV charging stations and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment to promote the transition to using net zero carbon emission vehicles. The project is based in the capital of Sri Lanka (Colombo) and will be building and then distributing charging stations to suburban centers in various developing countries, where the TukTuk is one of the dominant means of transport. </p>
<p>Drivers can make transactions using the application, using TUK tokens as payment. The project is based on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). A percentage of profits will go to territory partners who set up, manufacture, and maintain the stations. The tokens can also be staked for additional benefits.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/327233/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk crypto project" /></figure>
<p>APY is generated every time a driver makes a payment on the app. From a staking pool, the funds will be distributed as a reward to stakers. The total supply is 2 billion tokens and presale launched quite recently, at the start of August 2023. So far, it has raised over $60,000. </p>
<p>More information can be found on the <a href="https://t.me/etuktuk"><u>Telegram channel</u></a> as well as on <a href="https://twitter.com/eTukTukio"><u>Twitter.</u></a> Potential investors should also investigate the whitepaper in detail before allocating any financial resources. The project has been audited by Certik and has an ambassador program for increased adoption. </p>
<p>If TukTuk drivers take to this new concept, it could be the next big crypto in 2023 and beyond. it is currently available at a 40% discount. </p>

<h3><strong>9. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Next Big Meme Token Now Available on Multiple Tier-1 CEXs</strong></h3>
<p>One of the next big cryptocurrency contenders is $WSM, the native token of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes</a>. This is a popular meme platform that first launched its Twitter page in 2019. In the following years, Wall Street Memes has garnered a following of more than 1 million across various social media sites and enjoyed success in the Web3 space. </p>
<p>The WSM presale was one of the best ever, raising more than $25 million before it was listed on multiple leading CEXs including OKX and Huobi &#8211; at the time of writing, its 24-hour volume is almost $60 million.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/312958/wsm-token-home.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token" /></figure>
<p>With more CEX listings coming and hype continuing to build, Wall Street Memes’ large community following gives it the potential to be one of the top meme coins of the year. While new projects, such as Pepe (PEPE), have had to create a new following, Wall Street Memes already has a competitive advantage. </p>
<p>Elon Musk has also interacted with the page on numerous occasions and has been rumored to be the crypto whale that recently spent more than $1 million buying WSM tokens.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Wall Street Memes creators have previously launched a successful NFT project, Wall St Bulls. The first collection of Wall St Bulls was launched in 2021, where 10,000 Ethereum NFTs were sold in just half an hour. </p>
<p>Wall Street Memes also has several advantages over other meme coins, with a small supply of just 2 billion tokens and stake-to-earn feature currently offering 38% APY.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/327273/wall-street-memes-staking.jpg" alt="WSM token staking" /></figure>

<h3><strong>11. Gala (GALA) – The Next Big Cryptocurrency in the Blockchain Gaming Niche</strong></h3>
<p>Those researching what’s the next big crypto will likely have come across Gala. Gala is a relatively <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> project that looks to revolutionize the blockchain gaming niche. It does this by offering a selection of games within one platform – all made functional through the GALA token.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Gala platform offers 15 games, including Last Expedition, Echoes of Empire, and Spider Tanks. Most of these games also integrate NFTs practically, with Gala offering a built-in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-marketplaces.htm">NFT marketplace</a> for NFT trading.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/231959/gala.jpg" alt="Gal Games home page" /></p>
<p>However, like many tokens, GALA&#8217;s price has suffered during the ongoing &#8216;crypto winter&#8217;. The GALA price is down over 96% from November 2021&#8217;s all-time highs, as investors have shied away from risky assets. Regardless, Gala still has enormous potential and could be an intriguing way to gain exposure to the revival of the blockchain gaming sector.</p>

<h3><strong>12. Aptos (APT) – New Layer-1 Blockchain Looking to Rival Ethereum</strong></h3>
<p>Aptos is a new Layer-1 blockchain network created by former Meta Platform developers who had worked on the Diem project. The Aptos development team has big aims, looking to offer a network that can process up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) and rival Ethereum. </p>
<p>This would undoubtedly make APT a frontrunner for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> – yet the network&#8217;s launch did not go as planned. Aptos&#8217; tokenomics were unclear, and many believed it to be a pump-and-dump scheme, prompting the token&#8217;s price to fall sharply.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/231960/aptos.jpg" alt="Aptos Labs crypto project" /></figure>
<p>However, the APT price has rebounded recently and is nearly at the same level it debuted. Moreover, Aptos is backed by some big players, including FTX and Andressen Horowitz, which adds a significant degree of credibility to the project’s offering.</p>

<h3><strong>13. Ripple (XRP) – Popular Payments Protocol with Rebound Potential</strong></h3>
<p>Ripple has long been touted as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> on the market due to its revolutionary take on payment processing. Using the power of the blockchain, Ripple can facilitate cross-border transfers with low fees and near-instant finality. </p>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s native currency is XRP, used to pay transaction fees and as a &#8216;bridge currency&#8217; when making exchanges. Although XRP has been hyped tremendously, its progress has been stalled since 2020 due to an ongoing lawsuit by the SEC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/231962/ripple.jpg" alt="Ripple crypto project " /></figure>
<p>However, it recently had a partial victory as the court ruled in its favor, prompting sharper price increases and relisting on major exchanges. This was a huge win for the cross-border settlements provider, after a lengthy legal battle. </p>

<h3><strong>14. Theta Network (THETA) – The Next Big Crypto According to Reddit</strong></h3>
<p>Theta Network is the next big cryptocurrency according to Reddit – leading many to take note of its progress. According to Gemini, Theta Network is a decentralized video delivery network that helps solve issues within the video-streaming sector.</p>
<p>These issues revolve around bandwidth, which has suppressed growth in many sectors. However, Theta allows people to become ‘nodes’ by staking THETA tokens – providing bandwidth to others as a byproduct.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/231963/theta-network.jpg" alt="Theta video infrastructure" /></figure>
<p>As the Theta Network grows, this will help make video content delivery more effective and reduce the barriers to the sector’s growth.

<h2><strong>How to Find the Next Big Crypto</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Determining what will be the next big cryptocurrency is the most challenging task in the whole space – especially given the transitory and volatile nature of the crypto market. </p>
<p>However, finding the next big token can be extremely lucrative, with the likes of Pepe pumping 7,000% in just three weeks earlier this year. </p>
<p>There are some tactics that investors can employ to sift out projects with above-average value potential and help them spot red flags to avoid bad projects or scams. Let’s take a closer look at some of these tactics below:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Look for Trending Projects on Social Media</strong></h3>
<p>Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> get their start through social media. Platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube provide scope for new projects to begin ‘trending’, which is when a project starts being discussed by a large portion of the investing community.</p>
<p>If a project begins trending, there&#8217;s a good chance it has at least some merit – otherwise, nobody would be talking about it. Thus, seeking out cryptos consistently mentioned on social media is a great way to identify high-potential projects.</p>
<h3><strong>Review the Project’s Whitepaper and Roadmap</strong></h3>
<p>Finding out what&#8217;s the next big crypto also involves in-depth analysis of a project&#8217;s whitepaper and roadmap. These two resources should set out what the project aims to achieve and how it will go about it.</p>
<p>The key here is to look for a ‘unique selling point’ (USP) that will help the project stand out in the ultra-competitive crypto market. </p>
<p>Whitepapers are essentially an overarching document that tells a potential investor everything they need to know about a project &#8211; all the answers should be in there.</p>
<p>As a rule, investors should avoid projects that have poorly written or vague whitepapers and ones that do not have well-thought-out roadmaps. It is all good promising a $1 billion market cap, but the roadmap should outline the steps the project will take to achieve it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/231939/roadmap.jpg" alt="Crypto project roadmap" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Seek Out New &amp; Innovative Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Following the previous point, it&#8217;s vital to seek out projects with innovative use cases. Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-winter-tokens.htm">best crypto winter tokens</a> either improve on another project’s offering or provide a new use case entirely.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s also essential to examine whether the development team behind a project can actually achieve their goals. This involves searching them up on sites like LinkedIn and inspecting their work history to determine whether they have the skills and expertise to lead the project to success.</p>
<h3><strong>Find Projects with Appealing Tokenomics</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, investors looking to uncover the next big cryptocurrency would also be wise to analyze the &#8216;tokenomics&#8217; of any projects under consideration. The term &#8216;tokenomics&#8217; describes the factors that influence a token&#8217;s value, such as supply, distribution schedule, characteristics, and burn mechanisms.</p>
<p>Since the laws of supply and demand determine the values of crypto tokens, it&#8217;s vital to search for projects with appealing tokenomics. For example, a project with a built-in token burn mechanism will gradually reduce the supply over time. This makes the remaining tokens scarcer – thereby increasing their value. </p>
<p>Projects that have large team allocations could indicate a rug pull, for example. The best projects will have the majority of their tokens made available for investors as quickly as possible, rather than trying yo artificially inflate the price.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/92709/327276/wall-street-memes-tokenomics.jpg" alt="WSM tokenomics" /></figure>

<p><i><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Industry Talk section features insights from crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>The financial markets are inherently cyclical, meaning that vast peaks tend to be followed by deep troughs. This is no different in the crypto market, as although many coins have risen to prominence over the last few years, the past ten months have seen most of these coins lose massive amounts of their value.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>However, even though crypto is going through a &#8216;bear market&#8217;, there are still opportunities. With that in mind, this article discusses the <strong>best crypto to buy during the bear market</strong> by highlighting seven coins with positive value potential before presenting an overview of how investors can find high-potential cryptos in today&#8217;s challenging market environment.</p>
<h2><strong>The 7 Best Crypto to Buy During the Bear Market</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Finding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> during a bear market can be challenging, as many (if not all) will have experienced significant value decreases. However, it&#8217;s also important to note that this can provide a limited-time opportunity to invest in these cryptos at a discount before any rebound occurs. </p>

The token is priced at $0.005 during presale. </li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en"><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</strong></a> &#8211; New crypto with a Stake-to-Mine model, offering transparency, security, and High APYs. Its presale secured over $300K in less than a week of its launch.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><strong>Wall Street Memes (WSM)</strong></a><strong> &#8211; </strong>Red hot meme coin with a $25M raise and 1M social followers, double-digit PoS rewards, and Tier 1 exchange listing to follow.</li>

<h2><strong>Reviewing the Best Cryptos to Invest in During the Bear Market</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now let’s take a more in-depth look at the best crypto to invest in during the bear market, diving into the use cases, roadmaps, and price potential of the projects listed above:<strong> </strong><b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) &#8211; Best Crypto to Buy During the Bear Market, Offers High Staking Rewards</b></h3>
<p>Our #1 pick for the best crypto to buy during the bear market is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a>. This cryptocurrency is created to celebrate the upcoming arrival of a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1336" height="593" class="aligncenter wp-image-128399" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699431217-screen-shot-2023-11-08-at-11-00-49-am.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699431217-screen-shot-2023-11-08-at-11-00-49-am.png 1336w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699431217-screen-shot-2023-11-08-at-11-00-49-am-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699431217-screen-shot-2023-11-08-at-11-00-49-am-1024x455.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699431217-screen-shot-2023-11-08-at-11-00-49-am-768x341.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1336px) 100vw, 1336px" /></p>
<p>On the platform website, one can access live updates and information related to the Bitcoin ETF progress. A Bitcoin ETF will let traders purchase Bitcoin without holding the underlying asset. Furthermore, it removes the technical complexities of trading Bitcoin. Investors are still awaiting the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF by the SEC. </p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token is tied to the fate of the Bitcoin ETF, and has set 5 milestones it wants to achieve. These include the confirmation of the first Bitcoin ETF and the release of the ETF. In total, Bitcoin ETF Token has set 5 milestones &#8211; and will burn 5% of its token supply upon reaching each milestone. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1210" height="417" class="aligncenter wp-image-127995" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token milestones" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png 1210w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones-300x103.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones-1024x353.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones-768x265.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1210px) 100vw, 1210px" /></p>
<p>Thus, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 25% of its token supply in the long term. This crypto can be a good investment during the bear market &#8211; as $BTCETF holders can generate passive income. Through a smart contract, token holders can earn staking rewards as high as 2,800%. So far, more than 10 million tokens have been locked on the smart contract, which has been verified by Coinsult. </p>
<p>Interested investors can buy this new crypto for $0.005 during the first presale round. The presale will consist of ten rounds &#8211; where 840 million tokens will be allocated. The aim is to raise nearly $5 million by the end of the presale.

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Stake-to-Mine Crypto with High APY Rewards, Raised Over $300K in A Week</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix</u></a> ($BTCMTX) is a disruptive addition to cloud mining, offering the world&#8217;s first &#8220;Stake-to-Mine&#8221; model.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a unique alternative to traditional cloud mining, offering early buyers a simplified, transparent, and high upside opportunity during the bear market.</p>
<p>The project has caught investor attention by raising over $300,000 within its first week. The presale of its native $BTCMTX tokens starts at $0.011 per token and aims to hit a hard cap of $30 million. </p>
<p>The tokens are available in progressive stages, with the price increasing to $0.0119 toward the end of the presale.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix plans to release a total supply of 4 billion tokens, with 70% (2.8 billion) allocated for the presale. The remaining tokens will be used for rewards, liquidity, and other ecosystem activities.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/332380/screenshot-2023-10-02-at-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale" /></figure>
<p>Unlike traditional cloud mining, where you buy cash contracts, Bitcoin Minetrix has a more flexible &#8220;Stake-to-Mine&#8221; model. Users stake $BTCMTX tokens to receive non-tradable &#8216;mining credits,&#8217; which can be used to acquire Bitcoin mining power. </p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</u></a>, these credits offer a more direct link between staking and earning, breaking the entry barriers surrounding cloud mining.</p>
<p>The platform offers an integrated dashboard, simplifying the process for beginners and experienced users. Investors can keep tabs on their earnings, staking balance, and mining credits all in one place, either on desktop or mobile.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/332381/screenshot-2023-10-02-at-.jpg" alt="BTC stake to mine" /></figure>
<p>Staking rewards are calculated per Ethereum block and are proportional to the individual&#8217;s share in the staking pool. Currently, the platform offers a dynamic APY of over 2000%. Over 15 million tokens have been staked within the first week, showing strong community trust.</p>
<p>The project has also undergone a third-party smart contract audit. There are no locked-in contracts, enabling users to un-stake and sell their $BTCMTX tokens freely. </p>
<p>In addition to financial benefits, Bitcoin Minetrix provides an eco-friendly mining solution, standing out from traditional energy-consuming methods.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Wall Street Memes &#8211; The “King of Stonks” Raises $25 Million Within 3 Months, Listed on OKX</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes"><u>Wall Street Memes (WSM)</u></a> is an excellent crypto to buy during a bear market, with double-digit staking rewards and the potential for price appreciation. </p>
<p>This quickly selling presale has raised a colossal $25 million in about twelve weeks. After a rapid presale, the platform&#8217;s token debuted on OKX on September 26 and soared by more than 275% in just four days.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/329980/screen-shot-2023-09-15-at.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token presale page" /></figure>
<p>The meme token seeks to challenge Wall Street Actors, in much the same way as Shiba Inu and Doge aimed to remedy financial inequity with their own unique army of retail investors eager to settle the score. These coins were also very successful, and Wall Street Memes hopes to follow in their footsteps &#8211; it aims for a $1 billion market capitalization.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes movement has over 1 million social followers and regularly posts funny memes on its <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram</u></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes"><u>Twitter</u></a> socials. It has also seen interaction from Elon Musk on Twitter, a figure known to have pumped up the price of Doge on multiple occasions. It refers to itself as the “’king of stonks”, the very best meme coin on the market.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/329981/screen-shot-2023-09-15-at.jpg" alt="WSM token" /></figure>
<p>The project also features a $50,000 WSM airdrop giveaway. With regard to tokenomics, 50% go to marketing, 30% to community rewards, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to CEX liquidity.</p>
<p>To take part, remember to first read the <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>whitepaper</u></a> in detail and understand all risks.</p>
<figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&#8221;https://youtu.be/HwIEPnwZqt8[/embed]
<p>This is a great coin to buy during a bear market, and could be around for a decade or more, similar to Doge and other successful meme tokens. </p>
<p>It has a giant social following and serious financial backing that could ensure it stays, when other cryptos collapse. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Tamadoge (TAMA) – New Meme Coin Project Trading at a Discount</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/">Tamadoge</a> is the ideal crypto to invest in during the Black Friday crypto bear market since this token has amassed a cult following over the past few months. </p>
<p>For those unaware, Tamadoge sold out its presale phase in record time and raised a staggering $19m worth of USDT.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/253167/tamadoge-pirate-media-library-original-451-258.jpg" alt="Tamadoge crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Since concluding its presale, Tamadoge has gone from strength to strength and is now listed on major exchanges like MEXC, OKX, LBank, Gate.io, and Uniswap. Although the price of TAMA has been affected by the &#8216;crypto winter&#8217;, tokens have soared by 61% in recent weeks, hinting that another bull run could be on the cards.</p>
<p>Tamadoge has also emerged as one of the top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/utility-nft-projects.htm">utility NFT projects</a>, with investors able to buy the project’s NFTs on OpenSea. The Tamadoge collection contains 21,100 NFTs, each with its own rarity level, and will allow holders to access the upcoming ‘Tamaverse’. </p>
<p>NFT holders will even receive a ‘Tamadoge Puppy’ airdrop once the Tamaverse is launched, along with access to the project’s new arcade games. </p>
<p>While the price of TAMA has retraced in the wake of the FTX collapse, the coin looks primed to pump when market conditions improve.</p>
<p>The token is deflationary and will cut supply once the main Tamadoge game is released, with 5% of every transaction in the pet store being burned.</p>
<p>That main game &#8211; plus two further mini-games &#8211; will be released in 2023, while an augmented reality app is set for release at the end of 2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy TAMA on OKX</a>
<h3><strong>5. Binance Coin (BNB) – Volatile Utility Token with Long-Term Potential</strong></h3>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) has emerged as one of the top coins to buy during the bear market following the sudden collapse of the FTX exchange. Although it’s currently one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-volatile-cryptos.htm">most volatile cryptos</a>, BNB has exceptional potential due to Binance’s newfound domination of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>The crypto market bear market contributed to FTX’s collapse, meaning Binance is now the ‘go-to’ for most investors. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/">CoinMarketCap</a>, Binance regularly handles over $15bn in daily trading volume. Since BNB is used to pay trading fees, there’s a high likelihood that token demand will continue to increase.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/253169/bnb-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Binance Coin price chart" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, since BNB is tied to the Binance exchange, the token has become a popular way for investors to gain exposure to Binance’s growth. BNB holders can even deposit their tokens in the ‘BNB Vault’ to generate a yield – adding another valuable long-term use case for investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy BNB on eToro</a>
<p><i>Your capital is at risk. Crypto asset investments are highly volatile and speculative.</i></p>
<h3><strong>6. Ethereum (ETH) – Smart Contracts Crypto to Buy During the Bear Market</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum needs no introduction, as this cryptocurrency remains the second-largest in the world behind Bitcoin. Although it’s not necessarily the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrency</a>, Ethereum is a project with exceptional long-term potential due to its relation to the NFT and DeFi sectors.</p>
<p>Moreover, there’s a case to be made that ETH tokens are trading at a discount during the Black Friday crypto bear market. At the time of writing, ETH is valued at around $1,612, which is significantly lower than November 2021’s all-time highs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/253170/eth-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="ETH to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Looking ahead, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol could play a vital role in the blockchain regaining its stature. Ethereum now requires over 99% less energy than before, making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-eco-friendly-crypto.htm">most eco-friendly crypto</a> projects on our list.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy ETH on eToro</a>
<p><i>Your capital is at risk. Crypto asset investments are highly volatile and speculative.</i></p>
<h3><strong>7. Polygon (MATIC) &#8211; Useful Token with Rebound Potential During the Bear Market</strong></h3>
<p>Rounding off our discussion of the best crypto to buy during this dip is Polygon. Polygon is a Layer-2 blockchain designed to work alongside the Ethereum network, making it faster and cheaper for developers.</p>
<p>Due to Polygon&#8217;s critical use case, the project has been able to partner with an array of leading brands. These brands include Meta Platforms, Starbucks, and JPMorgan Chase – with the former two choosing Polygon to power their ventures into the NFT space.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/253171/matic-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Polygon to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Although many believe Polygon may not be required in the future, as Ethereum is expected to continue improving its scalability, this has yet to prove to be the case. MATIC, the network&#8217;s native token, has surged by over 180% since mid-2022 – highlighting that Polygon still has exceptional backing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy MATIC on eToro</a>
<p><i>Your capital is at risk. Crypto asset investments are highly volatile and speculative.</i></p>
<h2><strong>Are We in a Bear Market Now?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve discussed the best crypto to invest in during the bear market, let&#8217;s look closely at the market forces themselves. It&#8217;s important to note that there&#8217;s no clear definition of what a crypto bear market actually is – although some analysts define it as a 20% (or more) decrease in the market&#8217;s value over at least two months.</p>
<p>So are we in a bear market now and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-cryptocurrency-a-good-investment.htm" rel="nofollow">is cryptocurrency still a good investment</a>? According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the crypto market currently has a market cap of $837bn. At the beginning of the year, the market was valued at $2.1trn. Thus, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency market has lost around 60% of its value over the past eleven months.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/236508/are-we-in-a-bear-market.jpg" alt="total cryptocurrency market cap" />

</figure>
<p>Judging by this value decrease, many believe it&#8217;s safe to say that a bear market is ongoing. Another telltale sign is that most (if not all) coins have experienced substantial price falls. For example, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is down by 64% for the year, whilst Ethereum&#8217;s value has fallen by 66%.</p>
<p>Considering these are the two largest coins in the crypto market, it’s clear that sentiment is negative on the whole. Finally, other financial markets, such as the equities and commodities markets, are also experiencing similar downturns – highlighting the far-reaching nature of the bearish momentum.</p>
<h2><strong>What Causes a Crypto Bear Market?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before deciding what crypto to buy during the bear market, it&#8217;s essential to understand the forces that cause the bearish momentum. There can be many factors that contribute to a pricing downturn, which include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Geopolitical crises (e.g. the war in Ukraine)</li>
<li>Rising interest rates</li>
<li>A slowdown in economic growth</li>
<li>Sudden adverse events (e.g. the collapse of FTX)</li>
<li>Public health issues (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic) </li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately for crypto investors, all of the above factors have combined to create the perfect environment for a bear market to take hold. When these factors are present, it creates a ‘risk-off’ atmosphere for investors, leading them to shy away from risky asset classes like crypto.</p>
<p>It may also prompt investors to liquidate their crypto holdings, which causes downward price pressure. However, even amid all the negativity, there are still some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-during-the-crash.htm">cryptos to buy during the crash</a> that offer a ray of light for these investors. </p>
<h2><strong>When Will the Bear Market End?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/08/24/the-average-bear-market-lasts-289-days-how-long-do-we-have-left/">Forbes</a>, the average equity bear market lasts 289 days. Although this can&#8217;t be directly related to the cryptocurrency market, it highlights that these downturns aren&#8217;t fleeting – they can last for months, if not years.</p>
<p>Previous crypto bear markets, such as the ones in 2012 and 2016, have lasted for up to 300 days. There was also a bear market during the COVID-19 crash, although prices rebounded extremely fast in this instance. Unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t the case with current market conditions.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/236509/when-will-the-bear-market-end.jpg" alt="BTC to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, a recent article from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/how-correlated-is-bitcoin-crypto-markets-us-stocks-are-starting-to-look-alike?leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> pointed out that the stock and crypto markets are becoming increasingly correlated. Due to this, there&#8217;s scope for the crypto bear market to end around the same time as the equity bear market. Although there&#8217;s no telling when this might be, this fact gives investors something to look out for.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Should You Invest During a Bear Market?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Finding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next cryptocurrency to explode</a> can be tricky – especially in a bear market. Furthermore, many investors avoid buying new coins entirely due to the overwhelming volatility. But is it still possible to invest during a bear market?</p>
<p>Put simply – yes. It goes without saying that investing during a bear market is much more challenging than during favorable market conditions since coin prices can fluctuate seemingly at random. Moreover, volume can also be lowered since more people are choosing to place their money in &#8216;safe haven&#8217; assets like gold, which can mean bid/ask spreads are wider. However, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-cryptocurrency-safe.htm" rel="nofollow">is cryptocurrency safe?</a></p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/236510/should-you-invest-in-bear-market.jpg" alt="price charts and Bitcoin" /></figure>
<p>Regardless, bear markets allow those with a higher risk tolerance to invest in crypto-assets at a discounted price. Many of the coins that have experienced value decreases haven&#8217;t had any negative news emanating directly from them. This is important, as it highlights their depreciation is more to do with the economic conditions than the project itself. </p>
<p>For this reason, investing in a bear market can be a limited-time opportunity to obtain coins and tokens at a low price. Although there’s no guarantee these assets will recover to their previous highs, those that do will provide incredible returns to risk-seeking investors.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Find Cryptos to Buy in the Bear Market</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those who do decide to invest during a bear market must know what to look for. Bearing that in mind, detailed below are three ways investors can identify cryptos during a downturn:</p>
<h3><strong>Use Technical Analysis to Identify Support</strong></h3>
<p>A popular approach for finding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto</a> projects is to employ technical analysis. This involves analyzing an asset&#8217;s historical price movements to try and identify where the price could go in the future.</p>
<p>A common tactic is determining a coin or token&#8217;s &#8216;support level&#8217;, a specific price point that has historically propped the price up. When an asset has a support level, it indicates a lot of buying pressure around that price point – making it a high-probability rebound area.</p>
<h3><strong>Be Aware of Trending Cryptos on Social Media</strong></h3>
<p>Many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">best cryptos to buy on Reddit</a> are ideal for bear markets since they have the most extensive community backing. Although this may not mean they can provide market-beating returns, these cryptos can often withstand adverse conditions more effectively.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94751/236511/social-media.jpg" alt="CryptoCurrency Reddit" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Look for Projects with a Unique Selling Point (USP)</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, traders and investors should also seek out cryptos that offer use cases they cannot find elsewhere. Since these cryptos are &#8216;unique&#8217;, they&#8217;ll likely have a core group of users that continue to require them, regardless of market conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy During the Bear Market – Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To conclude, this article has taken an in-depth look at the best crypto to buy during this dip by highlighting seven projects with exceptional long-term potential. </p>
<p>Leading the way in this regard is Bitcoin ETF Token. This new crypto speculates the upcoming release of a Bitcoin ETF. $BTCETF, the native token, will burn 25% of its token supply over time. Furthermore, this crypto can be staked to earn high annual yields. $BTCETF is priced at only $0.005 on presale.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Can you make money in a crypto bear market?</strong></p>
<p>Yes – although a crypto bear market is dominated by downward momentum, this can often mean that high-potential cryptocurrencies are trading at a discount.</p>
<p><strong>How do you spot a crypto bear market?</strong></p>
<p>There is no clear definition of a bear market, although some analysts state that it occurs when the overall market has a value decline of over 20% within two or more months.</p>
<p><strong>How long is a crypto bear market?</strong></p>
<p>There is no set timeframe for a crypto bear market to last, with previous down markets lasting between two to four years. However, today&#8217;s market is very different from previous markets, so there&#8217;s no telling how long this downtrend will go on.</p>
<p><strong>Are we still in a bear market?</strong></p>
<p>Most crypto analysts believe that the bear market is still ongoing since there hasn&#8217;t been any sustained upwards momentum recently. Once the majority of coins begin rebounding, that will signify that the bear market may have ended.</p>

<p><i><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Industry Talk section features insights from crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>Bitcoin remains the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, with millions of people globally now holding BTC in the hope of generating above-average returns. In many instances, the coin has also solidified itself as a transactional currency, offering another option for shoppers and merchants. </p>
<p><strong>But is it too late to buy Bitcoin</strong>? In this article, we take a deep dive into Bitcoin&#8217;s price history and examine whether it still has long-term value. We&#8217;ll also highlight where traders can buy Bitcoin today with low fees before presenting some alternative cryptos that may be worth considering.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Is It Too Late to Buy Bitcoin? Our Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>So, is it too late to invest in Bitcoin? Needless to say, Bitcoin isn’t a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> anymore – and could even be considered &#8216;mature&#8217; within the context of the crypto market. Although this means the coin&#8217;s price tends to be less volatile, it also means explosive growth is improbable.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this, such as Bitcoin’s lack of utility and its outdated (and energy-intensive) mining process. However, the main reason is that market participants already know what they&#8217;re getting with Bitcoin – there are no surprises or additional use cases. In turn, there&#8217;s no huge &#8216;rush&#8217; for investors to purchase BTC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94394/235679/is-it-too-late-to-buy-bitcoin.jpg" alt="Bitcoin stack" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is now widely adopted by institutional investors, which has helped dampen volatility. The coin is now used in various <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-index-funds.htm">crypto index funds</a>, although the long-awaited spot BTC ETF remains unavailable, despite numerous applications from the likes of investment giants BlackRock and Fidelity in recent months. The adoption by financial institutions does have its good points, yet it also hints that Bitcoin’s quadruple-digit growth is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Putting everything together, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment.htm">is Bitcoin a good investment</a>? For &#8216;mom and pop&#8217; investors who are looking to gain exposure to digital currencies for the first time, BTC can represent a suitable option. However, for investors that seek high returns and are happy to take on additional risk, there are certainly better options out there.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>People often ask, “Is Bitcoin still worth investing in?” yet fail to understand the coin’s price history – which can help inform future price moves. For those unaware, Bitcoin was founded by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2008, with the coin’s source code released in early 2009.</p>
<p>In its first few years, many viewed Bitcoin as a joke, with its only real adoption coming from underworld websites like Silk Road. Ever wondered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-bitcoin-anonymously.htm">how to buy Bitcoin anonymously</a>? Well, since Bitcoin payments need no intermediary, both parties can remain anonymous, resulting in BTC gaining a reputation for facilitating murky transactions.</p>
<p>BTC’s value began rising in the early 2010s, and between 2013 and 2014, the coin&#8217;s price soared by over 5,600%. At this point, the investment community started taking notice, leading to the formation of many of the top crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">exchanges</a> we see today.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-beginner-crypto.htm">beginner crypto</a>, Bitcoin has maintained &#8216;first-mover&#8217; status within the market, adding credibility in investors&#8217; eyes. Between 2014 and 2020, Bitcoin had several bull runs, which were immediately followed by bearish retracements. However, this all changed in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94394/235681/price-history-2.jpg" alt="Market analysis chart" /></figure>
<p>Between March 2020 and April 2021, Bitcoin’s price rocketed by 1,537%. After a pullback in the months that followed, the price of BTC soared once more towards the end of 2021. As noted by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the Bitcoin’s price reached an all-time high of $68,879 – yet this high was short-lived.</p>
<p>In 2022, after a steep uptrend, BTC saw an accelerated downturn that led the coin to test the $16.2k support level.</p>
<p>This year, however, the bulls have stepped in to regain some momentum and the coin was up by over 90% from July 22 to July 23, almost reaching $32k, although it has since dropped a bit and is trading at around $28.5k at press time.</p>
<p>The following section will see us focus on Bitcoin&#8217;s performance in 2023. However, summarized below are BTC&#8217;s highs and lows from its inception until today:</p>
<ul>
<li>High of<strong> $19,735</strong> in December 2017 – a 933% increase in five months</li>
<li>Low of<strong> $3,270</strong> in December 2018</li>
<li>High of<strong> $13,910</strong> in June 2019</li>
<li>Low of<strong> $3,881</strong> in March 2020</li>
<li>All-time high of <strong>$68,789</strong> in November 2021 – 1,644% higher than March 2020’s lows</li>
<li>Current low of <strong>$17,330</strong> in November 2022</li>
<li>Local high of almost <strong>$32,000</strong> in July 2023</li>
<li>Dropped back to <strong>$28,500</strong> in August 2023, at the time of writing</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How Has Bitcoin Performed in 2022 &#8211; 2023?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Is Bitcoin still worth buying in 2023? To answer this question, it&#8217;s essential to explore how the coin has performed and whether there have been any seismic changes in its utility.</p>
<p>In early 2023, Bitcoin was still cited as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">best crypto to buy according to Reddit</a>. Although the coin&#8217;s price had already fallen significantly from November 2021&#8217;s highs, investors saw this as just another pullback. However, what was considered a temporary pullback turned out to be an extended downtrend.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94394/235682/bitcoin-2022.jpg" alt="Federal Reserve seal" /></figure>
<p>Between November 2021 and June 2022, Bitcoin&#8217;s value collapsed by over 74%. The main reason for this was the investment community&#8217;s prevailing &#8216;risk-off&#8217; sentiment, driven by record-high inflation and rapidly-increasing interest rates. When these two forces combine, they make volatile assets like Bitcoin much less appealing.</p>
<p>Those looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">crypto with the most upside</a> began focusing on other projects, which increased Bitcoin&#8217;s bearish momentum. This wasn&#8217;t helped by large corporate investors like Tesla opting to liquidate significant portions of their BTC holdings. These factors united to create an adverse environment for Bitcoin and its supporters. </p>
<p>The final nail in the coffin for BTC was the liquidity crisis experienced by FTX. Although this crisis wasn&#8217;t directly related to Bitcoin, it caused a contagion effect that rippled throughout the crypto market. This led to a broad sell-off, which forced the price of BTC lower. </p>
<p>However, since the start of 2023, the overall market sentiment showed promise as Bitcoin and the altcoin market saw an uptick. Bitcoin gained over 90% from its $16.2k support level, trading at nearly $32k in July 2023.</p>
<p>BTC has since dropped back to around $28.5k, as of the time of writing in mid-August, but a bull run is expected in early 2024 with the next Bitcoin halving fast approaching and institutional interest still high.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2023-2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Given the points raised in the previous section, is Bitcoin still a good investment? The answer to this question depends on what investors believe a &#8216;good investment&#8217; is. However, in our opinion, Bitcoin&#8217;s days of rocket ship-like growth are well behind it – meaning those looking for explosive returns may be better off looking elsewhere.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94394/235683/bitcoin-price-prediction.jpg" alt="Bitcoin whitepaper" /></p>
<p>Many people would like to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-get-rich-off-crypto.htm">get rich off crypto</a>, yet for this to happen, they&#8217;d need to identify a coin capable of producing triple-digit (or quadruple-digit) growth. The saturated nature of the crypto market now means there are endless possibilities for investors, which takes the attention away from Bitcoin. </p>
<p>We believe that Bitcoin can still provide positive returns in the future – just not to the level seen between 2021 and 2022. With that in mind, detailed below are our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">BTC price predictions</a> for the years ahead, based on both technical and fundamental factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forecast for End of 2023: </strong>We envision the Fed&#8217;s hawkish stance to continue into early 2023, making it difficult for BTC to maintain upward momentum. Due to this, we estimate BTC could value <strong>$36,000</strong> by the end of 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Forecast for End of 2024: </strong>The coming years should see the crypto market rebound, providing a better environment for Bitcoin’s price to grow. Should this occur, we estimate Bitcoin could value <strong>$47,400</strong> by the end of 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Forecast for End of 2025: </strong>For Bitcoin to be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto</a>, we’d need to see wider adoption from financial institutions and more use cases. If this happens, we predict BTC to be valued at nearly <strong>$69,000</strong> by the end of 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Forecast for End of 2030: </strong>Although BTC may not be as innovative as it once was, the coin will still benefit from the growth of other projects. Due to this, we estimate Bitcoin’s value to be around <strong>$100,000</strong> by the end of 2030.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How Could Bitcoin be Used in the Future?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In mid-2021, an article from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/bitcoin-btc-is-at-a-tipping-point-citi-says.html">CNBC reported that Citi thinks Bitcoin is at a “tipping point” in its life cycle</a>. The global bank went on to say that Bitcoin is standing on the precipice between “mainstream acceptance” and “speculative implosion” – and it’s fair to say that the latter prediction appears more likely, given today’s conditions.</p>
<p>The fact that Citi (and others) have opted to discuss Bitcoin is undoubtedly a good thing for the coin&#8217;s prospects. Although BTC may not be the best option for retail investors, it&#8217;s the closest to being widely adopted by financial institutions. At the time of writing, several Bitcoin ETFs are now available for trading, offered by leading names like ProShares, VanEck, and Valkyrie.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94394/235684/future-of-btc-1.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0948f1a9-ad0b-4126-9ae8-5ce4e212c07e">Investment giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity</a> are among a number of globally recognizable firms that want to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to their clients and have applied in 2023.</p>
<p>However, one major stumbling block for Bitcoin is the network&#8217;s substantial energy requirements. Those looking to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-sustainable-cryptocurrency.htm">most sustainable cryptocurrency</a> tend to avoid Bitcoin, as the network relies on &#8216;mining&#8217; to validate transactions. This mining process uses computers that require vast amounts of electricity, which contributes to global warming.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, an article from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/">Forbes reported that the Bitcoin network consumes more energy per year than the entire country of Norway</a>. This fact has made it difficult for institutions to adopt Bitcoin, as they’d be seen as promoting an environmentally-damaging asset.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94394/235685/future-of-btc-2.jpg" alt="Bitcoin network power demand" />
<figcaption><i>Data gathered from https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But what else could Bitcoin be used for? The coin&#8217;s future may lie in being a medium of exchange, and it is already accepted by over 15,000 merchants worldwide. There are many benefits for merchants who accept BTC, such as faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and the ability to send cross-border payments easily.</p>
<p>Considering the points raised above, is it too late to buy Bitcoin? Unlike the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a>, Bitcoin struggles from a lack of utility, which has undoubtedly contributed to the bearish sentiment around the coin. </p>
<p>Due to this, we believe that Bitcoin&#8217;s huge price movements are a thing of the past. However, for beginner investors looking to gain exposure to the crypto market, Bitcoin is still a viable option due to its accessibility.</p>
<h2><strong>What Experts Say on Whether it’s Too Late to Buy Bitcoin</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-emerging-cryptos.htm">emerging cryptos</a> now taking centre stage, the market’s attention is gradually shifting away from Bitcoin. However, many experts are still intrigued by the coin’s prospects. Let’s take a closer look at three experts that have discussed Bitcoin in recent times:</p>
<h3><strong>Michael Novogratz</strong></h3>
<p>Michael Novogratz is the CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners, an investment firm that focuses on the crypto markets. Novogratz is one of the largest investors in the space and reportedly has a net worth of over $1bn.</p>
<p>A recent article by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-08/novogratz-doubtful-bitcoin-will-push-through-30-000-soon?leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg quoted Novogratz as saying it&#8217;s &#8220;doubtful&#8221; that Bitcoin will exceed $30,000 anytime soon</a>. Moreover, Novogratz also noted a lack of institutional capital flowing into the space, hampering Bitcoin&#8217;s progress.</p>
<h3><strong>Cathie Wood</strong></h3>
<p>Cathie Wood is a famous investor and founder of Ark Invest. Ark Invest emerged as one of the world&#8217;s most innovative investment firms in 2020, yet its downfall has been dramatic.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94394/235686/cathie-wood.jpg" alt="Cathie Wood" /></figure>
<p>Although not directly attributed to Wood, an Ark Invest analyst came out earlier in the year and stated they believe BTC could value more than $1m by 2030. Wood herself has also admitted to purchasing $100,000 worth of Bitcoin, highlighting her bullish stance.</p>

<h2><strong>Where to Buy Bitcoin</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those wondering, &#8220;Is it too late to buy Bitcoin?&#8221; will now have a clearer understanding of Bitcoin&#8217;s plus points – and its downsides. Regardless, many investors will still wish to gain exposure to BTC&#8217;s price movements, as it still represents a viable option for portfolio diversification.</p>
<p>In our experience, one of the easiest ways to buy Bitcoin online is MEXC, which is a popular crypto exchange with 0% spot market trading fees.</p>

<p>All you have to do is sign up with your email, MetaMask wallet or Telegram or Google account and purchase Bitcoin with a SEPA bank transfer or a card. Some third-party service providers accept even Apple Pay and Google Pay. Depending on which way you choose to buy BTC, you&#8217;ll need to verify your ID. After that, you can either withdraw your Bitcoin or lock them in MEXC Savings to earn up to 1.80% APR.</p>
<p>If you need quick access to liquidity, use your BTC coins as collateral and borrow funds with MEXC Loans. This comes with low daily interest rates, which you can repay whenever you want. </p>

<h2><strong>Is It Too Late to Buy Bitcoin? Our Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Summarizing all of the points raised in this article, is it too late to buy Bitcoin? Given the information presented above, we believe it&#8217;s too late to buy Bitcoin for investors seeking exponential returns. The coin is in the &#8216;mature&#8217; stage of its life cycle, meaning explosive growth is now a thing of the past. </p>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin has an evident lack of utility compared to projects like Ethereum and Cardano. These projects have smart contract functionality and offer a platform for dApp developers to make their ideas into reality. Bitcoin offers nothing like this, which has damaged its prospects irreversibly.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94394/235689/the-verdict.jpg" alt="Bitcoin coin" /></figure>
<p>Although Bitcoin may not be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-crypto-gainers.htm">top crypto gainers</a> in the future, it still has a role to play and should be considered as part of a diversified investment portfolio. The coin is the first to be adopted by institutions, likely leading to the spot Bitcoin ETF investors have been seeking. Moreover, BTC has emerged as a viable medium of exchange, which should help maintain a base level of demand.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s now challenging to back Bitcoin over the long term. The aforementioned lack of utility and its damaging environmental impact create a clear roadblock to progress. For this reason, we believe there are better options for crypto investors, especially those looking to make fast and large gains rather than waiting for an investment to mature.</p>
<h3><strong>BTC Halving Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Upcoming Bitcoin halving is set for 2024, which will lower the quantity of new BTC tokens entering the market.</p>
<p>This event will cut mining earnings from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin. In the past, halvings have drastically altered Bitcoin&#8217;s price. For instance, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-24/what-is-bitcoin-halving-and-does-it-push-up-the-cryptocurrency-s-price-q-a">after the 2012 halving, the price skyrocketed by a staggering 500% percentage</a>. The 2016 halving resulted in a price rise of over 280% in the following months.</p>
<p>Post the 2020 halving, Bitcoin&#8217;s value rose by over 500%. Consequently, If the demand for Bitcoin goes up, we could see a significant increase in the value of BTC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/standard-chartered-bumps-up-bitcoin-forecast-120000-2023-07-10/">Top analysts at leading investment bank Standard Chartered</a> believe the halving could see the price of BTC rocket to $120,000 by the end of 2024.</p>

<h3><b>Other Bitcoin Alternatives &#8211; Get High Staking Rewards with Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Set to Burn 25% of its Token Supply</b></h3>
<p>One of the top alternatives to Bitcoin is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) &#8211; a new cryptocurrency that is anticipating the imminence of Bitcoin ETFs. This deflationary cryptocurrency will burn 25% of its token supply over time and offers huge staking yields to token holders. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1321" height="615" class="aligncenter wp-image-127808" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am.png 1321w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-1024x477.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-768x358.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1321px) 100vw, 1321px" /></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token whitepaper</a> &#8211; the project will burn 5% of its token supply for each of the 5 milestones it achieves. The milestones are connected to Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin in one way or another. Some of these include: </p>
<ul>
<li>SEC approving the first Bitcoin Spot ETF</li>
<li>The release of the first ETF</li>
<li>The ETF crossing $1 billion in assets under management</li>
<li>$BTCETF reaching $100 million in trading volume</li>
<li>Bitcoin trading past the $100K mark</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bitcoin Spot ETF will allow the asset to be traded like any other share on a stock market. This will let investors trade the cryptocurrency without holding the underlying asset. </p>
<p>By conducting the burning milestones, Bitcoin ETF Token wants to celebrate the development of the Bitcoin ETF. Furthermore, Bitcoin ETF Token will charge a 5% burn tax on each $BTCETF transaction. The tax will reduce by 1% on the completion of every milestone. </p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token has a total supply of 2.1 billion &#8211; 40% of which has been allocated for the ongoing presale. The presale consists of ten rounds, each allocating 84 million tokens. Currently, $BTCETF is priced at $0.005 during the first round. The price will increase to $0.0068 by the final round. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1210" height="417" class="aligncenter wp-image-127528" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token milestones" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png 1210w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-300x103.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-1024x353.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699275120-bitcoin-etf-milestones-768x265.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1210px) 100vw, 1210px" /></p>
<p>Another 25% of the supply will be distributed as staking rewards. $BTCETF token holders can lock their holdings on a verified smart contract, and generate passive income. At the time of writing, the staking annual yields are as high as 5,800%. </p>
<p>The smart contract of this new project has been verified by Coinsult. Join the <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Bitcoin ETF Token Telegram channel</a> to learn more about this cryptocurrency. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Is it too late to buy Bitcoin in 2023?</strong></p>
<p>The question of &#8220;Is it too late to buy Bitcoin in 2023?&#8221; is asked regularly, and our answer remains the same – it depends on the individual&#8217;s unique trading goals. However, if those goals are to generate triple-digit returns in a short space of time, we&#8217;d say it&#8217;s better to consider other coins.</p>
<p><strong>Is Bitcoin going to go up in value soon?</strong></p>
<p>It’s unlikely that Bitcoin’s value will rise substantially in the short term, as the sentiment around the crypto market is still overwhelmingly bearish. Moreover, the Fed has hinted at further rate increases, which puts even more pressure on risky assets like BTC.</p>
<p><strong>How many years will Bitcoin last?</strong></p>
<p>The last Bitcoin is expected to be mined by 2140, meaning there will be no more mining fees. This would likely make BTC unappealing to these miners, who may look elsewhere – prompting the coin to lose its top-tier status.</p>
<p><strong>Can you still mine Bitcoin?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s still possible to mine Bitcoin. However, custom-built computing systems are now required due to the scale of the Bitcoin network.</p>

We&rsquo;ll also take a deep dive into what ecoterra is and how it works, before highlighting whether it could be the largest crypto launch of 2023.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit ecoterra Now</a></div></div><h2><strong>What is ecoterra?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So, what is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/en">ecoterra</a>? Put simply, ecoterra is an innovative &#8216;Recycle2Earn&#8217; project that enables individuals and businesses to earn rewards by recycling. In addition, the ecoterra ecosystem also includes a carbon offset marketplace, a recycled materials marketplace, and a trackable impact profile &ndash; providing a true &lsquo;all-in-one&rsquo; environment that enhances collaboration.</p><p>The ecoterra project leverages the power of the Ethereum blockchain to bring this Recycle2Earn mechanism to the masses securely and transparently. At the heart of the project is the ECOTERRA token, used for rewards distribution, staking, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted in ecoterra&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ecoterra.io/documents/whitepaper-ecoterra.pdf">whitepaper</a>, climate change experts are increasingly worried that the global warming threshold will be exceeded in the next two decades &ndash; which would be disastrous for humanity. ecoterra is one of the few crypto projects aware of this and has designed several use cases to help tackle the issue.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/275513/ecoterra-recycling.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/275513/responsive-images/ecoterra-recycling___media_library_original_870_872.jpg 870w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/275513/responsive-images/ecoterra-recycling___media_library_original_720_722.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/275513/responsive-images/ecoterra-recycling___media_library_original_600_601.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/275513/responsive-images/ecoterra-recycling___media_library_original_300_301.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="870" class="content-img"></figure><p>The previously-mentioned Recycle2Earn protocol is at the center of everything ecoterra hopes to achieve. This protocol works by distributing ECOTERRA tokens to users who recycle using reverse vending machines (RVMs). Since these RVMs also provide FIAT currency as a reward, ecoterra users can earn two rewards for recycling.</p><p>However, given that ecoterra looks set to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">best crypto ICOs</a> of the year, there&rsquo;s a high likelihood that the value of ECOTERRA tokens will increase in the future. As such, the platform&rsquo;s users can also benefit from these value increases &ndash; incentivizing further recycling activities.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264398/what-is-ecoterra-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264398/responsive-images/what-is-ecoterra-2___media_library_original_2380_666.jpg 2380w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264398/responsive-images/what-is-ecoterra-2___media_library_original_1200_336.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264398/responsive-images/what-is-ecoterra-2___media_library_original_900_252.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264398/responsive-images/what-is-ecoterra-2___media_library_original_720_201.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264398/responsive-images/what-is-ecoterra-2___media_library_original_600_168.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264398/responsive-images/what-is-ecoterra-2___media_library_original_300_84.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="2380" class="content-img"></figure><p>Recycle2Earn is just one facet of the ecoterra ecosystem &ndash; we&rsquo;ll take a deep dive into the others later in this guide.

They can then choose the relevant operating system and create a password to finalize the setup.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264399/metamask.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264399/responsive-images/metamask___media_library_original_1360_864.jpg 1360w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264399/responsive-images/metamask___media_library_original_1200_762.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264399/responsive-images/metamask___media_library_original_900_572.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264399/responsive-images/metamask___media_library_original_720_457.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264399/responsive-images/metamask___media_library_original_600_381.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264399/responsive-images/metamask___media_library_original_300_191.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1360" class="content-img"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2 &ndash; Purchase ETH or USDT</strong></h3><p>Investors can buy ECOTERRA tokens through the presale using either ETH or USDT. These tokens can be easily purchased from many top brokers and exchanges.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, ecoterra&#8217;s presale dashboard lets investors buy tokens directly using a debit/credit card.</p><h3><strong>Step 3 &ndash; Connect Wallet to ecoterra Presale</strong></h3><p>Head to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/en">ecoterra&rsquo;s website</a> and click &lsquo;Connect Wallet&rsquo;. In the pop-up box, choose the relevant wallet provider and follow the instructions to make the link.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264400/connect-wallet.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264400/responsive-images/connect-wallet___media_library_original_510_520.jpg 510w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264400/responsive-images/connect-wallet___media_library_original_300_306.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="510" class="content-img"></figure><h3><strong>Step 4 &ndash; Buy ECOTERRA Tokens</strong></h3><p>Once a wallet has been connected, investors can input the amount of ETH/USDT/USD they&#8217;d like to invest. There is no minimum or maximum investment amount set for the presale.</p><p>After this, all that&#8217;s left is to confirm the transaction with the wallet provider. However, it&#8217;s crucial to have a little extra crypto left in the wallet to cover the gas fees associated with the token purchase.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264401/buy-ecoterra.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264401/responsive-images/buy-ecoterra___media_library_original_756_486.jpg 756w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264401/responsive-images/buy-ecoterra___media_library_original_720_463.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264401/responsive-images/buy-ecoterra___media_library_original_600_386.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264401/responsive-images/buy-ecoterra___media_library_original_300_193.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="756" class="content-img"></figure><h3><strong>Step 5 &ndash; Claim ECOTERRA Tokens</strong></h3><p>Investors can then claim their purchased tokens through the ecoterra website once the presale has ended. Ecoterra&#8217;s team hasn&#8217;t implemented a vesting structure for after the presale, meaning investors will have instant access to the tokens they&#8217;ve purchased.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit ecoterra Now</a></div></div><h2><strong>A Closer Look at ecoterra</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Given that ecoterra is currently in its growth phase, there&rsquo;s scope for it to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-micro-cap-crypto.htm">best micro-cap cryptos</a> on the market in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The demand for ecoterra will likely be driven by the project&rsquo;s innovative use cases, which can be split into four separate areas. Let&rsquo;s take a brief look at each of these areas:</p><h3><strong>Recycle2Earn App</strong></h3><p>Ecoterra&#8217;s Recycle2Earn mechanism was briefly described earlier, yet it serves as the heartbeat of the entire ecosystem. Using this app, ecoterra&#8217;s users will earn ECOTERRA tokens every time they use an RVM to recycle items, whether that be cardboard boxes or soda cans.&nbsp;</p><p>However, users can also earn ECOTERRA in other ways. Users can drop off old clothing items to retailers like H&amp;M or Patagonia, who will recycle the items. If a user takes a photo of their recycling receipt from the retailer and uploads it to the app, they will be rewarded with ECOTERRA tokens.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264402/recycle2earn.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264402/responsive-images/recycle2earn___media_library_original_1650_978.jpg 1650w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264402/responsive-images/recycle2earn___media_library_original_1200_711.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264402/responsive-images/recycle2earn___media_library_original_900_533.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264402/responsive-images/recycle2earn___media_library_original_720_427.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264402/responsive-images/recycle2earn___media_library_original_600_356.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264402/responsive-images/recycle2earn___media_library_original_300_178.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1650" class="content-img"></figure><p>Additionally, users can even earn tokens by using renewable energy sources in their day-to-day lives. For example, users who utilize solar panels to power their homes can scan their electricity bill, upload it to the Recycle2Earn app, and generate even more ECOTERRA tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>These tokens can be held for investment purposes, spent on ecological activities, or even used to access ecoterra&#8217;s planned educational courses &ndash; a crucial part of the project&#8217;s roadmap.</p><h3><strong>Carbon Offset Marketplace</strong></h3><p>Another reason ecoterra could be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-crypto-bull-run-coins.htm">next crypto bull run coins</a> is the practicality of its built-in carbon offset marketplace. This marketplace enables individuals and businesses to use ECOTERRA (and other cryptos) to purchase carbon offsets &ndash; thereby making a positive impact in the fight against climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the carbon offsets offered through the ecoterra marketplace are fully-verified in conjunction with <a href="https://verra.org/programs/verified-carbon-standard/">Verra.org</a> &ndash; one of the leaders in the space. As such, those who invest in these offsets can be sure they&#8217;re not being scammed and are making a tangible impact.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Recycled Materials Marketplace</strong></h3><p>The recycled materials marketplace targets businesses looking to implement these materials into their operations. Through the ecoterra app, these businesses can purchase recycled resources using ECOTERRA tokens, other cryptos, and even FIAT currency.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264403/recycled-materials.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264403/responsive-images/recycled-materials___media_library_original_1662_660.jpg 1662w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264403/responsive-images/recycled-materials___media_library_original_1200_477.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264403/responsive-images/recycled-materials___media_library_original_900_357.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264403/responsive-images/recycled-materials___media_library_original_720_286.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264403/responsive-images/recycled-materials___media_library_original_600_238.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264403/responsive-images/recycled-materials___media_library_original_300_119.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1662" class="content-img"></p><p>The app will feature advanced filtering criteria, which allows businesses to find the exact materials they require. Additionally, the app will even enable companies to create special requests for specific recycled resources &ndash; creating a collaborative environment that promotes network and eco-friendly actions.</p><h3><strong>Impact Profile</strong></h3><p>Finally, all users of ecoterra&rsquo;s ecosystem will have an &lsquo;Impact Profile&rsquo;. This is akin to a social media profile and provides an objective and transparent assessment of each individual or business&rsquo; impact in the fight against climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this Impact Profile will be publicly viewable, all of ecoterra&rsquo;s users will be incentivized to recycle and use the ecosystem to its fullest. Users will even earn NFT badges for their profile whenever certain recycling milestones are met, thereby gamifying the experience.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit ecoterra Now</a></div></div><h2><strong>Is ecoterra a Good Investment? Key Takeaways</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As highlighted in the section above, ecoterra&rsquo;s four main features combine to create an innovative platform that offers use cases that have yet to be seen within the context of the crypto market. But is investing in ECOTERRA tokens a good idea?&nbsp;</p><p>To answer this question, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at some of the project&rsquo;s main plus points:</p><h3><strong>Uncapped Earning Potential</strong></h3><p>ecoterra is one of the few <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-launches.htm">new crypto launches</a> that has created an entirely new use case &ndash; and one that offers limitless earning potential for users. Since users&#8217; tokenized rewards are tied to the amount they recycle, there&#8217;s no cap on how many ECOTERRA tokens they can make.</p><p>Users can recycle everyday plastic materials and clothes, along with using renewable energy sources, to earn ECOTERRA. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, ecoterra&rsquo;s team has even revealed plans for a staking protocol that will be released in the future &ndash; this will enable ECOTERRA holders to generate a recurring passive income stream.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Simple Way of Making a Positive Environmental Impact</strong></h3><p>Another massive benefit of the ecoterra project is that it enables individuals and businesses to make a positive environmental impact with little effort. This is achieved through the carbon offset marketplace, an integral part of the ecoterra app.</p><p>A recent report from <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-the-voluntary-carbon-market-is-thriving">Boston Consulting Group</a> has highlighted that the voluntary carbon credit market is expected to be valued at between $10 billion and $40 billion by 2030. However, due to its complexity, the market is still relatively inaccessible to individuals.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/275515/ecoterra-pollution.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/275515/responsive-images/ecoterra-pollution___media_library_original_900_859.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/275515/responsive-images/ecoterra-pollution___media_library_original_720_687.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/275515/responsive-images/ecoterra-pollution___media_library_original_600_573.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/275515/responsive-images/ecoterra-pollution___media_library_original_300_286.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img"></figure><p>ecoterra streamlines the process of getting involved by enabling users to purchase carbon offsets directly through the app. What&rsquo;s more, users can also spend their ECOTERRA tokens on these carbon offsets, meaning there&rsquo;s no need to use their own capital to fund purchases.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Scope for Huge Token Price Growth</strong></h3><p>Many also believe that ecoterra could be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next crypto to explode</a>, given the limitless potential that the project has. Furthermore, ECOTERRA is part of the Ethereum ecosystem, meaning there&rsquo;s scope for these tokens to be integrated into other decentralized applications (dApps) in the future.</p><p>Even if no integration occurs, ECOTERRA will likely see explosive demand once the presale ends and the token is listed on major exchanges &ndash; assuming the hype continues growing around the project. Given that there&#8217;s no fixed vesting period, presale investors can &#8216;cash in&#8217; on their purchased tokens if they please.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Unique Position Within the Crypto Market</strong></h3><p>Finally, ecoterra could also be a good investment due to its unique position in the crypto market. As noted earlier, no other crypto project offers the same use cases as ecoterra does &ndash; providing it an unmistakable &#8216;Unique Selling Point&#8217; (USP).</p><p>The uniqueness of ecoterra will likely be one of the primary drivers of token demand. In addition, ecoterra&#8217;s roadmap also presents plans to explore corporate partnerships, adding enormous credibility and increasing the project&#8217;s intrinsic value.</p><h2><strong>ecoterra Price Action &ndash; What to Know</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As noted earlier, ecoterra is in its presale phase, meaning tokens are not yet publicly traded. Crypto presales, like the one seen with ecoterra, are an excellent way for projects to boost awareness and raise the required capital for a successful launch.</p><p>Investors can only buy ecoterra tokens through the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/en">official website</a> using ETH, USDT, or credit/debit card. There is no minimum or maximum investment, ensuring anyone can get involved.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264405/price-history.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264405/responsive-images/price-history___media_library_original_1560_988.jpg 1560w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264405/responsive-images/price-history___media_library_original_1200_760.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264405/responsive-images/price-history___media_library_original_900_570.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264405/responsive-images/price-history___media_library_original_720_456.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264405/responsive-images/price-history___media_library_original_600_380.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264405/responsive-images/price-history___media_library_original_300_190.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1560" class="content-img"></p><p>ecoterra&#8217;s presale was split into nine separate stages, each containing between 10% and 20% of the total presale token allocation. Notably, the ecoterra token price differed depending on the stage. Stage 1 had the lowest token price, set at $0.004, while Stage 9 has the highest, specified at $0.01 &ndash; 150% higher than the first stage.</p><p>At the time of writing, the presale is in stage 9 with ECOTERRA on sale for $0.01.</p><p>The presale stages are broken down as follows:</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Phase</strong></td><td><strong>Token Price</strong></td><td><strong>Percentage</strong></td><td><strong>Number of Tokens</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Stage 1</td><td>$0.00400</td><td>20%</td><td>200,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 2</td><td>$0.00475</td><td>10%</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 3</td><td>$0.00550</td><td>10%</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 4</td><td>$0.00625</td><td>10%</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 5</td><td>$0.00700</td><td>10%</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 6</td><td>$0.00775</td><td>10%</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 7</td><td>$0.00850</td><td>10%</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 8</td><td>$0.00925</td><td>10%</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 9</td><td>$0.01000</td><td>10%</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The total supply of ecoterra tokens is two billion &ndash; meaning 50% of the supply is reserved for presale investors. This setup ensures that a considerable portion of the minted ECOTERRA tokens is in the hands of early investors, eliminating the likelihood of manipulation or rug pulls.</p><p>Moreover, only 5% of the total token supply has been earmarked for the development team, with the remainder used for tasks like marketing, liquidity, and exchange listings.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, ecoterra has set its soft cap at $2m &ndash; the minimum amount that needs to be raised to continue the project&#8217;s development and which has now been surpassed. However, the hard cap has been set at $6.7m, which is the maximum amount of funds that the presale can generate.</p><h3><strong>ecoterra Price Forecast</strong></h3><p>As one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-eco-friendly-crypto.htm">most eco-friendly crypto</a> projects to launch this year, ecoterra has put itself in a fantastic position for growth. But how could the ECOTERRA token price shape up in the coming months?</p><p>No listing price has yet been set by ecoterra&#8217;s development team, meaning presale investors won&#8217;t know how much of a &#8216;paper profit&#8217; they&#8217;ve locked in until closer to the exchange listings. However, like all crypto presales, ecoterra&#8217;s initial listing price will likely be significantly higher than during the final presale stage.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264406/price-prediction.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109046/264406/responsive-images/price-prediction___media_library_original_1874_914.jpg 1874w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264406/responsive-images/price-prediction___media_library_original_1200_585.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264406/responsive-images/price-prediction___media_library_original_900_439.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264406/responsive-images/price-prediction___media_library_original_720_351.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264406/responsive-images/price-prediction___media_library_original_600_293.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109046/264406/responsive-images/price-prediction___media_library_original_300_146.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1874" class="content-img"></figure><p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the crypto trading volume has steadily increased since early March. This hints that the investment community is ready to re-enter the market on a broad scale &ndash; which is bodes well for a positive <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecoterra-price-prediction.htm">ecoterra price prediction</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, there&rsquo;s no telling exactly where the ECOTERRA token price could go once it&rsquo;s listed &ndash; it&rsquo;s just too early to say. However, given that many successful presale projects, like Tamadoge and Lucky Block, produced quadruple-digit returns for investors once exchange listings had occurred, there&rsquo;s always a chance that a similar scenario could play out with ecoterra.</p><h2><strong>The Verdict?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>To conclude, this guide has taken an in-depth look at the ecoterra crypto project and detailed how investors can get involved through the presale phase immediately.</p><p>Stage 9 of ecoterra&#8217;s presale is still ongoing, meaning investors can buy ECOTERRA tokens for just $0.01 in the final stage before it reaches exchanges.</p><p>More than $6 million has been invested since the presale started, with the closing date set on July 13.</p><p>There is no minimum or maximum investment amount during the presale, while no vesting period will be required once it ends.</p><p>ecoterra&rsquo;s eco-friendly use cases and innovative earnings protocols have already caused a stir within the investment community &ndash; with many speculating that this could be one of the largest crypto presales of 2023.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit ecoterra Now</a></div></div><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>How do I buy ecoterra tokens?</strong></p><p>Ecoterra is still in its presale phase, meaning tokens can only be bought through the project&rsquo;s official website.

Alternatively, investors can use a credit/debit card to buy ECOTERRA tokens directly.</p><p><strong>What is the price of ecoterra?</strong></p><p>At the time of writing, the price of one ECOTERRA token is set at $0.01 However, this price is only available during Stage 9 &ndash; the token price will increase incrementally between stages. $6 million has been raised since launch. The presale will close on July 13.</p><p><strong>Is ecoterra a good investment?</strong></p><p>Many market commentators believe that ecoterra could be a good investment due to the unique way that it incentivizes individuals and businesses to recycle. Moreover, ecoterra&#8217;s exciting use of NFTs allows users to show off their positive impact &ndash; adding a real sense of community to the project.</p><p><strong>What is the total supply of ecoterra tokens?</strong></p><p>The total supply of ecoterra tokens is two billion. One billion of these tokens have been set aside for presale investors, while the remaining one billion tokens will be used for elements such as exchange listings, liquidity, and marketing.</p>

<p>You’re thinking about buying bitcoin, but you’re not quite there yet. Something is missing, but you’re not sure what. Well, you won’t learn everything there is about Bitcoin and blockchain in a day, though there are few things you should be aware of before you buy bitcoin.</p>
<p>This guide focuses on three things you should know before you buy bitcoin.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is bitcoin actually and what does it mean?</li>
<li>How profitable is bitcoin trading?</li>
<li>How to avoid bitcoin frauds and scams?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s have a closer look at each of these.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-buy-bitcoin-#1:-what-is-bitcoin-and-what-does-it-mean?">Before you buy bitcoin #1: What is Bitcoin and what does it mean?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>First of all, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-cryptocurrency.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrencies</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> are nothing like traditional finance. In fact, they were created in response to traditional banking failure during the 2008 global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The creator of Bitcoin, a mysterious group or individual <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satoshi Nakamoto</a></b> strictly believed in personal freedom to transact with whomever you want, individual privacy (which is why he remained anonymous), and fragility of centralized traditional finance (evident in the corruption and abuse of its power, which also leads to detrimental events like financial crisis).</p>
<p>Modern money system relies on inflating people’s hard-earned cash by design to discourage saving and encourage spending. Precisely for this reason, Bitcoin was made to be <b>deflationary</b> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but not in a way you think</a>).</p>
<p>Digital cash systems (like DigiCash or E-Gold) were already conceived in the ’90s but failed in their implementation. According to Satoshi Nakamoto, it was their centralized nature that led to their failure. That’s why the individual or group of people behind the Satoshi’s pseudonym designed bitcoin to be <b>a completely decentralized system</b> with <b>no central authority</b> or <b>central point of failure</b> (like central and commercial banks) to control it, freeze your account if they don’t like you, censor your transactions or simply confiscate your money without your permission. Decentralization is a security feature, too &#8211; there’s no central institution or data center to be hacked, which is why Bitcoin is the most secure financial system ever made.</p>
<p>Essentially, the Bitcoin Network is an open-source P2P project much like <b>Wikipedia</b> or <b>Linux-based</b> operational systems. Anyone is free to run a bitcoin node, develop applications on top of its protocol, or fork it, which makes Bitcoin the ultimate people’s money and free speech tool &#8211; something that our civilization has never had before.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-buy-bitcoin-#2:-there-are-no-guaranteed-profits-in-bitcoin">Before you buy bitcoin #2: There are no guaranteed profits in bitcoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The internet is full of pieces of advice <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about buying bitcoins</a>, but you need to keep in mind that not everything applies to every instance. Your mileage may vary, as they say.</p>
<p>Many people looking to buy bitcoin still treat it as a get-rich-quick scheme. That is not entirely wrong &#8211; bitcoin has made a lot of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/this-20-y-o-crypto-millionaire-has-a-message-for-you-3871.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early adopters filthy rich</a>. Just look at this incredible performance during the first ten years of bitcoins existence &#8211; it’s definitely something to behold.</p>
<figure class="center"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 1458w" alt="bitcoin price history before you buy btc" />

<p>Despite a successful decade, there are no guaranteed returns in bitcoin. In fact, bitcoin is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/will-bitcoin-ever-be-stable.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very volatile</a>, and many people have lost their hard-earned money, too. A golden rule to follow here is that you should never buy bitcoin for more than you can afford to lose. Keep in mind that despite the security of a decentralized network, Bitcoin is still a social experiment in its infancy. It may succeed, or it may fail, and no one knows for sure which one it will be.</p>
<p>The situation is best illustrated in the following tweet by Bitcoin developer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/jameson-lopp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jameson Lopp</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-buy-bitcoin-#3:--beware-of-frauds-and-scams">Before you buy bitcoin #3: Beware of frauds and scams</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Third, you’ve probably heard about many hacks and scams surrounding the cryptocurrency space. Indeed, in 2018 alone, hackers manage to steal nearly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-cryptocurrency-scams-work-3889.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.7 billion</a>. But does that mean bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are unsafe? Not exactly.</p>
<p>Most cryptocurrency hacks happen due to security holes in cryptocurrency exchanges. Every crypto exchange has a built-in wallet where you can send and receive your crypto funds. It’s a rather convenient place to keep your coins &#8211; you can sell it anytime, and you don’t have to do anything to set up your own crypto wallet &#8211; the funds are always at your fingertips. They are like banks of the crypto world. However, there’s an issue.</p>
<figure class="center"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5ce/3af77e23f4.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5ce/3af77e23f4.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5ce/3af77e23f4.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5ce/3af77e23f4.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5ce/3af77e23f4.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5ce/3af77e23f4.jpg 1280w" alt="before you buy bitcoin security" />

<p>Funds stored at a cryptocurrency exchange aren’t precisely yours. Exchanges do not give you any private keys which prove your ownership of bitcoin. So, if an exchange mismanages its operations, they can lose your funds, too, and it has happened many times before (ever head of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/mt-gox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mt. Gox</a>?).</p>
<p>Whether it is out of sheer ignorance or convenience, many people still keep their bitcoins in a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-it-is-risky-to-leave-your-cryptocurrency-in-exchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency exchange wallet</a>. This makes exchanges an ideal target for a hacking attack. It’s like a honeypot with minimal risk and maximum reward. That’s why hackers develop extremely elaborate schemes on how to rob cryptocurrency exchanges. Unfortunately, some of them are successful. Ultimately, there’s no point to rely on centralized services if you want to use a decentralized system like bitcoin. It just goes against the entire idea.</p>

<p>Apart from bitcoin, there are more than <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4000 cryptocurrencies</a> which utilize blockchain technology in one way or another, and some of them are complete scams. Bitcoin is like a father figure to most altcoins. Some of them are mere copies of the core protocol, while others are doing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-are-altcoins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something completely different.</a></p>
<p>For instance, if you’d go to <b>Bitcoin.com</b> or followed <b>@Bitcoin</b> handle on Twitter, it would like you have found an easy way to buy bitcoin. However, Bitcoin.com actually sells <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a>, a fork of original <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin (BTC)</a></b>. Although typically it would be treated as false advertising, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) developers believe that their version of Bitcoin (Cash) is the actual original bitcoin, even though most of the world disagrees. Since bitcoin is open-source software and not a copyrighted brand, there are misinformation campaigns like this.</p>

<p><i><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>AiDoge is the latest crypto to emerge from the artificial intelligence (AI) craze, leveraging the immense potential of this technology to offer several unique use cases. Given its meme coin style and built-in earnings mechanism, the project is in a prime position to benefit from the hype around AI-themed cryptos.</p>
<p>This <strong>AiDoge price prediction</strong> takes a deep dive into the project&#8217;s prospects and provides value estimations for the months and years ahead. We&#8217;ll also cover the factors that might affect AiDoge&#8217;s price before presenting a quick-step guide showing how investors can participate in the presale today.</p>
<h2><strong>AiDoge Price Prediction – Key Points</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before covering the intricacies of our AiDoge price prediction, here’s a brief overview of our estimations for the coming years: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023: </strong>AiDoge&#8217;s team has presented plans to launch $AI tokens on several exchanges in Q3 2023 at a price of $0.0000336. The hype surrounding this event could help the token price rise to <strong>$0.000040</strong> by the end of 2023.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025: </strong>Many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects are looking to capitalize on the tremendous power of AI, which is likely to be an ongoing trend. Given AiDoge&#8217;s obvious link to this technology, we could see demand push the $AI price to <strong>$0.00011</strong> by the end of 2025.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2030: </strong>Looking even further ahead, our AiDoge price forecast for 2023 estimates the token could be valued at <strong>$0.00037</strong>. This would represent a 1,001% return for Stage 1 presale investors, should this scenario happen.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>AiDoge Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/">AiDoge</a> is a brand-new AI-integrated meme platform that harnesses the incredible power of this technology to produce topical (and funny) memes. The platform’s built-in meme generator makes creating memes simple – no prior photo editing experience is required.</p>
<p>Similar to tools like ChatGPT, AiDoge&#8217;s meme generator uses text prompts to generate memes. This means that users simply need to type in the type of meme they&#8217;re looking to create, and the meme generator will instantly produce an image that considers the user&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271307/price-history.jpg" alt="Ai Doge token presale page" /></p>
<p>The power of memes can&#8217;t be understated since they&#8217;ve transitioned from a source of entertainment into a genuine way for people to express themselves. According to an article from the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220928-the-surprising-power-of-internet-memes">BBC</a>, memes have emerged as tools for connection, social influence, and even political subversion.   </p>
<p>Thus, AiDoge&#8217;s unique meme generation setup will likely appeal to millions worldwide who want to create memes for personal or business reasons. For example, an individual on LinkedIn may wish to make a meme that highlights their skills in a humorous way – AiDoge can produce such an image in seconds.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://aidoge.com/assets/documents/Aidoge_Whitepaper.pdf">AiDoge whitepaper</a>, the ecosystem’s native token, called $AI, will serve as a transactional currency. Users must own $AI tokens to generate memes, although these tokens can also be staked to earn daily rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271318/what-is-aidoge.jpg" alt="Ai Doge meme" /></figure>
<p>AiDoge launched its presale phase at the end of April – which many social media users believe could be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> of the year. Through this presale, early investors could purchase $AI tokens at a low price relative to the future exchange listing price.</p>
<p>The <strong>presale sold out its $14.9 million hard cap in just four weeks</strong> amid huge excitement in the crypto community.</p>
<p>$AI tokens will soon be listed on exchanges for their IEO, however, a limited amount of tokens remain available to purchase ahead of the IEO for $0.0000336.</p>

<h2><strong>AiDoge Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Most investors are interested in finding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next cryptocurrency to explode</a> – and AiDoge is in a prime position to do just that. The project’s exciting blend of AI elements and memes helps create an ecosystem that has yet to be seen in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As hinted at earlier, memes have become a powerful tool for social and political commentary. Using memes, people can express their opinions on current events in a humorous and engaging way. Moreover, memes are perfectly designed to spread through social media platforms and &#8216;trend&#8217; – which can ultimately result in positive change.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271308/2023.jpg" alt="Ai Doge meme generator" /></figure>
<p>This is where AiDoge comes in, as the project&#8217;s meme generator is ideal for streamlining this process. Using AiDoge, individuals (and businesses) can create memes to promote social change or criticize powerful figures in a light-hearted manner. AiDoge can even help marginalized groups have a voice in society by creating fashionable memes.</p>
<p>Due to the above points, demand for AiDoge tokens could surge once listed on major exchanges in Q3 2023. As such, our AiDoge price prediction estimates the token could be valued at <strong>$0.00004</strong> by the end of the year.</p>
<h2><strong>$AI Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Another key factor influencing our AiDoge price forecast is the project&#8217;s clear link to artificial intelligence. As has been seen with tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard, AI is becoming increasingly popular and reshaping how countless tasks are completed. </p>
<p>According to an industry report compiled by <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-market">Grand View Research</a>, the global artificial intelligence market was valued at around $136 billion in 2022. However, the market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% between 2023 and 2030. This means that the AI market will essentially 13x over the next decade or so.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271309/2025.jpg" alt="Ai Doge crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The growth of AI is set to impact countless industries in positive ways – although it will also put many jobs at risk. Bringing the focus back to AiDoge, AI-powered technology is fundamental to the project&#8217;s prospects. As more crypto investors realize AI&#8217;s power (and potential), it&#8217;ll naturally create more demand for $AI tokens, leading to long-term price growth. </p>
<p>As such, our AiDoge crypto price prediction for 2025 sees the token reach <strong>$0.00011</strong> – representing a 323% increase from the Stage 1 presale price.<strong> </strong></p>

<h2><strong>AiDoge Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking even further ahead, AiDoge’s team aims to make it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-crypto-coins.htm">best AI crypto coins</a> by creating various use cases that ensure $AI tokens remain in demand over the long term. The most important use case in this regard is the built-in earning mechanism around meme generation.</p>
<p>AiDoge&#8217;s &#8216;public wall&#8217; will feature an array of user-created memes that are AI-generated. Users can filter the memes showcased on this wall by upload date, topic, popularity, and other criteria.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271310/2030.jpg" alt="Ai Doge meme generation platform" /></p>
<p>This public wall will also feature a voting mechanism whereby community members can upvote their favorite memes. The more upvotes a meme receives, the higher it will rank on the public wall. Users who create the &#8220;best&#8221; memes each month, as decided by the community, will receive $AI token rewards.</p>
<p>This setup incentivizes community members to use their creativity and design memes that appeal to the masses. Ultimately, this will lead to long-term demand for $AI tokens – which is why our AiDoge price forecast estimates the token could be valued at <strong>$0.00037</strong> by the end of 2030.</p>
<h2><strong>Possible Highs &amp; Lows of AiDoge</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those wondering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-tokens.htm">how to buy tokens</a> may wish to consider checking out the AiDoge presale due to the project’s innate potential. With that in mind, here’s a table showcasing the possible highs and lows for AiDoge in the coming years: </p>

<h2><strong>What is the AiDoge Crypto?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we’ve covered our AiDoge crypto price forecast, let’s dive in and take a closer look at how the project will be set up. As noted earlier, AiDoge’s platform will provide a seamless way for individuals to create memes in seconds using text-based prompts – much like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already covered the importance of memes in society and how AiDoge rewards users who create the most popular memes. However, one crucial aspect of the ecosystem that will underpin all of AiDoge&#8217;s use cases is the project&#8217;s planned staking feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is crypto staking?</strong></p>
<p>Crypto staking is the process of &#8216;locking up&#8217; a certain number of tokens to support the functionality of a blockchain or crypto project. In return for doing this, stakers will receive rewards in the form of additional tokens. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As investors in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">best staking coins</a> will know, these crypto assets can produce a predictable income stream that rivals (or exceeds) what can be obtained through a traditional savings account. Not only that, but staking coins allow token holders to participate in securing the project they&#8217;re part of. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271311/what-is.jpg" alt="Ai Doge web3 project" /></figure>
<p>Thus, AiDoge&#8217;s staking setup is expected to be a massive hit with the community – especially since staking rewards will be paid out daily. The exact yield is yet to be announced, although AiDoge&#8217;s team has confirmed that staking rewards will be proportional to the number of $AI tokens that a user stakes.</p>
<p>Aside from financial gain, AiDoge&#8217;s staking process will provide several additional benefits. These include early access to new meme templates, special meme contests, or platform enhancements. There are even plans to grant voting rights to $AI stakers in the future to give them a say in the project&#8217;s development. </p>
<p>As such, AiDoge will offer an alternative to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-staking-platforms.htm">best crypto staking platforms</a>, all while allowing users to create memes and join a thriving community. The exciting news for investors is this is just the tip of the iceberg – since AiDoge’s team plans to continue iterating over the long term and adding new use cases.</p>
<h2><strong>What Factors Affect the Value of AiDoge?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As with all of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a>, countless factors could affect AiDoge&#8217;s value in the years ahead. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of these factors: </p>
<h3><strong>Scheduled CEX/DEX Listings</strong></h3>
<p>Naturally, one of the most significant events that will likely impact the $AI price is the team&#8217;s plan to launch on major exchanges in Q3 2023. As most investors will know, exchange listings can be a source of enormous demand since these exchanges make tokens much more accessible to everyday traders.</p>
<p>Thus, once $AI is listed on CEXs and DEXs, we should see demand (and price) begin to rise. This has been the case with many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">best crypto ICOs</a>, including Lucky Block and Tamadoge, so investors will hope a similar situation pans out with AiDoge.</p>
<p>An announcement on the IEO is pending.</p>
<h3><strong>Creation of New Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Another factor influencing the AiDoge price is the team&#8217;s commitment to creating new and exciting use cases. Although AiDoge&#8217;s meme generator is undoubtedly compelling, the development team must continue iterating to stay ahead of rivals within the crypto space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271312/factors-affecting-price.jpg" alt="Lightbulb" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, the growth of AI shows no signs of slowing down, so there&#8217;s every chance new technologies could emerge that nobody has even considered yet. This is one of the main reasons why many believe AiDoge is so exciting – since there&#8217;s no telling exactly which direction the project might go.</p>
<h3><strong>Appealing Tokenomics</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are tokenomics? </strong></p>
<p>Crypto tokenomics are the principles that govern the creation and distribution of coins/tokens. Tokenomics covers elements like supply, governance structures, burning mechanisms, and vesting periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AiDoge&#8217;s appealing tokenomics could be another element that affects the $AI price. As noted earlier, there will be a fixed supply of one trillion $AI tokens, with 50% set aside for presale investors.</p>
<p>However, the important part is that 25% of the total supply will be reserved for company vesting. This vesting setup will extend to ten years, meaning team members must stick with the project over the long term to receive their $AI tokens. Thus, team members are financially incentivized to stay with the project – meaning they have a vested interest in making AiDoge the best it can be.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Is AiDoge the Best Crypto to Buy in 2023?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Putting everything together – can AiDoge be considered the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> this year? Ultimately, there&#8217;s no way of saying with certainty that AiDoge will perform as many expect it to. Still, we can look at specific elements to indicate whether the project will be a success or not.</p>
<p>Firstly, as mentioned earlier, similar presale projects like Tamadoge have produced enormous returns for presale investors. Like Tamadoge, AiDoge has incorporated &#8220;meme coin&#8221; designs to appeal to retail investors. However, since AiDoge has also focused on artificial intelligence, this aspect is magnified.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271313/is-it-the-best-crypto.jpg" alt="Ai Doge crypto project" /></p>
<p>Secondly, the cryptocurrency market has begun to bounce back in 2023, with many tokens (e.g., Bitcoin) up over 70%. The bullish sentiment around cryptos is likely linked to the Fed&#8217;s war on inflation, which is bearing fruit. As such, the Fed will probably pause or decrease rate hikes – which is positive news for cryptos. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that AiDoge is a presale token, so it&#8217;s currently offering investors the opportunity to buy AiDoge tokens at a discounted rate. Nonetheless, crypto presales are not risk-free and therefore require extensive research prior to investing real capital. </p>
<p>Some crypto presales in the past have generated huge returns for investors so sometimes investing in a crypto presale can be worth considering when building a balanced portfolio of crypto assets. </p>
<p>Ultimately, things are looking up for AiDoge right now, which is why more and more investment community members are discussing the project. Although there&#8217;s no telling exactly where the $AI price will go in the coming months, it&#8217;s undoubtedly an exciting time for all involved.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Buy AiDoge – Quick-Step Guide</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As we’ve seen throughout this AiDoge price prediction, the project undoubtedly has immense potential. However, as noted, it’s still in its presale phase – meaning early investors must purchase $AI tokens directly through the AiDoge website. </p>
<p>With that in mind, here are the five simple steps that investors must take if they wish to get involved in the AiDoge presale:</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 – Create a Crypto Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>To invest in the AiDoge presale, investors must create a crypto wallet that supports the ERC-20 token standard. All of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm">best crypto wallets</a> offer this functionality, so investors can choose one that appeals to them. However, we recommend MetaMask or Trust Wallet since both are free and easy to set up.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271314/wallet.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2 – Buy Some Crypto</strong></h3>
<p>The next step is to buy some crypto to fund the $AI purchase. The AiDoge presale supports purchases made in ETH, BNB, or USDT – all three of these digital currencies can be acquired from most major exchanges and brokers. Once purchased, investors must transfer the crypto into the wallet created in Step 1. </p>
<p>Alternatively, investors can buy AiDoge tokens using a credit/debit card. This removes the need to use a third-party exchange to purchase crypto in advance.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 – Link Wallet to AiDoge Presale Dashboard</strong></h3>
<p>Investors must then head to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/">AiDoge’s website</a> and click &#8220;Buy Now.&#8221; Afterward, investors can choose the relevant wallet provider and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the link.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271316/link.jpg" alt="Connect MetaMask wallet" /> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Step 4 – Purchase $AI Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>In the order box that appears, investors can now choose their preferred currency and input their desired investment amount. It&#8217;s essential to reserve a little extra crypto to cover the network fees associated with the purchase. Once everything has been double-checked, all that’s left to do is confirm the transaction.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112243/271317/buy-ai.jpg" alt="AI token presale" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 5 – Claim Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>Once the presale ends, a Token Generation Event (TGE) will occur. Following this, investors can claim their purchased $AI tokens through the project’s website.</p>
<h2>Best Place To Buy Cryptos</h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<p><em>Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>

Much of the long-term demand for ECOTERRA tokens will likely stem from people worldwide looking to make a tangible impact in the fight against climate change &ndash; a fight that humanity currently appears to be losing.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>, the global average sea level has risen by four inches since 1993. Sea level increases are primarily driven by the melting of land-based glaciers and ice sheets caused by higher earth temperatures.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109057/264433/2030.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109057/264433/responsive-images/2030___media_library_original_1569_708.jpg 1569w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264433/responsive-images/2030___media_library_original_1200_541.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264433/responsive-images/2030___media_library_original_900_406.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264433/responsive-images/2030___media_library_original_720_325.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264433/responsive-images/2030___media_library_original_600_271.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264433/responsive-images/2030___media_library_original_300_135.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1569" class="content-img"></figure><p>Rising sea levels can cause disastrous issues like flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Projects like ecoterra aim to combat this issue (and other issues) by making it easier for individuals and businesses to recycle, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</p><p>The importance of recycling will undoubtedly continue to grow in the next 5-7 years, leading to ecoterra becoming increasingly popular globally &ndash; especially given that the platform is hosted on the blockchain. As such, our ecoterra price prediction estimates the token could be valued at <strong>$0.60</strong> by the end of 2030.</p><h2><strong>Possible Highs and Lows of ecoterra</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As can be seen from the points raised above, ecoterra is poised to become the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">best crypto to buy Reddit</a> for environmentally-conscious investors.

As previously mentioned, ecoterra&rsquo;s blockchain-based platform offers several use cases that encourage individuals and businesses to make more positive environmental choices.</p><p>The Recycle2Earn app is at the heart of this. Since this app relies on RVMs, ecoterra&rsquo;s users will actually receive two rewards every time they recycle glass, plastic, cardboard, or other materials. This is because RVMs already provide FIAT-based rewards, which dovetail effectively with the additional ECOTERRA rewards.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109057/264434/what-is.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109057/264434/responsive-images/what-is___media_library_original_1246_1098.jpg 1246w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264434/responsive-images/what-is___media_library_original_1200_1057.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264434/responsive-images/what-is___media_library_original_900_793.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264434/responsive-images/what-is___media_library_original_720_634.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264434/responsive-images/what-is___media_library_original_600_529.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264434/responsive-images/what-is___media_library_original_300_264.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1246" class="content-img"></figure><p>This setup could mean ECOTERRA is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next cryptocurrency to explode</a> &ndash; but the good news doesn&rsquo;t stop there. As noted in the project&rsquo;s whitepaper, ecoterra&rsquo;s development team intends to launch a staking protocol in the future that allows ECOTERRA holders to generate a passive income stream through their token holdings.&nbsp;</p><p>ecoterra&#8217;s development team is also heavily experienced and has the skill to ensure the project reaches its full potential. Several team members helped manage one of the most profitable recycling companies in the South East European region, meaning they understand the pain points and opportunities within the sector.</p><p>Due to the team&#8217;s experience, they&#8217;ve already managed to secure a partnership with Delhaize, one of the biggest supermarket chains operating in Europe, North America, and Asia. This partnership will see Delhaize introduce RVMs into their stores, making the Recycle2Earn mechanism more accessible to millions.</p><h2><strong>What Factors Affect the Value of ecoterra?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As with all <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-launches.htm">new crypto launches</a>, ecoterra&#8217;s value will be affected by various factors. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the most important factors below:</p><h3><strong>Planned Exchange Listings</strong></h3><p>One of the most significant events that will affect the ECOTERRA price is the development team&#8217;s plans to list the token on major exchanges in Q3 2023. This will mark the first time ECOTERRA can be publicly traded since the token is currently only available through the presale.</p><p>Crypto token listings are usually huge events in the market since new tokens tend to have exceptional hype behind them. Once they&#8217;re listed on exchanges, retail investors often pile in and buy the token &ndash; leading to significant price increases. ecoterra&#8217;s team (and investors) will hope a similar situation plays out when ECOTERRA is made available to the masses.</p><h3><strong>ecoterra&rsquo;s Circular Economy</strong></h3><p>ecoterra&rsquo;s team also aims to ensure it&rsquo;s one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/greenest-cryptocurrency.htm">greenest cryptocurrencies to invest in</a> by designing the project to encourage a circular economy. For those unaware, a circular economy is a system that aims to eliminate waste through the constant recycling and reusing of materials.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109057/264435/circular-economy.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109057/264435/responsive-images/circular-economy___media_library_original_1389_861.jpg 1389w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264435/responsive-images/circular-economy___media_library_original_1200_744.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264435/responsive-images/circular-economy___media_library_original_900_558.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264435/responsive-images/circular-economy___media_library_original_720_446.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264435/responsive-images/circular-economy___media_library_original_600_372.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264435/responsive-images/circular-economy___media_library_original_300_186.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1389" class="content-img"></figure><p>In the context of ecoterra, this would work by the platform&#8217;s users recycling their used materials, which businesses can then purchase through the recycled materials marketplace. Once the company has finished using them, these materials could be recycled again &ndash; and purchased by another business. Through this setup, ecoterra would drastically minimize the environmental impact of people and companies worldwide.</p><h3><strong>Exciting Partnerships</strong></h3><p>Finally, the ECOTERRA crypto price will also be affected by the project&#8217;s exciting partnerships. We&#8217;ve already mentioned the collaboration with the Delhaize Group, but ecoterra&#8217;s team isn&#8217;t stopping there.&nbsp;</p><p>The development team has also partnered with <a href="https://verra.org/">Verra.org</a>, which has designed the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). This partnership means that the carbon offsets made available through ecoterra&#8217;s marketplace are all fully-verified, ensuring buyers can be confident that they&#8217;re making a tangible impact on the environment.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Is ecoterra the Best Crypto to Buy in 2023?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As highlighted throughout this ecoterra price prediction, the project has incredible potential for growth due to its eco-friendly ambitions. But can it be considered the best crypto to buy in 2023?</p><p>It&#8217;s difficult to say at this early stage, given that ecoterra&#8217;s presale is still ongoing. However, the investment community already seems to have taken a shine to the project, thanks to its unique way of incentivizing recycling.</p><p>As has been seen in the case of BlockFi and FTX, certain so-called &lsquo;safe&rsquo; earnings protocols have turned out to be anything but. Thankfully, ecoterra&rsquo;s Recycle2Earn protocol isn&rsquo;t reliant on lending and borrowing crypto to generate returns for users, meaning it can be considered much more robust than other approaches.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109057/264436/is-it-the-best.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109057/264436/responsive-images/is-it-the-best___media_library_original_2085_699.jpg 2085w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264436/responsive-images/is-it-the-best___media_library_original_1200_402.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264436/responsive-images/is-it-the-best___media_library_original_900_302.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264436/responsive-images/is-it-the-best___media_library_original_720_241.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264436/responsive-images/is-it-the-best___media_library_original_600_201.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109057/264436/responsive-images/is-it-the-best___media_library_original_300_101.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="2085" class="content-img"></figure><p>Since ecoterra utilizes the Ethereum blockchain, which recently transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol, it can be considered one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-sustainable-cryptocurrency.htm">most sustainable cryptocurrencies</a>. As noted on Ethereum&#8217;s website, the network now uses 99.99% less energy than before &#8216;the Merge&#8217;, meaning ecoterra&#8217;s users can be sure they&#8217;re remaining eco-friendly when using the platform.</p><p>Combine all of these elements, and it&#8217;s clear why many believe ecoterra has exponential long-term prospects. Assuming ecoterra&#8217;s presale continues trending the way it is and the development team achieves its strategic goals, there&#8217;s scope for this to be one of the most exciting crypto launches of 2023.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit ecoterra Now</a></div></div><h2><strong>How to Buy ecoterra Tokens</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Before concluding this ecoterra price prediction, it&#8217;s important to highlight how the presale investment process works. Presented below are the five steps that investors must take to buy ECOTERRA tokens today, which can be completed in less than ten minutes.</p><h3><strong>Step 1 &ndash; Set Up a Crypto Wallet</strong></h3><p>Since ECOTERRA is an ERC-20 token, investors must set up a crypto wallet that supports this token protocol. Several wallet providers offer this functionality, although the development team recommends MetaMask (desktop users) or Trust Wallet (mobile users).</p><p>Regardless of which one is chosen, head to the provider&rsquo;s website and download the wallet.

<p>The crypto market has bounced back exceptionally in 2023, setting the stage for many new and exciting projects to launch. One project that has already caught investors&#8217; attention is Love Hate Inu – a brand-new vote-to-earn meme coin with valuable use cases that enable holders to generate recurring income over the long term. </p>
<p>With that in mind, this guide discusses <strong>how to buy Love Hate Inu tokens</strong> today at a massive discount through the presale. We&#8217;ll also present an in-depth overview of the project and touch on why investors are clamoring to buy LHINU while they can.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Love Hate Inu?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lovehateinu/">Love Hate Inu</a> is a brand-new meme coin project that allows users to vote on polls and earn rewards. Through its disruptive &#8216;Vote-to-Earn&#8217; (V2E) mechanic, users can generate recurring revenue – simply by giving their opinion on hot-button topics. </p>
<p>These topics could be anything, ranging from &#8216;What do you think about TateInu?&#8217; to &#8216;Do you agree with ElonInu&#8217;s vision?&#8217;</p>
<p><iframe title="Love Hate Inu Meme Coin Raises $2,000,000 - Best Crypto to Buy Now?

<p>The Love Hate Inu platform is built on the Ethereum network, meaning all poll entries are recorded on the blockchain. </p>
<p>This is one of Love Hate Inu’s key selling points, as it improves transparency and security, leading to more reliable poll results.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107337/261235/what-is-1.jpg" alt="Love Hate Inu voting" /></figure>
<p>As noted in the <a href="https://www.lovehateinu.com/assets/document/whitepaper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Love Hate Inu whitepaper</a>, the online software survey market is expected to value at $5.69bn by 2027. This provides a massive opportunity for Love Hate Inu to solidify itself as a key player in this market, all in a user-friendly and rewarding way. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> has countless applications for both users and businesses. For example, companies could conduct polls on Love Hate Inu to gauge the community&#8217;s sentiment toward a new product launch.</p>
<p>In the future, Love Hate Inu’s team aims to develop brand deals with leading companies to incentivize users to vote even more!</p>

<p>We’ll dive into the intricacies of the Love Hate Inu project later in this guide, but for now, it’s important to note that the project is still in the presale phase.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">Crypto presales</a> are an excellent way for projects to raise capital and build momentum before an eventual token launch on centralized exchanges (CEXs) – and this is precisely what Love Hate Inu’s team intends to do.</p>
<p>The Love Hate Inu presale launched on March 7, 2023, and has already <strong>generated more than $3.5 million in funding at the time of writing</strong> &#8211; this highlights the hype surrounding the project, which is being helped by the hugely-discounted price offered through the presale.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Buy Love Hate Inu – Full Tutorial</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As mentioned above, Love Hate Inu is currently in its fifth presale phase and, at the time of writing, one LHINU costs just $0.000115. Interestingly, this is 26% lower than the developers&#8217; intended listing price of $0.000145, meaning early investors can get involved at a steep discount.</p>
<p>However, this price is only available during Stage 5 – the price will increase incrementally between stages, with each stage lasting 7.5 days. This provides a clear incentive for investors to buy Love Hate Inu tokens as early as possible to obtain the lowest entry point.</p>
<p>With that in mind, detailed below are the five quick steps investors need to take to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lovehateinu/" rel="nofollow">buy LHINU</a> today:</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 – Set Up a Crypto Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>The first thing investors need to do is set up a crypto wallet. Crypto wallets are designed to store cryptocurrency safely, so a wallet is required to hold LHINU post-purchase. </p>
<p>Numerous wallet providers are out there, but Love Hate Inu’s team recommends either MetaMask (desktop users) or Trust Wallet (mobile users) since these both support ERC-20 tokens.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107337/261237/metamask.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet" /></figure>
<p>For example, those who wish to use MetaMask can head to the <a href="https://metamask.io/">official website</a> and click ‘Download’. Choose which operating system will be used, then follow the instructions to create a password and set up the wallet.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 – Obtain ETH or USDT</strong></h3>
<p>Love Hate Inu’s presale platform supports purchases made in either Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT). Both of these cryptos are readily obtainable from leading exchanges. Once some tokens have been purchased, transfer them to the crypto wallet created in Step 1. </p>
<p>Alternatively, Love Hate Inu’s team has a handy widget built into the presale platform that allows users to buy LHINU tokens using their credit/debit card. However, this does come with additional fees since the widget is powered by the Wert digital payment solution.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 – Link Wallet to Presale Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lovehateinu/">Love Hate Inu’s website</a> and click &#8216;Buy Now&#8217;. In the pop-up box, choose the relevant wallet provider and follow the on-screen instructions to link the crypto wallet to the presale platform.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107337/261238/order-box.jpg" alt="Crypto wallet choice" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 4 – Buy LHINU Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>An order box will then appear on-screen, allowing investors to decide which digital currency they’d like to use (ETH or USDT) and how many LHINU tokens they’d like to buy. </p>
<p>The minimum purchase amount is 10 LHINU.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 5 – Claim LHINU Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>Once the Love Hate Inu presale has concluded, investors can claim their purchased LHINU tokens from the official website. There is no vesting period, so all tokens will become immediately available.</p>

<h2><strong>A Closer Look at Love Hate Inu</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed how to buy Love Hate Inu tokens, let’s take a more in-depth look at what the project is all about. As one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a>, Love Hate Inu has already attracted significant attention from the masses, despite only launching in March.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, Love Hate Inu leverages the prior success of &#8216;meme coins&#8217; like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. However, as many investors know, these coins have suffered due to a lack of real-world utility. This is a problem that Love Hate Inu’s team aims to solve.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107337/261239/closer-look.jpg" alt="Love Hate Inu voting" /></figure>
<p>Love Hate Inu’s utility revolves around its unique voting mechanism housed on an Ethereum-based platform. Using this platform, users can display whether they &#8216;Love&#8217; or &#8216;Hate&#8217; a specific event or person. By taking this approach, Love Hate Inu aims to create a safe and non-judgmental environment that promotes healthy discussion.</p>
<p>Since the voting process is hosted on the blockchain, all responses will be anonymous and immutable. This is an important characteristic, as it helps ensure that poll results are accurate and cannot be influenced by bad actors. In turn, Love Hate Inu is in a prime position to partner with high-profile brands to run sponsored polls – with additional reward opportunities for voters. </p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://www.lovehateinu.com/en#roadmap">Love Hate Inu roadmap</a>, the development team has exciting plans to boost functionality in the future. These plans include partnership agreements, exchange listings, user-created polls, sponsored rewards, and even metaverse integration!<strong> </strong></p>

<h3><strong>LHINU Tokens – The Fuel of the Love Hate Inu Platform</strong></h3>
<p>At the heart of the Love Hate Inu ecosystem is LHINU – the project’s native ERC-20 token. Many believe LHINU could be one of the best <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-crypto-bull-run-coins.htm">crypto bull run coins</a> given that it is fundamental to Love Hate Inu’s ‘Vote-to-Earn’ (V2E) mechanism.</p>
<p>This mechanism is one of the project&#8217;s key selling points since it enables users to earn free LHINU tokens simply for participating in polls. The way this works is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users purchase LHINU tokens</li>
<li>Users stake their LHINU tokens on the platform for at least 30 days</li>
<li>Once the 30 days are up, users can then vote on Love Hate Inu’s polls</li>
<li>Users will then earn additional LHINU tokens as a reward for voting </li>
</ul>
<p>The number of tokens users can earn is influenced by several factors, such as how many polls they participate in, which type of polls they get involved in, and the duration they have staked their LHINU tokens. Alongside LHINU, the development team also intends to offer additional rewards for brand-sponsored polls, such as NFTs, NFT discounts, or merchandise.</p>

<p>The total supply of LHINU tokens will be 100 billion. Of these tokens, 90% (90 billion) will be allocated to the presale phase, while 10% (10 billion) will be used for liquidity, exchange listings, and community rewards. Importantly, there is no vesting period with LHINU, meaning tokens are unlocked right away, and no restrictions are placed on selling. </p>
<p>This is a crucial reason why LHINU could be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next cryptocurrency to explode</a> since the development team already plans to list the token on CEXs and DEXs. As such, if the token price increases upon listing, investors will be free to do as they please with their LHINU holdings.</p>

<h2><strong>Is Love Hate Inu a Good Investment? Key Takeaways</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Love Hate Inu is already attracting significant attention from all corners of the crypto market – but why is this? Let’s take a look at some of the key reasons why Love Hate Inu could be a good investment below: </p>
<h3><strong>Potential for Recurring Income</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, Love Hate Inu’s main attraction is the Vote-to-Earn (V2E) mechanic. This mechanic provides limitless possibilities for income generation since there are no restrictions on how many polls a user can participate in. Moreover, the longer a user stakes, the greater their income potential. </p>
<p>Love Hate Inu’s approach provides an exciting alternative to other income generation services, such as yield farming. These services have come under fire recently following the collapse of Celsius and FTX – yet this isn’t a concern with Love Hate Inu.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Scope for Explosive Price Growth</strong></h3>
<p>Adding to the previous point, users can also benefit from potentially explosive price growth. Once LHINU is listed on exchanges, it will be easily accessible to all crypto investors. As such, the attention LHINU receives could be huge – leading more people to invest. </p>
<p>Naturally, the more people buying LHINU, the higher the price will go, following the laws of supply and demand. The benefits here are enormous since Love Hate Inu users who earn tokens through the voting process will also see the value of these tokens rise further over time!</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107337/261241/price-growth.jpg" alt="Love Hate Inu roadmap" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Unique Way to Gauge Sentiment Towards Trending Topics</strong></h3>
<p>Many believe Love Hate Inu could be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> to buy due to the unique way it gauges the community&#8217;s sentiment toward specific topics. Since users are required to stake their LHINU holdings before voting, this removes the chance that bots and scam accounts could influence results.</p>
<p>In turn, this makes results more accurate and verifiable. What’s more, there will always be polls to vote on, created by the development team or Love Hate Inu’s users themselves. As such, users will always have opportunities to earn through the V2E mechanic.</p>
<h3><strong>Incentivizes Debate and Health Discussion</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, Love Hate Inu’s approach provides a solid foundation for debate and discussion. Platforms like Twitter and Reddit have come under fire for many reasons, mainly concerning the over-promotion of certain political biases.</p>
<p>This isn’t a worry with Love Hate Inu, as everyone is considered an equal on the platform. As such, users can participate in polls and join discussions related to the focus of these polls – making healthy debate a natural by-product. </p>
<h2><strong>Love Hate Inu Price Action – What to Know</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Love Hate Inu is still in its presale phase, meaning tokens are not publicly listed. These tokens can only be purchased through the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lovehateinu/" rel="nofollow">Love Hate Inu website</a> using ETH, USDT, or a credit/debit card.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Stage 5 of the presale has just started, meaning investors can buy Love Hate Inu tokens for just $0.000115. This is the lowest price that tokens will be available since the development team is using an eight-stage presale setup that sees the price increase at each stage.</p>

<p>This essentially means that the token price will increase when each stage ends. Each stage has 11.25 billion LHINU tokens allocated and lasts 7.5 days. Once these are claimed, the presale will move to Stage 6, which sees the token price rise to $0.0000125 – an 8.7% increase.</p>
<p>Stage 8 will be the final stage, which will see LHINU tokens priced at $0.000145. This is a 26% increase from Stage 5 and highlights why investors are clamoring to get involved as early as possible.</p>
<p>Like many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-launches.htm">new crypto launches</a>, Love Hate Inu’s presale will have a hard cap, which is the maximum amount of money that can be raised. This hard cap is set at just over $10m, providing the capital needed to make Love Hate Inu a success.</p>
<h3><strong>Love Hate Inu Price Forecast</strong></h3>
<p>Since Love Hate Inu is likely one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">best crypto ICOs</a> of the year, many investors are eager to learn about the token&#8217;s price prospects. However, making an accurate <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/love-hate-inu-price-prediction.htm" rel="nofollow">Love Hate Inu price prediction</a> is challenging since the project is still in its presale phase.</p>
<p>However, we can look to similar projects to provide insight into how LHINU&#8217;s price may react once listed on exchanges. Tamadoge is an excellent example, as this project also started through a presale phase. Tamadoge’s presale sold out early, leading the developers to launch TAMA on several crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>The TAMA price rocketed immediately upon launching, providing triple-digit returns to presale investors. This huge price increase was driven by high liquidity levels and easier access for retail investors.</p>
<p>Ultimately, LHINU investors will be hoping a similar situation occurs once the presale has ended and tokens are listed on CEXs/DEXs. Although there&#8217;s no way of telling which price LHINU could hit, early investors will be in a prime position to benefit from potential value increases due to the low purchase price currently offered through the presale.</p>
<h2><strong>The Verdict?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In summary, this guide has discussed everything there is to know about how to buy Love Hate Inu tokens before diving into what the project is all about and why it&#8217;s so highly regarded within the investment community.</p>
<p>Love Hate Inu’s presale is ongoing, meaning early investors can buy LHINU tokens at a considerable discount. Tokens are available for just $0.000115 during Stage 5 – the lowest price they&#8217;ll be made available – and more than $3.5 million has been invested in a month since the presale went live.</p>
<p>Once the Stage 5 allocation has been claimed, the price will increase in Stage 6. Given the tremendous hype already being generated around Love Hate Inu, investors have a clear incentive to get involved as early as possible to maximize potential gains in the future!</p>

Game Consoles</strong></h3><p>If you&rsquo;ve previously opted to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoins.htm">buy Bitcoin</a>, game consoles are another item you can buy online with this digital currency. Games consoles have traditionally only been offered by stores accepting FIAT; for example, GameStop and Walmart. However, this has changed in the past few years since these items can now be bought using crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>The most popular game consoles are the latest iterations from Microsoft and Sony &ndash; namely the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5. If you&#8217;re wondering how to spend Bitcoin, you&#8217;ll be glad to know that these items can be purchased with digital currencies. Moreover, their prices have dropped significantly since they&#8217;ve been out for a few years.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266140/consoles.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266140/responsive-images/consoles___media_library_original_1880_900.jpg 1880w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266140/responsive-images/consoles___media_library_original_1200_574.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266140/responsive-images/consoles___media_library_original_900_431.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266140/responsive-images/consoles___media_library_original_720_345.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266140/responsive-images/consoles___media_library_original_600_287.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266140/responsive-images/consoles___media_library_original_300_144.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1880" class="content-img"></p><p>In terms of where you can spend Bitcoin to buy these consoles, there&rsquo;s now a selection of online stores that offer them &ndash; although Crypto Emporium is likely the easiest to use. At the time of writing, Crypto Emporium stocks a wide range of consoles, including a few &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; versions.</p><p>Interestingly, Crypto Emporium even has the PS5 Digital Edition in stock, which is often sold out in other merchants. As such, those holding crypto can quickly obtain it and benefit from quick shipping timescales using this platform.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/cryptoemporium/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy Game Consoles at Crypto Emporium</a></div> </div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. Crypto Presales</strong></h3><p>If you&rsquo;re wondering what you can buy with Bitcoin, another popular option is crypto presales. For those unaware, crypto presales are a way for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects to raise funds and generate awareness before release.</p><p>The key benefit of investing in these presales is that tokens are usually offered at a discounted price relative to the eventual listing price. Thus, early investors can put themselves in line to generate exceptional returns &ndash; if the project experiences value increases in the future.</p><p>But which crypto presale is the best? Thankfully, hundreds of presales are ongoing at any one time, meaning you&#8217;ll always have options. However, two presale projects currently stand out from the crowd:</p><h4><strong>Love Hate Inu &ndash; New Vote-to-Earn Meme Coin with Huge Potential</strong></h4><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lovehateinu/">Love Hate Inu</a> is a brand-new meme coin that looks to capitalize on the success of coins like DOGE and SHIB. However, it also incorporates a &ldquo;Vote-to-Earn&rdquo; (V2E) mechanism that enables users to earn tokenized rewards simply for participating in the platform&rsquo;s polls.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#8217;s no cap on these rewards &ndash; so the more polls a user enters, the more LHINU tokens they&#8217;ll earn. Love Hate Inu&#8217;s team also intends to launch a staking protocol whereby users must stake their LHINU tokens for at least 30 days before being able to cast votes.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266141/lhinu.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266141/responsive-images/lhinu___media_library_original_1472_748.jpg 1472w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266141/responsive-images/lhinu___media_library_original_1200_610.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266141/responsive-images/lhinu___media_library_original_900_457.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266141/responsive-images/lhinu___media_library_original_720_366.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266141/responsive-images/lhinu___media_library_original_600_305.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266141/responsive-images/lhinu___media_library_original_300_152.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1472" class="content-img"></p><p>Given Love Hate Inu&rsquo;s meme coin style, the hype is already building around this crypto presale. The presale will have eight stages, each with its own price point, meaning those who invest earliest will receive the most appealing entry level.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lovehateinu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit the Love Hate Inu Presale Now</a></div> </div><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>DeeLance &ndash; Disruptive Recruitment Platform Leveraging Web3 Technology</strong></h4><p>Another popular crypto presale to consider is the one being offered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/deelance/">DeeLance</a>. DeeLance is a Web3-powered freelancing platform where freelancers and clients can connect seamlessly. This platform has low fees and leverages blockchain technology to ensure that disputes can be handled instantly.</p><p>DLANCE is the native token used on this platform. Clients can pay freelancers using DLANCE, although the token is also needed to pay for virtual office space in the DeeLance metaverse. It can even be used to purchase NFTs from DeeLance&rsquo;s planned marketplace.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266142/dlance.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266142/responsive-images/dlance___media_library_original_2184_1260.jpg 2184w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266142/responsive-images/dlance___media_library_original_1200_692.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266142/responsive-images/dlance___media_library_original_900_519.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266142/responsive-images/dlance___media_library_original_720_415.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266142/responsive-images/dlance___media_library_original_600_346.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266142/responsive-images/dlance___media_library_original_300_173.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="2184" class="content-img"></p><p>The &#8220;traditional&#8221; freelancing platforms continue to be plagued by various issues, meaning DeeLance has a huge opportunity to capitalize and offer a more effective service. The project&#8217;s presale is ongoing, meaning early investors can buy DLANCE tokens at a significant discount ahead of the planned CEX listings.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/deelance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit the DeeLance Presale Now</a></div> </div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4. Electronics</strong></h3><p>Many continue to wonder, &#8220;What can you buy with Bitcoin?&#8221; &ndash; but this should be changed to &#8220;What <i>can&rsquo;t</i> you buy with Bitcoin?&#8221; since there&#8217;s now an abundance of electronic items available to crypto users.</p><p>Instead of holding your BTC in one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-interest-accounts.htm">best crypto interest accounts</a>, it could be better to use it to purchase some electronic assets. By electronics, we mean items that can be used at home; for example, televisions and home cinema systems.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266143/electronics.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266143/responsive-images/electronics___media_library_original_1834_878.jpg 1834w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266143/responsive-images/electronics___media_library_original_1200_574.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266143/responsive-images/electronics___media_library_original_900_431.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266143/responsive-images/electronics___media_library_original_720_345.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266143/responsive-images/electronics___media_library_original_600_287.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266143/responsive-images/electronics___media_library_original_300_144.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1834" class="content-img"></p><p>Since many of these items are relatively expensive, using crypto can be a better option, as there are no foreign transaction fees or processing fees to worry about. Moreover, payment can be sent instantly, and the transaction is recorded on the blockchain &ndash; ensuring disputes never need to be an issue.</p><p>If you want to buy electronics, we recommend checking out Crypto Emporium. This platform has pretty much every electronic device you&#8217;d need, ranging from projectors to sound bars &ndash; and much more. Crypto Emporium even stocks the latest Samsung Neo QLED TVs, which offer a full 8K experience!</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/cryptoemporium/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy Electronics at Crypto Emporium</a></div> </div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5. Cars</strong></h3><p>Many people are unaware that cars are now one of the most popular purchases made online when it comes to what you can buy with Bitcoin. This may come as a surprise, considering that cars have traditionally been reserved for FIAT-based transactions &ndash; but times are changing!</p><p>BTC holders can now buy a range of new and pre-owned cars online. Notably, there are options for all preferences and budgets, which is crucial to understand since there&#8217;s an incorrect preconception that crypto-based car payments are solely for the super-rich.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266144/cars.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266144/responsive-images/cars___media_library_original_1878_904.jpg 1878w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266144/responsive-images/cars___media_library_original_1200_578.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266144/responsive-images/cars___media_library_original_900_433.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266144/responsive-images/cars___media_library_original_720_347.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266144/responsive-images/cars___media_library_original_600_289.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266144/responsive-images/cars___media_library_original_300_144.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1878" class="content-img"></p><p>Given the scale of the purchase when acquiring a car using Bitcoin, it&#8217;s wise to partner with a well-respected and credible platform.

Property</strong></h3><p>Considering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-a-house-with-bitcoin.htm">buying a house with Bitcoin</a>? Another area that has seen a surge in BTC-based transactions is the real estate market. Both buyers and sellers can benefit from using Bitcoin (and other cryptos) to facilitate property transactions &ndash; meaning this area looks set to explode in the coming years.</p><p>There are many advantages to using BTC for these purchases, such as reduced fees, faster processing, and increased privacy. Another key advantage is that buyers from other countries can make payments more straightforwardly since they don&#8217;t need to deal with foreign banking systems.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266147/property.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266147/responsive-images/property___media_library_original_1354_571.jpg 1354w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266147/responsive-images/property___media_library_original_1200_506.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266147/responsive-images/property___media_library_original_900_380.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266147/responsive-images/property___media_library_original_720_304.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266147/responsive-images/property___media_library_original_600_253.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266147/responsive-images/property___media_library_original_300_127.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1354" class="content-img"></p><p>Whether it&#8217;s a cheap flat or an ultra-expensive villa, there are plenty of options online for those wondering how to spend Bitcoin on real estate.

The buying process is as convenient as possible, making this a great alternative to the &#8220;traditional&#8221; purchasing process.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/cryptoemporium/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy Property at Crypto Emporium</a></div> </div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>9. Artwork</strong></h3><p>If you have a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-only-software-wallets.htm">Bitcoin-only software wallet</a> and want to invest in an appreciating asset, another option is artwork. The act of buying art with Bitcoin is gaining traction globally, which is again down to the benefits offered by crypto-based transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Art owners often look for privacy when buying expensive pieces, and this is undoubtedly something that Bitcoin-based purchases can offer. Again, much like with properties, buyers from foreign countries will often find using Bitcoin easier since they don&#8217;t have to deal with banking systems that are alien to them.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266148/artwork.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266148/responsive-images/artwork___media_library_original_2062_1004.jpg 2062w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266148/responsive-images/artwork___media_library_original_1200_584.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266148/responsive-images/artwork___media_library_original_900_438.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266148/responsive-images/artwork___media_library_original_720_351.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266148/responsive-images/artwork___media_library_original_600_292.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266148/responsive-images/artwork___media_library_original_300_146.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="2062" class="content-img"></p><p>Most of the focus on artwork remains tailored towards inexpensive pieces &ndash; although we&#8217;re sure that expensive items will soon become increasingly common.

Bicycles &amp; e-Bikes</strong></h3><p>With the need for eco-friendly actions growing more drastic by the week, there&rsquo;s a growing demand for &ldquo;green&rdquo; transport options. Bikes and e-bikes are two popular options &ndash; and BTC can now be used to purchase both.</p><p>Crypto holders can invest in an array of bikes from well-known suppliers. Not only that but there&#8217;s also scope to pay for bike repairs and enhancements using crypto at a growing number of merchants.</p><p>Crypto Emporium has a diverse selection of bikes, including road, race, and mountain bikes. There&#8217;s even a Penny Farthing for those seeking a Victorian vibe!</p><h3><strong>12. Collectibles</strong></h3><p>The collectibles market has also embraced cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being the most popular payment method. There are many different types of collectibles &ndash; although trading cards are the ones being integrated into the crypto market the quickest.</p><p>The demographics involved in trading these cards tend to be crypto savvy, so more transactions than ever use BTC, ETH, and other digital currencies. Pok&eacute;mon and Yu-Gi-Oh are the two leading brands receiving attention in this regard.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto Emporium offers cards from both these collections, along with classic sports memorabilia. You can even check out some &#8220;retro&#8221; electronic items, including a super-rare 1<sup>st</sup>-generation iPod!</p><h3><strong>13. Health Supplements</strong></h3><p>The level of privacy offered by Bitcoin means that the health supplement industry is also gradually accepting BTC as a payment method. Health-conscious customers may prefer BTC due to its speed and low transaction fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Health supplements can encompass various items, from protein powders to herbal remedies. Crypto Emporium is a frontrunner here since the platform offers a wide range of supplements &#8211; including nootropics. However, other options exist for those seeking more &#8220;personalized&#8221; products.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>14. Crypto Merchandise</strong></h3><p>Those familiar with the best crypto to buy Reddit will realize that certain digital currencies can &#8220;trend&#8221; on social media. Once a coin is trending, it attracts vast attention and leads to other products being launched that leverage its popularity.</p><p>Many retailers understand this process and offer merchandise with logos and branding from trending coins. For example, many online merchants offer DOGE-branded merchandise or mugs with Elon Musk&#8217;s face on them.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266150/crypto-merch.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266150/responsive-images/crypto-merch___media_library_original_1828_846.jpg 1828w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266150/responsive-images/crypto-merch___media_library_original_1200_555.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266150/responsive-images/crypto-merch___media_library_original_900_417.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266150/responsive-images/crypto-merch___media_library_original_720_333.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266150/responsive-images/crypto-merch___media_library_original_600_278.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266150/responsive-images/crypto-merch___media_library_original_300_139.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1828" class="content-img"></p><p>These merchandise items allow holders to display their passion for crypto and use crypto to fund the purchase! Expect this market area to grow exponentially in the years ahead as more and more crypto coins create strong communities on social media sites.</p><h3><strong>15. Motorcycles</strong></h3><p>Some of the best places to spend crypto allow crypto holders to buy motorcycles. This enables bike enthusiasts to obtain their dream ride while avoiding the hefty fees associated with large purchases.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, if you&rsquo;re one of these people, you&rsquo;ll also be able to dive into the international market. Since you won&rsquo;t have to worry about the volatility of currency conversion rates, you&rsquo;ll have thousands more biking options to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p>As crypto adoption grows, more motorcycle dealers may begin accepting digital currencies to make themselves appealing to customers. We&#8217;re already seeing this trend, with Crypto Emporium now offering bikes from high-profile brands like Yamaha, Ducati, and Kawasaki delivered directly to your door!</p><h3><strong>16. Mobile Phones</strong></h3><p>Smartphones, budget-friendly phones, and other mobile devices can now be purchased online using Bitcoin. This approach will appeal to tech-savvy enthusiasts who already hold crypto and wish to upgrade their current setup.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, we&#8217;re already seeing some mobile service providers begin integrating crypto-style aspects into their service. For example, Conflux has partnered with a Chinese telecom company to offer &#8220;BSIMS,&#8221; which mirror the services provided by traditional crypto wallets.</p><p>The additional fees charged by mobile phone stores are often off-putting, so using Bitcoin is a great alternative. Crypto Emporium offers a range of mobiles, from iPhones to Samsung Galaxy models &ndash; along with a selection of high-end accessories as well.</p><h3><strong>17. Sculptures</strong></h3><p>Regarding what can you buy with Bitcoin, most items are priced mid-range. However, if you have extra cash to burn, you may wonder whether you can buy sculptures online with BTC.</p><p>Thankfully, you can! If you&rsquo;re an art collector or sculpture lover, you can purchase these items using your Bitcoin holdings. This can also be viewed as an investment opportunity since artwork (and sculptures) often appreciate in value.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto Emporium is playing an essential role in driving this area of the art market. You can buy some extremely rare sculptures through the site, such as Jeff Koons&#8217; &#8220;Baloon Dog,&#8221; without going through a dealership.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>18. Music &amp; Video</strong></h3><p>Like the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">best NFTs to buy</a>, digital versions of music and video are becoming increasingly popular amongst the crypto community. This could be a wide range of items, from rare albums to brand-new indie productions.</p><p>An exciting area of the market involves new musicians and actors selling their wares and accepting crypto. This is an excellent way of &#8220;marketing&#8221; themselves since it naturally appeals to a growing demographic of crypto-savvy people.</p><p>Alternatively, these musicians and actors can sell their creations on e-commerce platforms like Crypto Emporium. This is much easier than finding a buyer themselves and provides excellent exposure while streamlining the payment process.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>19. Scooters</strong></h3><p>Eco-conscious crypto investors may also wish to purchase scooters with their digital currencies. Scooters are becoming incredibly popular within urban environments since they&rsquo;re cheaper and more accessible than many transport networks.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266152/scooters.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266152/responsive-images/scooters___media_library_original_1822_852.jpg 1822w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266152/responsive-images/scooters___media_library_original_1200_561.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266152/responsive-images/scooters___media_library_original_900_421.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266152/responsive-images/scooters___media_library_original_720_337.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266152/responsive-images/scooters___media_library_original_600_281.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266152/responsive-images/scooters___media_library_original_300_140.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1822" class="content-img"></p><p>However, only a few physical retailers offer electronic scooters, meaning most purchases are made online. Thankfully, many merchants now accept BTC as a payment method, which is excellent news for thousands of people.</p><p>At Crypto Emporium, not only can you buy scooters, but you can also buy other electric-powered items. These include unicycles, skateboards, and mountain climbers.</p><h3><strong>20. Sporting Goods</strong></h3><p>You can also spend cryptocurrency to buy sporting goods, which is a great alternative to going into physical stores. The term &#8220;sporting goods&#8221; covers a broad range of items, but in this context, we&#8217;re referring to things like surfboards, kayaks, dartboards, and other similar products.</p><p>All of these items can be bought directly from Crypto Emporium. Notably, the items that Crypto Emporium stocks are from industry-leading brands like Carver and Radiin. Excitingly, you can also add extras if you decide to use Crypto Emporium; for example, carbon fiber handles when you purchase a brand-new jet board.</p><h3><strong>21. Health &amp; Beauty Items</strong></h3><p>Health and beauty is another area that&#8217;s seeing rapid crypto adoption. This area includes skincare, cosmetics, supplements, wellness items, and appliances.</p><p>For example, Crypto Emporium offers the rare Cr&egrave;me de la Mer moisturizer, priced at 0.0065 BTC. In addition, you can also purchase a Dyson Supersonic Hairdryer &ndash; one of the most popular hairdryers on the market.</p><h3><strong>22. Arcade Games</strong></h3><p>A more unusual item that falls under what you can buy with crypto is arcade games. By arcade games, we mean &ldquo;retro&rdquo; games that used to be found in arcades throughout the 70s and 80s. These are often considered collectible items and have high sentimental value.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266153/arcade-machines.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266153/responsive-images/arcade-machines___media_library_original_2480_996.jpg 2480w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266153/responsive-images/arcade-machines___media_library_original_1200_482.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266153/responsive-images/arcade-machines___media_library_original_900_361.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266153/responsive-images/arcade-machines___media_library_original_720_289.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266153/responsive-images/arcade-machines___media_library_original_600_241.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266153/responsive-images/arcade-machines___media_library_original_300_120.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="2480" class="content-img"></p><p>The most popular arcade games you can buy with Bitcoin include pinball machines and air hockey. Crypto Emporium offers both game types and some rare pieces, such as the Stern South Park pinball machine, priced at 0.548 BTC.</p><h3><strong>23. Pet Products</strong></h3><p>Another of the best things you can buy with Bitcoin is pet products. This may seem strange, but many people have exotic animals that require items sourced from overseas. Merchants that offer these items often accept BTC so that customers don&rsquo;t have to worry about currency conversion fees.</p><p>Various pet-related items can be purchased online using crypto, from food sources to custom-built cages. Crypto Emporium offers a range of these items, meaning pet owners can find what they require without scouring the internet.</p><h3><strong>24. Classic Cars</strong></h3><p>Several innovative e-commerce platforms have also begun offering classic cars for purchase using Bitcoin. These platforms cater to car enthusiasts looking to acquire vintage vehicles using digital currencies instead of FIAT.&nbsp;</p><p>Since BTC allows borderless transactions, the classic car market could expand globally if more merchants began accepting it for payments.

Crypto Mining Equipment</strong></h3><p>With the crypto market bouncing back in 2023, BTC mining revenues are increasing. However, due to the size of the Bitcoin network, miners now require advanced rigs that can handle the network validation process.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266154/mining-rigs.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109831/266154/responsive-images/mining-rigs___media_library_original_1878_890.jpg 1878w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266154/responsive-images/mining-rigs___media_library_original_1200_569.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266154/responsive-images/mining-rigs___media_library_original_900_427.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266154/responsive-images/mining-rigs___media_library_original_720_341.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266154/responsive-images/mining-rigs___media_library_original_600_284.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109831/266154/responsive-images/mining-rigs___media_library_original_300_142.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1878" class="content-img"></p><p>Naturally, most sellers of these rigs accept BTC as payment due to the anonymity and speed it offers. Crypto Emporium offers a selection of these rigs from top names like Innosilicon and Goldshell. There&#8217;s also an array of mining accessories, ensuring this platform is an &#8220;all-in-one solution&#8221; for miners globally.</p><h3><strong>26. Cameras</strong></h3><p>The rise of platforms like YouTube and TikTok over the past few years has meant hundreds of camera brands offer new and exciting options for content creators.

These cameras have detailed product pages, making it easy to compare and contrast the options available.</p><h3><strong>27. Headphones</strong></h3><p>Bitcoin can also be used to purchase headphones online, which is great if you&rsquo;re seeking a new pair of Dre Beats. These days, many headphones brands charge a high price point for their top-of-the-range models, so using BTC (and other cryptos) can be a great way of ensuring costs remain low.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto Emporium offers a range of headphones that rivals most specialty electronics dealers. This range includes the latest models from Sennheiser and Apple &ndash; two of the most respected names in the space.</p><h3><strong>28.

This growth will naturally raise questions regarding what crypto can be used for and whether it will completely replace FIAT currencies.</p><p>As most <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">crypto exchanges</a> have found out, crypto regulations can change anytime. However, these regulations are more to do with buying and selling digital currencies &ndash; not using these currencies to purchase items online.&nbsp;</p><p>So, whether you&#8217;re looking to buy gift cards with Bitcoin or purchase new clothes with Ethereum, it&#8217;s completely legal to do so &ndash; in most countries (including the US).

This is trickier to answer, as it all depends on the merchant you use. Bitcoin itself is designed to be incredibly safe and anonymous, the latter point being one of the main reasons it&#8217;s such a popular option for buyers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, finding a credible merchant (e.g., Crypto Emporium) is crucial when researching how to spend crypto. If you purchase with a scam buyer, which many unfortunately do, there&#8217;s no way to recover the funds &ndash; meaning they&#8217;ll be lost forever.</p><h2><strong>How to Spend Bitcoin &ndash; Quick-Step Guide</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Before concluding our discussion of what can you buy with Bitcoin, let&rsquo;s take a brief look at the intricacies of the purchasing process &ndash; since they differ significantly from FIAT-based transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are the four simple steps you must be aware of when researching how to spend Bitcoin. We&#8217;ll use <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/cryptoemporium/">Crypto Emporium</a> as an example due to its level of safety and credibility within the space:&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1 &ndash; Create a Crypto Wallet</strong></h3><p>To start with Crypto Emporium, you&#8217;ll need a crypto wallet to store your digital currencies. There are various wallet providers, so feel free to choose one that suits your preferences. Setting up the wallet is simply a case of heading to the provider&#8217;s website and following the instructions to create a password.</p><h3><strong>Step 2 &ndash; Acquire Bitcoin</strong></h3><p>You&rsquo;ll then need to buy Bitcoin (or another supported crypto) to fund your purchases on Crypto Emporium. This can be easily achieved using the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm">best crypto apps</a>, brokers, or decentralized exchanges (DEXs).&nbsp;</p><p>However, we recommend using <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/">eToro</a> if you&#8217;re looking for the most seamless (and cost-effective) process. The eToro Exchange allows you to instantly swap FIAT to a wide range of different cryptos with low fees, and is one of the few crypto exchanges that&#8217;s licensed by tier 1 regulatory bodies like the FCA and ASIC, so it&#8217;s the safest place to buy Bitcoin.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy Crypto Using AQRU</a></div> </div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 3 &ndash; Register a Crypto Emporium Account</strong></h3><p>Head over to the Crypto Emporium website and click &#8220;Register .&#8221;Fill in the required details, including providing an email address and a strong password.
