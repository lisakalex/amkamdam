To be fair, there are quite a few ways to get free BTC, but honestly, they are unlikely to make you prosperous.</p><p>Most common activities to get free bitcoin include:</p><ul><li>Bitcoin faucets</li><li>Bitcoin reward programs</li><li>Completing microtasks</li><li>Affiliate programs</li><li>Working for bitcoin</li></ul><p>If you ever stumble upon a message that says, &ldquo;Send me a certain amount of bitcoin or ether, and I will send you ten times that!&rdquo; that&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/twitter-scams-are-getting-out-of-hand-1896.htm">just a fraud</a>. Do not believe it, and if you can, report the post to the social media platform it was published on. How to get free bitcoins is a common question, but it is widely misunderstood &mdash; in most cases, no one will just hand you their money over.</p><p>However, you can earn free bitcoin, although working for it may not make it free. The first source of &ldquo;free bitcoin&rdquo; you&rsquo;re likely to encounter is some sort of bitcoin faucet.</p><h2>Bitcoin faucets</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/d1c2444fcd.png" alt="How To Get Free BTC Bitcoin" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/d1c2444fcd.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c6/d1c2444fcd.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c6/d1c2444fcd.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c6/d1c2444fcd.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c6/d1c2444fcd.png 1000w" sizes="100vw"></figure><p>BTC faucets are websites that dispense small amounts of bitcoin every few minutes. It&rsquo;s a PTC business (pay-to-click) that works the following way: a faucet attracts visitors to the website to generate views for ads, and in turn rewards users with a fraction of ad revenue. Naturally, you have to disable your ad-blockers and be ready to engage with an enormous amount of ads.</p><p>Faucets are the easiest, but also the cheapest way to earn BTC. You will get anything from few cents up to a dollar per hour. In most cases, getting enough bitcoin to be able to withdraw them will require a lot of your time, too, so you need to do your math whether it&rsquo;s worth the effort.</p><p>Most free bitcoin faucets come and go, so finding a reputable one is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Yet, there are few which are more popular than others:</p><ul><li>Cointiply</li><li>Moon Bitcoin</li><li>BonusBitcoin</li><li>FreeBitco.in</li><li>Bitgames.io</li></ul><p>You need a bitcoin wallet to use a faucet. See our guide on how to store cryptocurrency safely to learn how to get one. A complete and up to date list of bitcoin faucets can be found at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/deep-dive/get-free-bitcoins-faucets-that-pay/">the Mac Observer</a>.</p><h2>Bitcoin rewards</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5e3/80955866a8.jpg" alt="Get free Bitcoin Fold app" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5e3/80955866a8.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5e3/80955866a8.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5e3/80955866a8.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5e3/80955866a8.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5e3/80955866a8.jpg 1807w" sizes="100vw" width="1254" class="content-img"></figure><p>Bitcoin reward (cashback) apps are the best-kept secret to earning free bitcoin. Whenever you buy something online, you may use one of the following apps to get back a percentage of your purchase in BTC:</p><p>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://use.foldapp.com/r/qEwdXvtq">Fold app</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vhttps://www.lolli.com/">Lolli</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bitcoinrewards.com/">BitcoinRewards.com</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.coinrebates.com/">Coin Rebates</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://getpei.com/">Pei</a></p><p>Bitcoin cashback rewards are not only a great way to stack sats but also save money on your purchases. Be sure to check them out!</p><h2>Completing microtasks</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Completing microtasks, games, or other tasks to get free bitcoin are simply more advanced forms of faucets. For example, you can solve <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-puzzles-a-new-rewarding-pastime-1461.htm">puzzles</a> &mdash; there are several of those that if you solve, you get a certain amount of bitcoin. In this way, you&rsquo;re not only watching ads for bitcoin but also are competing for it. If you don&rsquo;t mind it, enjoy small games, and have plenty of time to kill, you just might fill your wallet with a few extra satoshis.</p><p>One of the best way to get free bitcoin is by playing games via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thndr.games/">THNDR Games</a>, where you can play bitcoin games and earn bitcoin rewards on your mobile phone (both Android and iOS devices). Free games include:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thndr.games/bitcoin-games">Bitcoin bounce</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thndr.games/bitcoin-games">Turbo 84</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thndr.games/bitcoin-games/bitcoin-snake">Bitcoin Snake</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thndr.games/bitcoin-games/bitcoin-bay">Bitcoin Bay</a></li></ul><h2>Working for bitcoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>We already established a notion that there&rsquo;s no such thing as free bitcoin. In most cases, you have to trade your time and effort for it, and there is no easy way around it. So instead of chasing minuscule earnings, you might also try to get paid in bitcoin for your talents.</p><p>It is especially viable if you&rsquo;re a freelancer, but you might also ask your regular employee to pay you in BTC. Alternatively, you can try one of these methods:</p><ul><li>Ask for bitcoin donations on your website or blog.</li><li>Offer your services to companies do business in the crypto space.</li><li>Look for a job ad at sites like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://crypto.jobs/">Crypto.jobs</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptojobslist.com/">Crypto Jobs List</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cryptogrind.com/">Cryptogrind</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/">Jobs4Bitcoins</a>, and similar.</li><li>Ask for tips under your online posts or other contributions. For example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tippin.me/">Tippin.me</a> extension is a great way to receive bitcoin micropayments on Twitter.</li></ul><h2>Getting free bitcoin via affiliate programs</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>An often overlooked way to get a fair share of free BTC is to participate in affiliate programs. Like work, it will consume your time and energy, but if you&rsquo;re committed, you&rsquo;re likely to earn a full salary or even more.</p><p>Many <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/">bitcoin exchanges</a>, wallets, and other products and services offer affiliate programs for everyone who can bring them paying customers. How you promote your affiliate links is a matter of your imagination &mdash; you can share them on Facebook, run ad campaigns, set up a niche website or enticing video blog. The only limit is your creativity and imagination.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/d317c167ce.jpg" alt="Get Free BTC" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/d317c167ce.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c6/d317c167ce.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c6/d317c167ce.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c6/d317c167ce.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c6/d317c167ce.jpg 1920w" sizes="100vw"></figure><h2>There is no such thing as free bitcoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Of course, there are many more alternative ways to get bitcoin. We&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface here, but other forms of obtaining bitcoin require more capital. For instance, you might want to become a crypto trader using platforms like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro">eToro</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/xcoins">Xcoins</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance">Binance</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/hitbtc">HitBTC</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitmex">BitMEX</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews">others</a>. Alternatively, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-bitcoin-mining-works.htm">mine bitcoin</a> using your own or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin-mining.htm">rented mining gear</a>. Last but not least, there are plenty of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/exciting-crypto-casino-cryptoslots-expands-horizons-2672.htm">bitcoin casinos</a> or lending services where you can earn interest on your BTC. However, these options are high-risk activities and should be treated with caution.</p><p>As you can see, there are many ways of getting &ldquo;free&rdquo; bitcoin. However, money doesn&rsquo;t grow on trees, and if someone makes it look so, it actually isn&rsquo;t free at all. Even getting free BTC from faucets, games, or microtasks takes time and effort. Meanwhile, the most profitable ways to get BTC require capital and sufficient knowledge of online marketing, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies. Remember to invest your time and money not only in bitcoin but also in learning.</p>

<p>Issues one ought to consider before choosing an exchange include security, liquidity, fees, and user experience. For reviews of top exchanges, you can follow this link. Once you find an exchange that meets your basic requirements â&#8230;</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c8/f918e6c1e2.png" alt="How to choose a cryptocurrency exchange" /></figure>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges let you buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Without access to a cryptocurrency exchange, you are unable to buy or sell digital assets. Though, there are some alternatives.</p>
<p>Even so, that doesnât mean that any cryptocurrency exchange is a good one. If you asked any seasoned crypto OG or trader to tell you a story about their first Bitcoin purchase, they are likely to tell you how they wasted significant amounts of money and time dealing with incompetent, buggy, or simply expensive exchanges at the beginning. It takes time to learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff, but you came to the right article.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to choose the right cryptocurrency exchange for you right of the bat.</p>
<h2>What to consider when choosing a crypto exchange</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before jumping into any random exchange someone recommended, you should consider many factors. The most important ones include exchange security, liquidity, fees, history, markets, and user experience. Finding the best cryptocurrency exchange for you can take some time and effort, but it is totally worth it.</p>
<p>One easy way to do it is by reading expert reviews. To see our reviews and comparisons of top exchanges <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">follow this link</a>.</p>
<p>Itâs also important to distinguish crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat exchanges. The crypto-to-crypto exchanges list only cryptocurrency pairs, while fiat-to-crypto exchanges are let you buy and sell cryptocurrencies with dollars, euros, pounds, yen, and other currencies.</p>
<h2>How to pick the best cryptocurrency exchange?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When choosing an exchange, keep in mind that your mileage may vary. You may want an exchange that supports specific altcoins, trading pairs, and additional features such as margin trading or over-the-counter (OTC) deals.</p>
<p>Once you find an exchange that meets your basic requirements, check these other aspects as well:</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong></p>
<p>Security is by far the most important factor of an exchange. If an exchange is insecure, your funds could be stolen, leaving any other advantages it offers worthless. No one wants to lose his or her money, so In this respect, consider the following aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Technology:Â </strong><br />â The exchangeâs web address should start with HTTPS. Avoid HTTP connections.<br />â For login safety, it should use two-factor authentication (username and password plus a piece of information only you have).<br />â Customer deposits should be stored offline, in â<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin-cold-storage.htm">cold storage.</a>â<br />â Auditing programs that monitor exchange activity 24/7 and SMS and email alerts all give exchange customers additional security guarantees.<br />â You may want to whitelist your IP address or withdrawal wallet addresses for the maximum security.</p>
<p><strong>Legal aspects:</strong><br />â Itâs recommended you use an exchange from the same country you are, as that can make it easier to comply with regulatory changes. Itâs also possible, though, to use other exchanges in other countries. Note that some exchanges support only a limited number of countries.<br />â Some exchanges may insure their funds, meaning that in case they lose your funds, you may be reimbursed.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong>Â <br />â Does the exchange reveal its owners, headquarter address, and the members of its team?Â <br />â Transparent exchanges also publish their cold storage address or help check their reserves in other ways, like audit information.</p>
<p>In any case, donât leave your funds on any cryptocurrency exchange longer than necessary. Keep only the funds you need for trading. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-it-is-risky-to-leave-your-cryptocurrency-in-exchange.htm">Most exchanges are like honeypots for hackers</a>. Since they must keep many digital assets in one place, hackers create the most elaborate schemes to steal exchange userâs funds. Hence, itâs better to store the rest of your bitcoin in your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-store-cryptocurrency-safely.htm">private wallets</a>. (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-store-bitcoins.htm">You can also read more about Bitcoin wallets here</a>.)</p>
<p>Other important things to consider for when you are learning how to choose a crypto exchange are:</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity:Â </strong><br />The higher the trading volume is, the more liquid specific exchange is. Liquidity makes it possible to complete transactions faster, more easily and without having to deal with price volatility. Also, see whether an exchange offers &#8220;locked-in&#8221; pricing, which guarantees you the price at the time of your transaction even if it doesnât settle immediately.<br />Be aware that liquidity can be different for different trading pairs. It can be high for BTC/EUR, for example, but low for BTC/GBP. You can check the exchanges with the highest trading volumes here.</p>
<p><strong>Fees:</strong><br />â Compare all the fees an exchange charges. Theyâre usually less than 1% per transaction and may decrease if your trading volume increases.<br />â Check the withdrawal fees. Some exchanges are known to offer unreasonably high withdrawal fees for specific altcoins.<br />â Look into deposit fees, too. Many exchanges offer a quick and convenient way to buy cryptocurrencies with a credit or debit card, but such purchases also come with <strong>a 5% or higher fee</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>User experience:</strong><br />â If you care about anonymity, you probably won&#8217;t choose an exchange that requires you to reveal much about your identity;<br />â Is the user interface simple and easy to use on both a desktop and a mobile device?<br />â What do other users say about the benefits and drawbacks of a specific exchange, the support it offers and so on? Check community forums like Bitcoin Reddit or Bitcoin Forum.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c9/0b70cd5a0e.jpg" alt="how to choose bitcoin exchange" /></figure>

It lets you split your wallet recovery seed into multiple distributed shares and store them on secure, immutable, and damage-proof titanium hexagons. Although most crypto wallets do not yet support the SLIP39 standard, it is an excellent option for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trezor-model-t-review.htm">Trezor Model T</a> users as it is the first major wallet to support and popularize it.</p><p>Likewise, Cryptotag is the first recovery seed product designer to offer a dedicated product for Shamir backups. As such, Cryptotag Odin is a must-have for everyone who finds the Shamir backup scheme valuable and essential for their crypto security.</p><h2>Cryptotag Odin Review: Pros and Cons</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Cryptotag Odin is a premium wallet backup toolkit designed for wallets that use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir Secret Sharing</a> (SLIP39) seed recovery scheme. Although not as popular as the standard BIP39 recovery seed used by most wallets, SLIP39 lets you eliminate a single point of failure in your seed recovery process, and Cryptotag Odin is the tool that will keep your recovery sheets readable and intact even in the harshest physical conditions.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHGpChi4Wh8"></oembed></figure><p>Some of the key advantages of Cryptotag Odin include:</p><ul><li><strong>Extra security.</strong> If you find yourself thinking about how to improve your crypto security setup, adding an extra wallet or moving entirely to a Shamir backup scheme might be a great option. Add titanium hexagons into the mix, and you might finally grant yourself complete peace of mind.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Extreme durability.</strong> Much like its predecessors, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-review-the-best-way-to-backup-your-seed.htm">Cryptotag Thor</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-zeus-review.htm">Cryptotag Zeus</a> kits, Odin&#8217;s hexagons are made of high-grade titanium that is resistant to heat, water, and physical damage. It will make your Shamir backup shares capable of surviving even the most challenging physical conditions for lengthy periods.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Easy to set up.</strong> Odin uses a familiar setup process adapted for SLIP39 seeds. You&#8217;ll still have to sweat to punch holes into titanium, but the Cryptotag team made this process easier than it sounds. The duration of the setup procedure also depends on the number of secret shares in your Shamir setup.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Quick delivery.</strong> Cryptotag team pays special attention to its service design, which includes fast delivery service to most corners of the world. You can expect your package to arrive within 1 to 3 days after placing your order. More specific delivery times can be <a href="https://cryptotag.io/delivery-times-and-costs/">found here</a>.</li></ul><p>When it comes to the drawbacks of Odin, this is what comes to mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Most major wallets do not yet support SLIP39.</strong> While Cryptotag Odin is designed explicitly with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trezor-model-t-review.htm"><u>Trezor Model T</u></a> hardware wallet in mind, it is also compatible with other SLIP39 supporting wallets. Cryptotag also has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-zeus-review.htm"><u>Zeus</u></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-review-the-best-way-to-backup-your-seed.htm"><u>Thor</u></a> backup options for most if not all BIP39-based wallets.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Each Odin hexagon is limited to 20 words.</strong> While some of the Shamir Secret Sharing wallets let you choose to generate 33 words per share instead of 20, it&#8217;s worth keeping in mind that you&#8217;ll only be able to store 20 words per share with Cryptotag Odin.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Criticisms of Shamir Secret Sharing</strong>. Some security experts claim that <a href="https://blog.keys.casa/shamirs-secret-sharing-security-shortcomings/"><u>Shamir Secret Sharing introduces its own shortcomings</u></a> into crypto security setups, while others <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/protecting-bitcoin-shamir-backup"><u>highlight its benefits.</u></a> Despite these differences in opinion, it is generally accepted that each crypto security scheme has its strengths and weaknesses. You should choose the option that fits your personal needs, wishes, and circumstances best.</li></ul><h2>What Is Shamir Backup?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In very simplified terms, Shamir backup can be deemed as a multi-signature scheme for your recovery seed. It splits your recovery seed into multiple seed shares that can later be used to recover your crypto wallet in case of its loss or device failure. But that&#8217;s not the best part.</p><p>Unlike BIP39 wallets, which require you to have the exact amount of recovery words in a particular order, SLIP39 lets you recover your entire wallet using a predetermined threshold of shares, meaning that you don&#8217;t have to have all of your shares for full wallet recovery.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, Shamir backups let you create:</p><ul><li>3 seed shares with a recovery threshold of 2</li><li>5 seed shares with a recovery threshold of 3</li><li>7 seed shares with a recovery threshold of 4</li><li>Multiple other variations</li></ul><p>The maximum number of seed shares is 16, while the recovery threshold can be set to anything from 1 to 16.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/shamir-benefits.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_1415_1116.jpg 1415w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_1200_946.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_900_709.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_720_567.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_600_473.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_300_236.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1415" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Trezor.io</figcaption></figure><p>Such a method leaves extra room for error in case you lose access to certain parts of your recovery setup due to an accident or theft.</p><p>Here is a brief Shamir backup video <a href="https://wiki.trezor.io/Shamir_Backup">explainer by Trezor</a>:</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRh-NCvHkzM"></oembed></figure><h2>What&#8217;s In The Box?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>You can order three variations of Cryptotag Odin &#8211; Odin 3, Odin 5, and Odin 7. The only two differences between these packages are the number of titanium hexagons you&#8217;ll receive for your setup and their price.</p><p>Other than that, Cryptotag Odin shipment includes:</p><ul><li>3, 5, or 7 titanium hexagons</li><li>3, 5, or 7 silicon sleeves for hexagons</li><li>Center punch toolkit</li><li>Cryptotag matches</li><li>Earplugs</li><li>A setup guide</li><li>Conversion sheets (paper)</li><li>SLIP39 word list</li></ul><h4>Package specifications</h4><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Odin 3</strong></td><td><strong>Odin 5</strong></td><td><strong>Odin 7</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Packgage dimensions</strong></td><td>16.5 x 13 x 8.8 cm / 6.5 x 5.1 x 3.5 in</td><td>19.4 x 13 x 8.8 cm / 7.6 x 5.1 x 3.5 in</td><td>25.4 x 13 x 8.8 cm / 10 x 5.1 x 25 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Packgade weight</strong></td><td>1 kg / 35.2 oz</td><td>1.5 kg / 53 oz</td><td>2 kg / 71 oz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of hexagons</strong></td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage capacity</strong></td><td>20 words per hexagon</td><td>20 words per hexagon</td><td>20 words per hexagon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lenght</strong></td><td>12 cm / 4.7 in</td><td>12 cm / 4.7 in</td><td>12 cm / 4.7 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>2.2 cm / 0.87 in</td><td>2.2 cm / 0.87 in</td><td>2.2 cm / 0.87 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Width</strong></td><td>2.5 cm / 0.98 in</td><td>2.5 cm / 0.98 in</td><td>2.5 cm / 0.98 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heat resistance</strong></td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Design and Durability</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Unlike its predecessors Cryptotag Thor and Zeus, Cryptotag Odin is a unique hexagon shape. Each hexagon can store up to 20 SLIP39 words. However, you&#8217;re not going to store SLIP39 words directly on the hexagon &#8211; you&#8217;ll be using their corresponding list numbers instead.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://cryptotag.io/slip-39-wordlist/"><u>The SLIP39 word list</u></a> contains a total of 1024 words (unlike the <a href="https://cryptotag.io/bip39-list/"><u>BIP39 word list</u></a>, which uses 2048 words), each of which has its order in the sequence. For example, the alphabetical list starts with the word &#8216;abandon,&#8217; meaning that its corresponding number is 0001. Meanwhile, the last word in the list, &#8216;zoo,&#8217; can be easily replaced with the number 1024 and vice versa.</p><p>As a result, instead of punching in the entire world, all you have to do is punch in a corresponding four-digit number of the word. According to Cryptotag, using numbers instead of words is an easier and more reliable way to store recovery seed information into a titanium plate.&nbsp;</p><p>A complete list of all SLIP39 words and their corresponding numbers that are punched on the hexagon and also can be found on <a href="https://cryptotag.io/slip-39-wordlist/"><u>the official Cryptotag website</u></a>. Alternatively, Cryptotag dispatches a printed version of the SLIP39 word list for each Odin package.</p><p>When it comes to Odin&#8217;s durability, it remains one of the most robust backup products out there. It is made of high-grade titanium that is resistant to water damage, rust, heat (up to 1665&deg;C or 3029 &deg;F), and all sorts of physical damage. <a href="https://cryptotag.io/testing-facility/">According to Cryptotag&#8217;s testing facility</a>, it has been tested with:</p><ul><li>Blocktorch</li><li>Blacksmith fire</li><li>Open fire</li><li>Closed fire</li><li>Pneumatic hammer</li><li>Profile bending</li><li>Metal roller</li><li>High-pressure</li><li>Beretta 9MM (shooting distance 10m)</li><li>Glock 9 MM (shooting distance 10m)</li><li>CZ Scorpion SMG (shooting distance 10m)</li></ul><p>As such, you&#8217;re virtually guaranteed to receive one of the highest grade cool storage tools available on the market today.</p><h2>Compatible Wallets</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Cryptotag Odin goes hand in hand with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trezor-model-t-review.htm">Trezor Model T</a> hardware wallet, which was the first major wallet to support the SLIP39 format.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, it is also usable with other SLIP39 supporting software and hardware wallets, namely:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Keystone</li><li>Hermit</li><li>Electrum</li><li>Bluewallet</li></ul><p>Some SLIP39 supporting wallets allow its users to select the number of recovery words required per share &#8211; either a 33-word or 20-word recovery sheets. Keep in mind that each of Odin&#8217;s shares can store up to 20 words only, so shares that exceed this limit are incompatible with Cryptotag Odin.</p><h2>Setting Up a Shamir Backup Wallet</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Creating a Shamir backup on your compatible wallet is much like making a regular BIP39 setup, except that you have to write down more seed words, select a number of shares, and their corresponding threshold.</p><p>For instance, here is a short video guide by Trezor on how to create a Shamir backup:</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7WkAN0Gac4"></oembed></figure><p>In case you&#8217;d like to get further guidance on how to create a secure Shamir backup with your Trezor Model T, here is a detailed video explainer by Vlad Costea from <a href="https://bitcoin-takeover.com/"><u>BitcoinTakeover.com</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB289NG2bcM"></oembed></figure><h2>How To Set Up Cryptotag Odin Backup?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Setting up Cryptotag Odin is not so different from its BIP39 counterparts. You can upgrade your Shamir backup scheme from paper to titanium in six simple steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Get your recovery words.</strong> Bring all of your Shamir backup recovery sheets to a single place or set up a new Shamir wallet with a desired number of shares and write down their words (see the previous paragraph).<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Convert your recovery words into their corresponding numbers.</strong> You can find them in a provided SLIP39 word list that came with your Odin package. Alternatively, you can find the digital version of the list on <u>Cryptotag&#8217;s</u><a href="https://cryptotag.io/slip-39-wordlist/"><u> website.</u></a>&nbsp;<br><br><i><strong>Important:</strong> if you&#8217;re using a digital version of the wordlist, do not type in or mark your seed words on your browser or other search mechanisms &#8211; it might introduce an additional attack vector in case your computer is compromised. It&#8217;s safer to use the analog version if possible in order to minimize risks.</i><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Punch the numbers onto the titanium hexagons</strong> just as they appear on your paper recovery sheets.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Burn your paper recovery sheets</strong> as keeping additional paper copies may only introduce additional attack vectors. You can use Cryptotag&rsquo;s dedicated matches for a full Cryptotag experience.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Distribute and hide your titanium hexagons.</strong> Here you have it &#8211; your own secure Shamir backup. Take care and keep it safe!</li></ol><p>In case this wasn&#8217;tCryptotag&#8217;sCryptotag&#8217;s sufficiently clear, here is an original 5-minute setup instruction video by Cryptotag:</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY38fn2iD6Q"></oembed></figure><h2>Cryptotag Odin vs Cryptotag Zeus vs Cryptotag Thor</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Cryptotag Odin is a backup tool dedicated specifically to Shamir SLIP-39 backup schemes. Meanwhile, Cryptotag Thor and Zeus toolkits are designed for BIP-39 seed phrase storage, and the sole difference between the two titanium plates is the price and the number of wallets and seed words than can be stored via each kit.</p><p>You can read our full reviews of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-review-the-best-way-to-backup-your-seed.htm">Cryptotag Thor</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-zeus-review.htm">Cryptotag Zeus</a> here.</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Zeus</strong></td><td><strong>Thor</strong></td><td><strong>Odin 3, 5 &amp; 7</strong></td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Price</strong></i></td><td>EUR 129</td><td>EUR 350</td><td>EUR 199 &#8211; EUR 359</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Type of seed</strong></i></td><td>BIP39</td><td>BIP39</td><td>SLIP39</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Number of seed words stored</strong></i></td><td>24 seed words</td><td>48 seed words</td><td>20 words per share</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Max number of wallets stored</strong></i></td><td>1-2 wallets</td><td>2-4 wallets</td><td>1 wallet</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Compatible wallets</strong></i></td><td>Ledger, Trezor, Metamask and most other wallets</td><td>Ledger, Trezor, Metamask and most other wallets</td><td>Trezor Model T, Bluewallet, Electrum, Hermit and some others</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Setup time</strong></i></td><td>~ 5 minutes</td><td>~ 15 minutes</td><td>~ 10 &#8211; 30 minutes based on your number of shares</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Material</strong></i></td><td>Titanium</td><td>Titanium</td><td>Titanium</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Lenght</strong></i></td><td>11.3 cm / 4.4 in</td><td>11.3 cm / 4.4 in</td><td>12 cm / 4.7 in</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Width</strong></i></td><td>6.8 cm / 2.67 in</td><td>6.8 cm / 2.67 in</td><td>2.5 cm / 0.98 in</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Thickness</strong></i></td><td>0.6 cm / 0.23 in</td><td>0.6 cm / 0.23 in</td><td>2.2 cm / 0.87 in</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Weight</strong></i></td><td>210 grams / 7.4 oz</td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Heat ressistance</strong></i></td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Box weight</strong></i></td><td>410 grams / 14.1 oz</td><td>3.6 kg / 7.9 lb</td><td>1 -2 kg / 35 &#8211; 71 oz</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Box dimensions</strong></i></td><td>14.5 x 12 x 3 cm /&nbsp;<br>5.7 x 4.7 x 1.2 in</td><td>35 x 26 x 9 cm /<br>14 x 10 x 3.5 in</td><td>16.5-&nbsp; 25.4 x 13 x 8.8 cm / 6.5 &#8211; 10 x 5.1 x 25 in</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Cryptotag Odin Review: Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Cyptotag Odin is the best Shamir backup option on the market today and is an excellent addition to Cryptotag&rsquo;s repertoire of quality backup products.

The price dropped 18% in a month and is now down 4% in a year.<br /><br />ETH is likely to surpass its previous all-time high of roughly USD 4,900 by approximately USD 2,000 driven by &ldquo;the Merge&rdquo; &#8211; which will supposedly make Ethereum more energy-efficient, secure, and deflationary, a survey of 36 fintech and crypto specialists by comparison site <strong>Finder </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.finder.com/ethereum-eth-price-prediction">showed</a>.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;The Merge, an upgrade to Ethereum, should happen this summer. This could have an explosive effect on the token. People have been waiting for this for years. It should be far more secure, 99% more energy-efficient, and deflationary. If that isn&#8217;t the trifecta of potential, as a leading blockchain, I don&#8217;t know what would be,&rdquo; </i>surveyed technologist and futurist Joseph Raczynski was quoted as saying.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>However, as reported, The Merge <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-developer-says-merge-delayed-until-few-months-after-june.htm">might not happen this summer</a> and now is estimated in a &#8220;few months after&#8221; June.</p><p>Meanwhile, Martin Fr&ouml;hler, CEO of <strong>Morpher</strong>, gave his highest short-term ETH price target of USD 10,000, stating that &#8220;Ethereum will undergo the equivalent of 3 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halvings</a> with its Merge update. Ether will become a deflationary asset yielding 5&ndash;10% APY [annual percentage yield].&#8221;</p><p>Despite the enthusiasm, the panel&rsquo;s optimism for short-term price movements of ETH has cooled down as the same survey conducted by Finder at the start of 2022 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/far-more-bearish-survey-predicts-doubling-of-ethereum-price-year.htm">predicted</a> ETH price to hit USD 7,609 in 2022.</p><p>The key reasons for the slightly less bullish price outlook for ETH were growing competition in the decentralized finance (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) space, scalability, and lack of long-term confidence in the network.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Ethereum is at a very uncertain place in its journey at the moment. It is currently losing DeFi market share to its competitors (although it still remains dominant by a huge margin). Until Ethereum upgrades its systems and fulfills its promises to scale, I do not have long-term confidence in the network. That being said, I still think people will buy the token out of hype/promise/potential. I don&#8217;t think ETH will be the #2 asset forever though,&rsquo; said Keegan Francis, global cryptocurrency editor at Finder.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>At the same time, John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the <strong>University of Canberra</strong>, pointed out that &#8220;ether (and other non-stablecoin) crypto prices seem to fairly mindlessly follow the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC price</a> and seem to be part of a common speculative bubble.&#8221;</p><p>Overall, the survey respondents were quite divided on the Merge&rsquo;s impact on ETH price, as 44% were unsure if it is going to result in a much anticipated ETH supply shock.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe title="How will the Merge affect the price of ETH?

Weâve pretty much kept to the milestones, you know, weâve raised a substantial amount of money in the first four-five months of the year, ran another couple of variants of the testnet, launched the mainnet a couple of months ago, and now beginning to onboard use cases. We will be also listing on several exchanges within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p><strong>So that was probably your biggest plan for 2022?</strong></p><p>Yeah, pretty much. I think we are fulfilling the milestones as we carry on, and of course like everybody else, weâve got milestones forever into the future. But I think weâre at the point now where for the first time after three years of work we can actually build and work and do business on the blockchain which was where we wanted to get at obviously initially.</p><p><strong>Talk to me about your strategic partnership, the joint venture with Geely Holding Group, and what you guys have achieved so far?</strong></p><p>Yeah, thatâs right. Geely is a very interesting company, it owns a lot of companies in Europe. Actually, most notably Volvo, but also several others. And yes, thatâs right, we have, sort of, set up a separate version of Concordium out there because itâs a different space from a legal and regulatory point of view so you canât really use a traditional token economy there so we are instead working on a fee-based model as we progress. Together with them, we are building a Chinese version of&nbsp; Concordium if you will, which I think, is a very unique position to be in, to have like a global, decentralized blockchain, and then to have a, letâs say, compliant Chinese one tooling at some point in the future. Itâs a lot of ongoing work there as well but weâre happy for that partnership &#8211; very professional guys.</p><p><strong>Concordium has such a unique business model &#8211; very difficult to explain. Iâd love if you could give me a&nbsp; 30-second elevator pitch on Concordium business model?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I donât think itâs that difficult really, right. Weâre a foundation on blockchain like Ethereum or Cardano, or Algorand. We obviously made some science, some technological improvements that we think are important but most fundamentally we just think of ourselves by saying âwe think ID is the layer 1 caseâ &#8211; itâs not something you put on top afterward so in contrary to pretty much any other media foundation or any other form of signup &#8211; we actually insist that somebody identifies you on bitcoin on interview &#8211; not us but one of multiple companies specialized in that &#8211; we donât hold the information, we just want to know that on certain circumstances, due process, etc. Your identity can be retrieved &#8211; the path to that would be like any other permissionless blockchain, and we really just try to build a better foundation because I think it&#8217;s sorely needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A part of building a better foundation involves a really good merger and acquisition strategy. What is your M&amp;A strategy?</strong></p><p>I donât know if I really agree with that. I think weâre building things in a very different way from most people &#8211; not all but we are starting out with very high-level science &#8211; you know, weâve signed up some of the first and foremost cryptographic scientists in the world that work with us &#8211; including people that actually invented some of the stuff that all blockchains consist of like the hash function was invented by our lead scientists in 1980. So a lot of this is old old wine in new bottles, right? The science first, then a serious, serious tech culprit level tech building&#8230;Incidentally, our CTO is Torben Pedersen of the Pedersen Commitment, which any cryptographic savvy listeners would know. So another major cornerstone of cryptographic history if you will, so heâs the CTO.&nbsp;</p><p>And then we have this business overlay which consists of people like myself and several other people that have, you know, a lot of experience in the traditional business. I think thatâs really key &#8211; top science, real culprit approach to tech and then understanding what business is really is looking for which many times is quite different then what people at events like this thing, right? So more software building &#8211; I donât know if thatâs something go out and do much &#8230;and then add things onto that. Weâre helping people to build use cases on top but I think really, weâre focusing on building the best and most suitable blockchain for business in the world, thatâs how it goes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In regards to 2022, what do you think are the most important trends for the next year?</strong></p><p>I think, in overall space, interoperability is beginning to be a very big topicâ¦ Are we all putting ourselves into a little, individual corner, or is this space for somebody going across. Weâre actually looking into how ID solution might cross to other chains so we could help them out on that one&#8230;But I think interoperability is a very big thing. Clearly, NFTs is on a roll right, and weâre launching several NFT platforms, including one that Iâm building separately for another company that I own. So NFTs, obviously, the flavor of the month, so that is going to continue to progress and show how that increasingly spreads out to organizations, ticketing, and many other more sophisticated or additional uses of NFTs&#8230;and I think in general, Iâm not so worried about competition, because I think it is a growing space, Iâm extremely bullish on this space as a whole, and I directed nearly all of my family office investments in this direction now&#8230;but I think thereâs plenty of time to get it right, try few approaches.</p><p>I think some of the people we see now are very high up in the system&#8230;I would wanna see them actually interacting with critical mass before I would sort of say âthatâs a done deal,â right? So I think everybody that has this righteousness should get involved now because thereâs easy time to still come in and be a part of it and I think a lot of things are going to happen that we canât predict right now &#8211; this is what happened with the internet where I was also an early adoptor and we couldnât predict when the internet started what would be exactly the winning use cases and we canât here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Whatâs your take on the metaverse?</strong></p><p>Word of the year &#8211; absolutely, I think it has a good chance. Project of the year &#8211; more doubtful because I donât really see so much of these words converting into something new, and itâs obviously been tried since Second Life to build some of these kinds of functions. You know, Second Life, you may not even remember it but in 2007 that was a big thing. We were actually, as my bank, was one of the first ones on them &#8211; so we always liked new technology. But I think itâs a good bet &#8211; people were talking a lot about it but it&#8217;s a long long to go before you have anything that remotely looks like a metaverse but Iâm happy, happy to be a part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>In such a metaverse, where you will be directly interacting with a lot of people, I can tell you that the ID function will be more important than ever because youâre actually up against projects and people and much more integrated and invasive basis I would say so there you truly want to know what youâre dealing with and have some ID function. So I think all of this plays into the same direction, thereâs a lot of good stuff in a distributed blockchain but you have to marry it to more traditional ways of looking at life and business.</p><p><strong>Where do you see Bitcoin going into the next five to ten years?</strong></p><p>Iâve been predicting stock prices and fiat currencies for many years and had brilliant people paid a lot of money to do it and I know they fail as often as not. So I wouldnât want to make a prediction. Of course, Bitcoin is important for the entire community because it brings money into the community, it makes people risk on, willing to do investments. I think Bitcoin will be less important than most people think but what does that exactly mean I donât know. I think there are far better and more interesting solutions on the way and&#8230;but Bitcoin is, you know, frankly a bit of a religion, you know &#8211; if thereâs enough believers, it can last for a very long time. Itâs not better than gold in my view but&#8230;thatâs been around for 40,000 years and I donât think that would be easily outcompeted. But, you know, I like bitcoin going up, thatâs good for everyone. Iâm not heavily invested in it, I think more interesting options is out there to be honest on my sort of seprate family office approach. But you know &#8211; itâs really important. If Bitcoin goes in the hole, everything else, or a lot of it, will be dragged down and vice versa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So what are, in your view, the best investment trends for 2022?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;When I&#8230;apart from either your operation or directly involved in the project because that really is the way that you stay in for the very long haul. I spent 26 years making my millions out of Saxo Bank, and Iâm prepared to spend what it takes here to make this project right, you know. Because being directly involved forces you to stay &#8211; you canât just liquidate along the way and miss the big moves. If I invest &#8211; I go totally different about it. I find a couple, and Iâve done that, Iâve done very well, thank you very much, a couple of guys I trust, people that have time to sit 24/7, find the new upcoming trends, maybe invest in something weâre Iâll say weâll never but they still do it and sometimes theyâre right and sometimes theyâre wrong. So for me, if you wanted to invest, you got too broad, you know. Itâs very unpredictable whoâs gonna win here but you do see that the people that at least temporarily or permanently do well have enormous multiple pickups so you can afford a few losers here and there, right? But the space overall, I believe, will continue to increase because it has a lot of, not necessarily wild speculation crypto but the blockchain space overall has huge potential and will continue to prosper and get more and more adoption.<br />____<br /><strong>Learn&nbsp;more:</strong>&nbsp;<br />&#8211;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-coinfields-president-on-their-new-token-growth-plans-and-competition.htm">Watch: CoinField&#8217;s President on Their New Token, Growth Plans, and Competition</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-darkfi-team-on-defi-split-financial-privacy-metaverse-and-more.htm">Watch: DarkFi Team on DeFi Split, Financial Privacy, Metaverse, and More</a><br />&nbsp;</p><p>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-vp-of-wazirx-nft-marketplace-on-nft-trends-challenges-solutions-and-more.htm">Watch: VP of WazirX NFT Marketplace on NFT Trends, Challenges, Solutions, and More&nbsp;</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-cryptobirb-on-trends-in-crypto-trading-his-exit-strategy-bear-market-and-more.htm">Watch: CryptoBirb on Trends in Crypto Trading, His Exit Strategy, Bear Market, and More</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-tone-vays-on-bitcoin-narratives-bear-market-defi-nfts-and-ethereum.htm">Watch: Tone Vays on Bitcoin Narratives, Bear Market, DeFi, NFTs, and Ethereum</a><br /><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/watch-polygons-co-founder-on-holy-grail-of-scaling-ethereum-merge-nfts-and-more.htm">Watch: Polygon&#8217;s Co-founder On &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; of Scaling, Ethereum Merge, NFTs, and More</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/watch-nyms-ceo-on-mainnet-launch-privacy-trends-and-more.htm">Watch: Nym&#8217;s CEO on Mainnet Launch, Privacy Trends, and More</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-concordiums-chairman-on-digital-identity-growth-plans-crypto-trends-and-more.htm">Watch: Concordium&#8217;s Chairman on Digital Identity, Growth Plans, Crypto Trends, and More</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

First of all, itâs a great year for me because my colleagues and I bought the exchange this year. The original founders created an exchange coin, called SOLO, or Sologenic, and they did so well with it they said âwe just want to focus just on our cryptocurrencyâ so they said to a colleague of mine âwould you like to buy the exchange?â and he said âyeahâ and asked me to run it. I put up the original money to basically start it off, and then a whole lot of other people said âhey, can we join, can we join?â and itâs been one of the most amazing experiences of my life how itâs kind of coming together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are your strategic expansion plans for 2022 and beyond?</strong></p><p>First, itâs to have a CoinField coin, which we also call Field, being a coin that is recognized as making concrete steps towards using crypto to solve what I think is the number one problem for the stability of countries in the world &#8211; food, and the hyperinflation of food prices. So I think that this coin is the first attempt from the crypto community to solve that problem sustainably.</p><p><strong>The CoinField Coin is on pre-sale right now &#8211; whatâs the strategy with this token?</strong></p><p>Right now weâre here at the show, we just started yesterday, and weâre taking indications of interest, and then as soon as the lawyers approve, we get our opinion letter and everything, we release the whitepaper and itâs a utility token thatâs based on ERC-20, its Ethereum. However, weâre going to, after we distribute it, weâre going to replace it with another coin because we have a lot of interest from various people saying âoh why donât you do it on our platform and the othersâ and I basically want to see what all the offers are to collaborate with people because weâre very unique &#8211; right now a lot because some of the big firms doing ESG standards &#8211; they want to solve social problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Weâre the best pure-play about that. So thereâs CoinField, and CoinField is going to be a part of a publicly-traded company called Tingo Inc, and Tingo is operating in eighteen African countries &#8211; Tingo is the largest agri-fintech company in Africa, and they have the largest agri-tech trading platform, itâs called Nwassa and Nwassa does over 3 billion in the year, itâs a public company so these are FCC fillings, you know, itâs all out in the public domain, thereâs nothing special about this information, Iâm just digging it out of the documents.&nbsp;</p><p>But with CoinField we have about 17 billion maybe more in transactions, and we have 3 billion on the Nwassa platform. Both of those numbers should be way up for next year because weâre putting money into it and so the CoinField coin will be giving you discounted access for trading fees on CoinField and to Nwassa and to 10 million customers or mobile phone customers of Tingo. So basically itâs the first time that somebody has had a coin that can work with a crypto exchange in 186 countries for all the mobile phone needs of somebody and for all of the trading platform needs &#8211; thatâs a unique offering.</p><p><strong>How are you guys going to compete with the big boys and the big gals &#8211; the other big centralized exchanges?</strong></p><p>Sure, one of the things is that a lot of this happens one on one but thereâs a very big difference and I donât think crypto people realize it because you think âregulation is badâ and unregulated means âweâre free.â In fact, FTX is an unregulated exchange, Binance is an unregulated exchange, you have companies that are big exchanges and I donât think customers realize the extent to which their funds are comingled with the exchangeâs funds. So the exchanges go: âyou know, somebody left their crypto here, I think Iâm gonna yield farm it a little bit, I think Iâm gonna goose my returnsâ and then someone gets hacked like Liquid got hacked in Japan, and all of sudden its like âoh, so there was commingling of fundsâ and then the exchange goes down.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, anybody can try anything for a certain amount of time but ultimately the idea of regulation for exchanges is that you donât have a problem for the customers. So weâre a regulated exchange &#8211; we have people who have to answer to regulators and we have to explain everything that we do &#8211; we have to account for it, and so we actually had an audit by Grant Thorton where they went through and said &#8211; â are you compliant with all the regulations of the European Union?â And they went &#8211; âyes.â And we also have auditors at Tingo that are looking at our financial details and saying âare these numbers there?â So thereâs just that quality that you get from a public company that is, and somebody whoâs a regulated exchange &#8211; and we have that. I think that there are people who just want that extra security, and thatâs how weâll compete.&nbsp;</p><p>The other way we compete is that we actually care about people &#8211; we care about whether they have enough to eat, and we care about if weâre smart about crypto we should be able to use crypto to solve real-world problems. Like the hyperinflation of food &#8211; so Michael Saylor has one way of doing it, I talk to him yesterday, I got the last question, and I have my way of doing it. And people are asking Elon Musk or looking to Elon Musk for crypto news, like âoh Elon Musk tell us what we should be investing inâ and his advice is âoh, Dogecoin.â How does dogecoin help with food hyperinflation? I mean its so funny to me, and so weird that heâs saying one a hand dogecoin, and on the other hand heâs saying âI wonder how to solve the problem of food,â right, the food thing and all, âI should donate thingsâ and then he doesnât realize that you can use crypto and his reputation to actually feed people. And thatâs what weâre doing, and so, what I want is something that is one CoinField coin per meal. Now, in the beginning, weâre gonna have to bootstrap so weâll have meals. So on our CoinField.com website, you can get a meal for CoinField coin.&nbsp;</p><p>And it wonât be a great meal, it wonât be a huge meal, but lets say the coin follows what SOLO did, you know, thatâs the other coin from our exchange, and it goes up 10 times &#8211; well then, thatâs a better meal, thatâs a decent meal, even for western standards. And what if it goes up more from there? I mean, the cool thing would be to have pictures each week, like, hereâs the meal you can get for one CoinField coin, and right now, itâs apple and a banana.&nbsp;</p><p>And then the next week itâs like three bananas and a sandwich, and then all of a sudden you have a bunch of people having like a medieval-style Viking banquet or something. I think that would be super cool, and I think that would be a way for people to get excited about crypto and say âoh.â So, I see this isnât just something to make a lot of people who a rich, like that Remy song âIâm gonna be a bitcoin billionaire,â you know and all that where itâs funny and cool but like âoh wait, youâre solving real-world problems &#8211; thatâs what I want, thatâs what CoinField wants, thatâs what Tingo wants.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the most important old/new crypto trend you see moving forward into 2022?</strong></p><p>Sure, well, the biggest trend and the one that I talked about today is that exchange coins, coins from Binance, coin from KuCoin, coins from other places, outperform crypto as a whole. So people are looking, itâs like âoh, what coins are gonna be outperforming?â, and what outperforms is Metcalfeâs Law &#8211; every n number of users increases the utility of the network increases by n squared. And so I have diagrams over in our booth, you know, that show that basically has these positive feedback loops &#8211; more users gives more data which gives better algorithm which gives better applications and then you have these positive feedback loops to get people more and more value.&nbsp;</p><p>And it totally blows away the returns of things. So Michael Saylor is saying âyeah, you got to put it all in bitcoin, you got to put it all in bitcoin, itâs property, itâs an asset and yet it doesnât have those feedback loops that other things can have. So overall, yes, bitcoin is gonna outperform the crashing US dollar, but exchange coins as a category will outperform crypto as a category, and bitcoin by itself, thatâs my belief.</p><p><strong>Bitcoin &#8211; any hot takes or price predictions? Bitcoin on January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023?</strong></p><p>Okay, I would say&#8230;I donât normally make these predictions &#8211; I have two million words about the future with no mistakes in my books because I donât make price predictions but sure what the hell since youâve asked. What Iâm getting for January 1, 2022, is somewhere in the area of USD 80,000, and then for 2023 236,000 &#8211; those are my numbers.<br />___<br /><strong>Learn&nbsp;more:</strong>&nbsp;<br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-darkfi-team-on-defi-split-financial-privacy-metaverse-and-more.htm">Watch: DarkFi Team on DeFi Split, Financial Privacy, Metaverse, and More</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-vp-of-wazirx-nft-marketplace-on-nft-trends-challenges-solutions-and-more.htm">Watch: VP of WazirX NFT Marketplace on NFT Trends, Challenges, Solutions, and More&nbsp;</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-cryptobirb-on-trends-in-crypto-trading-his-exit-strategy-bear-market-and-more.htm">Watch: CryptoBirb on Trends in Crypto Trading, His Exit Strategy, Bear Market, and More</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-tone-vays-on-bitcoin-narratives-bear-market-defi-nfts-and-ethereum.htm">Watch: Tone Vays on Bitcoin Narratives, Bear Market, DeFi, NFTs, and Ethereum</a><br /><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/watch-polygons-co-founder-on-holy-grail-of-scaling-ethereum-merge-nfts-and-more.htm">Watch: Polygon&#8217;s Co-founder On &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; of Scaling, Ethereum Merge, NFTs, and More</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/watch-nyms-ceo-on-mainnet-launch-privacy-trends-and-more.htm">Watch: Nym&#8217;s CEO on Mainnet Launch, Privacy Trends, and More</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-coinfields-president-on-their-new-token-growth-plans-and-competition.htm">Watch: CoinField&#8217;s President on Their New Token, Growth Plans, and Competition</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

Since then, it has acquired a waitlist of 20,000 creators, according to Singh. However, out of these 20,000 creators, only 1,000 have been greenlisted so far. According to the VP, this is due to rather strict and elaborate Indian content-related guidelines.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a country full of many religions, many cultures, we have to be very very careful. So that was a reason why we did not want to be gatekeeper, but we had to do a bit of gatekeeping to ensure or actually build a culture around NFTs,&rdquo; she said.</p></blockquote><p>According to her, so far, only 0.000035% of the Indian internet population have purchased NFTs, which is a rather small number compared to 0.009% of internet users globally. However, this is set to change as the older generation that believes in traditional physical assets like gold, silver, or real estate more is being replaced by generation Z and generation Alpha, both of whom want to be &ldquo;asset-light.&rdquo;</p><p>Vishakha Singh, who comes from the film industry, also says that NFTs are going to get way more traction as more creators, as well as users, are going to discover the value and utility of the non-fungible tokens. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new additional revenue stream for not just independent film producers like me but even for actors.

We have some interesting numbers, you know, globally, 0.009% of the internet population has bought NFTs so far but in India, we&rsquo;re only at 0.000035%. But on the WazirX NFT marketplace in India, we have a waitlist of 20,000 creators so far, so a lot of interest in creating there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How is the NFT market in India different from other countries?</strong></p><p>So, you have to remember that, you know, globally, the world with all these NFT marketplaces that have come up because of this huge success that everyone sees enjoys, and they literally paved the way for us. But the global market is very very mature and its evolved. Per capita income in the west is way higher, the attitude towards money and saving and investment is very very different and bullish, whereas in India there are people who believe in saving, who believe in physical assets, who are actually enjoying, who actually take pride in saying &ldquo;we own a property,&rdquo; &ldquo;we own gold.&rdquo; But the new generation, which is gen z and gen alpha want to be asset-light. And, you know, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very very different right now, but I think, and the crypto market in India and crypto users in India have proven that, because they&rsquo;re primary between the age of 18 and 28 and art collections between 34 to 44, they have proven that this scenario is changing now.</p><p><strong>In the next 3 to 4 years, how do you see the NFT landscape changing in India?</strong></p><p>I think NFTs are going to accelerate crypto adoption in India, that&rsquo;s one. Two: a lot of content creators are going to find value in NFTs. I mean NFTs have actually changed the lives of creators, we get testimonials every day from them, but I think moving forward we&rsquo;ll see a lot of collaboration between platforms, things like interoperability would be easier&#8230;things like even integrating a Metamask wallet, and the process of buying an NFT would become easier and we&rsquo;re also seeing a lot of&#8230;hopefully the laggards will also join the bandwagon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What results has the WazirX NFT marketplace has seen so far?</strong></p><p>So you know, when we started off we had a waitlist of 20,000 creators. We&rsquo;ve actually went through a couple of thousands of creators and then again back to 20,000, so that&rsquo;s the interest we&rsquo;re seeing. But we&rsquo;ve had some good numbers, we&rsquo;ve tried&#8230;because you have to remember NFTs are content, and in India content-related guidelines are very very specific &#8211; they&rsquo;re very very particular about, you know, content not hurting religious sentiments &#8211; I mean, we&rsquo;re a country full of many religions, many cultures, we have to be very very careful. So that was a reason why we did not want to be gatekeeper, we had to do a bit of gatekeeping to ensure or actually build a culture around NFTs. So far, we&rsquo;ve only green listed, about 1,000 creators out of the list we&rsquo;ve received based on quality and consistency. Out of these, 700 creators have dropped NFTs, we have 400 organic collectors who have accounted for &#8211; while the number may sound small yet, but it is an important number &#8211; 400 collectors resulting in USD 50,000 worth of sale in 150 days. From an Indian context, it is a very healthy and inspiring number.</p><p><strong>On a global scale, what are some of the most important challenges for NFTs as a whole, the NFT market, and what are some of the best solutions to overcome these challenges?</strong></p><p>Well, I think from an NFT perspective&hellip;So the question most, a lot of art collectors have been asking is, you know, so far they are enthusiasts and they&rsquo;re art collectors and they want to do this but they&rsquo;re like: &ldquo;so sure, we want an NFT, but then we sell in a secondary market, and somebody else is going to buy it &#8211; at what point does the selling stop?&rdquo; You know, and who will that person be? So the answer I usually tell them is that I think the final NFT buyer who probably..there will be a buyer, a typical art collector who&rsquo;d probably would have a Mona Lisa at his place who would not want to sell. So that&rsquo;s&#8230;I mean it&rsquo;s very difficult to predict, you know, but from challenges point of view, I think interoperability is the most primary challenge that we want to solve. Because the moment we make NFTs free-flowing from one chain to another, I think that would really take things to another level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How important is utility to NFTs?</strong></p><p>Very very important. In fact, just I think today we had a conversation about digital assets, right, and I think NFTs, though I am a very traditional Indian collector, I want value for everything. Everything. Like I need to see the art that I&rsquo;ve collected. So for me, I would be very happy if I could get an NFT of say the Canne Film Festival, okay &#8211; their iconic poster every year. But I also want access to the Canne Film Festival, and I think that would be great. So utility is just, would help, again, faster adoption towards NFTs.</p><p><strong>What does the metaverse mean to you and why it has become so important?</strong></p><p>So yeah metaverse is you simplify it is nothing but virtual reality &#8211; metaverse it&rsquo;s just a cooler word for that. But I think what I&rsquo;m really kicked about is I would love to see&#8230;I want to have just an immersive experience &#8211; I keep telling all my friends who are tech people &#8211; and I&rsquo;m a non-tech person completely &#8211; but I keep telling people that I think this is for the first time that non-tech people, non-stem background people can actually have an immersive experience thanks to the blockchain, NFTs, and now the metaverse and it&rsquo;s just very very exciting.</p><p><strong>Where do you see bitcoin going in the next two, five, and ten years?</strong></p><p>Oh my God, no predictions, I mean bitcoin is too big, I don&rsquo;t want to make any predictions whatsoever, it&rsquo;s&#8230;Bitcoin is the boss.</p><p><strong>Before joining WazirX as Head of NFTs you were an actress and film producer. What kind of ties and trends do you see between the film industry and the NFT and crypto industry?</strong></p><p>Well you know, so I used to be an actress, and I am a film producer, I continue creating content and producing films and typical Bollywood ones and different than that, so for me, because I was an indy film producer, that was one of the reasons I got attracted to NFTs. Because earlier, as an independent film producer, I would, you know, sell my films and theatrical rights and music rights and then auditing rights and satellite rights. Now, I have NFT rights. And NFT rights are so beautiful that they do not contradict with your rights in the physical space, in the offline space. They are only to be exploited on the blockchain and that&rsquo;s phenomenal &#8211; it&rsquo;s a new additional revenue stream for not just independent film producers like me but even for actors. You know all the content that we put out on social media &#8211; it&rsquo;s just nightmare &#8211; you have ownership of it but it still doesn&rsquo;t belong to you.

In his view, the market is not going to âcrash tomorrowâ but heâd like to remind new traders that it might be a good time to plan and even start executing an exit strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of bitcoin price prediction, CryptoBirb expects the price to be between USD 60,000 and USD 80,000 by January, and somewhere around USD 20,000 &#8211; 30,000 on January 1, 2023.

So until like probably 2-3 years from now, we are going to be already, weâve already been through the bear market, and probably starting off a new bull market cycle. Iâm here just about to hop on the stage to actually warn everybody because I do believe that bitcoin is very much and very fast nearing its peak. I can see a lot of early symptoms, itâs not there yet that, letâs say, it needs to crash tomorrow but Iâm planning my exit strategy and Iâm slowly executing it. There are not like the reversal signals just yet but I think itâs very near like, in time, two-three months at best, maybe. I hope to be wrong, I really hope to be wrong but other than this, you know, the bear market to follow, the new bull market cycle would start so yeah itâs promising for the next year for sure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your exit strategy look like?</strong></p><p>So trading strategy, you know, Iâm a position trader, right, so I hold positions that usually take a couple of months. I do not day trade per se unless there is like a specific time that I simple have the time to do it. On top of that, I have well pretty good environment to do it because thereâs of course a lot of stress like running the businesses, of course, is very demanding time, time-consuming so I always have to be very mindful about what I do with my time which is why I would never allow myself to, for example, be a day trader and go degen(erate) on leverage or something like that. So I have a couple of small, low-leverage positions as well in the futures market, so I trade derivatives, I trade crypto of course, like far on the spot basis but I also have my attention outside crypto which is definitely silver, gold, real estate, and Iâm definitely scaling out slowly of crypto in order to put in into more, way more undervalued assets. Thatâs, for example, what silver has become today.</p><p><strong>Crypto aside, or just crypto in general, what services do people want to learn from the most?</strong></p><p>I believe thereâs huge demand, I mean, thereâs huge demand when the money has been growing. At the same time, like, as long as the market goes up, right. I mean, we as the business structurally very very well we grow about 100%, you know, for the growth rate, each and every single year on average &#8211; this is like some, almost I should say, on the healthy amount of growth per year for a startup but weâre growing very very fast. All the social media accounts are printing insane numbers &#8211; itâs pretty exciting, but it also shows the demand from the people which means that if the demand is there, you know, the services of course, that they are picking, have higher chances to be consumed in a way. The demand is rushing along with the people with the hitting the mainstream, the more work my team has to do. So, thereâs of course, B2C &#8211; which is of course business to clients, we offer the subscription-based products to the people to services where they can learn and discover the private chapters, the private corners of The Birb Nest, of the community, which of course is not going anywhere public. This is what weâve been doing since 2017 &#8211; weâve been doing that through the bull markets, bear markets, weâve been through ups and downs, through the crashes, through the biggest pumps, and nothing can change that &#8211; weâre just growing and thatâs the best part. On the other side we also have the B2B services &#8211; so the businesses, the partners that we have also are very attracted as long as the demand goes up for the B2C so thereâs a very direct correlation, directional correlation between the B2C sector and the B2B sector.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What opportunities do you see in the metaverse?</strong></p><p>Itâs huge. Itâs probably way bigger than I can expect right now. I do believe, you know, just with the latest Facebook announcement, I do believe itâs growing big, itâs growing way bigger than anybody expects and this is getting probably closer to where the Matrix movies have been warning us about.

Bitcoin continues to be demonized by both the political class and also continues to be downplayed by the entire crypto industry. But Bitcoin will continue to prevail because it is the most stable, most decentralized, most secure protocol in the digital space.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And how are these trends, these narratives are being affected by various trends in the crypto space such as DeFi and NFTs which weâve really seen blowing up in the last couple of months?</strong></p><p>To me, DeFi and NFTs are just a reincarnation of 2017. I have not seen any real technological innovation or any real long-term substance in neither DeFi nor NFTs. I donât find them to be decentralized, I donât find them to be innovative. Bitcoin as an innovation for true digital scarcity. You canât have an infinite number of digital scarcities &#8211; it doesnât actually make sense. So while they are fun for this bull run, when the bitcoin bear market eventually comes, and bitcoin takes a 50-60% nosedive, this other stuff is gonna fall 90-95% and will probably never recover just like 98% of the 2017 ICOs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you think this next Bitcoin bear market will look like compared to the one in 2017?</strong></p><p>I donât think itâs gonna be as long nor as deep. Now that view could change if we start to go exponentially higher on the price of bitcoin. As long as bitcoin continues the slow and steady rise &#8211; and bitcoin has been rising slow and steady &#8211; it went up a little bit too fast at the end of 2020, after the big crash in early 2020, but weâre at the same price now as we were back in April &#8211; so it hasnât gone up that much yet. So if bitcoin stays under USD 150,000 &#8211; 200,000 over the next 12 to 16 months &#8211; thatâs a slow and steady rise, and a slow and steady rise should not have a catastrophic fall. So bitcoin will probably be rising for another year to two years, and then will probably be declining for about a year after that but itâs not gonna crash all that hard. But this slow and steady decline could really hurt the altcoin space, the DeFi space, the NFT space because eventually, someone will stop paying USD 8 million for a picture of a monkey &#8211; digitally created or recreated.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How has El Salvador done with the Bitcoin experiment as of so far and what advice would you give to the president?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Wow. So when the news broke I didnât think it would be as important as it actually is, at first. And then I thought that maybe the way he did it was a bit of a mistake. Personally, I wouldâve preferred the country putting a fraction of their nationâs wealth into bitcoin and not trying to push bitcoin onto the citizens. Create wealth for the nation, and then the president uses that wealth to better the people. But he went straight for legal tender, which, at first, seems challenging for the population to understand the new currency, people are demonizing him as now everyone has to accept bitcoin &#8211; theyâre helping it. But when itâs all said and done and the smoke cleared itâs absolutely incredible. I can now go to any country in the world and freely talk about Bitcoin because if anyone questions it, I can say: âReally? Iâm I not allowed to talk about the national currency of El Salvador? How is that different from the national currency of India? Or China?â So, it makes it so much easier, it has given bitcoin amazing attention, and other countries are now paying attention. I think by the end of the decade, most, if not all Latin America is going to be using Bitcoin. It will make it easier for commerce between countries and within nations, theyâre gonna see how many entrepreneurs are gonna be moving to El Salvador. The El Salvador conference is happening right now this week [November 15â20] &#8211; I wasnât able to make it there but itâs on my list to go there this year &#8211; so its absolutely incredible, Iâm very happy that they did it, even though itâs definitely scary, and I feel like it couldâve led down a bad, rough path but the president has stuck to his guns and has navigated it flawlessly.</p><p><strong>Any other countries or continents that will follow suit over the next two or three years?</strong></p><p>I really think that Latin America and Africa are the only potentials for this. I do not see the west embracing Bitcoin. The west is going in the completely opposite direction &#8211; Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, all of Europe &#8211; theyâre going in the opposite direction. I donât want to get too political but when I was ten years old my family fled communist Russia for America, and after thirty years of being an American citizen I am now not happy with where we are. I am looking towards Africa, I am looking towards Latin America, Iâm looking towards UAE which is where weâre speaking right now. Prior to the whole COVID situation I loved Singapore, I loved Hong Kong &#8211; I donât think Iâll ever be in those countries again. Itâs all happening in the UAE, I think itâs all gonna be happing in Africa and Latin America. For individual countries, Paraguay has potential, Argentina has potential, Brasil has potential &#8211; mostly because of its very progressive president &#8211; and weâll see what happens after that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the main challenges for bitcoin mass adoption right now? &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Just FUD &#8211; fear, uncertainty, and doubt. I have no fear, no uncertainty, and no doubt about the future of Bitcoin. I believe it will be the global reserve currency &#8211; maybe it needs another ten years to get there. And the biggest challenge as it was in my very first article, maybe the second article Iâve ever written about Bitcoin and crypto in 2014 was âthe biggest threat to Bitcoin is misinformation,â and that is still today, the biggest threat to mass adoption is misinformation.</p><p><strong>How do you think the upcoming Ethereum upgrade might affect BTCâs position as an investment and store of value?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I think it can only help. Iâm still waiting for Ethereum to finally technologically implode &#8211; it is an unscalable technology, it is not decentralized, and they are making it less decentralized by removing mining. Iâm dumbfounded as to how Ethereum has managed to survive for so long and I know a lot of people refer to me as like the Peter Schiff of the crypto space or the Nouriel Roubini or Paul Krugman. The difference between me and them is that I actually understand the underlying technology because I was around before Ethereum was even created. So I understand exactly what Ethereum is, why it was created, what it does, and it makes absolutely no sense and it has no reason to exist into the future. Anything that Ethereum can offer, Bitcoin can offer as well &#8211; it just took a little longer to get there. Because if Ethereum implodes, goes belly-up, and the value of Ethereum goes to zero, Vitalik will just send a text message saying âIâm sorry for your loss, guys, Iâll try better next time.â Bitcoin does not have that ability. Bitcoin cannot fail &#8211; it is actually important to civilization. Ethereum &#8211; ah, itâs just another app on your phone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What role might Bitcoin play in DeFi and NFT space?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;If DeFi and the NFT spaces do survive into the future, and thereâs a small percent chance that it will, but it can, it will eventually all be anchored into Bitcoin. Right now, all of these NFTs are recorded on some guyâs website, and if he forgets to pay his domain bill, there will be absolutely no record of that NFT. They all say how they are anchored into the blockchain &#8211; theyâre not. Itâs somebodyâs Excel spreadsheet on a domain site. So thereâs absolutely no technological certainty in any of these projects- none of the DeFi, none of the NFTs &#8211; unless they are anchored into Bitcoin. If they are anchored into Bitcoin, we can at least then move the conversation into talking about the merits of the NFT, and not have it be a laughing stock that is just on someoneâs web server. And those that understand how this stuff actually functions technologically, and what was the actual innovation of Bitcoin &#8211; proof-of-work mining &#8211; is the only way to understand how none of the NFTs are actually technologically secure &#8211; they canât be. Only Bitcoin is technologically secure. Everything else is just around until some hacker proves that itâs irrelevant.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BTC price prediction for January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023.</strong></p><p>So, January 1ist 2022 &#8211; Iâm thinking somewhere around USD 90,000 &#8211; 92,000.</p><p><strong>And January 1, 2023?</strong></p><p>I think it will be somewhere around USD 125,000 but after it has made a top above USD 150,000.</p><p><strong>Last but not least, Iâd love it if you could show our fans your watch &#8211; it is absolutely incredible. Where did you get that bad boy and where could I get one?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So these bad boys were originally created in 2015, and theyâre an NFT &#8211; you can see it printed right there on the watch &#8211; 1 out of 200. This is as good of an NFT as anything youâll buy in the digital form because NFTs only have one thing that makes it an NFT &#8211; the reputation of the creator of the NFT. So the reputation of the watch creator is printed right there on the watch as to which number out of a number it is. When he sells out he comes up with a new design until he sells that out. He has already sold three slightly different designs and is working on a fourth. What youâre looking for is a website called <i>cryptomatic.io </i>or google âbitcoin watchâ and theyâre not expensive &#8211; theyâre only about USD 800. But he only accepts bitcoin so youâll have to live with that decision for the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tone, thanks a lot, appreciate your time, all the best. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>___</strong><br /><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/watch-polygons-co-founder-on-holy-grail-of-scaling-ethereum-merge-nfts-and-more.htm">Watch: Polygon&#8217;s Co-founder On &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; of Scaling, Ethereum Merge, NFTs, and More</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/watch-nyms-ceo-on-mainnet-launch-privacy-trends-and-more.htm">Watch: Nym&#8217;s CEO on Mainnet Launch, Privacy Trends, and More</a></p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/watch-tone-vays-on-bitcoin-narratives-bear-market-defi-nfts-and-ethereum.htm">Watch: Tone Vays on Bitcoin Narratives, Bear Market, DeFi, NFTs, and Ethereum</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

So definitely Iâve picked up weight, lost hair &#8211; the same with my team &#8211; so itâs been rewarding as well as hard-working time for us.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic expansion goals for 2022?</strong></p><p>The strategic expansion plan from our side is very heavily focused towards the zero-knowledge technology. We recently announced a billion-dollar fund on zero-knowledge and then out of that weâve done multiple acquisitions, weâve announced <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-hermez-to-scale-ethereum-ftx-supports-bitcoin-devs-m-11433.htm">Polygon Hermez</a>, which was the first zero-knowledge product that we launched. Then we also did Polygon Nightfall which is with the Ernst &amp; Young, one of the big four companies in the world in terms of auditing consultancy. And then we have multiple other initiatives also on that front to be launched very soon and weâll be very very heavily focused on zero-knowledge in the next six to eight months and we believe that zero-knowledge is the ultimate holy grail for the blockchain scaling and thatâs where we are going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How might Polygon be affected by the upcoming Ethereum merge? Any plans to combat this?</strong></p><p>No no, itâs actually very positive for any layer 2. See, all layer 2 projects have to put some data or some proofs back to Ethereum, and right now that costs a lot. So when the merge comes and Ethereum becomes like, letâs say from 13 transactions to 30 transactions per second with this much proof of stake merge &#8211; Iâm not talking about the sharding, like 64 shards thing, which is at least like 3 to 5 years away if at all it is coming, weâre only talking about the merge that is happening which is proof-of-stake, and many people think that ok, the whole sharding ETH 2.0 is coming &#8211; itâs not. Itâs simply the merge from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, and then Ethereum is going to have like probably thirty transactions per second from there. Itâs good for us, itâs good for all the layer 2 projects overall.</p><p><strong>What trends do you see in Polygon and how is Polygon going to be used in the NFT space more specifically?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So NFT, already like, I mean again, this is not a very widespread knowledge somehow but NFTs Polygon is the biggest project. Like we recently spoke with somebody, I mean I canât name but one of the biggest analytics platforms and they were doing analytics on Instagram for example so you know 80% of the Instagram NFTs are on Ethereum, 15% are on Polygon and the rest 5% is on othersâ¦ So Ethereum plus Polygon form like 95% of the NFT market. So you know Polygon does not have those big like you know 100 million dollar NFTs but the smaller NFTs which is what Polygon is built for &#8211; games and metaverses &#8211; Polygon has the leading position in that and weâre the largest NFT platform in that sense. We have probably 500 plus games deployed on Polygon and growing day-by-day.</p><p><strong>How is the multichain blockchain landscape looking moving forward?</strong></p><p>I mean weâve been very clear that [the] world is going to be multichain but we feel that multichain is not on the layer 1 but on layer 2. So we believe that the world will be multichain but the multichain world will exist on top of Ethereum instead of multiple layer 1âs existing &#8211; we donât believe in that thesis. We believe that Ethereum is going to be the ultimate settlement layer and on top of it there will be a lot of layer twoâs that will be built and connected with it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who do you see as your main competitor right now and how are you going to combat them?</strong></p><p>StarkWare. I think that on the zero-knowledge side, I think that StarkWare is the most formidable team, and with our multiple zero-knowledge efforts, we believe that, you know, we would be able to edge ahead on that but StarkWare is a very formidable team.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>With how quickly you and your team are growing right now would you ever consider a fresh capital raise?</strong></p><p>We actually, yes, we would be doing something in the future, and, you know, planning for something we might do a small capital raise.</p><p><strong>Your M&amp;A strategy moving forward?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Itâs going to be more and more aggressive, you know, I mean, we want to become the transaction layer of Ethereum and weâll constantly keep on doing that.<br />___<br /><strong>Learn more:</strong>&nbsp;<br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/ethereum-solana-polygon-co-form-a-new-hot-market-of-blockcha-11109.htm">Ethereum, Solana, Polygon &amp; Co Form A New Hot Market Of Blockchains&nbsp;</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-dominance-will-continue-to-decrease-messari-analysts.htm">Multi-Chain Future Brings Multiple Competitors to Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum &#8211; Analysts</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/ethereum-needs-to-try-harder-to-keep-its-dominance-in-a-mult-10506.htm">Ethereum Needs to Try Harder To Keep Its Dominance in a Multichain Future&nbsp;</a></p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/watch-polygons-co-founder-on-holy-grail-of-scaling-ethereum-merge-nfts-and-more.htm">Watch: Polygon&#8217;s Co-founder On &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; of Scaling, Ethereum Merge, NFTs, and More</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>
