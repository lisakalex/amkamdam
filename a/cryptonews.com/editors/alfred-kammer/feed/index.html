Two, neighboring economies in particular will grapple with disrupted trade, supply chains, and remittances as well as an historic surge in refugee flows. And three, reduced business confidence and higher investor uncertainty will weigh on asset prices, tightening financial conditions and potentially spurring capital outflows from emerging markets.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine are major commodities producers, and disruptions have caused global prices to soar, especially for oil and natural gas.

Economies reliant on oil imports will see wider fiscal and trade deficits and more inflation pressure, though some exporters such as those in the Middle East and Africa may benefit from higher prices.</p><p>Steeper price increases for food and fuel may spur a greater risk of unrest in some regions, from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America to the Caucasus and Central Asia, while food insecurity is likely to further increase in parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Gauging these reverberations is hard, but we already see our growth forecasts as likely to be revised down next month when we will offer a fuller picture in our World Economic Outlook and regional assessments.</p><p>Longer term, the war may fundamentally alter the global economic and geopolitical order should energy trade shift, supply chains reconfigure, payment networks fragment, and countries rethink reserve currency holdings. Increased geopolitical tension further raises risks of economic fragmentation, especially for trade and technology.</p><h2>Europe</h2><p>The toll is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2022/03/10/Ukraine-Request-for-Purchase-under-the-Rapid-Financing-Instrument-and-Cancellation-of-Stand-514148">already immense</a> in Ukraine. Unprecedented sanctions on Russia will impair financial intermediation and trade, inevitably causing a deep recession there. The ruble&rsquo;s depreciation is fueling inflation, further diminishing living standards for the population.</p><p>Energy is the main spillover channel for Europe as Russia is a critical source of natural gas imports. Wider supply-chain disruptions may also be consequential. These effects will fuel inflation and slow the recovery from the pandemic. Eastern Europe will see rising financing costs and a refugee surge. It has absorbed most of the 3 million people who recently fled Ukraine, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdata2.unhcr.org%2Fen%2Fsituations%2Fukraine&amp;data=04%7C01%7CGBhatt%40imf.org%7Ce4be9249c63c40fa665a08da0690ef21%7C8085fa43302e45bdb171a6648c3b6be7%7C0%7C0%7C637829516811465795%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=jfWaflq%2B02Ouh5diZ69KHmFb%2BkwZLq2ml7Ib4W%2FJ8JY%3D&amp;reserved=0">per</a> the <strong>United Nations</strong>.</p><p>European governments also may confront fiscal pressures from additional spending on energy security and defense budgets.</p><p>While foreign exposures to plunging Russian assets are modest by global standards, pressures on emerging markets may grow should investors seek safer havens. Similarly, most European banks have modest and manageable direct exposures to Russia.</p><h2>Caucasus and Central Asia</h2><p>Beyond Europe, these neighboring nations will feel greater consequences from Russia&rsquo;s recession and the sanctions. Close trade and payment-system links will curb trade, remittances, investment, and tourism, adversely affecting economic growth, inflation, and external and fiscal accounts.</p><p>While commodity exporters should benefit from higher international prices, they face the risk of reduced energy exports if sanctions extend to pipelines through Russia.</p><h2>Middle East and North Africa</h2><p>Major ripple effects from higher food and energy prices and tighter global financial conditions are likely. Egypt, for example, imports about 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. And, as a popular tourist destination for both, it will also see visitor spending shrink.</p><p>Policies to contain inflation, such as raising government subsidies, could pressure already weak fiscal accounts. In addition, worsening external financing conditions may spur capital outflows and add to growth headwinds for countries with elevated debt levels and large financing needs.</p><p>Rising prices may raise social tensions in some countries, such as those with weak social safety nets, few job opportunities, limited fiscal space, and unpopular governments.</p><h2>Sub-Saharan Africa</h2><p>Just as the continent was gradually recovering from the pandemic, this crisis threatens that progress. Many countries in the region are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/03/08/pr2267-statement-kristalina-georgieva-meeting-uneca-african-min-finance-cent-bank-gov-impact-ukraine">particularly vulnerable </a>to the war&rsquo;s effects, specifically because of higher energy and food prices, reduced tourism, and potential difficulty accessing international capital markets.</p><p>The conflict comes when most countries have minimal policy space to counter the effects of the shock. This is likely to intensify socio-economic pressures, public debt vulnerability, and scarring from the pandemic that was already confronting millions of households and businesses.</p><p>Record wheat prices are particularly concerning for a region that imports around 85% of its supplies, one-third of which comes from Russia or Ukraine.</p><h2>Western Hemisphere</h2><p>Food and energy prices are the main channel for spillovers, which will be substantial in some cases. High commodity prices are likely to significantly quicken inflation for Latin America and the Caribbean, which already faces an 8% average annual rate across five of the largest economies: Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Central banks may have to further defend inflation-fighting credibility.</p><p>Growth effects of costly commodities vary. Higher oil prices hurt Central American and Caribbean importers, while exporters of oil, copper, iron ore, corn, wheat, and metals can charge more for their products and mitigate the impact on growth.</p><p>Financial conditions remain relatively favorable, but intensifying conflict may cause global financial distress that, with tighter domestic monetary policy, will weigh on growth.</p><p>The United States has few ties to Ukraine and Russia, diluting direct effects, but inflation was already at a four-decade high before the war boosted commodity prices. That means prices may keep rising as the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-raises-interest-rate-by-25-basis-points-first-rate-hike-since-2018.htm">starts raising interest rates</a>.</p><h2>Asia and the Pacific</h2><p>Spillovers from Russia are likely limited given the lack of close economic ties, but slower growth in Europe and the global economy will take a heavy toll on major exporters.</p><p>The biggest effects on current accounts will be in the petroleum importers of ASEAN economies, India, and frontier economies including some Pacific Islands. This could be amplified by declining tourism for nations reliant on Russian visits.</p><p>For China, immediate effects should be smaller because fiscal stimulus will support this year&rsquo;s 5.5% growth goal and Russia buys a relatively small amount of its exports. Still, commodity prices and weakening demand in big export markets add to challenges.</p><p>Spillovers are similar for Japan and Korea, where new oil subsidies may ease impacts. Higher energy prices will raise India&rsquo;s inflation, already at the top of the central bank&rsquo;s target range.</p><p>Asia&rsquo;s food-price pressures should be eased by local production and more reliance on rice than wheat. Costly food and energy imports will boost consumer prices, though subsidies and price caps for fuel, food, and fertilizer may ease the immediate impact&mdash;but with fiscal costs.</p><h2>Global Shocks</h2><p>The consequences of Russia&rsquo;s war on Ukraine have already shaken not just those nations but also the region and the world, and point to the importance of a global safety net and regional arrangements in place to buffer economies.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We live in a more shock-prone world,&rdquo; IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva recently told reporters at a briefing in Washington. &ldquo;And we need the strength of the collective to deal with shocks to come.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>While some effects may not fully come into focus for many years, there are already clear signs that the war and resulting jump in costs for essential commodities will make it harder for policymakers in some countries to strike the delicate balance between containing inflation and supporting the economic recovery from the pandemic.</p><p>___<br><br><i>This article first appeared on </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://blogs.imf.org/"><i>blogs.imf.org</i></a><i>.</i><br>____<br><strong>Learn more:</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/fed-cant-stop-prices-from-going-up-anytime-soon-but-theres-good-news-too.htm">Fed Can&rsquo;t Stop Prices From Going Up Anytime Soon, But There&rsquo;s Good News, Too</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ukraine-war-raises-questions-about-end-of-monetary-regime-role-of-bitcoin.htm">Ukraine War Raises Questions About the &#8216;End of Monetary Regime&#8217; and Role of Bitcoin</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-ukraine-crisis-central-bankers-dilemma.htm">Bitcoin, the Ukraine Crisis and the Central Bankers Dilemma</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/could-ukraine-invasion-spark-global-financial-crisis.htm">Could the Ukraine Invasion Spark a Global Financial Crisis?</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-inflation-here-stay-bitcoin-ethereum-gold-investors-will-win-but-brace-for-volatility-bitmex.htm">As Inflation Is Here to Stay, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Gold Investors Will Win, But Brace for Volatility &#8211; BitMEX</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-an-interest-rate-rising-environment.htm">Bitcoin in an Interest Rate Rising Environment</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-raising-interest-rates-curbs-inflation-what-could-possibly-go-wrong.htm">How Raising Interest Rates Curbs Inflation &ndash; and What Could Possibly Go Wrong</a></p>

The reopening of economies boosted manufacturing output, but renewed lockdowns and shortages of intermediate inputs from chemicals to microchips caused the factory recovery to stall. Prices of core consumer goods rose rapidly as delivery times reached record highs&mdash;sparking a debate about inflation and the course of monetary policy.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/02/15/Supply-Bottlenecks-Where-Why-How-Much-and-What-Next-513188">In a new paper</a>, we estimate that euro-area manufacturing output in the fall of 2021 would have been about 6% higher without the constraints on supply. Based on the historical correlation between manufacturing and overall output, we assess that gross domestic product would have been about 2% higher&mdash;equivalent to about one year&rsquo;s worth of growth in normal pre-pandemic times for many European economies.</p><figure class="image"><a href="https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EUR-Blog-Supply-Shocks-Chart-1-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="768" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/71706/67449/1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/71706/67449/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_768_768.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/news/71706/67449/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_720_720.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/71706/67449/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_600_600.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/71706/67449/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_300_300.jpg 300w"></a></figure><p>The drag on output was largest in countries where manufacturing firms operate at the downstream end of global value chains and are reliant on highly differentiated intermediate inputs. Key examples include countries with large automotive sectors, such as Germany and the Czech Republic, where manufacturing output would have been as much as 14% higher.</p><p>Supply constraints also played a significant part in fueling producer price inflation in the euro area&mdash;but so did strong demand. The manufacturing component of producer price inflation was about 10 percentage points higher relative to pre-pandemic times in the first three quarters of 2021. We estimate that supply shocks can explain about half of the increase in the inflation of manufactured goods prices. The rest is mostly explained by increased demand.</p><p>Supply disruptions had less of an impact on core consumer prices (inflation excluding energy and food prices). This measure of inflation was only about 0.5 percentage points higher over the same period because of supply constraints for manufactured goods than it would otherwise have been. This smaller effect is not surprising because goods make up less than half of the consumption basket. The prices of services, which account for more than half, are less sensitive than those of goods to manufacturing supply shocks.</p><figure class="image"><a href="https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EUR-Blog-Supply-Shocks-Chart-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1500" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/71706/67450/2.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/71706/67450/responsive-images/2___media_library_original_1500_1126.jpg 1500w, https://cimg.co/news/71706/67450/responsive-images/2___media_library_original_1200_900.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/71706/67450/responsive-images/2___media_library_original_900_675.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/71706/67450/responsive-images/2___media_library_original_720_540.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/71706/67450/responsive-images/2___media_library_original_600_450.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/71706/67450/responsive-images/2___media_library_original_300_225.jpg 300w"></a></figure><h2>Problems could persist</h2><p>Globally, we find that up to 40% of the supply constraints in manufacturing can be traced to shutdowns, which should have only transient effects on inflation. The same is true of the severe weather and industrial accidents that hindered microchip and auto output in 2021. Other drivers of supply constraints, such as labor shortages (which explain up to 10% of manufacturing supply constraints globally) and aging logistics infrastructure, could however have more persistent effects on supply and inflation than shutdowns.</p><p>Late last year industry experts expected supply shortages for autos to largely dissipate by mid-2022, and broader bottlenecks by the end of this year. Omicron has injected new uncertainty. Europe and China have imposed new restrictions and more disruptions could follow. All in all, supply disruptions could last for longer, possibly into 2023.</p><h2>Policy priorities</h2><p>The first line of defense is to tackle supply bottlenecks directly with regulatory measures wherever possible, for instance by fast-tracking the licensing of transport and logistics workers, temporarily easing restrictions on port operating hours, streamlining customs inspections, easing immigration rules to alleviate labor shortages, and mandating practices that limit the spread of the virus and protect the health of workers.</p><p>Fiscal measures should also be deployed actively to ease the bottlenecks and avoid permanent damage to potential output. Broad-based aggregate demand support at this time could intensify the bottlenecks and raise inflation with limited impact on output and employment. Support should instead be well-targeted.</p><p>For instance, it remains important to preserve the jobs that will be viable once the bottlenecks ease (such as the skills-intensive manufacturing jobs affected by intermediate input shortages). Equally vital is to ensure a recovery in labor supply by removing obstacles to work (by expanding reliable care for children and the elderly, for example) and by helping to train workers in newly needed skills.</p><p>The prospect of prolonged supply bottlenecks raises challenges for monetary policymakers&mdash;namely to sustain a still-incomplete recovery and ensure that output catches up with its pre-pandemic trend&mdash;without allowing wages and prices to spiral upwards. Keeping medium-term inflation expectations stable despite transient boosts to inflation, including from supply disruptions and surging energy prices, is key to managing this trade-off.</p><p>Despite rapidly tightening labor markets in the euro area, recent data and historical precedent suggest that wages will rise only moderately, and hence we expect inflation to fall slightly below the <strong>European Central Bank</strong>&rsquo;s target once the pandemic fades. The ECB has appropriately decided to maintain an accommodative monetary stance until its medium-term inflation target is met while preserving its flexibility to adjust course if high underlying inflation proves more durable than expected.</p><p>In general, to anchor inflation expectations at target rates, it is critical that central bankers continue to communicate how they will react to inflation and other economic data, including movements in inflation expectations, and signal readiness to respond rapidly to any significant change in the medium-term inflation outlook.</p><p>The more successful regulatory and targeted fiscal measures are in alleviating the supply bottlenecks, the less likely it is that policymakers will be forced to dampen down aggregate demand and economic growth to contain inflation.</p><p>___<br><br><i>This article first appeared on </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://blogs.imf.org/"><i>blogs.imf.org</i></a><i>.</i><br>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solanas-serum-raises-usd-100m-coinsuper-vs-crypto-traders-euro-inflation-surprise-more-news.htm">Euro Inflation Surprise</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/eurozones-fiat-is-plunging-and-probably-wont-bounce-back-soon.htm">Eurozone&rsquo;s Fiat Is Plunging &ndash; And Probably Won&rsquo;t Bounce Back Soon</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/imf-warns-of-dangers-of-feds-rate-rise-brazil-says-inflation-wont-temporary-west.htm">IMF Warns of Dangers of Fed&rsquo;s Rate Rise, Brazil Says Inflation &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t Be Temporary in West&rsquo;</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/inflation-huge-danger-as-us-government-overdid-it-little-charlie-munger.htm">Inflation Is &#8216;Huge Danger&#8217; as the US Government &#8216;Overdid It a Little&#8217; &#8211; Charlie Munger</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/turkey-unintentionally-builds-case-for-bitcoin-as-it-plans-convert-citizens-gold-lira.htm">Turkey (Unintentionally) Builds Case for Bitcoin as It Plans to Convert Citizens&#8217; Gold to Lira</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-raising-interest-rates-curbs-inflation-what-could-possibly-go-wrong.htm">How Raising Interest Rates Curbs Inflation &ndash; and What Could Possibly Go Wrong</a></p>
