Source: a video screenshot, Elon Musk Zone / YouTube</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, serial entrepreneur <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/tesla/"><strong>Tesla</strong></a> and <strong>SpaceX</strong> fame reiterated his support for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> on Twitter and during an interview with Bloomberg at the Qatar Economic Forum. Despite the fact that the meme-based cryptocurrency has dropped from an all-time high of USD 0.76 to a current price of around USD 0.08 since Musk touted the altcoin on Saturday Night Live on May 2021<i>&nbsp;</i>and he&#8217;s currently <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/elon-musk-eyes-twitter-digital-payments-expansion-but-faces-doge-pyramid-legal-wrap.htm">facing a USD 258bn lawsuit</a> that alleges the whole thing was nothing more than a pyramid scheme, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-21/elon-musk-interview-in-full-on-dogecoin-trump-twitter-tesla-and-recession">told</a> Bloomberg:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I just know a lot of people who are not that wealthy who, you know, have encouraged me to buy and support Dogecoin. I&#8217;m responding to those people.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Also, in December 2021, Musk made the case for Dogecoin as a better alternative to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> during an interview with MIT Research Scientist and podcast host Lex Fridman. In Musk&#8217;s view, greater on-chain capacity (leading to lower transaction fees) and perpetual inflation are two key features that give Dogecoin an edge over Bitcoin.</p><p>&#8220;[Dogecoin] actually does have a much higher transaction volume capability than Bitcoin, and the cost of doing a transaction, the Dogecoin fee, is very low,&#8221; said Musk. &#8220;Right now, if you wanted to do a Bitcoin transaction, the price of doing that transaction is very high. So, you could not use it effectively for most things.&#8221;</p><iframe title="Elon Musk: Bitcoin vs Dogecoin | Lex Fridman Podcast Clips" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8l7bf2r4Iy0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In terms of the differing monetary policies between Bitcoin and Dogecoin, Musk indicated that an issuance rate that is too low would lead to hoarding and disincentivize spending. In Bitcoin, the issuance rate is cut in half roughly every four years, while Dogecoin has a flat issuance rate that does not change.</p><p>While Musk has become one of the most prominent influencers in the crypto markets over the past couple of years, both of these points made regarding Dogecoin&#8217;s supposed benefits over Bitcoin do not hold up to the slightest bit of scrutiny.</p><h2><strong>Don&#8217;t compare Dogecoin to Bitcoin&#8217;s base chain</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Musk is correct in his claim that Dogecoin can handle many more transactions per second than Bitcoin at the base layer, but comparing the on-chain transaction costs of Bitcoin and Dogecoin is not a useful exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bitcoin network is being developed via a multi-layer approach that allows users to opt into secondary layers, such as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a>, to enable much faster and cheaper transactions. In fact, the transactions on the Lightning Network are faster and cheaper than what is currently possible on Dogecoin, while also retaining a relatively high degree of decentralization. Fees for Bitcoin Lightning Network transactions tend to be a fraction of a penny and approach zero, while&nbsp;median Dogecoin transaction <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/dogecoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3m">fees were over USD 0.10</a>&nbsp;as recently as last month and over USD 0.40 late last year (fees have recently collapsed to under USD 0.01 alongside the Dogecoin price).</p><p>It should be noted that the higher transaction costs on Dogecoin have mostly been caused by higher-than-needed default fee settings in wallet software and at exchanges. Dogecoin&#8217;s median transaction fees could decline further if developers and exchanges implement lower fee settings for their users, but in the long run, keeping a record of all transactions on the base blockchain layer will be more expensive than a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/layer-2-2022-get-ready-for-rollups-bridges-new-apps-life-with-ethereum-20-layer-3.htm">layer-two</a> system like the Lightning Network, lead to centralization pressures due to the increased costs of operating a full node, or both.</p><blockquote><p>On-chain Bitcoin transactions enable the highest degree of censorship resistance for value transfers in the digital realm, but the reality is this extreme level of decentralization is not needed on every transaction.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>For this reason, it makes sense for Bitcoin to take a layered approach to scaling where separate, upper-layer protocols can be used for specific types of transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Lightning Network enables faster, cheaper payments for everyday transactions, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://liquid.net">Liquid</a> sidechain enables new features on a federated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-are-sidechains-2658.htm">sidechain</a> with faster block times, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rsk.co">RSK</a> allows for bitcoin to be used to pay for gas on a federated sidechain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</a>), and federation-backed Chaumian banks, such as <strong>Minimint</strong>, can enable improved privacy for instant, Lightning-esque payments.</p><p>With Dogecoin&#8217;s focus on low-cost payments, it would be best to compare the meme-based cryptocurrency with the Lightning Network rather than on-chain Bitcoin transactions, as these two networks are operating in the same niche. Musk touts the transaction capacity of Dogecoin, but the number of transactions that can be processed by the Lightning Network is effectively limitless, as there is no cap on the number of payments that can be made once a user has a channel open on the secondary payment protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the ability to transact with peers directly rather than interacting with a costly, inefficient blockchain leads to much lower transaction costs. That said, it should be noted that there is still a scaling limitation here based around users rather than transactions, as users must be able to make at least one on-chain transaction to join the Lightning Network.</p><h2><strong>Data shows Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network is catching up to Dogecoin</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The data shows Bitcoin&#8217;s secondary protocol layers, which are still in the early stages of development, are already more active than Dogecoin. And the reasons behind this reality should be obvious. If you can get the key feature of Dogecoin, namely fast and cheap payments, with the relative stability of BTC (at least when compared to other cryptocurrencies), then it would make sense to opt for that approach.</p><p>According to the most recent available data, Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network alone may have already surpassed Dogecoin in terms of payment activity. In April, <strong>Arcane Research</strong> put out their second <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-payments-jump-over-400-80m-users-have-access-to-lightning.htm">report on the Lightning Network</a>, and it indicated that Bitcoin&#8217;s payments layer had accounted for more than 800,000 transactions in the month of February. This is roughly double the number of Lightning Network transactions made in February of 2021. More recently, <strong>Breez Technology</strong> CEO Roy Sheinfeld <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://twitter.com/kerooke/status/1535283042666917896">revealed</a> that his company alone is doing 200,000 to 300,000 Lightning transactions per month, which indicates even more growth may have taken place since February.</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://charts.coinmetrics.io/network-data/">data</a> from <strong>Coin Metrics</strong>, the Dogecoin network was processing roughly 30,000 transactions per day in February, which would amount to a little under 870,000 transactions for the month. However, Dogecoin&#8217;s transfers per day, which is a metric that attempts to find multiple payments in the same on-chain transaction, was around 83,500.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>This would put Dogecoin&#8217;s monthly payments count at around 2.4 million. That said, these numbers are roughly the same as they were in February 2021.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, comparing payment activity on Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network to Dogecoin&#8217;s on-chain activity is far from an exact science for a variety of reasons. For one, Lightning Network activity happens off-chain, which means it&#8217;s much more difficult to collect the relevant data. So, for example, Arcane Research relies on third-party reporting for their data. However, more direct comparisons can be made with data from specific merchants. In the case of both <strong>Coincards</strong> and <strong>Bitrefill</strong>, the most recent data shows Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network accounts for more activity than Dogecoin on a monthly basis.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/CoinCards/status/1532083692339728384[/embed]<figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/ziggamon/status/1481307334068641795[/embed]<p>Furthermore, the transactions on the Lightning Network are much more likely than on-chain transactions to be real-world payments, as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/lightning-network-adoption-at-exchanges-is-growing-this-is-why-its-good-for-bitcoin.htm">exchange adoption of this Bitcoin layer-two technology</a> is still low. According to the aforementioned report from Arcane Research, around half of Lightning Network transactions fall under the category of micro rewards or gaming. There are a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/play-earn-bitcoin-games-how-lightning-network-enables-gamers-to-earn-sats.htm">number of Lightning-enabled games</a> and apps that reward their users in small units of bitcoin, known as satoshis, and this is where a lot of the activity takes place today.&nbsp;</p><p>While Musk has talked about certain types of transactions being priced out of the Bitcoin network due to high fees, the reality is the small amount of satoshis transferred as gaming rewards via the Lightning Network would be uneconomical on Dogecoin at scale.</p><p>It should also be noted that the base Bitcoin network dwarfs both the Lightning Network and Dogecoin when it comes to transactions, processing around 250,000 transactions and 800,000 transfers per day.</p><h2><strong>The supposed benefits of Dogecoin&#8217;s monetary policy</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In terms of Musk&#8217;s comments on the benefits of Dogecoin&#8217;s alternative monetary policy, the reality is market participants are not going to prefer to hold a more inflationary asset, even if it hypothetically would be more beneficial for the overall economy. In general, people act in their own self-interest, not for the common good.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Dogecoin&#8217;s monetary policy becomes increasingly deflationary over time anyway, as the issuance rate per block is a set number rather than a percentage of the current supply. In other words, the theoretically-negative talking points regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s deflationary monetary policy also apply to Dogecoin. Of course, Dogecoin governance is so centralized at this point that Musk could likely push through a change to the monetary policy without much pushback. However, the ability for the issuance rate to change makes the policy less credible and therefore less interesting as an investable asset.</p><p>With all of this in mind, perhaps the only real advantage of Dogecoin is that its logo has a dog on it.<br />_____<br /><strong>Learn more:</strong><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/another-elon-musk-fueled-doge-rally-ends-with-a-dump.htm">Another Elon Musk-fueled DOGE Rally Ends With a Dump</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/popular-meme-coin-dogecoin-used-in-most-serious-crimes.htm">Popular Meme Coin Dogecoin Used in &#8216;Most Serious&#8217; Crimes</a></p><p>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/elon-musk-should-listen-to-cathie-wood-on-bitcoin-11187.htm">Elon Musk Should Listen to Cathie Wood on Bitcoin</a><br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-on-chain-metrics-strongest-among-peers-kraken.htm">Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Strongest Among Peers &#8211; Kraken</a></p><p>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/as-bitcoin-scales-with-lightning-network-what-role-does-litecoin-have-to-play.htm">As Bitcoin Scales With Lightning Network, What Role Does Litecoin Have to Play?</a>&nbsp;<br />&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/dont-fear-the-reaper-why-the-market-downtrend-is-good-for-crypto.htm">Don&rsquo;t Fear the Reaper: Why the Market Downtrend Is Good for Crypto</a></p> <p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/heres-what-elon-musk-gets-wrong-about-bitcoin-and-dogecoin.htm">Here&#8217;s What Elon Musk Gets Wrong About Bitcoin and Dogecoin</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

Although many of them have dismissed the asset as a highly speculative bubble in the past, the cryptocurrency keeps growing in terms of price, general adoption, and a variety of other metrics. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/610/e2efcc108e.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/610/e2efcc108e.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/610/e2efcc108e.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/610/e2efcc108e.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/610/e2efcc108e.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/610/e2efcc108e.jpg 1193w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/zhenya</figcaption></figure><p>Due to the massive increase in the bitcoin price over the past year or so, central bankers have, once again, been sharing their bad takes on Bitcoin with the general public, while also oftentimes simultaneously touting the promise of blockchain technology&#8217;s use in the development of central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDCs</a>). Let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of these recent comments to see what the central bankers are getting wrong about Bitcoin this time around.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="1.-bitcoin-is-too-volatile-and-is-not-a-store-of-value">1. &ldquo;Bitcoin is too volatile and is not a store of value&rdquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A key criticism thrown at BTC from a wide range of skeptics (not just central bankers) is that the asset is far too volatile to act as a store of value.</p><p>&#8220;Cryptoassets, which we call them crypto assets, [are] highly volatile (see bitcoin); therefore, they&#8217;re not really useful as a store of value,&#8221; said US <b>Federal Reserve</b> Chair Jerome Powell at an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5bVtzQt4Uc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event</a> held by the <b>Bank for International Settlements</b> (BIS) back in March.</p><p>In terms of not being useful as a store of value, there are plenty of long-term bitcoin holders who would dispute this claim. While the short-term bitcoin price can be quite volatile, those who have held bitcoin through an entire <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">halving cycle</a> (roughly four years) have never lost money. There is no dispute that the bitcoin price can be highly speculative and volatile over the short term, but plenty of bitcoin holders are willing to ignore this potentially-temporary property of the system, as they&#8217;re interested in use of the crypto asset as a form of long-term savings.</p><p>Yes, bitcoin has fallen from over USD 60,000 to roughly USD 30,000 and then recovered to USD 40,000 over the past few months, but it&#8217;s also still up around 250% over the past year and more than 6,000% over the past five years at the time of this writing. The short-term bitcoin price action can be extremely noisy, as the market is still unsure how to value this completely new type of asset that previously did not exist. Additionally, the past five years of bitcoin price action have empirically been less volatile than the first five. The idea that a completely new type of asset can go from zero to tens of thousands of dollars without volatility simply has no basis in reality.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/610/e28cd97b5c.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/610/e28cd97b5c.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/610/e28cd97b5c.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/610/e28cd97b5c.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/610/e28cd97b5c.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/610/e28cd97b5c.png 833w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>60-day BTC/USD Volatility.

</figcaption></figure><p>It should be noted that Robert Kaplan, who is the president of the <b>Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</b>, appears to disagree with Powell&#8217;s assessment on bitcoin.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear it&#8217;s a store of value,&#8221; Kaplan stated at a Bitcoin event hosted by Texas A&amp;M earlier this year. &#8220;Obviously, it moves a lot in value, so that may keep it from spreading too far as a medium of exchange and wide adoption. But that can change, and that will evolve.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="video-object"><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwUa45-537s?wmode=transparent&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 data-param="1" id="2.-bitcoin-is-not-backed-by-anything-and-has-no-intrinsic-value">2. &ldquo;Bitcoin is not backed by anything and has no intrinsic value&rdquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Another criticism of bitcoin that is closely related to its supposed inability to act as a store of value is the claim that the crypto asset has no intrinsic value. &#8220;[Bitcoin] is not backed by anything,&#8221; stated Powell at the aforementioned BIS event.<br>
In his view, stablecoins are an improvement over pure crypto assets like bitcoin due to the fact that stablecoins are backed by sovereign currencies of leading nations like the United States. From this perspective, Powell sees bitcoin as more similar to gold than the US dollar. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard also agrees with this comparison. &#8220;They characterize it as a rival to gold, and that might be a good way to think about it,&#8221; said Bullard in an interview with CNBC earlier this year.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe width="560" height="405" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.cnbc.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&amp;byGuid=7000177485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The lack of fundamental value for bitcoin is also espoused by other central bankers around the world. In May, a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/fsr/html/ecb.fsr202105~757f727fe4.en.html#toc2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the <b>European Central Bank</b> (ECB) compared bitcoin to the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sea_Company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Sea Bubble</a>. Additionally, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/ecb-s-guindos-says-crypto-assets-aren-t-a-real-investment?sref=GUP2BhaG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Bloomberg TV that crypto assets are not real investments because they have very weak fundamentals. <b>Bank of England</b> Governor Andrew Bailey has also espoused this sentiment. In a May press conference, he stated:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[Cryptocurrencies] have no intrinsic value. That doesn&rsquo;t mean to say people don&rsquo;t put value on them, because they can have extrinsic value. But they have no intrinsic value.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>To be fair, this criticism of bitcoin is mostly correct. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and it&#8217;s value is entirely dependent on people viewing it as valuable (albeit based on its intrinsic properties). However, the problem with bitcoin&#8217;s lack of intrinsic value as an argument against the crypto asset is it also applies to alternatives like gold and the US dollar. The US dollar has value because the federal government says it has value and people believe them. If more people decide to hold value in bitcoin instead of the US dollar, there is nothing &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; about dollars that guards them from this sort of <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculative attack</a>. Instead, the federal government can only use their monopoly on violence to try to outcompete bitcoin through the use of force.</p><p>Obviously, there are still fundamental reasons for both bitcoin and the US dollar to be at their current valuations. It is often said that the US dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government or the requirement to pay taxes in the currency, which is all fine and well. </p><blockquote><p>But bitcoin also has its own fundamental value propositions in the forms of an incorruptible monetary policy, the difficulties associated with seizing someone else&#8217;s bitcoin, and censorship-resistant online payments.</p></blockquote><p>As a final note on this topic, Powell&#8217;s point around bitcoin&#8217;s lack of backing should not be viewed as a negative, as that is the entire point of the digital cash system. Any sort of backing of bitcoin by real-world assets or a centralized issuer would reintroduce counterparty risk (as is the case with stablecoins), which is the entire problem bitcoin is intended to solve in the first place.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="3.-bitcoin-uses-too-much-energy">3. &ldquo;Bitcoin uses too much energy&rdquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Another criticism of bitcoin levied by Powell during the BIS event in March was that the Bitcoin system is too energy-intensive. A spokesperson for the <b>World Bank</b>, which itself is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/world-bank-accused-of-ignorance-hypocrisy-as-it-refused-to-h-10726.htm">investing billions in fossil fuels, despite European officials&rsquo; pleas to stop</a> funding projects of this nature, also told Reuters that environmental concerns were one of two reasons the international financial institution could not assist <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/el-salvador/">El Salvador</a> with their adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. Additionally, ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2021/html/ecb.blog210511~7810445372.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in May, &#8220;The enormous energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions of cryptoasset mining could undermine global sustainability efforts. Bitcoin alone is already consuming more electricity than the Netherlands. Controlling and limiting the environmental impact of cryptoassets, including through regulation and taxation, should be part of the global discussion.&#8221;</p><p>More recently, the ECB <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-starts-digital-euro-project-with-two-year-investigation-11060.htm">stated</a> that their digital currency&#8217;s energy consumption would be negligible when compared to bitcoin. Also this summer, a BIS <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/central-banks-step-up-bitcoin-stablecoin-bashing-efforts-ami-10775.htm">report stated</a>, &#8220;Bitcoin in particular has few redeeming public interest attributes when also considering its wasteful energy footprint.&#8221;</p><p>This statement from the BIS report is the perfect illustration of the key problem with the environmental arguments against Bitcoin. These arguments are only valid to people who think there is no value to Bitcoin&#8217;s existence. </p><blockquote><p>If you don&#8217;t understand Bitcoin&#8217;s value proposition, then of course you will make the argument that any energy used in bitcoin mining is a waste. It is no different from someone who does not like Christmas thinking that all of the energy spent on Christmas lights every year is a waste. </p></blockquote><p>In other words, this is a subjective argument. Obviously, those who hold bitcoin see the costs of establishing a global, apolitical monetary system worth the associated energy costs.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/kyletorpey/status/1362251926990127106"></oembed></div><p>The narrative in the media that Bitcoin is horrible for the environment is also grossly overstated. Many of the estimates on future Bitcoin energy use make extremely basic technical mistakes such as ignoring layer-two systems like the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a> and assuming that all future transactions are going to occur on the base blockchain layer. There is plenty of reason to believe that the environmental impact of a widely adopted Bitcoin monetary standard would be less than the impact from the current financial system or a return to a gold standard. <b>ARK Invest</b> and <b>Square Crypto</b> also co-authored a paper that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/proof-of-bitcoin-needed-as-critics-competitors-unite-to-play-10017.htm">explores whether bitcoin mining may actually improve</a> the economics of renewable sources of energy.</p><div class="video-object"><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SA_IhASl-S4?wmode=transparent&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 data-param="1" id="4.-bitcoin-lacks-transparency-and-is-too-useful-for-criminals">4. &ldquo;Bitcoin lacks transparency and is too useful for criminals&rdquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The same World Bank spokesperson who brought up environmental concerns in the context of El Salvador&#8217;s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender also said transparency is a potential issue with the crypto asset, and the BIS report mentioned in the previous section also touched on the use of bitcoin for money laundering and ransomware attacks. But perhaps the most critical remarks on cryptocurrency&#8217;s use by criminals this year came from ECB President Christine Lagarde.<br>
&ldquo;[Bitcoin] is a highly speculative asset, which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity,&rdquo; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-president-attacks-bitcoin-again-as-digital-euro-in-works-8889.htm">said Lagarde</a> at the Reuters Next conference in January.</p><p>Lagarde, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/christine-lagarde-convicted-imf-head-found-guilty-negligence-fraud-trial-a7484586.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who herself is a convicted criminal</a>, added that global regulation is needed on bitcoin and other digital currencies to prevent people from finding pockets of jurisdictions around the world that can be used to get around financial reporting requirements.</p><p>In February, Lagarde also stated, &#8220;[Bitcoin] is a [crypto asset] that was established back in 2009 by libertarians and the hopeful of the completely decentralized universe that will be completely anonymous.&#8221;</p><div class="video-object"><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8j4LDc3A6sU?wmode=transparent&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This comment indicates an understanding of the political underpinnings of the Bitcoin network. However, a digital financial system that is neither decentralized nor potentially anonymous has its own social implications as well. These implications were perhaps best described by BIS General Manager Agustin Carstens at an IMF <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVmKN4DSu3g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event</a> in October 2020, where he made a statement regarding the differences between the physical cash of today and the potential CBDCs of the future.</p><p>&#8220;A key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that central bank liability, and also, we will have the technology to enforce that,&#8221; said Carstens.</p><div class="video-object"><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpNnTuK5JJU?wmode=transparent&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Bitcoin has long been thought of as a potential hedge against a dystopian cashless society where there is no such thing as financial privacy or true ownership over one&#8217;s savings (I <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-push-for-a-cashless-society-could-be-an-opportunity-for-bitcoin-2016-04-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about it for NASDAQ five years ago). </p><blockquote><p>With complete government control over the digital financial system, it becomes easier to implement inflationary monetary policies, seize assets from the populace, and censor specific types of transactions, all in the name of protecting the children from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Four Horsemen</a> of the Infocalypse. </p></blockquote><p>There are a variety of regulatory developments related to cryptocurrency taking place around the world right now, so this year may give everyone a glimpse of just how far governments are willing to go to protect their &#8220;absolute control&#8221; over the digital financial system.<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Part of what many observers expected to see during Wednesday&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/here-s-what-everyone-missed-in-the-dorsey-musk-and-wood-bitc-11158.htm">discussion</a> featuring <b>Ark Invest</b> CEO Cathie Wood, <b>Tesla</b> and <b>SpaceX</b> CEO Elon Musk, and <b>Square</b> and <b>Twitter</b> CEO Jack Dorsey was a debate regarding the merits of Bitcoin&#8217;s multi-layer approach to scaling versus the alternative of increasing transaction capacity at the base blockchain layer. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60f/ba05ceefad.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60f/ba05ceefad.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/60f/ba05ceefad.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/60f/ba05ceefad.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/60f/ba05ceefad.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Elon Musk. Source: A video screenshot, Youtube, Bloomberg.</figcaption></figure><p>While this direct confrontation between the panelists did not really happen, contrasting comments made by Wood and Musk illustrated the key area of disagreement in this technical debate and why Musk&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> experiment is unlikely to succeed.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="wood-explains-bitcoins-value-proposition">Wood explains Bitcoin&#8217;s value proposition</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>At the beginning of Wednesday&#8217;s livestream, Wood was asked by <b>Square Crypto</b>&#8216;s Steve Lee to explain what originally sparked her interest in Bitcoin. In her response, Wood recalled that her former mentor and economist Arthur Laffer (of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer curve</a> fame) referred to Bitcoin as the sort of &#8220;rules based monetary system&#8221; that he had been waiting for his entire career.</p><p>Later in the talk, Wood added, &#8220;The role that [Bitcoin] is playing, given that the rule is a quantity rule [of] 21 million units, is really a store of value role.&#8221;</p><p>Put differently, the main purpose of the Bitcoin blockchain in the context of the bitcoin asset&#8217;s utility as a store of value is to enable a monetary policy that is &#8220;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/attempts-to-increase-bitcoin-s-supply-would-end-up-with-anot-6030.htm">set in stone</a>&#8221; (as Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1611#msg1611" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it many years ago</a>) and cannot be corrupted by a trusted third party such as a central bank.</p><p>Wood also mentioned the fact that various apps around the use of bitcoin as medium of exchange can be built on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain, although high-value transactions do already take place on the base chain as well.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="musk-wants-to-test-bigger-blocks-on-dogecoin">Musk wants to test bigger blocks on Dogecoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Shortly after Wood&#8217;s explanation regarding the main utility of the Bitcoin blockchain as the foundational layer of a new monetary network, Musk was asked for his thoughts regarding bitcoin&#8217;s ability to scale as a means of payment. While Musk has received heavy criticism from some Bitcoin enthusiasts over statements he&#8217;s made regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s scalability, his position came off as more nuanced in the livestream.</p><blockquote><p>
</p><p>&#8220;Bitcoin, by itself, simply cannot scale to be the monetary system of the world at the base layer. But with a second layer, this is possible, depending on how that second layer is implemented.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Musk added that he holds much more BTC than <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a> or DOGE, and that he would like to see Bitcoin succeed. However, he also sees value in pushing the limits of on-chain scaling with Dogecoin.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="what-musk-gets-wrong">What Musk gets wrong</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The key point that Musk did not attempt to dispute in Wednesday&#8217;s discussion was that changing Bitcoin&#8217;s base layer at all, especially in a way that increases the cost of operating a full node, weakens the credibility of the rules of the network. Going back to Wood&#8217;s points on the value proposition of the Bitcoin blockchain, large changes made at the base layer potentially harm the credibility of bitcoin&#8217;s monetary policy and the crypto asset&#8217;s utility as a store of value. In the past, the market has been unwilling to risk bitcoin&#8217;s utility as a store of value in favor of perceived advantages associated with smaller-value transactions, as was the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2017/11/09/failure-segwit2x-shows-bitcoin-digital-gold-not-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case</a> with the failure of SegWit2x.</p><p>As Lee rightly pointed out, there has already been plenty of debate on this topic throughout Bitcoin&#8217;s history, and it&#8217;s not like Musk is proposing anything new here. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/">Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a> even tried to piggyback on top of Bitcoin&#8217;s monetary network effects to implement a much higher block size limit and <a href="https://twitter.com/kyletorpey/status/1362163815438299136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed</a> miserably. For many, a more practical way to build on Bitcoin&#8217;s existing network effects is through the use of secondary-layer networks like the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-are-sidechains-2658.htm">sidechains</a>, which don&rsquo;t necessitate the creation of a new, separate cryptocurrency. And to Musk&#8217;s credit, he&#8217;s also open to the potential of this scaling philosophy.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/sangaman/status/1393747007525773312"></oembed></div><p>It appears that the &#8220;I&#8217;m new to Bitcoin and I&#8217;m here to fix it&#8221; meme applies quite well here. Of course, that tends to apply to nearly everyone when they get involved in the space for the first time, and it&#8217;s definitely magnified in this situation due to Musk&#8217;s celebrity profile. That said, it&#8217;s understandable that Bitcoin users have become annoyed by Musk&#8217;s and others&#8217; recent rehashing of old discussions and ideas.</p><p>While Musk is still hung up on things like <a href="https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1415095276147298306" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-debunked</a> concerns over the potential regulation of Lightning Network nodes and a bewildering <a href="https://twitter.com/kyletorpey/status/988565695838539776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desire</a> to only buy a coffee with an on-chain transaction, it&#8217;s likely that, just like everyone else, he&#8217;ll eventually give in to the inevitability of bitcoin&#8217;s monetary network effects.<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, a highly-anticipated conversation regarding <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> between <b>Ark Invest</b> CEO Cathie Wood, <b>SpaceX</b> and <b>Tesla</b> CEO Elon Musk, and <b>Square</b> and <b>Twitter</b> CEO Jack Dorsey took place online as part of <a href="https://thebword.org/c/the-b-word" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The B Word</a> initiative. While most have focused on the newsworthy aspects of the talk, such as the fact that SpaceX holds bitcoin on their balance sheet or that Tesla is likely to accept BTC again in the near future and that the company is not selling their BTC, there are a number of other key takeaways to look at when it comes to the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin as a revolutionary technology that has the potential to change the world for the better. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60f/87bde430ec.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60f/87bde430ec.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/60f/87bde430ec.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/60f/87bde430ec.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/60f/87bde430ec.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/60f/87bde430ec.png 1390w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: A video screenshot.</figcaption></figure><p>Social media was rather excited about Musk disclosing that he personally owns both <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">dogecoin (DOGE)</a> (but also owns a much greater amount of BTC), but for me, the key takeaway was the notable <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/cypherpunk-manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cypherpunk</a> philosophy that underpinned various statements made during the panel discussion, which was also moderated by <b>Square Crypto</b>&#8216;s Steve Lee.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="musk:-bitcoin-empowers-the-individual">Musk: Bitcoin empowers the individual</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>For Musk, money is an information system, primarily for labor allocation, and there are a number of issues with the various database systems that are currently used around the world today. Specifically, Musk sees serious issues when it comes to the speed and security of these outdated systems.</p><p>&#8220;[The credit card system] is like handing your username and password to a stranger in a restaurant if you buy a meal,&#8221; noted Musk.</p><p>In his view, Bitcoin has the potential to offer improvements in the areas of throughput, fraud prevention, government interference, and other error-prone areas of the current financial system. &#8220;Bitcoin is solving for having no throat to choke,&#8221; added Musk.</p><p>With that in mind, the CEO of Tesla sees Bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally as something that fits into a wider vision of doing things that benefit people and create a better future for the world. </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;It can have an empowering effect for individuals and increase the power of the individual relative to government,&#8221; Musk said. </p></blockquote><p>&#8220;And really, government is just a corporation in the limit. Sometimes some people are like against corporations but [in favor of] government. It&#8217;s like: Guys, the government is just a corporation in the limit. It&#8217;s the biggest corporation of all, and it&#8217;s got a monopoly on violence. So, if you don&#8217;t like corporations, you should really hate government.&#8221;</p><p>Musk said he has been thinking deeply about money since his <b>X.com</b> days (a precursor to <b>PayPal</b>), and he sees Bitcoin as a candidate for creating a better standard of living for everyone around the world and providing more power to the individual. The Tesla CEO also discussed the importance of non-custodial wallets over leaving funds on exchanges, as the latter misses the point of why Bitcoin was created in the first place. In terms of empowering his own companies, Musk made it clear that holding BTC is definitely more attractive than holding cash in some European bank accounts due to the negative interest rate policies that have been adopted on the continent and is affecting Tesla directly.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="dorsey:-bitcoin-changes-everything">Dorsey: Bitcoin changes everything</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>For Dorsey, BTC is a potential native currency for the internet that could eventually change the world. The Twitter CEO was explicit about the influence the cypherpunks have had on his thinking.</p><p>&#8220;[Bitcoin] is deeply principled,&#8221; said Dorsey. &#8220;It&#8217;s weird as hell. It&#8217;s always evolving. And it just reminded me of the internet when I was a kid. I encountered alt.cypherpunks when I was fairly young. This was a topic of discussion for years. I didn&#8217;t touch it until 2008 when we started Square.&#8221;</p><p>Echoing some of what Musk had said, Dorsey shared that he encountered a &#8220;predatory&#8221; and &#8220;obtuse&#8221; financial system when he originally started Square. In his view, Bitcoin provides an opportunity to build something completely new from the ground up rather than trying to build around the existing system.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;[The traditional financial systems] just are not relevant to today, and they&#8217;re certainly not relevant to the future, especially when you consider the entire world and countries like Nigeria, Ghana, or India and [their] interconnection with countries like the United States, Canada, and all over Europe,&#8221; explained Dorsey.</p></blockquote><p>The Square CEO also offered specific examples of the kinds of issues he sees with the legacy financial system, such as the problems a woman in Ethiopia faced when she was first trying to build out the local equivalent of the ride-sharing app <b>Lyft</b>.</p><p>&#8220;She still has to take paper, fiat cash from her passengers and pay all of her drivers in the same way because there&#8217;s no monetary system that she can utilize,&#8221; said Dorsey. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing digital.&#8221;</p><p>Dorsey also covered the high costs of transferring money between African nations, with the 10% to 30% costs of transfers made from Ghana to Nigeria as a specific example. Additionally, Dorsey claims the advertising-based profit model that social media platforms like <b>Facebook</b>, Twitter, and <b>YouTube</b> are built around today would not exist if Bitcoin had been invented prior to the development of these platforms.</p><p>It&#8217;s clear that, at least for Dorsey, Bitcoin is much more than an investment, and it&#8217;s something special and unique that those who use it should help protect and develop.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Having sound <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/imagine-separation-of-money-and-state-6-crypto-experts-weigh-4773.htm">money that is separate from the state</a> is the idea,&#8221; said Dorsey.</p></blockquote><p>&#8220;My hope is that it creates world peace or helps create world peace,&#8221; Dorsey added later in the discussion. &#8220;Elon said it earlier, we have all of these monopolies on violence and the individual doesn&#8217;t have power . . . It may sound a little bit ridiculous, but you fix that foundational level and everything above it improves in such a dramatic way. It&#8217;s going to be long term, but my hope is definitely peace.&#8221;</p><p>These comments from Dorsey will sound extremely familiar to anyone who has heard the &#8220;fix the money, fix the world&#8221; meme around Bitcoin.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="wood:-bitcoin-is-the-best-money-for-esg">Wood: Bitcoin is the best money for ESG</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Wood talked about the ability for Bitcoin to change the world in the context of the movement found within many traditional institutions regarding how companies impact various social causes, which is commonly referred to as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/traditional-investors-sending-an-esg-sign-important-to-bitco-10746.htm">ESG</a> (environment, social, and governance).</p><p>The potential environmental impact of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/a-closer-look-at-the-environmental-impact-of-bitcoin-mining-9869.htm">Bitcoin&#8217;s use of proof-of-work</a> was heavily discussed throughout the event, with the general consensus being that it would make sense for Bitcoin to eventually be mostly-powered by renewable sources of energy. And again, Musk indicated that Tesla is likely to start accepting Bitcoin payments again in the near future due to his perception that Bitcoin&#8217;s negative environmental impact has decreased in the past few months.</p><blockquote><p>To this point, Wood stated, &#8220;I really do believe that Bitcoin will be much more environmentally friendly, certainly than traditional gold mining or the traditional financial services sector. In many ways, it already is, and it&#8217;s just going to get better that way.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>While Wood indicated that many institutions think of things like diversity and pay equity when it comes to the social impact of various companies, she also pointed out that she thinks about this aspect of ESG a bit differently when it comes to disruptive technologies like Bitcoin. Much like Dorsey, Wood pointed to statistics related to the reduction of friction in global payments, such as the heavy reliance on remittances in places like Tonga and El Salvador, as a social responsibility aspect of the Bitcoin phenomenon. Wood also pointed to the 4.3 billion people living under authoritarian regimes and 1.3 billion people living under double-digit or greater levels of inflation as other areas where Bitcoin can enable economic empowerment. Wood also pointed to the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/gladstein">Alex Gladstein</a> of the <b>Human Rights Foundation</b> for those who seek more information on this topic.</p><p>&#8220;Saving them from the destruction of their purchasing power certainly is a noble social goal,&#8221; added Wood. &#8220;We expand social to be much more than the traditional ESG community.&#8221;</p><p>In terms of governance, Wood pointed to the openness and transparency of the entire ecosystem around Bitcoin. &#8220;It&#8217;s completely transparent, unlike the opaqueness of financial systems and the toll takers in the traditional financial world,&#8221; said Wood.</p><p>The CEO of Ark Invest also shared how she became more familiar with the transparency of Bitcoin through conversations with various contributors to Bitcoin Core.</p><p>&#8220;In terms of talking to them about economics, economic theory, [and] failed monetary regimes historically, they know economic history, many of them, better than anyone I&#8217;ve ever met,&#8221; Wood said of the Bitcoin development community. </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;So, that gives me a great degree of confidence that they do believe they&#8217;re on a noble mission. They could be getting paid a lot more than they&#8217;re being paid right now if they worked at Google or Facebook or some of these other areas, but they&#8217;ve chosen this sense of purpose for a noble goal . . . It gives me a great deal of comfort as I think about the governance of the ecosystem, much more so than I think we would find in other financial ecosystems.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>It is notable that Wood spent time to share her understanding of the Bitcoin development community, as that brings us back to a direct connection to the core ethos of &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBuns9Evn1w-T2RwqMhUnTZbTTe-M-g42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cypherpunks write code</a>&#8221; that underpinned much of Wednesday&#8217;s discussion.<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a new cryptocurrency in the works that has the backing of some of the biggest names in tech. <b>Worldcoin</b> is the startup behind the upcoming crypto project, and the founding team includes the former head of the Silicon Valley business incubator <b>Y Combinator</b>, Sam Altman. Additionally, the list of investors behind the project includes <b>Andreessen Horowitz</b>, <b>LinkedIn</b> founder Reid Hoffman, and the venture arm of <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinbase</a></b>.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60d/e03c94b8d7.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60d/e03c94b8d7.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/60d/e03c94b8d7.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/60d/e03c94b8d7.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/60d/e03c94b8d7.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/60d/e03c94b8d7.jpg 1227w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/negroscuro</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/sam-altman-s-worldcoin-will-give-free-crypto-for-eyeball-scans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to comments made to Bloomberg, Altman&#8217;s involvement in Worldcoin stems from his more general interest in universal basic income (UBI) and the future of wealth redistribution. The basic premise, at least based on what we know so far, is to create a new cryptocurrency from scratch that gives coins to every single human on earth (if they want them). To help guard against fraud in the initial distribution of coins (and perhaps other aspects of the cryptocurrency network), Worldcoin wants to use an iris-scanning hardware device to confirm that each user is a unique person.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="the-case-for-worldcoin">The case for Worldcoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So, what&#8217;s the case for Worldcoin&#8217;s upcoming cryptocurrency? Angel investor and podcaster Jason Calacanis shared his thoughts on the topic during Tuesday&#8217;s <a href="https://thisweekinstartups.com/sam-altmans-worldcoin-facebook-hits-1t-alchemys-nikil-viswanathan-on-aws-for-blockchain-e1238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edition</a> of <i>This Week in Startups</i>. In his remarks, Calacanis covered some of the issues he sees with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and how Worldcoin&#8217;s eventual offering may be able to bring some improvements.</p><p>&#8220;Right now Bitcoin is so toxic and feels like a multi-level [marketing] scam because you have FOMO (the fear of missing out) because you know somebody like myself who bought in for under USD 100,&#8221; said Calacanis. &#8220;And everybody has to convince the next group of bagholders or participants (depending on how you want to frame the crypto project); you have to convince them to buy in. And you have to take this leap of faith, and it starts to feel like a Madoff Ponzi scheme where the new people coming in are doing it for the benefit of the people who got in early and that is scary.&#8221;</p><p>Calacanis went on to point to the bear market following the then all-time high bitcoin price of nearly USD 20,000 in December 2017 and the more recent drop from the all-time high of roughly USD 65,000 hit in April of this year as further examples of how Bitcoin can, in his view, be toxic and scary. While Calacanis pointed out there are a number of different ways in which Worldcoin could fail to achieve their goals, he also sees the potential for the startup to create a serious competitor to BTC.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;This seems to me to be a way to restart the crypto ecosystem with a level playing field,&#8221; said Calacanis. &#8220;The game will be started anew. Just like when a new social network comes out, there are a group of people who get to take the top slots in that social network . . . Every time a new social network emerges, some group of popular people get some of the top slots, but some of the top slots open up for new inventory . . . Every new medium gives a chance for the top 100 [or] top 1,000 to be resorted, if you will. And that is really exciting. The new medium here is a cryptocurrency.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Calacanis pointed to <b>Clubhouse</b>, a social network based on voice, as the most recent example of new people gaining status by being early adopters of a new social media platform.</p><p>&#8220;This, to me, seems like a brilliant idea, and I will be watching this like a hawk,&#8221; Calacanis continued. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve always said that a better project will come along that could challenge the other projects. This happens in every technology. For some reason, the Bitcoin people in their toxicity, in their multi-level marketing, you know, worst moments are saying there will never be a replacement for Bitcoin . . . The fact that they don&#8217;t believe there could ever be another [cryptocurrency] is proof of how they are part of this multi-level marketing cult.&#8221;</p><p>Near the end of his Worldcoin segment, Calacanis put the chances of Worldcoin taking the wind out of Bitcoin&#8217;s sails at anywhere from one in a thousand to one in a million. However, this was seemingly more of an on-the-spot, throwaway line than a serious, thought-out prediction.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="those-who-dont-know-bitcoin-history-are-destined-to-repeat-it">Those who don&#8217;t know Bitcoin history are destined to repeat it</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>I strongly disagree with Calacanis&#8217;s criticisms of Bitcoin, but I&#8217;d like to keep the focus on the supposed value proposition of Worldcoin. Needless to say, Calacanis is free to sell his BTC if holding it is too scary for him. </p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s possible that Calacanis is mistaking the conviction in predictions made by some Bitcoin users as toxicity. Maybe these Bitcoin users simply know something Calacanis does not know.</p></blockquote><p>For example, there have been many cryptocurrency projects over the years that have attempted to do something similar to what Worldcoin seemingly intends to do. Calacanis mentioned <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/stellar/">Stellar (XML)</a> as another crypto project that tried to distribute their coins &#8220;fairly&#8221; to a large number of people. Indeed, Stellar lumens have been distributed for free via a variety of methods, including two of the largest cryptoasset companies in the world: <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain-com/">Blockchain.com</a></b> and Coinbase. </p><p>In the case of Coinbase, users were able to receive some free lumens after reading pro-Stellar propaganda via the Coinbase Earn program. In the case of Blockchain.com, users who went through an identity verification process were able to receive USD 25 worth of lumens. At the time, in 2018, I <a href="https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/11/Why-Blockchains-Million-Stellar-Airdrop-is-Bad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about how this deal was good for Blockchain.com growing their userbase but not necessarily a smart move on the Stellar project&#8217;s end. Stellar lumens are down 82.5% against bitcoin in the roughly two-and-a-half years since my post on the topic was published. (<b>Learn more:</b> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stellar-s-free-xlm-either-unclaimed-or-exchanged-for-other-c-4721.htm">Stellar&rsquo;s Free XLM Either Unclaimed or Exchanged for Other</a>) </p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/auroracoin/">Auroracoin (AUR)</a> is perhaps an even better direct comparison to what Worldcoin plans to do. In 2014, the idea with Auroracoin was that half of the supply would be distributed to the citizens of Iceland. Instead of a device that scanned people&#8217;s irises, Auroracoin used a national ID system to guard against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sybil attacks</a>. It was basically the Worldcoin concept restricted to the country of Iceland. It should be obvious that Auroracoin failed to achieve its goals because you&#8217;ve likely never heard of it. In other words, Auroracoin&#8217;s return against BTC is even worse than that of the aforementioned Stellar lumens.</p><p>As a funny aside, one of the other top altcoins around the time of Auroracoin was called, you guessed it, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/worldcoin/">Worldcoin (WDC)</a>.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/Truthcoin/status/1409941100421431300"></oembed></div><p>So, what were the key failures of the &#8220;fair&#8221; distribution programs tried out by Auroracoin and Stellar? </p><p>As I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305214844/https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/auroracoins-market-cap-highly-inflated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> in a post on Auroracoin seven years ago, the problem with handing out a cryptocurrency to everyone for free is that these people can do whatever they want with it once they own it. </p><p>What are most people going to do with a cryptocurrency they don&#8217;t understand or care about when it&#8217;s handed to them for free? Obviously, they&#8217;ll sell it for something else. They may even decide to exchange it for some bitcoin. <br>
After all, while BTC is still wildly volatile when compared to traditional fiat currencies, the reality is the cryptoasset is still much further along the process of becoming money than any of the altcoins. In many ways, the people who are given a cryptocurrecy for free instead of paying for it or earning it are basically the opposite of &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2018/01/24/heres-the-fundamental-bitcoin-valuation-metric-that-determines-the-cryptocurrencys-price-moves/?sh=75132b691b22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hodlers</a>.&#8221;</p><p>For more recent examples of the perils of giving away your cryptocurrency to others for free, see how blockchain-based social network <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitclout-investors-coinbase-blockchain-com-step-up-their-shi-10692.htm">BitClout</a></b> hands out their cryptocurrency to social media influencers and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>-based dog token <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/shib-shiba-inu/">shiba inu (SHIB)</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buterin-not-getting-tax-write-off-for-shib-india-covid-19-re-10365.htm">gifted a large amount</a> of their supply to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a>.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="central-banks-to-the-rescue?">Central banks to the rescue?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>If you&#8217;re a fan of UBI, you may be more likely to get your way via central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDCs</a>) than decentralized cryptocurrencies. After all, CBDCs need to compete with bitcoin somehow, and it&#8217;s unlikely to be in the area of censorship resistance. The only way the UBI &#8220;feature&#8221; makes sense is if it&#8217;s implemented via government decree, as the cryptocurrency market works on a completely free market basis. People aren&#8217;t going to adopt a new form of money in the free market just because it has the morals of UBI or &#8220;fair&#8221; distribution attached to it, especially when Bitcoin already solved the digital scarcity problem and has strong network effects built around it. But don&#8217;t worry, China already <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/face-recognition-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has</a> the dystopian biometrics figured out, so we may not need Worldcoin&#8217;s iris scanner. </p><p>Also, we&#8217;ll assume the investors in Worldcoin won&#8217;t be getting more than their &#8220;fair share&#8221; of the new currency for now, as that would go against the entire supposed value proposition of the project.</p><blockquote><p>In other words, <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/cypherpunk-manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cypherpunks write code</a>, but there also needs to be incentives for people to run that code. Bitcoin exploits the greed of the individual to incentivize adoption, which is a much stronger incentive than the morals of proposals like Auroracoin or whatever Worldcoin creates. </p></blockquote><p>Put differently, what Calacanis refers to as a &#8220;Madoff Ponzi scheme&#8221; is the real form of fair distribution. Those who are willing to take risks may also get rewards. This is how the world has always worked. People talk a big game and like to virtue signal when it comes to moral superiority, but at the end of the day, they tend to do <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/lebron-james-angers-hong-kong-protesters-with-free-speech-comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what&#8217;s best</a> for them as an individual. That&#8217;s why they choose Bitcoin.<br>

For one, 20% of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP) comes from remittances, according to the most recent data from the World Bank. </p><figure><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.DT.GD.ZS?locations=SV" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60d/808d5c0893.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60d/808d5c0893.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/60d/808d5c0893.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/60d/808d5c0893.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/60d/808d5c0893.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/60d/808d5c0893.png 801w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption>Source: data.worldbank.org</figcaption></figure><p>This means a large chunk of the population depends on money transfers from outside the country to make ends meet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_59hrgTiRJU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to <b>Strike</b> CEO Jack Mallers, the cost of a remittance from the United States to El Salvador can be up to 50% of the value of the transfer, in addition to the security and time-related costs of picking up the money at a physical location.</p><p>Secondly, El Salvador has an incentive to break their reliance upon the US dollar and embrace a neutral store of value for savings due to the fact that newly issued dollars tend to have diluted value by the time they reach the Central American country. This phenomenon is known as the <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/the-cantillion-effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cantillon Effect</a>. </p><blockquote><p>For example, the people of El Salvador did not receive any of the new money that was created to send out stimulus payments in the United States. </p></blockquote><p>By the time that money has reached El Salvador, inflation will have occurred. This setup is advantageous to Americans, but not so much for El Salvador.</p><p>Thirdly, roughly 70% of the population in El Salvador does not have a bank account, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57373058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according</a> to President Nayib Bukele. This limits access to the global financial system that has emerged on the internet and increases transactional friction in the economy.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="strike-and-the-lightning-network">Strike and the Lightning Network</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Strike can be summarized as a <b>Venmo</b> and <b>Cash App</b> alternative that is heavily integrated with Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network. A Strike user can instantly transfer value from the United States to El Salvador at little cost via the Lightning Network. While critics have pointed out that Strike users in El Salvador hold value in US dollars via stablecoins like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">tether (USDT)</a> rather than bitcoin, the reality is users can also send US dollars in their Strike account instantly to any Lightning Network invoice. In terms of the remittance use case, the key point is that bitcoin&#8217;s ability to act as digital cash is what enables the instant and free transfer of money from the United States to El Salvador. With Strike, those receiving remittances in El Salvador can choose to receive US dollars in the form of a stablecoin (although the use of Tether is now <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/el-salvador-the-whole-story#notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being phased out</a>) or receive bitcoin directly into their own Lightning Network-enabled wallet such as the one developed by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-beach-provides-clues-about-el-salvador-s-greater-btc-10652.htm">Bitcoin Beach</a> community.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1408124456183156752"></oembed></div><p>In a situation where non-KYC (know your customer) stablecoins, which are coming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/experts-warn-of-tighter-policing-ahead-for-stablecoins-10286.htm">under increased scrutiny</a>, are regulated out of existence, the improvements to remittances to El Salvador made possible by bitcoin could be greatly enhanced through the development of a circular economy around the cryptocurrency. However, even in that scenario, those who wish to hedge against bitcoin&#8217;s volatility could do so via technology like Discreet Log Contracts (<a href="https://dci.mit.edu/smart-contracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLCs</a>), which would effectively allow users to short bitcoin and long the US dollar in their Bitcoin wallet at the click of a button. However, these hedging contracts can also turn out to be somewhat costly, as there needs to be someone willing to take the other side of the trade.</p><p>A key criticism of the Lightning Network from those who are either bearish on bitcoin or advocate for a specific altcoin focused on low-value payments is that some of the most popular Lightning Network-enabled wallets are custodial. This is due to the fact that a custodial setup creates a much more user-friendly experience. Indeed, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.galoyapp&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Beach Wallet</a> works on a system of &#8220;shared custody&#8221; where every user&#8217;s bitcoins are really in the hands of trusted members of the Bitcoin Beach community rather than each user having full sovereignty over their own funds.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/nicolasburtey/status/1406177526699941889"></oembed></div><blockquote><p>Of course, anyone can still use whatever Bitcoin wallet they want, and there are plenty of non-custodial Lightning Network-enabled options available too. </p></blockquote><p>Additionally, potential future improvements to the Bitcoin protocol, such as <a href="https://anyprevout.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT</a>, could help make these non-custodial wallets more attractive to end-users. El Salvador&#8217;s embrace of bitcoin should create plenty of opportunities to experiment with different trust models for Lightning-enabled Bitcoin wallets. However, those who want a higher degree of financial sovereignty will need to be willing to pay for it, at least for now.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="liquid-and-rsk">Liquid and RSK</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While the Lightning Network gets most of the attention, it is not the only layer-two Bitcoin network that exists today. </p><p>The <a href="https://liquid.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liquid</a> federated sidechain is another alternative to using the base blockchain that makes different tradeoffs, and there may be a role for Liquid to play in El Salvador. Specifically, <b>Blockstream</b> has <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/1401284186590355463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> how Liquid could help modernize El Salvador&#8217;s financial market. According to Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow, it&#8217;s also possible stablecoins closely tied to the traditional banking system, such as tether and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/">USD coin (USDC)</a>, could see a new competitor emerge in the form of a bitcoin-backed stablecoin issued on Liquid. While still centralized and trusted, this alternative stablecoin model would potentially have the added benefits of improved transparency and security of reserves.</p><p>Another Bitcoin sidechain that has seen <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/rsk-is-bitcoin-s-fastest-growing-layer-not-liquid-nor-lightn-10412.htm">tremendous growth in 2021</a> is <a href="https://www.rsk.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSK</a>, which is compatible with smart contracts created for use on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> network but uses a BTC-pegged token for gas payments rather than ETH. Two of the most popular applications on RSK today are <a href="https://sovryn.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sovryn</a> and <a href="https://moneyonchain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Money on Chain</a>. Money on Chain&#8217;s Dollar on Chain (DOC) token may be of particular interest in El Salvador, as it&#8217;s a somewhat decentralized, bitcoin-backed stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The people of El Salvador will be the world&#8217;s beta testers of Bitcoin&#8217;s usability for commerce and finance- decentralized or otherwise,&#8221; pseudonymous Sovryn contributor Ingalandia told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p></blockquote><p>&#8220;Because it is a country with a majority of its people unbanked, Bitcoin applications such as Sovryn could be their first experience of secure savings accounts. Once they experience interest-earning by lending an appreciating asset, the gears will really start to turn.&#8221;</p><p>It should also be noted that, much like the Lightning Network, simple bitcoin payments made via Liquid and RSK are also cheaper than on-chain transactions.</p><p>There is still plenty of work to do when it comes to improving the privacy, scalability, censorship resistance, and interoperability of the Lightning Network, Liquid, and RSK; however, El Salvador has created a useful environment to see just how valuable these layer-two systems can be as the world continues its march towards a bitcoin standard. The entire country of El Salvador is not going to switch from dollars to bitcoin overnight, so it&#8217;s useful to remember that just because these projects are not perfect today does not mean they can&#8217;t provide tremendous value over the long term.<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been a number of different privacy improvements over the years, and more are on the way in 2021.
There are new innovations and a variety of layer-two protocols that could offer improvements over the popular CoinJoin model.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60b/1232d61b8d.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/60b/1232d61b8d.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/60b/1232d61b8d.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/60b/1232d61b8d.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/60b/1232d61b8d.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/60b/1232d61b8d.jpg 1213w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/Kevin McGovern</figcaption></figure><p>Privacy is a bit of a complicated topic in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>. While the mainstream media have often referred to the cryptoasset as a form of anonymous currency for the internet, the reality is that every Bitcoin transaction made on the base blockchain layer is completely public and stored on thousands of computers around the world. </p><p>While there are no real-world identities that must be tied to the pseudonymous addresses used in the Bitcoin system, the reality is that blockchain analysis firms like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chainalysis-valued-at-usd-2b-as-investors-see-demand-crypto-9697.htm"><b>Chainalysis</b></a> are able to figure out most of the identities behind Bitcoin transactions through on-chain analysis and collaborations with various crypto custodians. This ability for surveillance companies to figure out what&rsquo;s really happening on the Bitcoin blockchain is an indication that there is still plenty of work to do when it comes to improving user privacy in the system.</p><p>That said, there have been a number of different privacy improvements made to Bitcoin over the years, and more are on the way in 2021. While <b>Wasabi Wallet</b> and <b>Samourai Wallet</b> are well-known options for using the Bitcoin network in a more privacy-conscious manner through the use of their <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinJoin</a> implementations, there are also new innovations like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-bitcoin-s-taproot-nears-ex-cia-director-s-paper-raises-pr-9916.htm">Taproot</a>, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinSwap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinSwap</a>, and a variety of layer-two protocols that could offer improvements over the popular CoinJoin model. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the state of Bitcoin privacy in 2021 and where things are headed.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="a-better-foundation-with-taproot">A better foundation with Taproot</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Of course, the biggest story for Bitcoin in 2021 at a technical level is the Taproot soft fork. This Bitcoin improvement is actually a combination of three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) in the form of <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taproot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tapscript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schnorr signatures</a>. These technical changes contain a number of benefits for Bitcoin, most notably in the areas of privacy and smart contracts.</p><p>In terms of privacy, a key benefit of Schnorr signatures is that it enables the aggregation of signatures used on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/a-bitcoin-multisig-primer-how-does-it-work-what-you-need-to-8293.htm">multi-signature transactions</a>. Instead of multiple signatures being added to the blockchain whenever a transaction is sent from a multisig address, all of the associated signatures are aggregated into one. This means that multisig transactions, whether they be a 2-of-3 multisig spend or the opening of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a> channel, can be made to look no different than a simple, single-signature Bitcoin transaction. It should be noted that the average Bitcoin user with a single-signature address also benefits from this setup, as it&rsquo;s now unclear if their transactions are simple Bitcoin spends or something much more complex.</p><blockquote><p>In the long run, it will be beneficial to move all of the different types of on-chain Bitcoin transactions to a single anonymity set; however, it should be noted that, at least over the near term, Taproot may actually reduce privacy, as it is creating a new transaction type that will further split the anonymity sets found with Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.</p></blockquote><p>While Taproot is seen as a positive development for Bitcoin privacy overall, it doesn&rsquo;t have many implications for the CoinJoin-focused software that is widely deployed and used today. </p><p>According to <b>Bitcoin Teleport</b> and <b>JoinMarket</b> developer Chris Belcher, there aren&rsquo;t any benefits of Taproot to CoinJoin-enabled Bitcoin software like Samourai Wallet, Wasabi Wallet, and JoinMarket outside of lowering the overall load on the network via faster transaction verification. However, Taproot is a bit more helpful for a specific Bitcoin privacy protocol that has been implemented in JoinMarket, known as <a href="https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/2c13fb5819bd469ca318156e2cf25d79" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SNICKER</a>.</p><p>Taproot is also not much of a priority for the developers behind Samourai Wallet and Wasabi Wallet. According to pseudonymous Samourai Wallet developer TDevD, <a href="https://www.samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whirlpool</a> continues to be the main focus, and the CoinJoin implementation was recently opened up to denominations of 100,000 satoshis (USD 39). On top of that, Samourai Wallet is working on improvements to their <a href="https://support.samourai.io/section/44-cahoots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cahoots</a>-style transactions and the integration of an <a href="https://github.com/OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject/rfc/blob/master/obpp-05.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgraded version</a> of reusable payments codes.</p><p>According to Wasabi Wallet inventor Adam Fiscor, Taproot is not especially useful for that piece of software, so it isn&rsquo;t a focus right now. Instead, the wallet is focused on the transition from version 1.0 to version 2.0. Fiscor <a href="https://twitter.com/nopara73/status/1371069113020395520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined</a> the differences between these two versions of Wasabi Wallet in a tweet thread back in March. In summary, the intent with Wasabi Wallet 2.0 is to make the software faster and cheaper with a better user interface.</p><p>It should be remembered that Taproot can also be seen as a building block for a future improvement that would be beneficial for CoinJoin in the form of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ibcnsv/taproot_coinjoins_and_crossinput_signature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-input key aggregation</a>. This would allow for all of the inputs in a CoinJoin transaction to be aggregated into a single signature, thus lowering the overall cost of a CoinJoin transaction for all users involved in them. In fact, a Bitcoin user&rsquo;s involvement in a collaborative CoinJoin transaction would have a lower cost than an on-chain, single-signature transaction in a situation where cross-input signature aggregation were enabled on the network.</p><blockquote><p>Although Taproot isn&rsquo;t immediately relevant to the commonly-used Bitcoin privacy wallets of today, it&rsquo;s still a foundational change to the Bitcoin network that can be helpful with privacy overall and enable further improvements in the future. </p></blockquote><p>While it&rsquo;s important to remember that this change has not yet been locked in on the Bitcoin network, indications are that more than the necessary 90% of the network hashrate is ready to activate the change later this year.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="coinswap">CoinSwap</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While CoinJoin is still the standard option for pushing back against adversaries tracking the movement of funds across the Bitcoin network, Belcher has moved on to an alternative method for improving Bitcoin privacy in the form of CoinSwap, which was originally described by former <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockstream/">Blockstream</a></b> Chief Technology Officer Greg Maxwell in a 2013 Bitcointalk <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321228.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>. Belcher&rsquo;s work in this area has been funded by two separate grants from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/square-crypto-remains-open-despite-strong-focus-on-bitcoin-4346.htm">Square Crypto</a> and the <b>Human Rights Foundation</b>.</p><p>A key issue with CoinJoin transactions today is that they stand out like a sore thumb to anyone who is looking at the Bitcoin blockchain. This issue is not theoretical, as some bitcoin custodians, <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1234531935038341120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as</a> <b>BlockFi</b>, have already implemented policies that are unkind to CoinJoin users. It&rsquo;s also possible that CoinJoin transactions could be censored by miners on the Bitcoin network itself. </p><p>For example, <b>Marathon Digital Holdings</b> is a new mining pool that is intended to be fully compliant with US financial regulations and has already <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1239/marathon-digital-holdings-becomes-the-first-north-american" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censored</a> some transactions. Of course, these transactions are only censored in blocks mined by Marathon Digital Holdings. Other miners are still free to include the transactions in their blocks, and it would take the cooperation of <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Majority_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51%</a> of the miners to censor Bitcoin transactions at the network level.</p><blockquote><p>The major innovation with CoinSwap is that it breaks the assumption that a blockchain observer can track the movement of coins simply by looking at the blockchain.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>When constructed properly, multiple Bitcoin users are effectively able to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atomically</a> swap the transaction histories of their coins via a CoinSwap. Additionally, a blockchain observer cannot tell the difference between a normal Bitcoin transaction and a CoinSwap. This means that normal users who are not even interested in doing a CoinSwap also benefit, as it&rsquo;s possible that their normal-looking transaction is actually a CoinSwap.</p><p>According to Belcher, the other advantage of CoinSwap over CoinJoin is that the former uses less block space. While the current, work-in-progress implementation of CoinSwap, known as Bitcoin Teleport, does not use Taproot, there are also a few slightly beneficial <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lm6nmk/another_coinswap_milestone_multihop_coinswaps/govggtr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes</a> that can be made to the system once that improvement has been activated on the Bitcoin network. In Belcher&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_belcher_/status/1374810307143610369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opinion</a>, users of JoinMarket (and other CoinJoin projects) will move over to Bitcoin Teleport once the software is further developed, but he also admits that it will ultimately be up to the market to decide what&rsquo;s most useful. Specifically, Belcher said that some users may prefer to use CoinJoin in situations where it is desirable to publicly prove that a UTXO&rsquo;s (unspent transaction output&rsquo;s) transaction history has been broken.</p><p>For Samourai Wallet, CoinSwap is viewed more as an additional feature rather than a replacement for CoinJoin.</p><p>&ldquo;We have tested CoinSwap and have concluded that its use with unmixed UTXOs is of little interest,&rdquo; TDevD told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. &ldquo;In fact, it presents some real risks for the user being handed a UTXO resulting from what might be considered a problematic history. As such, CoinSwap is more suited to post-mix spending and will find a place along side our other post-mix spending tools.&rdquo;</p><p>Although there have been plenty of flame wars between the Samourai and Wasabi camps on social media, it appears they mostly agree when it comes to combining CoinJoin and CoinSwap together.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;CoinSwaps can provide better privacy after widespread Taproot adoption, but CoinJoins are cheaper and faster,&rdquo; said Fiscor. &ldquo;I&#8217;d speculate the privacy Wasabi CoinJoins can provide is more than sufficient for anybody, but it&#8217;s also possible that there&#8217;s a strong market niche for CoinSwaps. The combination seems to be more interesting though: CoinSwaps to and from CoinJoins, which could make low anonymity set CoinJoins getting as much privacy as a CoinSwapper would.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 data-param="1" id="mercury-wallet">Mercury Wallet</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><b>CommerceBlock</b>&rsquo;s <a href="https://mercurywallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury Wallet</a> is a new bitcoin wallet offering that combines the concept of CoinSwap with a layer-two Bitcoin technology known as Statechains. The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/statechains-sending-keys-not-coins-to-scale-bitcoin-off-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idea</a> behind Statechains is that users are able to transfer ownership of UTXOs without touching the base Bitcoin blockchain. This enables the instant, free transfer of UTXOs on a layer above the base Bitcoin network. Additionally, the statecoins, which are one-to-one pegged with bitcoin, issued on a Statechain can be swapped between users to improve privacy. This is the specific functionality that has been built into Mercury Wallet.</p><p>While a key downside of Statechains is that users must transfer full UTXOs and cannot split them into smaller amounts, this issue may be less relevant to those who just want to mix their coins. The idea with Mercury Wallet is that users can swap their coins in an off-chain environment, which means the fees on these swaps can be effectively zero and could lead to much larger anonymity sets than what is found with a single on-chain CoinJoin today. However, since only full UTXOs can be swapped via this method, it means real-world transactions are likely to be made via a different mechanism.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think Statechains aren&rsquo;t that useful because they lose the divisibility of the coin,&rdquo; said Belcher. &ldquo;Divisibility is a very important property of money just like fungibility. But maybe the tradeoff will be worth it in the end, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>According to CommerceBlock CEO Nicholas Gregory, Schnorr signatures would be helpful for Mercury Wallet&rsquo;s implementation of Statechains. &ldquo;The Schnorr implementation that comes with Taproot would help us a lot because we are able to add more Statechain entity signing keys, [which is] something we can&#8217;t do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECDSA</a>. Schnorr scales very well here.&rdquo;</p><p>In other words, Schnorr signatures improve the security of Statechains because they effectively enable a multisig setup for the entity behind a Statechain, which could be split up into multiple keys to improve security or federate control over the platform.	</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoins-layer-2-vs-monero">Bitcoin&rsquo;s Layer-2 vs Monero</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Of course, Mercury Wallet&rsquo;s Statechain implementation is just one example of a secondary-layer Bitcoin technology. Other examples include the Lightning Network, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/is-liquid-sidechain-a-path-for-better-bitcoin-privacy-6395.htm">Liquid</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/rsk-is-bitcoin-s-fastest-growing-layer-not-liquid-nor-lightn-10412.htm">RSK</a>. These additional layers built on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain come with different tradeoffs in terms of features and trust. For example, Fiscor and TDevD have both <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/is-liquid-sidechain-a-path-for-better-bitcoin-privacy-6395.htm">criticized</a> the federated setup found in the Liquid sidechain.</p><p>While the security models of sidechains and other upper-layer Bitcoin networks can be debated, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that these other networks can be a method of enabling more private BTC activity. The Lightning Network has obvious privacy benefits, as transactions are processed by fewer parties (as low as two when directly connected) rather than via the public blockchain. Liquid already has Confidential Transactions, which would be even more powerful when combined with a compatible CoinJoin implementation. That said, these systems would also benefit from privacy improvements made at Bitcoin&rsquo;s base layer, as they still use the blockchain for final settlement.</p><p>In addition to various other layers built on top of the Bitcoin network, there are also a number of privacy-focused altcoins that exist, and for Samourai Wallet, one of these altcoins, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/monero/">Monero (XMR)</a>, is preferable to building on Bitcoin&rsquo;s secondary layers.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lightning [Network] privacy, or the lack thereof, is now better understood and Liquid&#8217;s custodial tradeoffs and weak Confidential Transactions implementation are non-starters for use as a privacy layer,&rdquo; TDevD told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>&ldquo;Given their tradeoffs, existing L2 services will not be considered by Samourai Wallet for providing serious privacy enhancements. This is why we prefer to leverage the base protocol of Monero and explore how it can be used as a privacy L2 for certain Bitcoin applications. XMR-BTC atomic swaps are non-custodial, censorship resistant, permissionless and respond to specific needs on both chains. We have identified specific applications for adoption of XMR-BTC atomic swaps and are prioritizing their development.&rdquo;</p><p>Monero is perhaps the only altcoin that is sometimes given a pass by some of the more adamant Bitcoin maximalists who do not see a need for additional cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin, and Samourai Wallet is taking this acceptance of Monero to another level. The bitcoin wallet provider recently <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1388095210912092160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made</a> a financial contribution to <b>Haveno</b>, which is a Monero-integrated <a href="https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fork</a> of decentralized bitcoin exchange <b>Bisq</b>. However, according to TDevD, Samourai Wallet itself will remain a BTC-only wallet solution, and users will need to use a separate wallet for handling Monero.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blind maximalism has bet the farm on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/gg0wxg/what_is_ngu_technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NgU</a> [Number Go Up] and thrown privacy under the bus,&rdquo; said TDevD. &ldquo;We will continue to work on identifying and solving problems for Bitcoin users who need to transact privately on-chain without shortcuts that are not so much tradeoffs as unacceptable compromises.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Of course, an obvious downside of using Monero rather than a second-layer Bitcoin protocol is that users are subject to the increased volatility of the XMR cryptocurrency as long as they are using it as a mechanism to improve financial privacy.</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s improvements to privacy at the base blockchain layer, new possibilities on layer-two networks, or tighter integrations with Monero, it&rsquo;s clear there is plenty of work being done on improving privacy for all Bitcoin users. The exact way in which Bitcoin will become more private is still a bit unclear, but there are a large number of different building blocks currently in development that can be combined together in a way that limits the amount of information available for the entire world to track and analyze on the public blockchain.</p><p>____</p><p><b>Learn more:</b> <br>

This means that any smart contract built for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> can be copied and made to work on RSK. </p><p>As a sidechain to Bitcoin, the native token of RSK, which is known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/rootstock/">RBTC</a>, is pegged to bitcoin on a one-to-one basis. This means that users are effectively using bitcoin to pay for gas on the RSK network rather than a new token like ETH, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tron/">tron (TRX)</a>, or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">binance coin (BNB)</a>.</p><p>RSK uses a combination of a federation of bitcoin companies and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHA-256</a> miners who are already mining bitcoin to secure the two-way peg with Bitcoin&rsquo;s base blockchain and the RSK blockchain itself. This current setup, which is known as the <a href="https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/building-the-most-secure-permissionless-and-uncensorable-bitcoin-peg-b5dc7020e5ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powpeg</a>, is about as low trust as a Bitcoin sidechain can be without the introduction of new, soft-forking improvements to the base Bitcoin protocol.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="comparing-growth-on-bitcoins-layer-2-networks">Comparing growth on Bitcoin&rsquo;s Layer-2 networks</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>At the time of this writing, there is BTC 2,913 pegged into Liquid, BTC 1,638  pegged into RSK, and a total capacity of BTC 1,291 in public Lightning Network channels. </p><p>It should be noted that the real amount of BTC held in Lightning channels is difficult to estimate, as private channels can be opened that are harder to track. <a href="https://twitter.com/joaodealmeida_/status/1185498772366708739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Past estimates</a> have indicated as much as 41% of the BTC held in Lightning channels could be in private channels, which would mean the real capacity of the Lightning Network would be closer to BTC 2,190.</p><p>If you look at the past growth of each of these Bitcoin layer-two networks, most of the growth in the Lightning Network occurred in 2019, most of Liquid&rsquo;s growth occurred in 2020 (including surpassing public Lightning Network capacity), and the vast majority of RSK&rsquo;s growth has taken place in 2021.</p><p>Growth of the RSK Bitcoin sidechain took off in late March of this year, just as the RSK-based decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) platform <b>Sovryn</b> enabled incentives for providing liquidity to the platform. </p><p>There was less than BTC 600 pegged into RSK on March 23, and there has now been more than BTC 1,000 added to that total in less than two months. During this same time, BTC pegged into Liquid has only grown by roughly BTC 20 and public Lightning Network capacity has increased by around BTC 120.</p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s clear that RSK is growing faster than Liquid and the Lightning Network right now, but this could also just be a short term trend.</p></blockquote><p>For example, Liquid experienced a net increase of BTC 1,000 in March 2020, but the amount of new BTC pegged into the federated Bitcoin sidechain since then is less than BTC 1,000. Of course, the BTC/USD exchange rate has also increased substantially since that time.</p><p>It will be interesting to see if each of these three layer-two networks for Bitcoin continue to grow throughout the rest of the year, especially if transaction fees on the base Bitcoin blockchain <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#1y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue to rise</a>. </p><p>The difference in use cases between Liquid and the Lightning Network made it easy to predict that Liquid would overtake the Lightning Network over the short term, and a similar phenomenon could take place with RSK overtaking Liquid by the end of 2021.</p><p>Of course, there are a number of other blockchains with their own native cryptocurrencies that also act as quasi-layer-two options for Bitcoin. Examples of platforms that operate in this grey area between Bitcoin sidechain and completely separate, alternative chains include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/defi-on-binance-smart-chain-what-s-already-yielding-8645.htm">BSC</a>), and <b>Stacks</b>. </p><p>From this perspective, the most successful Bitcoin layer-two project by far is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/wrapped-bitcoin/">Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)</a> token on Ethereum, which is currently backed by BTC 173,221 that has been pegged into the system. </p><p>Of course, like many Ethereum-based projects, some shortcuts have been taken here, and the level of decentralization achieved with this layer-two system is not different than simply holding bitcoin on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinbase</a> or another crypto exchange. For this reason, it&rsquo;s questionable to classify it as a true layer-two network on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>Indeed, this point of contention is also found when comparing the Lightning Network to federated sidechains like Liquid and RSK, as Lightning users are able to retain a higher degree of control over their own coins. Although, the completely centralized custody model found with WBTC is harder to defend than the federated custody model found with current Bitcoin sidechains. </p><blockquote><p>That said, there is no reason WBTC couldn&rsquo;t become increasingly federated and reach levels of decentralization that is roughly the same as what&rsquo;s found with Liquid and RSK.</p></blockquote><p>____</p><p><b>Learn more:</b> <br>

And of course, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> has the original cryptocurrency meme in the form of &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo;.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/609/5840624954.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/609/5840624954.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/609/5840624954.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/609/5840624954.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/609/5840624954.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/609/5840624954.jpg 1230w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/surasak</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, a popular meme that has popped up in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> circles is the concept of ETH as &ldquo;ultrasound money&rdquo;. Due to an upcoming change to ETH&rsquo;s monetary policy, some ETH holders believe that the crypto asset can become even better than bitcoin at being money. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s dissect this Ethereum meme and see if it holds any basis in reality.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="what-is-the-basis-of-the-ultrasound-money-meme?">What is the basis of the ultrasound money meme?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The ultrasound money meme around ETH originated as a reaction to an upcoming change to the Ethereum network, known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-fees-to-stay-high-even-with-eip-1559-another-analys-9649.htm">EIP-1559</a>. Part of this alteration to the fee mechanics of the Ethereum network involves the underlying ETH asset&rsquo;s monetary policy. Once EIP-1559 is activated on the network, a portion of the ETH that is used to pay transaction fees will be burned, effectively removing that ETH from circulation forever.</p><p>The total amount of ETH that would be burned from transaction fees on a regular basis is a bit difficult to quantify, as the base fee on Ethereum transactions that will be burned after the activation of EIP-1559 will automatically adjust based on demand. Additionally, the number of transactions included in a new block (and the resource requirements of those transactions) can vary widely. That said, one calculation in October last year, found that nearly 1 million ETH would have been burned over the course of a year from October 2019 to October 2020 if EIP-1559 was already live. </p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1316726120469983235"></oembed></div><p>Based on this estimate, ETH will still be inflationary even after EIP-1559 is implemented, as roughly 5 million new ETH are currently created in new blocks on an annual basis (an annual inflation rate of around 4.5%).</p><p>Of course, EIP-1559 is not the only upcoming change to Ethereum. The network is also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/proof-of-disagreement-bitcoin-s-work-vs-ethereum-s-planned-s-9788.htm">expected</a> to change its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). The annual inflation rate is expected to drop from 4.5% to between 0.5% and 1% as a result of this change to PoS. When EIP-1559 is combined with the move to PoS, the ETH supply is estimated to decrease on a yearly basis, although the exact rate of supply reduction is, again, difficult to estimate due to the varying amount of ETH that could be burned on a regular basis via the transactions happening on the network.</p><p>This possibility of a monetary policy that gradually decreases the supply of ETH is the ultimate source of the ultrasound money meme. Bitcoin&rsquo;s current inflation rate is around 1.5% (and is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">cut in half</a> roughly every four years), so the idea is that, if bitcoin is supposed to be sound money, ETH should be considered ultrasound money because it will have a lower issuance rate.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="weakened-credibility">Weakened credibility</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So, do the upcoming changes to ETH&rsquo;s monetary policy mean that the crypto asset will become ultrasound money? No. Sure, with all things being equal and only comparing ETH to itself, these changes to the monetary policy can be seen as a positive move for the cryptocurrency. However, ETH does not exist in isolation.</p><p>The key reason that bitcoin has become increasingly trusted as a global, apolitical store of value over the years is not necessarily the specific inflation rate on the cryptocurrency network but rather the credibility of that monetary policy. </p><p>Bitcoin users trust that the monetary policy has been &ldquo;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1611#msg1611" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set in stone</a>&rdquo; and will not be changed for any reason in the future. The failure of the parties behind the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/New_York_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Agreement</a> to push through a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard-forking</a> change to Bitcoin&rsquo;s consensus rules is often cited as a key source of this credibility. </p><blockquote><p>With ETH&rsquo;s monetary policy being changed once again, the credibility that the policy won&rsquo;t change in the future is weakened. </p></blockquote><p>In terms of credibility and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindy effect</a>, ETH will effectively be 12 years behind bitcoin when EIP-1559 is activated on the network. Additionally, the credibility of ETH&rsquo;s monetary policy will be reset to zero yet again whenever the move to PoS happens.</p><p>The absurdity of the argument that simply a lower rate of inflation is all it takes to become ultrasound money can be easily debunked by imagining the creation of a new digital currency that reduces supply by 5% per year and is controlled by a single issuer in a Google Spreadsheet. </p><p>Obviously, there is much more to sound money than just the rate of new base money issuance. If you want a more concrete example, just look at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-chain-is-on-a-parabola-surpassing-ethereum-in-severa-10053.htm">Binance Smart Chain</a>&rsquo;s underlying token, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">BNB</a>. BNB already has a deflationary monetary policy where all of the coins that will ever exist have already been created and coins are burned on a regular basis. Does this make BNB super-duper ultrasound money? No, of course not.</p><p>Critics of this point of view will say that the social contract for ETH&rsquo;s monetary policy is to bring issuance down to the lowest rate possible while also maintaining a sufficient level of security. But even if you take this counterpoint at face value, this is an admission that ETH supply could increase if it is later found that more issuance than what is expected with the upcoming changes is needed to maintain security. ETH proponents also say that changes to the crypto asset&rsquo;s issuance rate have always been for the purpose of lowering the rate at which new coins are created, but this is simply not true (as indicated by the chart below).</p><figure><a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/assets/images/issuance_graph.png" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/609/57f9ac8a45.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/609/57f9ac8a45.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/609/57f9ac8a45.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/609/57f9ac8a45.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/609/57f9ac8a45.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/609/57f9ac8a45.png 1522w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The volatility of the Ethereum platform as a whole also trickles down to ETH as an asset, which weakens the utility of ETH as money. </p><blockquote><p>Money is meant to be a boring way to maintain savings in a safe and secure manner, and the &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo; philosophy adopted by Ethereum in contrast to Bitcoin is the opposite of stability. </p></blockquote><p>Everything about the Ethereum economy today is built around high-time preference, unsustainable, and speculative use cases that could be gone tomorrow. Whether you&rsquo;re talking about centralized stablecoins that could be outlawed with the stroke of a pen or yield farming initiatives that increase users&rsquo; returns in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications over the short term via the issuance of new crypto tokens with unclear value propositions, it appears that everything in Ethereum is meant to pump ETH and ERC-20 tokens over the short term and not worry about the side effect of building a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/the-ethereum-economy-is-a-house-of-cards-10162.htm">house of cards</a> rather than a sustainable, decentralized economy for the internet.</p><p>A specific example of the folly of ETH&rsquo;s pumponomics relevant to the upcoming changes to its monetary policy can be seen in the incentives for staking ETH for the purpose of participating in the Ethereum network&rsquo;s new PoS consensus mechanism. As <i>Bankless</i>&rsquo;s David Hoffman <a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ultra-sound-money-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> in an article last month, more transaction fees being paid on Ethereum should lead to more ETH being locked up to earn fees via staking, which takes more ETH off the market and effectively lowers the supply of ETH for sale. However, the opposite is also true! </p><p>If there is a massive decline in activity on Ethereum due to a regulatory crackdown on highly-centralized &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo; projects, increased competition from more centralized and efficient offerings like Binance Smart Chain, or some other reason, ETH that is staked should be unstaked (and possibly sold). The PoS mechanism itself brings additional volatility to the ETH asset, which makes it less useful as money.</p><p>When you live by the pumponomics, you also die by the pumponomics. This is simply not a solid foundation for emerging digital money, and in many ways, Ethereum is bringing the same problematic, short-term thinking found in the current fiat currency standard managed by bureaucrats to the cryptocurrency realm. </p><blockquote><p>In other words, Ethereum is reintroducing the very issues the adoption of a bitcoin standard is intended to solve.</p></blockquote><p>As a related side note, the issuance of many different types of assets on Ethereum, including competing forms of money, harms the utility of ETH as a decentralized medium of exchange. For example, the large amount of centralized stablecoin activity on the platform increases fees for those who are just trying to use ETH.</p><p>There are a few other potential reasons that the ultrasound money argument for ETH is itself not sound, but these basic points on their own illuminate the foundational problems with the narrative. John Light has gone into more detail in a direct <a href="https://lightco.in/2021/04/25/ultra-sound-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response</a> to the aforementioned piece from Hoffman, which is worth a read if you&rsquo;d like to explore this topic further.</p><p>In summary, it&rsquo;s quite possible that the changes being made to ETH&rsquo;s monetary policy will lead to a short-term pump in the ETH price, perhaps even when denominated in bitcoin. But these changes are also a continuation of the same sort of policies that make ETH less useful as sound money over the long term. If ETH does indeed outperform bitcoin as this bull market continues, you can be assured that it will also massively underperform BTC in the ensuing bear market, just like last time.<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In terms of the growth of various adoption metrics, such as active <a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/active-address" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addresses</a> and daily <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1384676842045681664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value</a> transferred, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> network has been killing it over the past year or so. Various applications in the area of decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) have been the main drivers behind this growth, as those new to the crypto asset space have been mystified by the yields that are possible with the emergence of these new platforms.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/609/1502198cf3.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/609/1502198cf3.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/609/1502198cf3.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/609/1502198cf3.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/609/1502198cf3.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/Syda Productions</figcaption></figure><p>But a lingering criticism around all of Ethereum&rsquo;s recent success is that all of this could be nothing more than a house of cards. First of all, there are a myriad of concerns around Ethereum at the base layer in terms of issues around centralization. Examples of this specific critique include: much of the activity on Ethereum is actually routed through a centralized entity known as <b>Infura</b>, it is becoming increasingly difficult to run an Ethereum full node as activity increases on the network, and there is an upcoming move to a completely different consensus mechanism in the form of proof-of-stake (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/ethereum-won-t-hide-from-quantum-computers-behind-pos-shield-10041.htm">PoS</a>).</p><p>On top of that, there are also risks at the application layer in terms of the reliance on centralized stablecoins, the use of developer backdoors in projects that are supposed to be decentralized and trustless, the Ponzinomics around many of the ERC-20 tokens issued on the platform, buggy smart contracts, questionable cryptoeconomics, DeFi <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/defi-governance-tokens-face-three-challenges-7959.htm">governance tokens</a> being centralized in the hands of a few entities, and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/understanding-oracles-in-the-blockchain-world-a-not-too-tech-7698.htm">oracle</a> problem, just to name a few.</p><p>To summarize, the criticism here is that the Ethereum community is effectively taking shortcuts to adoption that will eventually come back to haunt them when one or more of these Jenga pieces are removed and the Ethereum economy comes crashing down. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at some of the more unsustainable aspects of the Ethereum economy and see if there are any fundamental building blocks that could provide utility to users over the long term after all of the froth is removed.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="centralized-stablecoins-ponzi-games-and-defi">Centralized stablecoins, ponzi games, and &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://www.ethgasstation.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to ETHGasStation, two of the top four uses of the computing resources on the Ethereum network over the past 30 days (at least at the time of this writing) have been for transferring the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">USDT</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/">USDC</a> stablecoins, which are pegged to the value of the US dollar. The growth in the transfer volume of these sorts of centralized stablecoins on Ethereum is often cited as an illustration of the network&rsquo;s underlying value proposition, and many believe that the use of these stablecoins on the Ethereum network should lead to a higher ETH price. Indeed, the burning of ETH to pay for stablecoin transactions is a key tenet of the &ldquo;ultrasound money&rdquo; meme that has popped up in Ethereum circles recently.</p><p>However, there are at least two key, related risks associated with the heavy use of stablecoins on Ethereum. An obvious one is that government regulators or lawmakers may decide that they do not want people making pseudonymous transactions with US dollars over the internet. </p><blockquote><p>
</p><p>This would lead to a crisis of identity for Ethereum as a whole, as much of the platform&rsquo;s supposed benefits are built around the use of a variety of different assets and currencies rather than just ETH itself. </p></blockquote><p>For now, regulators may not be too worried about the use of stablecoins on Ethereum due to the serious privacy issues found with the network and other networks compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). </p><p>Companies like <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chainalysis-valued-at-usd-2b-as-investors-see-demand-crypto-9697.htm">Chainalysis</a></b> can likely help law enforcement identify the real-world users behind a pseudonymous Ethereum account with a stablecoin balance, so it&rsquo;s not like these stablecoins are making it easy to get away with doing illegal things with US dollars on the internet.</p><p>There are also risks to be explored in a situation where regulators do not clampdown on the use of stablecoins on public blockchains. After all, if these centralized coins have the approval of the regulators, then what is the utility of issuing them on public blockchains? The need for a public blockchain gets a bit murky when you&rsquo;re not looking for regulatory arbitrage, so more efficient competitors to Ethereum may be able to offer a cheaper service by adding even more centralization to the backend.</p><p>This has already started to play out a bit in the real world, as the USDT transaction volume on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tron/">Tron (TRX)</a> surpassed the stablecoin&rsquo;s volume on Ethereum in early April (though Ethereum has since regained a lead over Tron in this regard). Additionally, much of the Ponzi-esque activity on Ethereum has started to migrate to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-chain-is-on-a-parabola-surpassing-ethereum-in-severa-10053.htm">Binance Smart Chain</a>, where there are now more active addresses and transactions per day than what is found on Ethereum. There&rsquo;s also the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rsk-opens-bridge-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum-more-news-5718.htm">RSK</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-are-sidechains-2658.htm">sidechain</a> for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, which may be preferred by those who are interested in using bitcoin as their collateral and unit of account when operating in the DeFi world, as a separate token is not needed for gas payments.</p><p>As mentioned previously, USDT and USDC are two of the biggest gas guzzlers on the Ethereum network. But it&rsquo;s also important to note how important they are to the Ethereum economy as a whole. If you look at any of the popular DeFi applications on Ethereum, these centralized stablecoins account for a large percentage of the activity in those apps. </p><p>This is not some hidden data point at all, and it&rsquo;s viewable on the stats pages for the most popular DeFi apps including <b><a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pairs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniswap</a></b>, <b><a href="https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/recent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sushiswap</a></b>, <b><a href="https://compound.finance/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound</a></b>, and others. Obviously, another large chunk of the volume on DeFi exchanges is made up of outright Ponzi games, recent examples being <b>ELON</b> and <b>SHIB</b>, that cannot get listed on more centralized, regulatory-compliant exchanges.</p><p>To be clear, this heavy reliance upon centralized stablecoins and Ponzi games for adoption is found in all major DeFi apps on Ethereum. In fact, Curve Finance is effectively built entirely around this concept.</p><p>Outside of centralized stablecoins and explicit Ponzi games, there are some ERC-20 tokens that act more like traditional stocks by paying dividends to holders based on revenue generated by a specific DeFi application. But of course, these tokens are reliant upon centralized stablecoins and Ponzi games for generating much of their revenue. And what would the value of Uniswap, for example, be if there weren&rsquo;t any useful tokens to trade against ETH? </p><p>An additional risk with these &ldquo;DeFi stocks&rdquo; is that a new developer could come in and fork out the need to pay additional fees to the DeFi project instead of just the base fees that are required to send transactions on the base Ethereum network (as happened with the 0x protocol). Alternatively, a developer could copy a DeFi project&rsquo;s codebase and tweak it to create an improved, competing project without much effort (as occurred when Sushiswap forked Uniswap).</p><p>And why are people using these DeFi apps in the first place? It&rsquo;s due to the attractiveness of the high yields that can be generated on their stablecoins, ETH, and other ERC-20 tokens. </p><p>Where do these yields come from? It&rsquo;s almost always one of the three following sources: </p><ul><li>an overcollateralized loan, </li><li>the aforementioned dividends for holders of DeFi stocks, </li><li>or printing new tokens to giveaway as incentives for users to use a particular DeFi app. </li></ul><p>The third of these three potential sources of DeFi yield is perhaps the least sustainable, as inflating the supply of a DeFi project&rsquo;s token to acquire new users can only work over the short term. </p><blockquote><p>In fact, this is exactly the problem (loss of savings through inflation) bitcoin is intended to solve in the first place! In many cases, these newly-created tokens are then staked themselves in an attempt to generate even more yield.</p></blockquote><h2 data-param="1" id="is-there-any-fundamental-utility-here?">Is there any fundamental utility here?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A notable exception to the point regarding the heavy utilization of centralized stablecoins in DeFi apps is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/maker/">MakerDAO</a>, which also just happens to be the largest DeFi app in terms of total value locked (TVL). That said, there are a variety of issues with this platform as well. For one, the overcollateralization requirements for creating <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dai/">DAI</a> means the system doesn&rsquo;t scale. This is why various ERC-20 tokens, including centralized stablecoins, have been added as alternative collateral options to ETH. </p><p>There are also centralization issues around the federation of oracles that power the price feeds used in the MakerDAO system and concerns regarding the concentration of the project&rsquo;s MKR governance tokens in few hands. The federated security model is often brought up as a critique of Bitcoin sidechains like RSK and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/is-liquid-sidechain-a-path-for-better-bitcoin-privacy-6395.htm">Liquid</a>, but for some reason it&rsquo;s rarely ever mentioned as a potential risk in Ethereum circles in relation to their DeFi apps. </p><blockquote><p>The oracle problem is an <a href="https://www.longhash.com/en/news/3324/DeFi%E2%80%99s-Oracle-Problem-May-Not-Be-Solvable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue</a> that may be unsolvable in terms of getting the same sort of assurances you get when you&rsquo;re holding bitcoin on the base Bitcoin blockchain, so it&rsquo;s unclear if a truly decentralized stablecoin for consumers will ever be a possibility (or even desirable). </p></blockquote><p>Additionally, a bitcoin-collateralized stablecoin already exists on the RSK sidechain in the form of Dollar on Chain (DOC) as part of the greater <b>Money on Chain</b> platform. Due to the counterparty risks that appear to be inherent to stablecoin systems, it&rsquo;s unclear if there is much to gain from having stronger decentralization at the base layer than what is available with RSK, especially considering the tradeoffs in terms of efficiency and the lack of a need for a new token for gas payments.</p><p>Many of the most interesting Ethereum DeFi apps involve the creation of these sorts of derivative assets based on collateral held in ETH, some ERC-20 token, or a combination of the two. Synthetix (SNX) is another example of this, although it is not currently in the top ten based on gas usage or TVL. The basic idea is to create synthetic versions of real-world assets like gold or <b>Apple</b> stock through derivatives backed by the protocol&rsquo;s underlying SNX token. However, this platform has an even bigger issue with overcollateralization, requiring 7.5x collateral to back its synthetic assets. </p><p>Obviously, this is a use case that involves the oracle problem as well. Additionally, the use of SNX instead of ETH as collateral for these assets points to the misaligned incentives for developers who are building on Ethereum. The incentive is to pump the value of their own coin rather than ETH. A similar phenomenon can be observed with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/chainlink/">Chainlink&rsquo;s LINK</a> token.</p><p>So, the most useful Ethereum apps appear to be those that involve taking out loans against some collateral, which may not even be denominated in ETH. </p><p>This sort of functionality is also already available on the Bitcoin sidechains Liquid (via <b>Hodl Hodl Lend</b>) and RSK (via <b>Sovryn</b> and Money on Chain). There are completely centralized exchanges that offer this financial service as well. It should also be noted that there is already much more liquidity in BTC than ETH, and if you take away all of the fluff of centralized stablecoins and Ponzi games, this liquidity advantage for BTC should expand greatly, meaning the case for using ETH as collateral over BTC in these sorts of DeFi systems weakens.</p><p>At the end of the day, all this uncertainty about the possible outlawing of stablecoins, unsustainable yield-farming initiatives powered by token printing, smart contract risk, oracle risk, utility of DeFi apps if stablecoins are not allowed, increased competition from EVM-compatible chains like Binance Smart Chain and RSK, and many other aspects of the Ethereum economy trickles down to the underlying ETH asset itself, which has the compounding impact of making ETH less useful as money and, therefore, less useful as collateral.</p><p>A pivot from characterizing ETH as gas to calling it money is probably the correct move for ETH proponents; however, this change may be coming too late in the game, as Bitcoin now also has a variety of avenues via the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a>, Liquid, and RSK to do DeFi things without the need for the introduction of a new token.<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, one of the top subjects of conversation on Bitcoin Twitter was initiated when investor Alistair Milne claimed there is a rumor that <b>Facebook</b> will announce they hold <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> on their books on Wednesday. There is a long history of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/almost-usd-10-billion-liquidated-amid-sunday-selloff-in-cryp-9959.htm">false rumors</a> and reports when it comes to huge announcements that could affect the bitcoin price, which may be why the cryptoasset didn&rsquo;t move much after Milne shared the rumor on social media. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/608/9391ff1096.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/608/9391ff1096.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/608/9391ff1096.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/608/9391ff1096.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/608/9391ff1096.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/608/9391ff1096.jpg 1193w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/natanaelginting</figcaption></figure><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1386982516188450816"></oembed></div><p>While there isn&rsquo;t much point to speculating about whether the rumor is true or not, there is certainly value in pointing out the various reasons as to why it would make sense for Facebook to make this move. </p><p>Specifically, there are three key reasons Facebook should be considering an allocation to bitcoin: it may help them with their reputation issues around user data and privacy, integrating bitcoin into Facebook makes more sense than their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/diem/">Diem</a> project, and they&rsquo;re bound to earn a return by purchasing bitcoin and then giving the asset their own stamp of approval by publicly disclosing the purchase.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="1.-facebook-has-a-reputation-issue">1. Facebook has a reputation issue</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to Statista, Facebook is the most widely-used social media application in the world, but there is a certain segment of the population that absolutely loathes this tech giant. And it just so happens that there is a lot of overlap between the Facebook critics and the Bitcoin enthusiasts. This overlap makes sense because critiques of Facebook often sound quite similar to Bitcoin users&rsquo; criticisms of the legacy banking system. Bitcoin users love the ability to take full custody and responsibility over their money and remove the need for trusted intermediaries in the digital world. Similarly, Facebook critics would prefer to be in complete control over their data rather than having it collected, stored, and sold by a centralized third party. </p><blockquote><p>In other words, Bitcoin supporters and Facebook detractors have common ground in the desire for retaining self-sovereignty on the internet.</p></blockquote><p>Facebook&rsquo;s issues around privacy and control over user data have revealed themselves via a number of scandals and controversies over the years. Also, CEO Mark Zuckerberg referred to his users as &ldquo;dumb fucks&rdquo; for handing their personal data over to him when the platform was still just a website known as The Facebook. There have been many other user privacy snafus that have popped up for the social media giant over the years, but the point is that all of these issues involve personal data being placed in the hands of a trusted third party, Facebook, which is a problem Bitcoin proponents understand quite well.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/ZLOK/status/1316443608870944768"></oembed></div><p>Facebook seems to have a renewed push for user privacy and data security every few years, but buying, using, and promoting bitcoin could do wonders for their credibility when it comes to their statements in regards to user sovereignty on Facebook&rsquo;s platforms. The pressure on Facebook related to these issues is also likely on the rise thanks to <b>Apple</b>, which has launched a wide <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variety</a> of privacy-enhancing features over the past couple of years that allow users of Apple devices to retain more control over their data. Of course, Facebook&rsquo;s official response to Apple&rsquo;s privacy improvements has been to do things like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/facebook-blasts-apple-in-new-ads-over-iphone-privacy-change-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> the move will harm small business, so perhaps we&rsquo;re still waiting on Zuckerberg&rsquo;s come-to-Jesus moment.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="2.-bitcoin-makes-more-sense-than-diem">2. Bitcoin makes more sense than Diem</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Facebook is already connected to the concepts of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology via its Diem initiative, which was originally known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/libra/">Libra</a>. However, Diem is nothing like Bitcoin.</p><p>First of all, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to refer to Diem as a pure cryptocurrency, as it&rsquo;s based on a permissioned blockchain. The key innovation with Bitcoin was to enable dynamic, potentially-anonymous actors to solve the double-spending problem and order transactions. With Diem, the system is controlled by a federation of known, trusted entities. Additionally, Diem is intended to track the value of the US dollar, which means it&rsquo;s quite similar to many of the various tools for online payments that already exist in the United States. Indeed, the level of centralization involved in this project has already enabled a number of delays and structural changes due to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/g7-game-keep-facebook-s-libra-at-bay-work-on-own-cbdc-7973.htm">concerns</a> from regulators.</p><p>If Facebook truly wants to give their users more sovereignty and control over their data and money, then it would make much more sense to simply integrate bitcoin into their existing applications rather than effectively recreating PayPal or Cash App on top of a permissioned blockchain. </p><p>Even US Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2019/10/16/us-congressman-facebook-should-adopt-bitcoin-drop-libra-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that Facebook should opt for bitcoin instead of creating Diem in the early days of the project.</p><p>On the official website of the Diem project, there is a heavy focus on the desire to bring financial services to the unbanked. But the reason the unbanked don&rsquo;t have access to financial services is related to restrictions around Know Your Customer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KYC</a>) and anti-money laundering (<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/aml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AML</a>) regulations. If these requirements did not exist, people would already be moving dollars, euros, and other fiat currencies around the world as easily as a tweet or an email. Yes, stablecoins already exist, but it&rsquo;s unclear if regulators will allow pseudonymous digital transactions to persist in these dollar-denominated IOUs. And if they are allowed to persist, then why is a blockchain needed in the first place?</p><p>Creating another centralized system like Diem does not solve this problem because it is easily regulated and controlled. With bitcoin, any pseudonymous individual is able to receive payments in a permissionless manner. This is the key differentiator with bitcoin and the reason it is able to operate as a form of digital cash.</p><p>As a final side note on Diem, it would make sense for Facebook to purchase and hold some bitcoin if they intend to go back to the original vision of Diem (then Libra) where the digital currency was backed by a basket of currencies rather than just the US dollar, as bitcoin could potentially be added to Diem&rsquo;s reserves as well.</p><blockquote><p>If Facebook continues to pursue Diem in lieu of Bitcoin, it will be clear that this step into the digital currency realm is just another power grab rather than a new way to empower their users. Instead, they should hold bitcoin on their balance sheet and begin building new products and services around it. </p></blockquote><p>For those ready to point out that Bitcoin (even with the early development of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a>) cannot scale to handle the entire Facebook user base today, it&rsquo;s important to realize that every Facebook user is not going to immediately start making Bitcoin payments the day they theoretically go live. And even if this sort of functionality is still some years away, it still makes sense for Facebook to buy now while it&rsquo;s still early.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="3.-pumponomics-101">3. Pumponomics 101</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The third reason Facebook should buy and hold some bitcoin on their books is a pretty simply one: <i>pumponomics</i>. If Facebook were to purchase some bitcoin and then come out with an announcement regarding their bitcoin position and intentions to build products and services around the world&rsquo;s most popular cryptoasset, then they would stand to benefit financially from the likely increase in the bitcoin price following the announcement.</p><p><b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/microstrategy/">Microstrategy</a></b> CEO Michael Saylor was the first executive at a publicly-traded company to outline this simple strategy when he recommended it to <b>Tesla</b> CEO Elon Musk via Twitter. </p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1340665067570913280"></oembed></div><p>And <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/1-million-first-time-buyers-bought-bitcoin-on-dorsey-s-cash-9325.htm">according</a> to Square Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s absolutely a case for every balance sheet to have bitcoin on it.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, some may say that it would make more sense for Facebook to adopt an altcoin instead of bitcoin, as it would perhaps be easier for Facebook to pump and dump a much lower-valued cryptoasset for profit. </p><blockquote><p>However, the point is not to pump and then dump. Instead, the point is to buy and help build and support a native, permissionless currency for the internet.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that simply pumping and dumping a small-cap altcoin would have the opposite effect in terms of Facebook improving their reputation. Additionally, Facebook will need for there to be enough liquidity in a cryptocurrency for them to eventually convert some funds back to US dollars, if necessary. As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tesla-sends-bullish-bitcoin-signal-to-global-corporates-10062.htm">Tesla recently proved</a>, there is plenty of liquidity in bitcoin.</p><p>A decision to get into bitcoin may come down to time preferences for Facebook. The social media giant can continue to cling onto centralized control or begin to embrace a future internet that is more decentralized and enables true user sovereignty. While Facebook increases its power through centralization today, there may eventually be a need to embrace user sovereignty, as Twitter has done with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/twitter-aims-to-set-new-bluesky-for-decentralized-social-med-5288.htm">bluesky</a>. Long term, a future where Facebook has not embraced bitcoin may look rather dystopian, as it may indicate the cryptocurrency failed.<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) applications, specifically on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, have exploded in popularity over the past couple of years. While bitcoin appears to be here to stay as a global, apolitical store of value, the basic idea behind DeFi is to go beyond the creation of a new, base monetary asset and bring a greater degree of decentralization to other areas of finance (or at least the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-defi-isn-t-always-as-decentralized-as-you-might-think-7695.htm">appearance of decentralization</a>).</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/608/310bae6f3f.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/608/310bae6f3f.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/608/310bae6f3f.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/608/310bae6f3f.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/608/310bae6f3f.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/608/310bae6f3f.jpg 1215w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/Kokhanchikov</figcaption></figure><p>While bitcoin&rsquo;s key value proposition is built around the removal of trusted third parties in the realm of digital money, it is much more difficult to completely remove counterparty risk in other areas of the traditional financial system. </p><p>Sure, some people are making fortunes by earning yields on the speculative tokens found in the DeFi ecosystem, but with greater yield comes greater risk. </p><p>It&rsquo;s vital for anyone involved in the cryptoasset market to understand that Bitcoin and DeFi are not at all the same when it comes to risk profiles.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoin-is-a-savings-technology">Bitcoin is a savings technology</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin is often referred to as a speculative investment, but the reality is it is a new type of savings technology. A key difference between savings and investment is that savings does not generate yield and should not involve potential downside risk. Savings is simply the money from an individual&rsquo;s generated income during a particular period of time that is not spent. It&rsquo;s the cash being held on hand that is not put at risk in any sort of investment.</p><blockquote><p>The key selling point of bitcoin as a savings technology is that it is deflationary, which is in stark contrast to the inflationary standard found in government-issued fiat currencies. In other words, bitcoin should appreciate in value over time, while fiat currencies tend to lose value over time.</p></blockquote><p>A key reason government-issued currencies tend to be inflationary is that it stimulates investment and spending over the short term, and politicians tend to think and act on short timeframes. Additionally, it is extremely advantageous for governments to be able to create new currency <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/the-great-depression-and-money-printers-of-today-9957.htm">out of thin air</a> rather than being forced to collect it from the general public <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/biden-tax-plans-speculations-spook-crypto-speculators-10028.htm">through taxation</a>.</p><p>A side effect of an inflationary monetary policy is that it pushes individuals out of their savings (as to avoid devaluation) and into more speculative investments. With bitcoin&rsquo;s deflationary monetary policy, individuals are able to simply hold bitcoin and allow it to appreciate over the long term rather than worrying about what is going on in the stock market or outsourcing that task to a third party.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/pierre_rochard/status/1324449259165519872"></oembed></div><p>Of course, the introduction of bitcoin&rsquo;s apolitical monetary policy that was &ldquo;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1611#msg1611" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set in stone</a>&rdquo; with the launch of the Bitcoin network back in 2009 means that governments no longer operate without competition from a free market money for savings.</p><p>Yes, gold exists as well, but the precious metal is poorly suited for the digital world. Since gold is a physical object in the real world, there is no way to use it via the internet without the introduction of counterparty risk. Gold&rsquo;s failures in terms of ease-of-use are what led to the creation of paper money in the first place. </p><blockquote><p>With bitcoin, it is easier to become completely sovereign and protect one&rsquo;s savings against theft and devaluation without outsourcing the job to a bank or some other custodian.</p></blockquote><h2 data-param="1" id="defi-brings-greater-yield-with-much-greater-risk">DeFi brings greater yield with much greater risk</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So, we&rsquo;ve established that the key selling point of bitcoin is that it allows its users to preserve the value of their savings without introducing counterparty risk or moving funds into riskier investments. Now, what has the DeFi phenomenon done up to this point? Mostly reintroduce that very problem Bitcoin was created to solve, including a heavy reliance on inflationary, fiat-pegged stablecoins.</p><p>Today, the DeFi space is made up of a variety of applications around financial services such as trading, borrowing, lending, and derivatives. While these DeFi apps are often marketed as decentralized, trustless, and just like Bitcoin, they are actually far from it. After all, many DeFi users are generating high yields on their crypto assets via these applications, and that could not be the case without the introduction of some sort of risk factor.</p><p>There are an incredible number of risk factors piled up on top of each other in the world of DeFi apps. These apps are crudely glued together based on potentially-faulty smart contract code, trusted oracles, developer-controlled backdoors, volatile underlying network tokens (e.g. ETH, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">BNB</a>), centralized stablecoins with plenty of counterparty risk, yields denominated in Ponzi-esque crypto tokens with unclear utility, and other problematic building blocks. </p><blockquote><p>DeFi applications are also closely intertwined with each other, which means a problem with one app can affect others. It&rsquo;s basically all one big house of cards that can fall apart as quickly as it has risen in prominence.<br>
DeFi is often referred to as a system of money Legos, but it&rsquo;s much more like money Jenga right now.</p></blockquote><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1191664760565178371"></oembed></div><p>Put simply, bitcoin is intended to be the most secure, sovereign option for savings that the world has ever seen, while DeFi is so far into the realm of &ldquo;investment&rdquo; that it can more properly be referred to as outright gambling. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with gambling, but the extreme contrasts between the safety and security of Bitcoin and DeFi are almost always completely ignored, even by some of the most well-known entities in the space.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/kyletorpey/status/1112843843915923457"></oembed></div><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that risks also exist with regulated, centralized financial institutions that use bitcoin; however, a critical difference there is that users have someone to turn to for help or blame in a situation where something goes wrong. With DeFi, the user takes all of the risk upon themselves and has no safety net for their investments that go awry. DeFi apps can eventually become more trustworthy and decentralized over time, but we&rsquo;re clearly not there yet, which leaves many people preferring to move bitcoin into the traditional financial system for now.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="defi-will-improve-with-time">DeFi will improve with time</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The early DeFi projects of today are of the &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo; variety, but more reliable and secure applications are bound to develop over time. It is possible to have extremely low trust DeFi applications built on top of Bitcoin, and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a> is the best example of such a financial service innovation. In the case of the Lightning Network, you get payments that are much faster and less costly than transactions made on the base blockchain layer without having to make large tradeoffs in terms of trust or counterparty risk. That said, Lightning Network still comes with a bit of smart contract complexity risk (though not as much as a random DeFi app), as it is still early days for this layer-two Bitcoin network.</p><p>There are also the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/is-liquid-sidechain-a-path-for-better-bitcoin-privacy-6395.htm">Liquid</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rsk-opens-bridge-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum-more-news-5718.htm">RSK</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-are-sidechains-2658.htm">sidechains</a> that allow for greater levels of experimentation; however, these networks currently rely on federations of trusted entities rather than the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, which means they are less resistant to large scale attacks by governments or other entities. On Liquid, low-trust borrowing and lending collateralized with bitcoin is possible via <b>Hodl Hodl</b>&rsquo;s <a href="https://lend.hodlhodl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lend</a>, while <a href="https://www.sovryn.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sovryn</a> is bringing many of the DeFi applications from Ethereum over to RSK, which is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVM</a>).</p><p>Longer-term, a programming language called <a href="https://www.longhash.com/en/news/3353/How-to-Make-Advanced-Smart-Contracts-Possible-on-Bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simplicity</a>, which is seen as more reliable than Ethereum&rsquo;s Solidity, is expected to be added to Liquid and could eventually find its way into Bitcoin itself. This would provide for better assurances regarding the underlying code backing more complex DeFi applications.</p><p>While the safety of DeFi can definitely be improved upon, investment does imply risk at the end of the day. All developers can do is minimize the risks at a technical level, and users will still be free to make bad bets. Still then, lingering issues like the <a href="https://www.longhash.com/en/news/3324/DeFi%E2%80%99s-Oracle-Problem-May-Not-Be-Solvable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oracle problem</a>, which is critical to many DeFi applications, could persist.</p><blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s obviously nothing wrong with taking the basic idea behind Bitcoin and trying to apply it to other financial applications, but the differences between using bitcoin for savings and putting it at risk in any sort of investment need to be well understood. Additionally, DeFi proponents need to be honest about these newly-introduced risks.</p></blockquote><p>There has been some growth in the combination of bitcoin with the DeFi phenomenon, namely via <b>Badger DAO</b> and Sovryn, and it will be interesting to see if this overlap between conservative bitcoin holders and much riskier financial applications continues to gain traction. Despite all of the risks associated with DeFi today, this trend has the potential to at least lead to a decentralization of many bitcoin applications that are completely centralized as of today.<br>

One of the reasons for this is that Bitcoin works very differently from traditional online payment systems.</p><p>In Bitcoin, users are in full control of their own money, which means they&rsquo;re in charge of securing it and not making any mistakes when they are sending an irreversible transaction. There are no third parties to come to your rescue in a situation where you make a mistaken payment or a hacker accesses your private keys.</p><p>A new wave of Bitcoin wallets are attempting to solve at least part of these issues with the BTC user experience through the use of so-called seedless multisig wallets. These wallets are intended to simplify the storage of BTC in a non-custodial manner and get rid of the current default backup option in most wallets, which involves writing down a 12 or 24-word backup phrase and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-to-protect-your-absolute-crypto-lifeline-seed-words-3565.htm">storing it somewhere safe</a>.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="the-promise-of-seedless-multisig-wallets">The promise of seedless multisig wallets</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The main idea with seedless multisig is to make it so a combination of backup options in the form of devices, service providers, hardware wallets, trusted friends or family members, and other sources replaces the need to write down a backup passphrase and keep it secure.</p><p>&ldquo;The <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIP39</a> [passphrase] introduced in 2014 was a very simple yet powerful way for backing up a Bitcoin wallet using 12 to 24 words (plus an optional passphrase),&rdquo; said <b>Hexa Wallet</b> Product Director Anant Tapadia. &ldquo;Before this backing up a Bitcoin wallet was something only technically proficient people could do. But this method posed certain problems.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Tapadia, the biggest issue with BIP39 is the backup method creates a single point of failure for the wallet user&rsquo;s BTC holdings.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If they are lost, there is no recourse,&rdquo; said Tapadia. &ldquo;Adding a salt or passphrase does not help the problem as now you end up having two single points of failure. Losing any one of them means loss of funds. Mnemonic based backup scheme offers no resiliency.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>US-based crypto security specialist <b>Casa</b> has been one of the pioneers in the seedless multisig wallet space.</p><p>&ldquo;Our seedless setup does away with paper backups once for all,&rdquo; notes Casa&rsquo;s page on their Keymaster wallet. &ldquo;So stop worrying that you&rsquo;re going to forget where that piece of paper went.&rdquo;</p><p>That said, the free version of Keymaster only works for a single-signature wallet architecture. For multisig functionality, Keymaster users must pay at a subscription fee, which starts at USD 10. When reached for comment, Casa Chief Technology Officer Jameson Lopp told <i>Cryptonews.com</i> there are no plans to offer a free version of Keymaster at this time.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We don&#8217;t make money by selling ads or user data, so it really comes down to an issue of how we pay for support costs,&rdquo; Lopp added. &ldquo;No such thing as a free lunch I&#8217;m afraid.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>According to Tapadia, Hexa Wallet uses a system that combines the use of multisig with a threshold recovery scheme.</p><p>&ldquo;Hexa has gone for a hybrid approach of having a multisig account on top of a multi-party seedless recovery,&rdquo; said Tapadia. &ldquo;We use <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trezor-and-ledger-started-this-fall-with-two-news-4592.htm">Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing</a> scheme for this.&rdquo;</p><p>Hexa Wallet also plans to add Lightning Network support to their wallet. The funds held on the Lightning Network will act as a sort of checking account, while the &ldquo;savings account&rdquo; will be for larger amounts held in a multisig address.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="looking-for-balance">Looking for balance</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Of course, seedless multisig also has its downside risks, as<b>Unchained Capital</b> Chief Strategy Officer Dhruv Bansal explained on an <a href="https://stephanlivera.com/episode/113/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode</a> of the Stephan Livera Podcast back in October of last year.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I personally think it is insane to run seedless,&rdquo; said Bansal during his conversation with Livera. </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think running without a seed phrase or throwing out your seed phrase because you believe you have sufficient other devices, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that. The argument, I think, that is advanced sometimes by folks like Casa for doing that is seed phrases are complicated, I guess, and they can be lost.&rdquo;</p><p>Bansal and Livera also discussed the fact that a BIP39 passphrase does not necessarily need to be created in a manner in which it creates a single point of failure. And the various shares of the backup seed phrase can be encrypted.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually one of the additions that Unchained is pushing into this conversation is to try to encrypt these shares,&rdquo; said Bansal. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not just one of them, so that makes it a lot easier to say that it&rsquo;s safer.&rdquo;</p><p>At the end of the day, all of these different wallet providers are simply trying to find the correct balance between security and user experience, and a definitive answer may not be available until multiple architectures are tried out in the wild.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="seedless-lightning-network-wallets">Seedless Lightning Network wallets</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Of course, many mobile BTC wallets are also focused on the Lightning Network these days, as the layer-two protocol&rsquo;s instant, nearly-free payments make more sense when it comes to using BTC on a phone. After all, nobody wants to walk around with their entire life&rsquo;s savings in their pocket.</p><p>Since smaller amounts are expected to be used with Lightning, there may be room to further improve the user experience, as security requirements become a little less strict.</p><p>Lightning Network developer Tankred Hase has been working on a new mobile Bitcoin wallet library, <a href="https://github.com/photon-sdk/photon-lib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photon-lib</a>, that allows users to backup their private keys and channel state with a model based on SMS and cloud backups. Hase&rsquo;s work on photon-lib was fueled by lessons he learned regarding user activity while working on the Lightning app for <b>Lightning Labs</b>.</p><p>&ldquo;Most users want to experiment with a wallet at first,&rdquo; Hase told Cryptonews.com. &ldquo;Maybe feed chickens on <a href="https://pollofeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollofeed</a> or order a sticker in the Blockstream store. So, mobile wallets should emphasize ease of use during the initial setup process.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Hase, the most important aspect of the backup process when a new user is playing around with the Lightning Network should be redundancy. </p><p>Users can then be &ldquo;upsold&rdquo; on additional security features like a PIN or time delay once more funds are added to the wallet.</p><p>The developers behind photon-lib are currently figuring out the balancing act between security and user experience on <a href="https://t.co/AZFk0OFCgM?amp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their</a> GitHub.<br>

[There&rsquo;s] not a foundation, not a development arm, not a development company [behind Bitcoin]. It&rsquo;s a truly stateless monetary base that strengthens the case for BTC as a store of value, which now can be supported by data and really solidify this idea that Bitcoin is the antithesis of interventionism and the type of money that we will need heading into the 2020s,&rdquo; he stressed.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoins-predictable-monetary-policy">Bitcoin&rsquo;s predictable monetary policy</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In the opening portion of his talk, Nuzzi covered the paradox that has appeared when it comes to the US dollar.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The response by central banks to the Coronavirus pandemic has created a lot of money paradoxes,&rdquo; said Nuzzi.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>&ldquo;On the one hand, there is widespread concern about central bank interventionism and markets not really reflecting reality whatsoever.

According to Nuzzi, there are estimates that the <b>Federal Reserve</b>&rsquo;s balance sheet could grow as high as USD 11 trillion by the end of the year.</p><oembed url="https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1268813635520008198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></oembed><p>Despite this tremendous increase in activity by the Federal Reserve, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DXY:CUR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DXY</a> (Dollar Index Spot)  is up roughly 0.9% year-to-date. Additionally, there has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mysterious-stablecoin-rally-marked-with-regional-differences-6540.htm">tremendous growth</a> in USD-denominated stablecoins this year, with the total value of these stablecoins roughly doubling over the past few months.</p><p>Notably, Bitcoin was celebrating its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">third halving</a>, in which the amount of new BTC created on a regular basis is cut in half, as central banks around the world ramped up their money printers.</p><p>Nuzzi also shared data that indicated a growth in the use of BTC as a store of value over the years. Recently, the one-year Hodl Factor, which is a direct measurement of the use of BTC as a store of value, surpassed 50% for the first time. This means half of bitcoin&rsquo;s supply hasn&rsquo;t moved for at least a year.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="advantages-of-btc-over-gold">Advantages of BTC over gold</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>According to Nuzzi, the recent crisis should have been viewed as a potential perfect storm for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/use-bitcoin-gold-and-bonds-as-a-hedge-against-inflation-bitm-6631.htm">gold</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Gold bugs initially felt vindicated because gold was appreciating relative to the global markets in the early stages of the pandemic, but gold itself [was affected] by the global supply chain issues that the pandemic introduced,&rdquo; said Nuzzi.</p><p>As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gold-faces-a-very-physical-problem-bitcoin-to-the-rescue-6118.htm">reported</a>, in March, millions of ounces of gold could not be delivered due to supply chain issues.</p><p>&ldquo;People who thought they owned gold realized that they&rsquo;re at the mercy of these third parties that are subject to other issues that you face in a pandemic, and meanwhile, Bitcoin was operating business as usual,&rdquo; noted Nuzzi.</p><p>To Nuzzi&rsquo;s point, the Bitcoin network settled USD 50 billion worth of money transfers in April.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;In an era of pandemics and social unrest, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that a reliable store of value needs to be portable and digital,&rdquo; added Nuzzi.</p></blockquote><p>The Coin Metrics network data analyst also pointed out that, as Bitcoin&rsquo;s issuance rate is on the decline thanks to the halving, the supply of gold is expanding due to increased production in China, Russia, and Australia.</p><p>&ldquo;In fact, this year will be the first year where Bitcoin supply inflation is lower than gold,&rdquo; said Nuzzi.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoin-is-a-highly-dispersed-asset">Bitcoin is a highly dispersed asset</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Nuzzi also covered the importance of the decentralization of Bitcoin holders during his talk. Notably, Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter pointed to the dispersion of coins on a cryptocurrency network as a key point of comparison between crypto assets during his own <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/3-experts-on-3-ways-to-compare-cryptoassets-6717.htm">appearance</a> on a panel at Mainnet.</p><p>&ldquo;What makes Bitcoin unique as a fair monetary system is that, as the first successful crypto asset, there are basically no guarantees or precedents that signaled it was going to succeed,&rdquo; said Nuzzi.</p><p>From Nuzzi&rsquo;s perspective, Bitcoin&rsquo;s turbulent history, including everything from the shutdown of the Silk Road black market to the <a href="https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block size wars</a>, has been tremendously helpful in increasing asset turnover.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;These early adopters that went through those first booms and busts of both activity and in the market [price] sold coins to newcomers because there were no guarantees of success and there was plenty of FUD [fear, uncertainty, and doubt], and these newcomers then became early adopters and that cycle has undoubtedly democratized the Bitcoin monetary base,&rdquo; said Nuzzi.</p></blockquote><p>In an effort to illustrate this point more clearly, Nuzzi compared the dispersion of coins in Bitcoin to the relatively higher-level of centralization of holdings found in altcoins.</p><figure style="max-width: 617px"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ed/a60746251a.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 617px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ed/a60746251a.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5ed/a60746251a.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5ed/a60746251a.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5ed/a60746251a.png 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The above chart shows the year-on-year change in the number of addresses on each cryptoasset network that hold more than 1% of the total monetary base.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, you can see, relative to three years ago, the number of addresses that hold more than 1% of Bitcoin&rsquo;s supply has gone down by 33%, and over the years, Bitcoin has consistently decentralized its monetary base,&rdquo; explained Nuzzi. &ldquo;Whereas assets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">Ripple</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/stellar/">Stellar</a>, and even <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zcash/">Zcash</a> have consistently become more centralized over the years.&rdquo;<br>

Source: a video screenshot, Youtube/Telstra Enterprise</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> mainstream adoption is more about people using the underlying Bitcoin network rather than a bunch of wealthy investors and institutions coming in to hold the underlying asset, according to <b>MIT Digital Currency Initiative</b> Director Neha Narula.</p><p>Narula and <b>Lightning Labs</b> CEO Elizabeth Stark were discussing Bitcoin and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a> during <b>Messari</b>&rsquo;s Mainnet online <a href="https://messari.events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conference</a> on Monday. </p><p>&ldquo;We forget mainstream adoption doesn&rsquo;t mean institutional adoption. It doesn&rsquo;t mean a bunch of really wealthy people holding Bitcoin as an asset to protect their wealth. That&rsquo;s not what mainstream adoption means,&rdquo; Narula said, explaining that, to her, it&rsquo;s about everyday people that are actually using this network. </p><p>&ldquo;Whether that&rsquo;s holding because it&rsquo;s part of their savings, or whether that&rsquo;s using the Lightning Network to make payments, or whether it&rsquo;s building things that are on top of Bitcoin,&rdquo; she added.</p><p>Stark pointed out that many people on Bitcoin Twitter were upset about a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/why-you-should-and-shouldn-t-care-about-goldman-sachs-report-6665.htm">presentation</a> by a division of investment banking giant <b>Goldman Sachs</b> last week. &#8220;Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are not an asset class,&rdquo; it said.</p><p>Stark and Narula agreed that this is not something Bitcoin users should care about.</p><p>&ldquo;If Goldman Sachs likes [Bitcoin], I think that means we&rsquo;re doing something wrong,&rdquo; said Narula. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;They should not like Bitcoin. We don&rsquo;t want Jamie Dimon saying Bitcoin is great. I understand people want number to go up, but you got to be in this for the long term. You have to think about what this really is and what kind of value it really has. And it&rsquo;s not just about pumping an asset.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoins-4-key-areas-of-development-focus">Bitcoin&rsquo;s 4 key areas of development focus</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As this was an update on what&rsquo;s going on with Bitcoin protocol development, Narula also covered the four key areas of focus she sees in the Bitcoin development process.</p><ul><li>Better privacy, which makes it harder to censor transactions</li><li>Better performance, which makes it easier to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/ways-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-bitcoin-node-4894.htm">run a full node</a> and therefore makes the network more decentralized</li><li>Better robustness, making it harder to attack the Bitcoin network in general</li><li>Additional functionality, not just for functionality&rsquo;s sake but in terms of what the companies building on Bitcoin really need</li></ul><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoin-development-funding">Bitcoin development funding</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Another topic covered by Narula during her conversation with Stark was the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-new-bitcoin-dev-funds-needed-key-funding-players-reveal-6158.htm">funding of Bitcoin developers</a> who are working on the underlying protocol. Stark pointed out that, while altcoins often have premines or initial coin offerings (ICOs) where funds can be reserved for protocol development, this aspect of the network works in a much more ad-hoc manner in Bitcoin.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see this as a tragedy of the commons because I think the really sophisticated <i>hodlers</i> realize that they have to give back to the network to protect their assets,&rdquo; said Narula. &ldquo;And I think the really sophisticated institutions see this as well . . . It&rsquo;s like the <b>Linux</b> open-source kernel, it&rsquo;s like <b>Red Hat</b>, it&rsquo;s like <b>IBM</b>. If you&rsquo;re building on open-source technology, you need to contribute back to making sure that open-source technology is robust.&rdquo;</p><p>Narula also pointed out that the fact Bitcoin Core contributors are having to find new funding for their development work on a year-to-year basis is a really scary situation when you consider how much money is at stake on the Bitcoin network.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was no token sale,&rdquo; said Narula. &ldquo;There is no foundation. There is no, sort of, central body with hundreds of millions of dollars that is supporting Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>MIT&rsquo;s Digital Currency Initiative, <b>Square Crypto</b>, <b>Chaincode Labs</b>, <b>Blockstream</b>, <b>Digital Garage</b>, <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitmex/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BitMEX</a></b>, <b>Xapo</b>, and <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinbase</a></b> were mentioned as specific companies who have provided funding for open-source Bitcoin development.</p><p>&ldquo;Like I said, I think the sophisticated companies realize that this is really important to their success,&rdquo; said Narula.<br>

Instead, an array of metrics can be used to understand the level of dispersion found in the ownership of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UTXO</a> (unspent output from bitcoin transactions) set or account holder base.</p><p>Carter used the number of addresses holding at least BTC 0.1 on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> network as an example data point.</p><p>&ldquo;If you look at the chart on Bitcoin, it looks a little bit like the price chart, actually,&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;It has these really rapid expansion phases [followed by] slight concentration. But just, generally, the trend is growth, as the userbase gets more dispersed.&rdquo;</p><p>Carter added that this sort of data can also be useful when measuring the relative success of various forks that break off from a particular cryptocurrency. For example, the holdings of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-sv/">bitcoin SV (BSV)</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-gold/">bitcoin gold (BTG)</a> have become more concentrated since they launched, as BTC has continued to become more widely dispersed.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You might juxtapose [coin dispersion] against transaction value or transaction count for some of those fork coins,&rdquo; said Carter. &ldquo;You see that they have an apparent vibrancy because there are lots and lots of transactions going on, but if you look into it a bit deeper, you see the transactions are kind of like for the insertion of arbitrary data, for tipping services, or actually just could be straight up spam transactions. And it&rsquo;s not a function of actual commerce happening really.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>According to Carter, the entities transacting are mostly the same entities:  &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s not evangelism going on. There&rsquo;s no additional, new dispersion. There&rsquo;s no user acquisition.&rdquo;</p><h2 data-param="1" id="taking-a-look-at-liquidity">Taking a look at liquidity</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>For Soubiran, it&rsquo;s also useful to look at metrics around usage and velocity. With these sorts of data, you can see how money is being moved around on a cryptoasset network rather than just how much is being held by users.</p><p>&ldquo;Going back to my bread and butter, I&rsquo;m completely obsessed with order book metrics and how you can derive order book data to have more liquidity-related insights on the market,&rdquo; explained Soubiran. &ldquo;And so, everything about slippage, market depth, how quickly market depth depletes when you have large market moves&mdash;there are so many things that you can learn from order book data that goes way beyond just pure price information. It really gives a lot around market microstructure and how stable the market actually is.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Soubiran, while more investors are talking about BTC as a potential hedge against increased <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fiat-money-printer-goes-brrr-is-it-a-time-to-sell-cash-for-b-6063.htm">money printing</a> by governments, the reality is the cryptocurrency market is still highly illiquid. To this point, Kaiko CEO pointed to a recent <a href="https://blog.kaiko.com/how-black-thursday-decimated-cryptocurrency-order-books-58167bf9157d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from her company on how exchange order books were completely decimated on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/exclusive-10-crypto-minds-weigh-in-on-post-crash-bitcoin-and-6028.htm">Black Thursday</a>.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is not yet an asset that can be considered a hedge against anything, in my opinion,&rdquo; said Soubiran. &ldquo;However, the hedge narrative is wonderful for us because it brings a lot of attention and a lot of interest to the space because, conceptually, it is a real hedge against inflation. It&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re not there yet in terms of size and volume.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Soubiran added that slippage is still very much an issue for BTC traders, as traders can experience 10 basis points of slippage on the largest exchanges for orders of around USD 50,000 to USD 100,000, with the issue becoming much worse for larger trades.</p><p>&ldquo;Market orders above USD 150,000 to USD 200,000 start being quite expensive in terms of how much of the order book you&rsquo;re actually eating up,&rdquo; said Soubiran. &ldquo;So, if we just look at that from a price stability standpoint, an order of USD 100,000 to USD 200,000 can start messing up the price quite significantly . . . on the largest exchanges.&rdquo;</p><h2 data-param="1" id="where-is-the-customer-data?">Where is the customer data?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While Balter agreed with the answers provided by Carter and Soubiran, he added that metrics used to track growth of traditional businesses may be useful when looking at cryptoasset networks.</p><p>&ldquo;If you might look a few years out, an investable asset might be one that has real customer metrics, things that you might understand maybe as you&rsquo;re even investing in equities today: user growth, retention, [customer acquisition cost], [and loan-to-value],&rdquo; he said. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;My sense is what we&rsquo;re missing in this space is more prominent indicators of ecosystem performance that would indicate that these assets are actually growing as real organizations.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Soubiran pointed out that this is what Messari, who was putting on the conference, is currently attempting to build.</p><p>According to Balter, part of what Flipside Crypto works on is distinguishing different types of users of the various cryptoassets they track on their platform.</p><p>&ldquo;Once you start looking at stakeholder behaviors in stablecoins, you&rsquo;ll see that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dai/">DAI</a> is really the only one that is being used deeply for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">decentralized finance</a>, while <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">Tether</a> is mainly being used for arbitrage. So, that begins to give you an indication of where are their customer metrics, where [is] their actual usage . . . So, I would like to see much more of these types of real indicators of what type of usage, not just what type of tokens are being moved around, but what type of usage is occurring for these types of assets.&rdquo;</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>Even today, there is a non-trivial chance that governments try to ban <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, according to Marco Santori, the recently appointed Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of major crypto exchange <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/kraken/">Kraken</a></b>.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a 20% or 30% chance in the next five years, but I think it&rsquo;s real. And it&rsquo;s up to us to do everything that we can to give this stuff real&mdash;and maybe this is where this starts to get a little controversial&mdash;real functional use that people in government can appreciate as something more than just what they see oftentimes as a casino,&rdquo; he said during the Kraken <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/kraken-s-bitcoin-vr-halving-party-517.htm">Block Drop VR Halving Party</a> on Sunday. </p><p>Santori noted that it&rsquo;s important for crypto lobbying organizations like <b>Coin Center</b> to be on the front lines to make sure that the Overton window, which is the range of ideas that the general public is willing to accept from politicians, never opens far enough for a ban on Bitcoin to ever come close to a possibility.</p><p>That said, Santori tries to remain practical in terms of the potential for a ban.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I still operate every day as if it is a non-trivial possibility [Bitcoin could be banned], and I think folks who are regulated and subject to laws are wise to think that as well,&rdquo; said Santori. &ldquo;There was a time where I wouldn&rsquo;t have described it as non-trivial . . . I would have described it as maybe a 20% chance [or] 30% chance.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>According to the CLO, his views on the potential for an outright ban on Bitcoin were altered by the release of <b>FinCEN</b>&rsquo;s (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&rsquo;s) guidance regarding cryptocurrencies like BTC in 2013.</p><p>&ldquo;When the government first said, &lsquo;Okay Bitcoiners. You&rsquo;re under our thumb. You have to follow the rules like everybody else.&rsquo; I think a lot of people reacted negatively to that, but just as many people reacted positively,&rdquo; explained Santori. &ldquo;They thought, &lsquo;Oh my goodness. This is the government recognizing the legitimacy of this thing. They said something for the first time about Bitcoin and it wasn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s bad and illegal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Before joining Kraken, Santori served as President and Chief Legal Officer for <b>Blockchain.com</b>, a major crypto wallet provider, and is known as the &lsquo;Dean of Digital Currency Lawyers&rsquo; for his work in litigating, advising on and creating new law in the crypto industry.</p><p>In April, he <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/in-a-year-or-two-courts-will-be-ones-making-crypto-laws-krak-6349.htm">argued</a> that the courts, not the lawmakers, will likely be the ones that&#8217;ll make &#8220;new sources of law&#8221; for the crypto industry within the next couple of years. </p><h2 data-param="1" id="a-bunch-of-fractured-interests">&lsquo;A bunch of fractured interests&rsquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Meanwhile, during the same discussion on Sunday, Coin Center Director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh, said that preventing a government ban has been easier than you&rsquo;d think. </p><p>&ldquo;Government is just a bunch of people, and they all have their specific interests,&rdquo; said Van Valkenburgh.</p><p>From his perspective, people at the <b>Securities and Exchange Commission</b> are mostly interested in protecting mainstream investors from penny stocks and certain initial coin offerings, FinCEN just wants to make sure illicit money isn&rsquo;t flowing through the regulated financial system, and the <b>Internal Revenue Service</b> just wants Americans to pay their taxes.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Maybe the taxes thing is where things start to break down&mdash;where if you had widespread tax evasion because of Bitcoin we&rsquo;d see a different tone, you&rsquo;d see government unify under one interest (they all want to make sure they still get paid as a government),&rdquo; Van Valkenburgh added. &ldquo;But right now, you have a bunch of fractured interests, and you don&rsquo;t have an existential threat to the government. So, there really hasn&rsquo;t been a widespread call here in the US amongst anyone in Congress or the agencies to sort of ban this thing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>According to Van Valkenburgh, the United States has a long history of not just accepting new technologies but also embracing and promoting them to the point where politicians want to take credit for these advancements. The Coin Center director of research pointed to Al Gore&rsquo;s infamous claim (which he <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/internet-of-lies/">didn&rsquo;t</a> actually make) that he invented the internet as supporting evidence for this phenomenon.</p><p>&ldquo;The internet created a whole new suite of potential vulnerabilities and issues for American society, but our reaction wasn&rsquo;t to get rid of it,&rdquo; said Van Valkenburgh.</p><p>He added that for every congressperson or regulator who gets loud about the perceived negative aspects of Bitcoin there are one or two people in government who are excited about the technology and think it&rsquo;s cool.<br>

So, has the LN replaced the need for altcoins focused on lower transaction fees? Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="lightning-network-for-online-retail-payments">Lightning Network for online retail payments</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In January 2019, it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2019/01/23/bitcoin-lightning-network-payments-have-already-surpassed-all-altcoins-at-this-retailer/#511fe5c83992" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that <b>Bitrefill</b>, which sells gift cards and mobile prepaid cards as part of its business, had already seen the LN overtake all of the individual altcoins in terms of payments.</p><p>Since then, it has mostly been ethereum (ETH), not the Lightning Network, that has seen some growth relative to other payment options on the platform. According to Bitrefill CEO Sergej Kotliar, the cryptocurrency payments breakdown for the online retailer is currently as follows: </p><ul><li>80% on-chain BTC, </li><li>7.5% <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a>,</li><li>4% Lightning-based BTC, </li><li>7.5% other altcoins LTC, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dash/">dash (DASH)</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">dogecoin (DOGE)</a>).</li></ul><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Everything is growing, but in share, Lightning is currently not growing at [the] expense of other payment methods,&rdquo; Kotliar told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p></blockquote><p>It should be noted that this data is in reference to payments made by users that do not have refillable accounts on Bitrefill, where only bitcoin transactions (on chain or Lightning) are accepted.</p><p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re still optimistic about Lightning, especially as we&#8217;re seeing usage of everything grow right now, and the possibilities especially of integrations with custodial entities, such as what we&#8217;ve done with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitfinex/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bitfinex</a>,&rdquo; added Kotliar. &ldquo;But adoption among exchanges is going slowly. I would have expected more by now.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an attempt to help Venezuelans to store their savings in a more stable currency,  Colombia-based fintech, <b>Valiu</b>, decided to indirectly use <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> rather than one of the many available stablecoins. There are three reasons why BTC has won in this case.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5eb/18d6e4e288.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5eb/18d6e4e288.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5eb/18d6e4e288.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5eb/18d6e4e288.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5eb/18d6e4e288.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5eb/18d6e4e288.png 1122w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/allexxandarx</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;Liquidity, business model, and regulatory advantages,&rdquo; Sid Ramesh, an advisor to Valiu, an app that allows Venezuela migrants in Columbia to send money back to their home country, named the reasons in an interview with <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. </p><p>He was unwilling to expand on the regulatory benefits of Valiu&rsquo;s synthetic dollar-based system, but he did explain the importance of liquidity for their concept to work.</p><p>&ldquo;Liquidity is key here,&rdquo; said Ramesh. &ldquo;BTC is the only liquid asset in our jurisdiction. If stablecoins catch on in [Latin America], we&#8217;ll use them as settlement.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, Valiu&rsquo;s synthetic dollar could be seen as a sort of crypto-collateralized stablecoin in its own right. But according to Ramesh, Valiu&rsquo;s setup does not come with the same sorts of problems that may soon be found with more traditional stablecoins.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We will thrive even in a negative interest rate world with interest revenues since it&#8217;s a function of the BTC futures curve,&rdquo; said the advisor. </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stablecoin issuers who depend on interest revenues from US treasuries will have to explore new business models whereas our yields are a function of the low-risk premiums available on the BTC derivatives market (basis trades, yield on the perpetual funding rate, etc.).&rdquo;</p><p>As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/stablecoins-will-have-to-adapt-to-survive-coronavirus-recess-6151.htm">reported</a> by <i>Cryptonews.com</i>, those stablecoins which rely on such rates and yields for their revenues are now in a serious bind and they will have to adapt if they want to survive the Coronavirus-prompted recession.</p><p>Although Valiu uses cryptocurrency in the backend, this is hidden from the user. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how Valiu&rsquo;s synthetic US dollar works behind the scenes also.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="how-valiu-uses-bitcoin">How Valiu uses Bitcoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Last week, Valiu <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/argentina-venezuela-seek-crypto-powered-solution-to-economic-6387.htm">announced</a> that it has developed a dollar savings account for their app. The app uses BTC derivatives to create a synthetic version of the US dollar, and the goal is to allow Venezuelans to store their savings in a more stable currency. </p><p>&ldquo;In the most simplistic form, Valiu hedges BTC to the dollar by shorting 1x on BTC futures to obtain synthetic exposure,&rdquo; Ramesh explained. &ldquo;The underlying profit and loss stays constant in USD value but changes for the BTC value depending on the moves in the market.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Ramesh, Valiu is effectively issuing USD depository receipts to its users.</p><p>&ldquo;The hedging and risk strategies we&#8217;ve developed enable us to net risk across [forex] pairs in [Colombian Peso] or [Venezuelan Bol&iacute;var] as well as BTC/USD in derivative markets,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>For those who are aware of the mobile crypto app <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/abra/">Abra</a>, these underlying mechanisms may sound similar. In the past, Abra used <a href="https://www.abra.com/blog/abras-synthetic-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic assets</a> created through the use of Bitcoin multisignature addresses as the underlying source of value for the assets held in the app by its users. However, Valiu is still quite different from how Abra&rsquo;s synthetic assets worked.</p><p>&ldquo;Unlike Abra&#8217;s model which had &lsquo;multi-sig&rsquo; enabled exposure, the BTC collateral [used in Valiu] currently sits on custodial venues,&rdquo; explained Ramesh. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Abra is &lsquo;non-custodial&rsquo;, and we&rsquo;re not. We&#8217;re exploring other mechanisms such as proof-of-reserves and non-custodial backing to ensure Valiu becomes a full-reserve backed financial institution that&#8217;s trust minimized and transparent of our solvency.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Valiu also doesn&rsquo;t allow users to interact with BTC directly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s completely abstracted out from the user experience and we don&#8217;t plan on exposing crypto to the end-user anytime soon,&rdquo; said Ramesh.</p><p>Currently, Valiu allows synthetic dollars to be redeemed for Colombian pesos or Venezuelan bolivars. The company has more than 30,000 on ramps and off ramps in Colombia, where physical cash, debit cards, credit cards, and bank transfers can all be used as payment methods.</p><p>Users who are receiving synthetic dollars in Venezuela can withdraw them into one of nine different banks; however, the idea is Venezuelans will use the synthetic dollars as a savings account of sorts and only withdraw bolivars to their bank account when absolutely necessary for spending (in an effort to avoid exposure to the highly inflationary bolivar).<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although most of the activity around <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and other cryptocurrencies currently has more to do with price speculation than actual commerce, there are still plenty of reasons as to why accepting bitcoin payments makes sense for some businesses. Whether you believe in the ideas behind Bitcoin from a philosophical perspective or you just want to avoid chargebacks, there are plenty of benefits to be had from allowing your customers to pay for your goods or services via a cryptocurrency network.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ea/e5e265f2dc.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ea/e5e265f2dc.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5ea/e5e265f2dc.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5ea/e5e265f2dc.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5ea/e5e265f2dc.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5ea/e5e265f2dc.jpg 1207w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/Mateusz</figcaption></figure><p><b><a href="https://bitpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitPay</a></b> and <b><a href="https://btcpayserver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTCPay Server</a></b> are two of the most well-known options on the market in terms of enabling cryptocurrency payment acceptance for your business. However, they approach this problem from two different points of view.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitpays-history-and-best-features">Bitpay&rsquo;s history and best features</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Incredibly, BitPay was founded in the US all the way back in 2011 by Stephen Pair and Tony Gallipi. In fact, the company was launched less than two years after the launch of the Bitcoin network itself.</p><p>BitPay says its main mission is to transform the way individuals and businesses around the world receive payments through the use of blockchain technology. Many of the largest companies in the world that accept bitcoin payments, such as <b>Microsoft</b> and <b>Newegg</b>, do so via BitPay.</p><p>The company has processed more than USD 2.8 billion in cryptocurrency payments over the course of its entire history. Currently, the company processes payments made with BTC, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a>, and three different stablecoins.</p><p>Over the years, BitPay has expanded into other products and services that help enable better utility for BTC and other cryptocurrencies as mediums of exchange. For example, in addition to their merchant payment processing offerings, BitPay also has a Bitcoin debit card, a Bitcoin wallet, and a number of open source tools for developers.</p><p>In 2014, BitPay gained some mainstream notoriety through their sponsorship of an <b>NCAA</b> (the National Collegiate Athletic Association) college football bowl game; however, the company decided to promote Bitcoin rather than their company specifically through the deal. More controversially, BitPay was one of the companies that supported the so-called <a href="https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Agreement</a> in 2017, which was an attempt to implement a hard-forking increase to Bitcoin&rsquo;s block size limit to go along with the Segregated Witness (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-to-use-bitcoin-segwit-transactions-a-guide-4834.htm">SegWit</a>) upgrade. While many major Bitcoin miners, other large BTC companies were supporting this attempt, the majority of Bitcoin&rsquo;s development community and other industry players were against it. Back then, they stressed that this scaling solution would make Bitcoin more centralized. </p><h3 data-param="2" id="best-bitpays-features:">Best BitPay&rsquo;s features:</h3><ul><li>Convert cryptocurrency into your local fiat currency with a flat 1% exchange rate to avoid price volatility</li><li>Merchants can choose to receive part of their payment settlement in cryptocurrency and another part in fiat currency</li><li>BitPay can be implemented into online stores built with Shopify, WordPress, and other e-commerce platforms</li><li>BitPay has a customer support team</li><li>The company has a strong brand and has been around since 2011</li><li>Payments are private between merchants and customers</li></ul><h2 data-param="1" id="btcpay-servers-history-and-best-features">BTCPay Server&rsquo;s history and best features</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>BTCPay Server was created in 2017 by Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier as an act of protest against BitPay&rsquo;s activities around the aforementioned SegWit2x plan.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/NicolasDorier/status/898378514256207872"></oembed></div><p>BTCPay Server gives users more control over their payments than what is available with BitPay &mdash; it&rsquo;s effectively a self-hosted version of BitPay. In fact, the BTCPay <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/a-beginner-s-guide-to-crypto-apis-4837.htm">API</a> conforms to BitPay&rsquo;s configuration, which allows merchants to make the switch.</p><p>BTCPay Server comes with a full node wallet for its users, which means the original intent of Bitcoin in terms of censorship-resistance and full control over one&rsquo;s money is preserved with this payment solution.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="best-btcpay-servers-features:">Best BTCPay Server&rsquo;s features:</h3><ul><li>Support for SegWit, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a>, and PayJoin payments</li><li>No approval process for merchants</li><li>Users have complete control over their bitcoin via <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/ways-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-bitcoin-node-4894.htm">full node</a> software</li><li>Tor (an anonymous browser) integration available</li><li>No fees (besides cryptocurrency network fees)</li><li>Support for altcoins and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-are-sidechains-2658.htm">sidechains</a> via opt-in integrations</li><li>WooCommerce (an e-commerce plugin for WordPress) integration available</li></ul><h2 data-param="1" id="which-btc-payment-processor-is-right-for-you?">Which BTC payment processor is right for you?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Choosing the right BTC payment processor for your business will depend on a variety of factors. Although they are attempting to solve similar issues, BitPay and BTCPay approach bitcoin payments from two very different perspectives.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re someone who just wants to enable BTC payments because you think it will attract new customers and you&rsquo;re not actually interested in the ideas behind digital cash, then you may be better off going with BitPay. They&rsquo;ll be able to turn all of your cryptocurrency payments into fiat currency, helping you avoid any volatility risk. Additionally, there is an actual company you can call for help in case anything goes wrong. (In case of BTCPay Server, you would need to ask the community for help and sometimes pay for it).</p><p>If you&rsquo;re more interested in Bitcoin from a philosophical point of view, then you may want to take a closer look at BTCPay Server. While the company plans to introduce crypto to fiat conversion in an unspecified future, you can already convert your cryptocurrency payments on your own without permission from a company to enable payments for a cryptocurrency that is supposed to be permissionless in nature. In other words, BTCPay Server is for people who actually have a need for a form of censorship-resistant digital cash.</p>
