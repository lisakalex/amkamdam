										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Inuit, an indigenous people in the northern Canada town of Rigolet, Labrador, regularly face a challenging scenario &mdash; frozen rivers and streams are their only transportation routes in and out of town. With the impact of climate change, consistently warmer temperatures have created dangerous pathways for travel. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ab/4e217f1f2a.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ab/4e217f1f2a.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5ab/4e217f1f2a.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5ab/4e217f1f2a.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5ab/4e217f1f2a.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5ab/4e217f1f2a.jpg 1280w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Traditional qamutik (sled), Cape Dorset. Source: Wikipedia/Ansgar Walk</figcaption></figure><p>Amid these heightened concerns, blockchain has now emerged as a potential solution. Leading the charge by way of an experimental project in this space is RightMesh, a mobile mesh networking platform that employs blockchain&rsquo;s decentralized ledger application to chronologically track information.</p><p>The eNuk application is what allows local Rigolet residents to track changes in the environment. The underlying technology which enables browsing without a conventional internet connection is seen as a particularly valuable tool for remote areas with extremely unreliable internet connection.</p><p>Launched as a pilot in Rigolet in early 2017, the eNuk app was envisioned by Rigolet residents and built by way of a collaborative effort involving community members, local government officials, and researchers at Newfoundland&rsquo;s Memorial University and the University of Guelph in Ontario. <br>
Solid ice that once provided residents with a way to hunt and fish, or drive on ice highways between Rigolet and nearby communities, has grown dangerously thin in recent years. It&rsquo;s here where the app provides residents with a mobile tool to share and tag locations through text, pictures, or video. The broader aim:  To assist residents with identifying unpredictable environmental conditions, including ice thickness, tied to rising ocean temperatures that impede mobility and navigation.  </p><p>This initiative aligns with the United Nations belief that connectivity should be a basic human right because of the economic and social benefits it accords. The challenge facing remote towns like Rigolet with relatively small populations is that internet service providers lack the economic will from a return on investment standpoint to erect better infrastructure in those areas.</p><p><b>An immediate connection</b></p><p>In a phone interview Dr. Jason Ernst, Chief Networking Scientist at RightMesh was asked about the genesis of the project. Ernst has this to say: &ldquo;We got approached by some folks up in Rigolet who had been working with researchers from a couple of universities on things like climate data, human population medicine and things like that. As the southern-most  Inuit community in the world, they wanted to start collecting data about climate change because of the rapid environmental changes they&rsquo;ve experiencing.  Their intention was to document this, collect data and tell their story.&rdquo; </p><p>Ernst said the community approached a computer science professor working with a bunch of science students on a protocol to address these environmental issues. What they found was because there&rsquo;s no cell phone networks up there, people were having to go through a tedious process of going under the ice, capturing a picture of some potentially unsafe areas before bringing it back to the village where they could go onto their computer and upload the picture. </p><p>&ldquo;With something like Right Mesh you could eliminate a lot of that. Once you take a picture on your phone and return back to the community, it would automatically create connections with other phones and immediately connect people.&rdquo;</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ab/4e2e910474.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ab/4e2e910474.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5ab/4e2e910474.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5ab/4e2e910474.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5ab/4e2e910474.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Phone testing.</figcaption></figure><p>Ernst estimates that maintaining a decent network in Rigolet would require about 50 smartphones to be in use on the platform. He says if RightMesh is successful in executing this project,  there&rsquo;s a chance that other communities in northern Canada&mdash;and other remote parts of the world&mdash; would find interest in it. To this point, Ernst says that there have already been in talks with rural community leaders in Russia, Norway, and Iqaluit in Nunavut about this very thing. </p><p>Concludes Ernst: &ldquo;The full version of our solution isn&#8217;t expected to launch in Rigolet until late spring or early summer. In the meantime, it&rsquo;s interesting to watch how feedback from town residents is continuing to drive this project in new, sometimes completely unanticipated, directions.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p><i></i></p><p><b>How it works</b><br>
A mesh network could best be described as a set of interconnected Wi-Fi access points, or nodes, where users are not directly dependent on an internet service provider for connectivity. As a decentralized internet network, where devices function as both receivers and transmitters, the town of Rigolet is able to support the eNuk app. </p><p>With the mesh platform having been built on the Ethereum blockchain, RightMesh is able to reward users for sharing mobile device resources with an in-network cryptocurrency called MESH Tokens.<br>
The company is managing the technical aspects in collaboration with two Rigolet residents who are employed as research associates. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-regulator-targets-icos-in-a-regulatory-sweep-1307.htm">The recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) probe</a> into companies who are launching Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) might end up with a real mess, securities attorney Aaron Kaplan told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p><p>ICO issuers are running scared, whereas some investors may end up with illiquid assets that can&rsquo;t be traded, he said.</p><figure class="left"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5aa/375fac9dfb.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 300px, 300px" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5aa/375fac9dfb.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5aa/375fac9dfb.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5aa/375fac9dfb.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5aa/375fac9dfb.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In an interview, Kaplan, an associate at a law firm Gusrae Kaplan, and co-founder of Prometheum, a firm that assists startups seeking to pursue an legally compliant ICO, discusses the cloud of uncertainty surrounding ICO projects as the SEC pursue clampdowns and restrictions within the space.  </p><p><b>What sort of short-term ramifications can we expect to see in the ICO space with this recent action on the part of the SEC? </b></p><p>We think this is just the beginning &ndash; there&#8217;s going to be a big reckoning for those who have operated outside of the Federal Securities Laws, with more SEC enforcement actions and criminal prosecutions in the near future. Companies who have already completed extra-judicial ICOs &ndash; that is, outside the law &ndash; are at real risk. And investors in those securities may end up with illiquid assets that can&rsquo;t be traded. This could be a real mess.</p><p><b>What are you hearing from ICO issuers in response? What has been their reaction? </b></p><p>ICO issuers are running scared. Virtually every pending ICO is on hold while the industry gets a handle on how to do this legally. We&rsquo;ve had a ton of inbound interest at our firm from issuers and advisors in the past few days as rumors of the SEC sweep spread. </p><p><b>What is the distinction between what some are calling a &#8220;token sale&#8221; vs &#8220;ICO campaign?&#8221; </b></p><p>It depends on who you ask. &ldquo;Token sale&rdquo; is a bit of a nebulous term. It can be an umbrella term that covers the token pre-sale and the actual campaign itself. Generally, the term is used to refer to the token pre-sale offered to institutions and accredited investors before the campaign is available to the public. The ICO campaign is the public sale. </p><p><b>What are the key factors in determining whether a token is a security or not?</b></p><p>In the U.S. the determination of whether a token is an investment contract is based on the Howey Test, which considers whether there is an investment of money, with the expectation of profit, in a common enterprise where the profit comes from the efforts of others. The harsh reality is that the overwhelming majority of ICO tokens are investment contracts, and thus securities, and always have been. The proposition that utility tokens are not securities is nonsense. </p><p><b>Can you talk about the lack of SEC infrastructure and guidance in place for effective monitoring and compliance? </b></p><p>Regulation is inherently reactive. With the pace of technical innovation, it is hard for the SEC and virtually all other regulatory bodies to keep up, but the Federal Securities Laws always apply to securities. Enforcement actions are just an eventuality. It is not a matter of if, but when. <br>
The SEC, in fact, has formed a cyber unit specializing in these matters &ndash; essentially, its special operations troops &ndash; and they are well equipped to monitor ICOs for compliance.</p><p><b>What about U.S. investors with ICO stakes in other countries?</b></p><p>If an ICO offering touches the United States (meaning U.S. investors invest), then the Federal Securities Laws apply, and those ICO issuers should expect to receive a letter from the SEC if they violated U.S. securities laws. </p><p><b>What additional trends do you believe we&rsquo;ll see in this space over the next 12-18 months?</b></p><p>I certainly expect stepped-up enforcement actions from the SEC, and I think we&rsquo;ll see criminal prosecutions along with fines and maybe prison time for some.</p><p><b>And what will it take for ICO issuers to regain the approval and support of the SEC?</b></p><p>Abiding by the Federal Securities Laws.  The industry does not need to wait years for Congress, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the SEC to create new regulations.  Existing, compliant means of capital formation are available to ICO issuers under the Federal Securities Laws, and provide the best opportunity for ICO issuers that want to compliantly raise capital and not worry for five years (the statute of limitations) about whether the SEC will be sending them a nice little letter.</p><p>***</p><p><b><u>Background</u></b></p><p><i>In recent weeks SEC has handed down &#8220;dozens&#8221; of subpoenas and information involving ICOs. According to multiple media outlet reports, the SEC has sent requests to a number of companies and advisors involved in these campaigns amid mounting concerns about consumer protection. <br>
This development comes as ICOs continue to gain widespread attention among companies seeking to provide investors with &#8220;tokens&#8221; or niche cryptocurrencies in exchange for fiat money or even virtual assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. While these ICO have become a popular way for legitimate blockchain related startups to raise monies outside of traditional mechanisms like Initial Public Offerings or angel investments, fraudulent schemes known as &ldquo;pump and dump&rdquo;continue to take place.  <br>
&#8220;Pump and dump&#8221; is a type of securities fraud which involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading statements, with the intent to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. <br>
The SEC is now in the throes of determining whether or not ICOs are protected by securities law. Currently, if an investor gets scammed out of their funds, they can attempt to take a company to court. Ultimately though they have little recourse because ICO due to their unregulated nature are challenging for courts to rule on. This is particularly true if an ICO project is abroad. <br>
If ICOs are ever  classified as securities, protections will need to be in place for investors and traders to be evaluated.  Moreover advisory firms and individuals will need to have a solid, in-depth knowledge of how securities events are properly conducted &mdash; an element missing in the vast majority of token sales today.<br>
There is also a faction in the global cryptocurrency space that is resistant to the idea of regulatory oversight, utilizing language such as &#8220;utility tokens&#8221; and &ldquo;token sales&rdquo; to steer around any existing regulatory edicts. To date, no ICOs have registered as securities with SEC.<br>
Via a public statement released on December 11, 2017,  SEC chairman Jay Clayton noted that defining a token as a utility or otherwise does not &#8220;prevent the token from being a security.&#8221; Additionally, he warned about the practice of adding the term &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; to a project to boost prices without anything blockchain-related to show for it. </i></p>
