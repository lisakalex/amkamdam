<h2>A Closer Look at the Cryptocurrencies with the Most Upside</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With so many ways to make money with cryptocurrency finding the top digital assets with the most upside potential is at the top of most investors&#8217; to-do lists. At any particular time, there are potentially hundreds of cryptocurrencies with impressive upside potential. </p>
<p>But with more than 30,000 cryptocurrencies now in existence, it can be a challenge to pick out the most undervalued cryptos on the market.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we scoured the market to find the crypto with the most upside potential. Looking at key factors like market capitalization, hype, trends, development stage, and potential addressable market, we found nine worthy candidates that could become the most profitable cryptos in 2023.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Crypto With The Most Upside Potential Due To Its Links To Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval And High APY Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is a promising new crypto project with a massive upside potential, given Its ties to the anticipated approval of Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) by regulatory authorities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>Operating as an ERC-20 token, $BTCETF has a deflationary model to increase scarcity and value over time.</p>
<p>The project is currently in its presale phase, structured across ten stages. The token&#8217;s initial price was $0.005, which will increase to $0.0068 by the final presale stage. This pricing strategy offers early buyers the potential for significant upside.</p>
<p>Notably, the presale has already raised over $560,000 in just over a week, showing high investor interest and trust. </p>
<p>Of the total 2.1 billion $BTCETF tokens, 840 million are allocated for the presale, promoting fair distribution and setting a foundation for future price stability.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>A key feature of the Bitcoin ETF Token is its deflationary model. The <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF whitepaper</a> outlines a plan to burn 25% of the total token supply over time, tied to the achievement of significant milestones in the Bitcoin ETF space. </p>
<p>These milestones include the SEC&#8217;s approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, the launch of the first ETF, and Bitcoin reaching a $100k trading value. </p>
<p>Additionally, a 5% transaction tax is imposed on $BTCETF trades, which is set to decrease by 1% with the completion of each milestone, further aligning with the token&#8217;s deflationary strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>$BTCETF offers one of the highest Annual Percentage Yields (APY) for stakers, currently standing at over 400%. This high yield is particularly advantageous for early adopters as it will decrease once more people join the staking pool.</p>
<p>Over 64 million tokens have already been staked at the time of writing, indicating strong investor confidence. </p>
<p>A quarter of the total supply is dedicated to staking rewards, encouraging long-term holding and involvement in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Investors interested in $BTCETF can buy tokens using Ethereum wallets like MetaMask, with payment options including Ether, Tether, MATIC, Binance Coin, or card payments. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Emerging Crypto That Allows For BTC Cloud Mining With A $10 Investment</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a> is our next pick as the crypto with the most upside potential, at the present time. It has an ambitious hard cap of $33 million, which will be used to further its operations of revolutionizing the BTC cloud mining industry. </p>
<p>At present, Bitcoin mining is dominated by large, centralized mining operations. Mining factories have millions of dollars worth of equipment and it is known to be an environmentally damaging process, as well as very noisy. It&#8217;s impossible for regular investors to compete. Even the BTC cloud mining industry is beset with many shady providers and higher upfront investment costs. So there is no viable way to mine Bitcoin, as was originally intended. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125758" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Presale Page" width="900" height="443" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-768x378.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Until Bitcoin Minetrix can along with the world’s first stake-to-mine. This is an Ethereum-powered presale where users can simply purchase and stake $BTCMTX, earn cloud mining credits, and burn them for Bitcoin. It’s a simple yet ingenious concept. Staking $BTCMTX generates non-transferrable ERC20 token credits that can be burned in exchange for Bitcoin cloud mining power.</p>
<p>It makes the market open to the average retail investor. The miner can choose to burn, stake, or withdraw tokens through a single dashboard. This gives them complete control to manage their operations, all with just a $10 upfront investment cost. The dashboard provides an overview of daily, monthly, and weekly rewards. It also presents key metrics such as ‘Mining Credits Earned’ and ‘Mining Power Bought’.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-126166" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698936283-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-59-49.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Staking Dashboard" width="900" height="327" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698936283-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-59-49.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698936283-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-59-49-300x109.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698936283-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-59-49-768x279.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Right now, the PoS APY for this project is about 190% with over 220 million staked coins. The presale is also running a $30k ‘Minedrop’ for further incentivization. This consists of 10 drops, each worth $3K. </p>
<p>The current price per token is $0.0114, though this will rise to $0.0148 by the final stage (stage 39). Needless to say, earlier investment generates greater benefits, in terms of both APY and price differentials. </p>

<h3>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; High Upside Crypto With 112% APY And New Meme Combat Style</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat"><u>Meme Kombat ($MK)</u></a> is a new paradigm in Web3 gaming, as it combines meme icons together under one umbrella. </p>
<p>The world’s most famous memes (Shiba Inu, Floki, Doge, Pepe, etc) battle it out one vs one, while spectators bet on the outcome.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/332613/screen-shot-2023-10-04-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" /></figure>
<p>This is quite an intelligent strategy because it means that it can capture some of the appeal of the individual meme icons. Doge and Shiba Inu are known to have millions of online followers, and the meme industry can offer extreme upside potential. </p>
<p>Yet it has also created an engaging gameplay enhanced with AI-rendered battle illustrations, a variety of betting options, and decentralized processing for combat outcomes.</p>
<p>This means that the battles are randomly selected and there is little chance for any manipulation. Rewards are automatically processed on chain. </p>
<p>The founder of this presale has made his identity <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattw8047814774/">publicly accessible</a>, and it has further undergone a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cmzG-n6ziqdjBfYU7DoRdSHzcxWXImk/view">smart contract audit </a>&#8211; so it scores very highly in terms of its overall transparency.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/332615/screen-shot-2023-10-04-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>There is a total of 120 million tokens, of which 6 million are being made available in the presale, at a price of just $0.1667. 50% of the total token allocated goes to the presale, 30% to staking, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to community rewards. Nothing has been allocated to the core team, and much of it has been given away as rewards and staking.</p>
<p>Season One will feature Eleven of the world&#8217;s most loved meme icons &#8211; Pepe, Pepe 2, Shiba, Sponge, Doge, Floki, Baby Doge, Milady, Kishu, Mong, and Wojack. More seasons will follow with new characters and betting options.</p>
<p>The three primary betting options are P v P, P v Game, and Direct. But it also allows for side betting opportunities, to make the gameplay even more interesting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meme Kombat New 100x Potential Meme Coin Crypto Presale LIVE - 112% Staking Rewards &#x1f680;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pf5esWyKM5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is an innovative new high upside crypto with a strategy that has not been introduced before. It has a number of ROI verticals for investors and AI-enhanced combat.</p>
<p>This could be a 10x, or even a 100x token, if it gets some momentum behind it.</p>

<h3><br />4. Wall Street Memes &#8211; 100% Community-Backed Meme Token Offering Huge Growth Potential, Token Live on OKX </h3>
<p>While established cryptos, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), already boast a huge market cap, new tokens may offer a greater chance of 10x &#8211; 100x price increases. Therefore, diversifying into token presales such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes</a> ($WSM) can be one way to invest in crypto. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/312916/wsm-6-8m-raised.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token presale page" /></figure>
<p>While presales are high-risk investments, Wall Street Memes has already managed to raise nearly $7 million within a few weeks of its presale. Furthermore, this meme token stands out from other meme coins such as $PEPE and $LADYS. For starters, Wall Street Memes is an established meme platform with over 1 million followers.</p>
<p>Secondly, the creators of Wall Street Memes have garnered success with their NFT project, Wall St Bulls. In the first NFT collection drop, 10,000 Ethereum NFTs were sold out within half an hour. Thus, this meme movement wants to dominate the crypto space with the $WSM token. </p>
<p>$WSM will be a 100% community token. Moreover, the low supply of 2 billion can help the price increase in the long term as the adoption rises. Half of the token supply has been allocated for the ongoing presale. 1 billion $WSM tokens are being distributed across 30 presale rounds, with the price increasing per round. </p>

<p>Wall Street Memes raised over $25 million and was one of the most successful presales of 2023. The token is now live on OKX and other large T1 exchanges. </p>

<h3>6. Chimpzee – The Best Green Crypto Investment of 2023</h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency with the highest upside in 2023 is <a href="/ext/chimpzee/"><u>Chimpzee</u></a>. An excellent financial, social, and passive investment, Chimpzee has developed a unique blockchain tool against climate action and wildlife protection.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/277411/image1.jpg" alt="Chimpzee web3 project" /></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is set apart by its three-pillared ecosystem dedicated to reinvigorating these initiatives through crypto incentivization. Here is a brief look at how it works. </p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify">Chimpzee earmarks 10% of its token supply and a share of its profits to organizations dedicated to saving animals, stopping deforestation, and fighting climate change.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The limited collections of Chimpzee NFT passports will give holders multiple benefits and rewards. </li>
<li style="text-align: justify">CHMPZ coins will be used for a broad range of payments in the ecosystem. </li>
<li style="text-align: justify">CHMPZ coins used to buy the Chimpzee NFT Passports will be burned (up to 10% of the total circulating supply). </li>
<li style="text-align: justify">They are then taken out of circulation, bolstering the value of both the tokens and the NFTs in the open market. </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">Given that we’re inching closer to a worldwide climate crisis, everyone needs to make eco-conscious efforts to save Earth from mass destruction. Traditional initiatives have proven ineffective for the cause.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Chimpzee aims to change this through its three-pillared ecosystem which covers play to earn (The Zero Tolerance Game), Trade to earn (NFT marketplace), and Shop to earn (Merchandise store).</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/277412/image2.jpg" alt="Chimpzee token presale stages" /></figure>
<p>You can join any of these platforms to earn attractive CHMPZ rewards. It is also worth noting that The Giving Block, One Tree Planted, and the Wild Foundation have joined Chimpzee’s mission. If you’re looking to invest in the project, don’t wait long. It is now hosting the CHMPZ presale for attractive discounts and bonuses in different stages. In fact, up to 100% free bonus CHMPZ coins await early investors.</p>

<h3>8. Battle Infinity (IBAT) &#8211; High Risk High Reward Cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>With the goal to revolutionize the gaming industry by coupling gaming with blockchain and the metaverse, <a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> recently launched to a ready and waiting audience.</p>
<p>As fantasy sports play-to-earn Battle Arena, Battle Infinity will allow players to access a range of crypto-enabled battle games for a rewarding and entertaining experience.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/220864/screenshot-2022-09-16-at-12-47-44.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity crypto project roadmap" /></figure>
<p>At the heart of the Battle Infinity economy is the IBAT token. This is required to access the suite of products available within the Battle Infinity ecosystem (its gaming metaverse). These include: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IBAT Premier League:</strong> An NFT-based fantasy sports game where users can battle head-to-head to earn rewards.</li>
<li><strong>IBAT Battle Swap</strong>: A platform where users can buy IBAT and convert their winnings to other low and high risk cryptos. This is linked directly to the marketplace, the game store and the arena — making trades and token swaps hassle-free.</li>
<li><strong>IBAT Battle Games</strong>: An NFT-based multiplayer game store that features games with strong play-to-earn mechanics.</li>
<li><strong>IBAT Battle Market</strong>: A marketplace where any tokenized BEP721 digital goods can be exchanged, including in-game assets from the IBAT Battle Games;</li>
<li><strong>IBAT Battle Arena</strong>: A playground for players to showcase their avatars and explore the metaverse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Launched on exhcanges less than a month ago and with a market cap of $10m, IBAT fits many of the characteristics of a high risk high reward cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>But given the huge range of features and significant token utility, it appears to have substantial <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long-term potential</a> for growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Battle Infinity</a>
<h3>9. Bitcoin (BTC) &#8211; Cryptocurrency with the Most Upside Potential</h3>
<p>By far the best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is a worldwide phenomenon in its own right. As the very first blockchain-based digital asset that has been slowly gaining momentum since 2009, Bitcoin kickstarted an entire industry and is widely regarded as the gold standard in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Both cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology were invented by the so-called ‘father of Bitcoin’ — Satoshi Nakamoto, its enigmatic inventor and a legend in his/her/their own right.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/252894/btc-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Bitcoin price chart" /></figure>
<p>It wasn’t until 2013 when BTC reached well over $1,000 that the concept started to gain serious traction. Since then, the idea of digital assets living on a blockchain ledger has caught on, leading to the rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency space — with tens of thousands of crypto coins now populating the market today.</p>
<p>Within just over a decade, Bitcoin has gone from $0 to a peak of over $68,500 in November 2021 — providing a roughly six million percent return on investment for early holders. It has frequently been estimated that Bitcoin can reach over $100,000 &#8211; or potentially even $1 million &#8211; in the coming years as demand for an inflation-resistant and censorship-resistant asset grows.</p>
<p>If this holds true, Bitcoin may very well be the cryptocurrency with the most upside potential long term. It&#8217;s also one of the few mining <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-work-coins.htm">Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p>What makes BTC exciting is that it has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, most of which have already entered circulation. The emission of the remaining supply is set to half every four years while both retail and institutional adoption grows with time. This provides a recipe for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long-term growth</a>, allowing Bitcoin to become well-known as the highest upside cryptocurrency.</p>

<p><i>Crypto assets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3>10. Ethereum Name Service (ENS) &#8211; High Risk Crypto DNS Provider</h3>
<p>Launched in November 2021, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the most widely used integrated blockchain naming standard. Currently supporting more than 2.1 million names, 506 integrations, and 541,000 unique owners, it has already achieved a great deal of success.</p>
<p>The platform acts as a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. Its naming service includes wallet names, websites, avatars, and practically anything Web3-related. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/220867/screenshot-2022-09-16-at-12-51-53.jpg" alt="Ethereum Name Service price chart" /></figure>
<p>Access to the naming service is available to anyone with an internet connection directly via the app, which makes it easy to find, acquire, and manage a human-readable name for their on-chain wallets and assets.</p>
<p>The platform has its own native token, known as ENS. This is the primary governance token for the Ethereum Name Service, allowing holders to table and vote on proposals that change how it operates — ensuring it always aligns with the will of the community.</p>
<p>Due to the unlimited application potential, ENS falls in the category of cryptos with the biggest upsides. However, it can also be considered high risk, due to the sheer number of competitors and competing blockchains that now exist.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the value of ENS has shown remarkable strength in recent times, despite the overall crypto market downtrend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy ENS on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3>11. dYdX (DYDX) &#8211; High Risk High Reward Perpetual Contracts Exchange </h3>
<p>dYdX is a popular crypto exchange running on the Starkware Layer 2 protocol. Since it launched in February 2021, it has achieved an impressive aggregate trading volume of over $690 billion, and regularly clocks in more than $1 billion in daily trading volume.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/220868/screenshot-2022-09-16-at-12-52-18.jpg" alt="DYDX to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>The derivatives platform is unusual in that it can be accessed from a web browser as well as a mobile device, reducing barriers to entry. It also allows users to trade with up to 20x leverage in a completely decentralized fashion — leading the market for decentralized perpetual contracts.</p>
<p>The platform is constantly being updated to improve the UI/UX experience and grow the number of contracts available to trade. Likewise, thanks to the low fees and fast execution times enabled by the L2 solution, it is popular among both professional and institutional traders.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s native governance token is known as DYDX. This gives users to ability to vote on how the protocol operates — including trading fees, partner incentives, development goals, and more. </p>
<p>But since derivatives are a highly regulated industry, there is a chance this could adversely impact dYdX and the DYDX token — making it a high risk high reward cryptocurrency.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy DYDX on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3>12. Primal (PRIMAL) &#8211; Low Cap Move-to-Earn and Athlete Engagement Platform</h3>
<p>The sports industry is huge and is currently estimated to have a global market size of at least $300 billion, attracting huge attention, sponsorship funding, and fan engagement. </p>
<p>Blockchain technology is now being used to push innovation in the sports industry by powering a range of tokenized fan engagement platforms. These often use a range of technologies, including blockchain, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and play-to-earn games to improve the experience for fans and unlock new revenue streams for brands and sports stars.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/220869/screenshot-2022-09-16-at-12-53-07.jpg" alt="Primal web3 project" /></figure>
<p>Primal, a fan-based infrastructure project is one of the projects innovating in this arena and looks to blend move-to-earn and fan-athlete experience tokenization to a broader audience. </p>
<p>The platform enables users to engage with any sport or workout while wearing a fitness tracker device. Its users are able to join the inner circle of athletes and train with their favorite sports stars — all while being rewarded with athlete fan tokens that can be traded, spent on rewards, or cashed out.</p>
<p>The platform will use three tokens: a reward token known as ENRGY; an in-app workout reward token called COMBAT, and PRIMAL — the governance token used to shape the platform and fine-tune its economics.</p>
<p>With strong connections to the Step App project, which recently achieved 14,800% returns for public sale participants, Primal could be the crypto with the most upside potential in 2023. It’s still early-stage, having only just completed its private sale, but looks to be a promising prospect for 2023.</p>
<h3>13. Univers (VRS) &#8211; Metaverse Crypto with the Huge Potential Upside</h3>
<p>The metaverse is widely considered to be the future of the internet, providing people with new opportunities to work, play, socialize, and relax. </p>
<p>But until now, the vast majority of metaverse projects have lacked one crucial feature — interconnectivity. Indeed, most metaverses are actually simple closed-off ecosystems that are disconnected from other virtual worlds.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/220870/screenshot-2022-09-16-at-12-54-21.jpg" alt="Univers crypto project" /></figure>
<p>But the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-coins.htm">best metaverse projects</a> do it differently. This includes Univers, a platform that is building the infrastructure for creating, connecting, and enriching virtual games/worlds using blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Focused on metaverse scalability and interconnectivity between, Univers looks to shake up the metaverse space and break up the siloed metaverse landscape of today.</p>
<p>Incubated by Kucoin labs and backed by Polygon studios as well as other notable partners, the VRS token is used to govern the Univers Network economy.</p>
<p>As an early-stage project with a low $729,000 initial market cap, VRS fits squarely into the high risk high reward category. That said, it is focused on powering what may become a trillion-dollar industry, painting it as a contender for this year’s crypto with the most upside potential.</p>
<h3>14. Gunfire AVAX (GUNX) &#8211; High Risk High Reward P2E Game</h3>
<p>With an estimated market size of <a href="https://www.invesco.com/uk/en/country-splash.html?src=%2Fuk%2Fen%2Finsights%2Fwhen-gaming-meets-finance.html">$180.3 billion in 2021</a>, it is no surprise that the blockchain gaming narrative is becoming mainstream. While the crypto gaming landscape has seen several GameFi projects rise and fall, the industry is still bustling with innovation and promise.</p>
<p>Gunfire is one such project that holds a lot of potential but its token economy is still in its early stages of development. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/220871/screenshot-2022-09-16-at-12-56-20.jpg" alt="Gunfire NFT game" /></figure>
<p>Built as a 2D shooting game on Avalanche, Gunfire AVAX looks to bring high-octane gaming to the Avalanche ecosystem and leverages a finely-tuned play-to-earn system to reward players for their in-game triumphs in the form of AVAX tokens.</p>
<p>The game has been available to play since summer and is quickly gaining a reputation as the world’s first blockchain-driven tournament-only game.</p>
<p>Assuming that the token launch rumors are accurate, the earning model is likely to change in the near future, placing the native GUNX token at the center of the Gunfire economy. Until now weekly tournaments, the NFT marketplace, and referral programs were the only ways to dive into the game.</p>
<p>The game already has an active and growing community, but can still be considered a high risk high reward cryptocurrency due to its huge addressable market but still relatively unproven product.</p>
<h2>Why do Investors Choose High Risk High Reward Cryptos?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are well-known as perhaps the most lucrative asset class of all time &#8211; but they’re not completely without risk. </p>
<p>Given their extreme volatility, the value of cryptocurrencies can swing wildly in either direction. The goal of cryptocurrency investors is to select assets that stand to gain more than they could possibly lose.</p>
<p>As such, digital assets can be stratified into three risk tiers: low, medium, and high risk cryptos. Typically, cryptocurrencies with a lower risk profile have the lowest potential upside — since they tend to be well-known, widely used, and heavily traded. Conversely, high risk cryptocurrencies tend to have the most growth potential, but also the highest chance of failing.</p>
<p>Many traders opt to trade high risk high reward cryptocurrency since they can represent asymmetric risk opportunities. Put simply, some high risk cryptos can lose a maximum of 100% of their value, but could potentially gain far more than 100%.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the last two years alone, dozens of so-called “high risk crypto assets” have recorded well over 10,000% returns for early investors.</p>
<p>This includes the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shiba Inu (SHIBA)</strong>: 43,000,000% (43 million percent) growth in 2021</li>
<li><strong>Terra (LUNA)</strong>: 13,000% growth in 2021</li>
<li><strong>Axie Infinity (AXS)</strong>: 12,000% growth in 2021</li>
<li><strong>Solana (SOL):</strong> 10,000% growth in 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the investor’s job to identify the cryptos with the highest upside for the lowest risk. Cryptocurrencies with an excellent risk/reward ratio can make excellent investments, but in most cases, investors should invest just a small amount of their capital in this category.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that most high risk cryptos don’t keep climbing forever. So traders need to identify their exit points even when trading assets with a lot of potential left. The risk/reward ratio of an asset can skew toward excess risk when it has already appreciated considerably.</p>
<p>Those with a very limited investment budget may be inclined to search out the best high risk high reward crypto assets since they can represent opportunities to strike it rich without risking a large sum. After all, had someone invested $100 into Shiba Inu on January 01, 2021, and held until today, their investment would be worth $15 million.</p>
<p>That being said, few investors actually manage to hold onto their assets long enough to achieve such staggering returns — continuing to hold an asset that has already multiplied 10,000% or even 100,000% is no simple feat.</p>
<h2>How to Find the Best High Risk High Reward Crypto</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As you might expect, the vast majority of high risk cryptocurrencies fail to achieve notable success. Simply investing in random high risk cryptos would likely result in painful losses that could have been easily avoided with better project selection.</p>
<p>If you take the time to survey the landscape, you will find that the cryptos with the biggest upside tend to have features in common — such as an extremely low initial market capitalization, feverish hype and community sentiment, and an ambitious development schedule. </p>
<p>But given the sheer number of projects to sort through, finding the right opportunities can be time-consuming.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are several ways to make finding the best high risk high reward cryptocurrencies a much quicker and easier task. These include:</p>
<h3>Filter Through Low Caps</h3>
<p>Low cap cryptocurrencies are defined as those with a low market capitalization. Many traders consider any cryptocurrency with a circulating market capitalization of less than $10 million to be a low cap.</p>
<p>These can represent asymmetric investment opportunities since they are still largely under the radar and their long-term potential might not be priced in.</p>
<p>Many of today’s largest projects started off life as a low cap but had the right mix of fundamentals to achieve considerable growth.</p>
<p>Popular aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko can be used to find low-cap cryptocurrencies, after which you can do further research to determine their viability.</p>
<h3>Leverage Dextools</h3>
<p>Dextools and similar platforms like Poocoin and Cryptokek can be used to quickly identify cryptocurrencies at their very earliest stages — that is, when they are first listed on popular decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or PancakeSwap.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/220873/screenshot-2022-09-16-at-13-00-05.jpg" alt="DEXTboard crypto pairs" /></figure>
<p>By spotting these assets shortly after their initial listing, you can scoop them up at the lowest possible prices.</p>
<p>This system should only be used to identify potential cryptos with the highest upside, after which you should do more in-depth research to get a better grasp of their fundamental strength before considering an investment.</p>
<p>Most of these will have little to no utility, and practically zero long-term potential. But some have the right stuff to defy the odds.</p>
<h3>Consider Meme Coins</h3>
<p>Despite their comical origins and frequent lack of real ambition or utility, some meme coins are no joke. </p>
<p>Throughout 2020 and 2021, several of the best-performing projects were meme coins. With assets like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Dogelon Mars, Baby Doge, and SafeMoon achieving staggering returns for early investors.</p>
<p>As such, if you’re looking for the cryptocurrency with the most upside potential or the best high risk high reward crypto, meme coins like Tamadoge are worth considering. </p>
<p>Early-stage meme coins can often be found by searching Twitter using the #memecoin hashtag, or by diving into newly listed DEX tokens via Dextools or Cryptokek.</p>
<h3>Forked Coins</h3>
<p>Layer 1 gas coins are unusual among cryptocurrencies in that they can be forked. When a difference in opinion causes a schism in the community, this can lead to the production of fork coins and tokens.</p>
<p>Some of the highest upside cryptocurrency coins ever have resulted from forks. Including well-known assets like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Terra (LUNA), and Bitcoin SV (BSV).</p>
<p>To put the potential returns into perspective, Bitcoin Cash opened on public markets at around $290 per coin but reached a peak value of $3,785 a month later — equivalent to a return of 1,200% in just four weeks. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87843/220872/screenshot-2022-09-16-at-12-58-23.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency price chart" /></figure>
<p>Though most forks never go on to develop much traction and remain almost worthless, some can develop a thriving ecosystem in their own right. Because of this, fork coins can be considered a type of high risk high reward cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>In most cases, prominent forks will be well publicized before launch, giving you enough time to research their strength before investing.</p>
<h3>Browse Presales</h3>
<p>In many cases, cryptocurrencies are sold to investors in different early-stage rounds, giving early participants the opportunity to buy tokens at the lowest possible prices before they list on an exchange and become available to secondary market buyers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the discount these early-stage investors get is significant, allowing them to secure a sizeable profit if the asset is popular on secondary markets.</p>
<p>TAMA, for example, sold out its presale in less than eight weeks, raising $19 million and is now listed on OKX, while IMPT raised $500,000 in less than 48 hours.</p>
<p>When buying high-risk cryptos, the lower your entry price and the earlier you enter the better. This is why the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> can represent excellent opportunities for high-risk crypto connoisseurs. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In your search for the crypto with the most upside potential, you will almost certainly stumble across meme coins, low caps, and early-stage projects that have a high amount of risk associated with them. </p>
<p>Your job is to find the cryptos with the highest upside but lowest possible risk. By taking positions in cryptocurrencies with an excellent risk-to-reward ratio, you can maximize your chance of securing considerable returns.</p>
<p>Barring rare exceptions, high risk high, reward cryptocurrencies are the only reliable way to achieve substantial returns from a single investment.</p>
<p>One of the tokens boasting upside potential right now is Bitcoin ETF Token. It offers over 400% APY, a dynamic token burn strategy for long-term growth, and a discounted presale price.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Which cryptocurrency has the most upside potential?</strong></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry is as wide as it is deep. Stand-out cryptocurrencies across all sectors and niches have the potential to generate substantial upside returns but finding these at an early stage is easier said than done. </p>
<p>That said, it is widely acknowledged that meme coins, low caps, and presale stage projects often represent the best investment opportunities, but can be considered high risk and high reward. As such, Wall Street Memes is a solid project well worth consideration. It is already creating waves in the investor community by seeing a successful presale so far, having raised more than $6.8 million.</p>
<p><strong>What is a high risk/high reward crypto?</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are well-known to be one of the most profitable asset classes of all time. But even within the sector, there is a class of coins/tokens that stand out as the most profitable — these are known as high risk, high reward cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The cryptos with the highest upside also tend to have the highest associated risk — since they’re often very early stage, obscure, unproven, or highly speculative. They generally have a very low market capitalization and have an excellent risk-to-reward ratio.</p>
<p>This makes them attractive investments for those looking to secure the highest possible returns.</p>

<h2>Reviewing the Top Cryptocurrencies to Watch Right Now</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Despite the prevailing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/whats-bear-market.htm"><u>bear market</u></a>, cryptocurrencies remain by far the most lucrative asset class for investment — having the extraordinary capacity to claw back losses in record time and achieve staggering heights over the long term. </p>
<p>But we’ve all got a limited ability to focus our attention. Deciding which cryptocurrencies to watch and dive into can be a time-consuming and befuddling task that can put off some would-be investors — preventing them from taking a leap that could prove life-changing. </p>
<p>In this piece, we hope to simplify your decision-making process by highlighting the cryptocurrencies we think are worth paying close attention to in 2023.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) &#8211; Best Crypto To Watch With High Passive Income Potential And A Deflationary Mechanism</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is the best crypto to watch this year, particularly for those awaiting potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The token is designed to align its growth and rewards with the key milestones in the Bitcoin ETF landscape.</p>
<p>The presale of $BTCETF is split into 10 stages, with more rewards offered to people who enter early. The token price starts at $0.005 and is set to rise to $0.0068 by the final stage, offering an immediate gain for early investors.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token raised over $820K within 10 days of launch, highlighting strong investor trust and confidence.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF whitepaper</a>, with a total supply of 2.1 billion tokens, $BTCETF adopts a deflationary model. </p>
<p>The project plans to burn 525 million tokens, 25% of the total supply, in stages linked to the Bitcoin spot ETF&#8217;s regulatory and market milestones. </p>
<p>These milestones include the approval and launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, the token reaching $100 million trading volume, and Bitcoin’s price hitting over $100,000. This strategic burning is expected to reduce supply and potentially increase the token&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>A main attraction for $BTCETF holders is the opportunity to earn high staking rewards, currently over 300% APY in the early presale stages. </p>
<p>This rate is anticipated to decrease as more tokens get staked, making early participation more rewarding.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Investors can buy the tokens using cryptos like Ethereum, MATIC, BNB, USDT, or even by a card after linking a wallet like MetaMask to the presale site.</p>
<p>The project focuses on community involvement, inviting potential investors to join the <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Bitcoin ETF Token Telegram channel</a> and stay updated with the latest information.</p>

<p>Crypto mining can be an expensive process due to the costs of setting up mining rigs and purchasing advanced equipment and hardware. Therefore, Bitcoin Minetrix will offer rented mining times to users. However, Bitcoin Minetrix is one of the first platforms to leverage blockchain technology to tokenize cloud mining credits. </p>
<p>$BTCMTX can be staked on Bitcoin Minetrix’s Ethereum-based staking contracts to generate ERC-20 cloud mining credits. These credits can be burned on the ecosystem to get Bitcoin cloud mining power. Therefore, individuals can access allocated mining times and earn a share of mining revenues. </p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix also offers passive income to staked token holders. At the time of writing, staking $BTCMTX results in an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) of over 190%. From a low supply of 4 billion tokens &#8211; 70% of the token supply has been allocated equally across twenty presale rounds. </p>
<p>Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at just $0.0114 per token. By the final presale stage, the price will soar to $0.0148.<!-- notionvc: 5a0755ca-803e-4e56-8ce7-d9e14f734e21 --> In only a month since the presale launched, Bitcoin Minetrix has raised over $3.1 million. Bitcoin Minetrix aims to raise a presale hard cap of over $33.46 million. </p>

<h3><b>3. Meme Kombat (MK) &#8211; Fight with Meme Coin Avatars on a Battle Arena and Earn High Staking APYs</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/">Meme Kombat (MK)</a> combines the thrill of meme cryptocurrencies with the potential to earn passive income and in-game rewards. This new meme cryptocurrency is developing a Battle Arena &#8211; a Web3 ecosystem built using blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-124026" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home.png" alt="Meme Kombat home" width="900" height="418" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home.png 1439w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>On the battle arena, players can compete with each other by taking the form of popular meme coin characters. The battle arena will be launched in different seasons &#8211; mimicking the concept of popular games such as Fortnite. The first season will be launched after the end of the ongoing $MK presale and will feature 11 unique meme coin avatars. </p>
<p>This top cryptocurrency token has enjoyed a strong start to its presale &#8211; raising over $1.1M. Compared to other meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Meme Kombat boasts a low supply of 120 million. This can help make the token price competitive when there is an increase in demand. </p>
<p>30% of the token supply will be distributed as battle and staking rewards. Within the battle arena, users can wager their $MK tokens on live games. You can challenge opponents to a Player vs Player battle, and up the stake by wagering tokens. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-124027" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753939-meme-kombat-presale-apys.png" alt="Meme Kombat presale APYs" width="900" height="296" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753939-meme-kombat-presale-apys.png 1286w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753939-meme-kombat-presale-apys-300x99.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753939-meme-kombat-presale-apys-1024x337.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753939-meme-kombat-presale-apys-768x253.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Another way to earn on Meme Kombat is by staking the $MK token. Presale investors will witness their tokens get automatically locked on a staking contract until the presale ends. The APY (Annual Percentage Yield) in this period is 112%. After the presale ends, Meme Kombat will offer dynamic staking rewards &#8211; where returns are based on the staked amount on a large staking pool. </p>
<p>50% of the 120 million tokens supply has been distributed for the ongoing presale, as Meme Kombat hopes to raise $10 million. Currently, tokens are priced at just $0.1667.

<h3>4. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Wildly Popular Meme Token On Final Stage Before Tier 1 Exchange Listing, Last Chance at $0.0337</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes (WSM)</u></a> is definitely a top coin to look out for in 2023, for multiple reasons. It has raised over $25 million since launch, figures that dwarf most other presales, which have fundraising hard caps that typically range between $2 and $6 million. </p>
<p>The project is now in the final weeks of its presale with a tier-1 exchange listing expected at the end of September.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/327418/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="wall street memes presale" /></figure>
<p>It is a top crypto to watch as Elon Musk even made reference to Wall Street Memes in a Twitter comment, which is a positive signal as this celebrity has a history of pushing the price of DOGE (another meme token) upwards on several occasions.</p>
<p>Overall, the project has more than a million social media followers and has been a favorite since launching as an offshoot of the popular Wall Street Bets subreddit.</p>
<p>The presale campaign has a similar theme to previously successful tokens such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Both of these movements center around retail investors finally getting even with Wall Street fat cats. Periodically, the campaign releases hilarious memes that highlight the greed of corporate actors. </p>
<p>This is a theme that is very popular among laypeople who are not satisfied with the status quo. Wall Street Memes call itself the “King of Stonks” and the “Number #1 Meme Token”, and we have to agree with them in many respects.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/327419/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="wall street memes social following" /></figure>
<p>Wall Street Memes is in its final stage and is priced at $0.337. This might be the final opportunity to get this meme coin before it lists on a major exchange, where the price is likely to be much higher.</p>
<p>If it lists on a major exchange such as Binance, which is more than possible, it could benefit from a price increase above 41%, known as the “Binance Effect” &#8211; a centralized exchange listing is mentioned in its roadmap and is expected after the presale closes.</p>
<p>More information can be found on the <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram</u></a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4E538pzeGX"><u>Discord</u></a> socials. Twitter is a great place to find some of the latest memes from this project, where it cites some of the more recent economic and corporate figures. Its Twitter account has more than 250,000 followers. </p>
<p>This might be the final time to take part in Wall Street Memes before presale &#8211; make sure you don’t miss out on a top crypto for 2023. But you should also take care to read more about the project throuhh its <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> prior to investment. </p>

<h3>6. eTukTuk &#8211; Building Eco-Friendly Vehicles For TukTuk Drivers &amp; Promoting Financial Inclusion, $50,000 Raised in Low Cap Presale</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/eTukTuk/en"><u>eTukTuk (TUK)</u></a> is involved in more of a niche field as compared to many environmental initiatives. It’s specifically focused on the distribution of eco-friendly TukTuk vehicles in less developed regions. The TukTuk is a common means of transport in specific Asian countries but is considerably more environmentally damaging in comparison to cars. The electric vehicles can be charged at eco-friendly charging stations, maintained by territory partners. </p>
<p>eTukTuk looks for a solution that not only helps the environment but also assists in terms of social and economic inclusion. The transport industry is important in many poorer regions and drivers can find it difficult to make a living. The new electric vehicles will cut down on fuel costs considerably and the native token can be used by drivers to earn staking rewards and to make in-app purchases.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/327438/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="etuktuk presale website" /></figure>
<p>This campaign was launched from Sri Lanka, a region that ranks very poorly in terms of pollution. Sustainable transport has become a matter of national urgency, but it is well known that most individuals will not make changes unless financial incentives are attached. People in poorer regions are worried more about making a living than about preserving the environment, which is why the two have to be combined to make a definitive impact.</p>
<p>Thus far, the project has raised over $50,000, and it has a small hard cap of $120,000. It offers a substantial 40% discount if purchased at the presale stage. TUK is a BEP20 token with a total supply of 2 billion. The current price is $0.024 while the price at the next stage is $0.028. The token has been audited by Certik, a well-recognized third party.</p>

<h3>7. Chimpzee &#8211; An Eco-Friendly Project That Promotes Immediate Action and 20% APY Rewards, $1.3 Million Raised in Ongoing Presale</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/chimpzee/en"><u>Chimpzee (CHMPZ)</u></a> is a project on a mission to save the planet &#8211; and that’s not just hot air. The project has donated $15,000 to the protection of elephants and planted 20,000 trees at a time when its presale has not even been completed. This is not a common occurrence, with presales delivering little but empty promises and investors hoping that something is delivered down the line. </p>
<p>Chimpzee is further set apart due to having both a <a href="https://sourcehat.com/audits/ChimpzeeCoin/"><u>smart contract audit</u></a> and a <a href="https://github.com/coinscope-co/kyc/blob/main/chmpz/kyc.png"><u>KYC certificate from Coinscope.</u></a> No severe issues were found in the code. Moreover, Chimpzee allows users to earn up to 20% APY if they purchase a Diamond NFT passport. Silver and Bronze NFTs only allow for a 10% staking reward, though this is still relatively appealing. In total, there are 3 ways to earn an income through Chimpzee &#8211; Shop-To-Earn, Play-To-Earn, and Trade-To-Earn.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/327421/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="chimpzee presale website" /></figure>
<p>A major selling point of this project is that it is clear that it cares about the environment and is serious about protecting it. The <a href="https://www.chimpzee.io/assets/chimpzeeWhitepaper.pdf"><u>Chimpzee whitepaper</u></a> describes in detail the effects of deforestation and animal hunting and outlines how little is required for conservation. It also includes quotes from prominent environmentalists. </p>
<p>In terms of tokenomics, there are currently 89 billion CHPMZ that are set to be reduced to 50 billion. The total supply changes regularly because the project burns so many tokens. At present, over 100 billion tokens have already been burned, with another 50 billion being burned upon launch. </p>
<p>45% of the tokens are available in presale. There is no buying or selling tax with Chimpzee and the campaign plans to support many reputable organizations, including, Wild.org, Mercy for Animals, The Ellen Fund, Wildlife SOS, WeForest, Forgotten Animals, and more.</p>
<p>More info can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/RealChimpzee"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/officialchimpzeetelegramgroup"><u>Telegram</u></a> &#8211; more than $1.3 million has been raised in the presale so far.</p>

<h3>8. Scorpion Casino &#8211; Coin That Allows Users to Become Indirect Casino Owners Potentially Earning $10,000 in Staking Rewards</h3>
<p><a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/"><u>Scorpion Casino (SCORP)</u></a> is a new token that allows users to earn up to $10,000 in APY staking rewards, depending on how well the casino does. In a sense, it allows users to become casino owners and feel included. They are part of the casino itself. The SCORP token aims to be the leading cryptocurrency for gambling. The casino offers 30,000 betting opportunities, 210 casino games, and 160 live games. </p>
<p>Buying SCORP in presale confers a number of advantages. First is the difference in price between listing ($0.05) and the current presale price ($0.017). That’s about a 66% discount for those who make a presale purchase. Second, is that investors can benefit from 40% in casino credits. Finally, staking is actually available from the presale period. This is a rarity in presales, with staking usually offered after the presale is complete. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/327424/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="scorpion casino presale site" /></figure>
<p>SCORP is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token and there is an overall supply of 480,000,000. Through the presale, 50% of the tokens go to $SCORP holders as rewards while the other 50% is permanently burned, supporting $SCORP price appreciation. Of the overall supply, 40% goes to the presale, 20% to the liquidity, and 20% to staking rewards. The remainder is split between referrals, airdrops, bonuses, marketing, and advisors. </p>
<p>Scorpion Casino has definitely taken an innovative approach to online gambling. While it often takes $2 million and 6 &#8211; 18 months to launch an online casino, according to the Scorpion Casino webpage, this presale allows anybody to take part without needing significant amounts of capital.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/327425/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="scorpion casino license and audit" /></p>
<p>Wallet Connect and MetaMask can be used to make a purchase while USDT, ETH, and BNB are the accepted cryptocurrencies. While this coin might see impressive returns in 2023, it&#8217;s important to remember the risks inherent in all financial ventures and to read the <a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/static/media/Whitepaper.ac4ceb28f62e7fb2bb01.pdf"><u>whitepaper</u></a> to understand what they are. </p>
<p>It’s also good to keep in touch with the project via <a href="https://twitter.com/ScorpionCasino"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/scorpioncasino_official"><u>Telegram</u></a>. </p>

<h3>10. Yearn Finance (YFI) &#8211; Unlocking the Value in Idle Assets</h3>
<p>Next on our list of the top crypto to watch this week is Yearn Finance, a pioneer in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and a popular platform among investors.</p>
<p>The value proposition of the platform is simple, it allows you to stake your assets and earn a variable interest rate on your deposits. The platform achieves this by deploying your capital across a range of relatively safe and battle-tested strategies</p>
<p>Today, the platform offers well over 40 vaults covering popular cryptocurrencies like USDT, SUSHI, COMP, UNI, SNX, and more.</p>
<p>Given that Yearn Finance achieved an impressive total value locked (TVL) of almost $7 billion, it’s safe to say that its features are well-appreciated. But since yields have dropped due to the bear market its TVL has fallen considerably.</p>
<p>The Yearn Finance token (YFI) is down more than 90% since reaching its all-time high of $90,790 in 2021. It isn’t unreasonable to think that the platform could return to its former glory if/when the market recovers, making it one of the top cryptos to watch long-term.</p>

<h3>11. Solana (SOL) &#8211; Next-Generation Smart Contract Platform</h3>
<p>Widely regarded as one of the most advanced smart contract platforms, Solana has gathered a huge amount of momentum and captured the imagination of the crypto community since it launched in 2019.</p>
<p>The platform can now be considered a flourishing ecosystem of dApps — many of which are unique to the Solana platform. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/251396/screen-shot-2023-01-19-at-3-36-03-pm.jpg" alt="solana price chart" /></figure>
<p>Although it’s more than three years in the making, Solana can still be considered a new cryptocurrency to watch since it’s still in its beta release. Though it’s production ready, the platform has suffered from several hiccups in the last two years which have stunted its growth somewhat.</p>
<p>As an ultra-scalable, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-energy-efficient-cryptocurrency.htm">energy-efficient</a>, high-speed, and developer-friendly smart contract platform, some believe that Solana will be used to host the next generation of mass-market dApps. </p>
<p>The SOL coin is down more than 91% since reaching its all-time highest value back in November 2021 — giving it serious room for recovery and making it one of the top cryptos to watch.</p>
<div class="raw-html-embed">

<h3>12. Sweat Economy (SWEAT) &#8211; Unlocking Fitness Through Blockchain Rewards</h3>
<p>In 2021, the move-to-earn economy exploded into popularity, with several major projects offering users the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency rewards for simply keeping fit.</p>
<p>But until now, no project was able to strike the right balance between incentives, token utility, and growth. Leading to the collapse of most early move-to-earn projects.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/222196/screenshot-2022-09-22-at-17-21-16.jpg" alt="sweat wallet homepage graphic" /></figure>
<p>But Sweat Economy looks to be separating itself from the competition. Rather than paying unsustainable rewards to those that invest the most in the project, it has a finely tuned reward system that works to subtly incentivize fitness while remaining viable in the long term.</p>
<p>It’s one of the few <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-penny-crypto.htm">penny cryptos</a> to watch. With a token price currently hovering around $0.011 and a market capitalization of under $50 million, it’s far cheaper than competing projects. </p>
<p>But given that it already has 13 million wallet users and recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sweat-economy-launch-breaks-crypto-records.htm"><u>broke several records</u></a> regarding growth, it might just be the best cryptocurrency to watch in 2023 — having substantial room for further growth.</p>

<h3>13. SushiSwap (SUSHI) &#8211; Decentralized Finance Juggernaut</h3>
<p>Despite its comical name, SushiSwap is far from a joke. As it stands, it’s the seventh most popular decentralized exchange (DEX) by trading volume and a trusted name in the DeFi space.</p>
<p>The platform is popular for good reason. It provides a single access point to a whole array of DeFi tools and services. Beyond the decentralized exchange, it also offers a yield farm, a decentralized lending/borrowing market, a launchpad (known as MISO), and more.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/251397/screen-shot-2023-01-19-at-3-37-56-pm.jpg" alt="sushiswap price chart" /></figure>
<p>SushiSwap is well-known for its fast-paced development. Back in July 2022, the platform unveiled SushiXSwap — a cross-chain DEX that leverages LayerZero&#8217;s Stargate protocol to allow users to trade assets across seven different blockchains.</p>
<p>The platform has a large number of drivers to funnel value to the SUSHI token and given its history of pushing the envelope in innovation and utility, it’s definitely one of the cryptos to watch in 2023. </p>
<div class="raw-html-embed">

<h3>14. GameZone (GZONE) &#8211; Going Beyond Gaming Launchpads</h3>
<p>In late 2021, launchpads were a pillar of the early-stage crypto space. The sheer mass of new blockchain-enabled projects leveraged these platforms for both fundraising and user acquisition, helping to ensure a successful launch.</p>
<p>A launchpad is a platform where new project concepts are refined and incubated. Projects typically leverage these platforms to conduct their private or public sales prior to listing their token on centralized and/or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm"><u>top decentralized exchanges</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/222198/screenshot-2022-09-22-at-17-22-41.jpg" alt="gamezone staking features and rewards" /></figure>
<p>GameZone is a popular launchpad for gaming-centric projects and play-to-earn games. When it first launched, it quickly rose the ranks as it launched several prominent play-to-earn titles. To date, it has notched up 21 successful project launches. </p>
<p>Despite the adverse market conditions, the platform is still active and developing, and allows users to access the future of play-to-earn projects at their earliest stages of development. Users need to hold and stake the platform’s native utility token, GZONE, to access these sales.</p>
<p>For less than $300, users can access the lowest guaranteed tier on the platform. </p>
<p>It’s also a penny crypto, with GZONE currently coming in at $0.041. But with the staggering potential of GameFi and the potential resurgence of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/experts-attack-play-earn-but-games-like-battle-infinity-rely-on-skill.htm">play-to-earn</a>, it’s definitely a penny crypto to keep an eye on.</p>

<h3>15. The Sandbox (SAND) &#8211; Metaverse Made For Everyone</h3>
<p>Whether you’re a new or experienced crypto enthusiast, you’ve almost certainly heard of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-coins.htm"><u>‘metaverse’</u></a> — a blockchain-powered digital landscape and online environment.</p>
<p>The Sandbox is arguably the most feature-complete blockchain metaverse there is and a pioneer in the space. As a virtual space accessed over the internet, the Sandbox leverages the Ethereum blockchain to provide an environment where users can interact, as well as exchange goods and services.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/251398/screen-shot-2023-01-19-at-3-44-15-pm.jpg" alt="the sandboz price chart" /></figure>
<p>The platform empowers users to unleash their creative potential safely and anonymously. At the same time, it enables participants to monetize their creativity by building their own content or participating in a range of gaming experiences hosted in a pervasive virtual environment.</p>
<p>SAND is the platform’s native utility token and the primary means of exchange in the Sandbox metaverse. It achieved an all-time high value at $8.40 but is currently trading at below $1.</p>
<p>Given the near-limitless growth potential of the Metaverse, SAND certainly deserves a place among the best crypto to watch in 2023.</p>

<h3>16. Stacks (STX) &#8211; One of the Top Cryptos to Watch</h3>
<p>Despite popular belief that Bitcoin is a simple blockchain for peer-to-peer transfers, recent advances have shown that its capabilities extend well beyond simple payments.</p>
<p>Spearheading this exploration is Stacks, a platform that provides developers with a decentralized open-source network for building dApps, smart contracts, and digital assets for Bitcoin. All while taking advantage of Bitcoin’s security and network. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/222201/screenshot-2022-09-22-at-17-24-44.jpg" alt="stacks crypto homepage " /></figure>
<p>The Stacks and Bitcoin platforms are connected by a secure Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism. </p>
<p>Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has proven to be an immensely popular use case for this blockchain technology. By bringing this capability to Bitcoin, Stacks could help unlock its latent potential. </p>
<p>The platform’s native token, STX is currently down MORE THAN 90% from its peak value but can be seen as a strong candidate for the best crypto to watch in 2023 due to its huge long-term potential. </p>

<h3>17. Ethereum (ETH) &#8211; The Original Smart Contract Titan</h3>
<p>Ethereum is, without a doubt, a pioneer in the blockchain space. As the platform that made smart contracts available to the masses, it has solidified itself as the second most successful cryptocurrency platform (behind Bitcoin). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/251399/screen-shot-2023-01-19-at-3-46-39-pm.jpg" alt="ethereum coingecko price chart" /></figure>
<p>In 2022, Ethereum took a big leap by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-live-latest-news-updates.htm"><u>transitioning from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake</u></a> — dubbed the Merge — cutting its energy usage by 99.9% and setting the stage for further upgrades. It also dramatically reduced inflation, reducing the number of new ether (ETH) that enter the supply thanks to EIP-1559 and the new validator system.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, Ethereum will be deflationary whenever the average gas fee exceeds 15 gwei.</p>
<p>This, combined with its huge user base and developer community, as well as the rapid growth of its dApp ecosystem, means it remains a solid cryptocurrency to watch even seven years after its launch. </p>

<h3>18. Euler (EUL) &#8211; An Open Lending Disruptor</h3>
<p>Decentralized lending platforms are a staple in the DeFi ecosystem — allowing users to leverage up their exposure to the market and earn a passive income on their idle assets.</p>
<p>Euler deserves a place among new cryptos to watch thanks to its capacity to unlock the full potential of decentralized lending and borrowing. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88435/222205/screenshot-2022-09-22-at-17-26-52.jpg" alt="euler homepage" /></figure>
<p>Unlike other open lending platforms, Euler allows users to lend or borrow practically any asset. So long as the asset has a liquidity pool on Uniswap, it can be listed on the platform without permission.</p>
<p>The platform features both isolated and cross margin and feeless flash loans. It also uses time-weighted average pricing rather than spot-based oracle prices — making it more resistant to price manipulation attacks.</p>
<p>Though Euler faces stiff competition from the likes of Compound and Aave, its USP could see it blow both out of the water long term. Its total value locked (TVL) is also growing rapidly and tripled between June and September 2022.</p>
<p>Given its staggering potential, it’s one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to watch long-term.</p>

<h3>19. My Neighbor Alice (ALICE) &#8211; Play-to-Earn Crypto to Watch Today</h3>
<p>Widely regarded as one of the most profitable IDOs of 2021, My Neighbor Alice has become a phenomenon in its own right.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-games.htm">crypto game</a> blends aspects of popular life-simulation games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, with the unique properties of blockchain technology to power a novel play-to-earn experience.</p>

<h2>How We Select Crypto to Watch</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are unusual among speculative assets in that they can vary considerably in their promise and potential and can rise or collapse incredibly quickly.</p>
<p>While some cryptocurrencies are clear game-changers and almost certainly have a bright future ahead of them, others are more subtle or nuanced in their design, which can make their potential difficult to spot at first glance.</p>
<p>In our process of finding the most promising cryptos to watch in 2023, we try to separate the reality from the hype to see which potential crypto coins to watch have what it takes to achieve long-term success.</p>
<p>Practically, this means taking the market as a whole, identifying the narratives that will likely drive the future of crypto adoption, and using this to separate out a pool of candidates.</p>
<p>It is easy to find new coins with the likes of CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, CoinList and others all carrying long lists of new coins, while social media sites such as Reddit and Twitter are also great tools to find new projects.</p>
<p>However, once a coin grabs your attention, from there you must complete further research and do your due diligence. Easily spotted good points are a doxxed (public) team, strong social media buzz and well thought out and thorough roadmap and whitepaper.</p>
<p>Immediate red flags are an anonymous team and incomplete or badly presented websites and documents, while one must also be wary of social media bots and spam. You then must further refine your search to extract only the most robust options which we consider the top cryptos to watch this year.</p>
<p>Some of the filters we use when identifying new cryptocurrencies to watch include:</p>
<h3>Long-term potential</h3>
<p>The top crypto to watch this week all have one thing in common — they’ve got serious <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long-term potentia</a>l.</p>
<p>Put simply, this means they’ve both got staying power and the capacity to grow significantly over the long term. As has been seen time and time again, the most promising new cryptos to watch can have the potential to 10x or even 100x their value in just a few years — making them incredibly lucrative.</p>
<p>Some of the simplest ways to gauge the long-term potential of an asset are to examine the strength and background of its founding team, identify its value-adding backers and partners, estimate how demand for its services will change over time, and check whether it has any major competitors.</p>
<p>If a potential cryptocurrency to watch has no major competitors, then it may have the first-mover advantage, or there simply isn’t demand for the services it provides — both cases should be considered before investing.</p>
<h3>Community Interest</h3>
<p>There is arguably no better sign of strength than an engaged and enthusiastic community. </p>
<p>Oftentimes, new cryptos to watch have managed to gather an incredibly strong community because of their innovation and impressive fundamentals. While other crypto coins to watch haven’t yet developed a sizeable community but are on the right track.</p>
<p>We typically gauge community interest by examining the sentiment surrounding a project on its social media and public discussion boards — such as Reddit, Telegram, and Discord. This, combined with the simple number of genuine community members can be a strong indicator of potential.</p>
<h3>Creativity and Innovation</h3>
<p>Every now and then, a pioneering project comes along that pushes the boundaries of what can be done with blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Many of these projects go on to kickstart new trends, such as Axie Infinity and the play-to-earn trend, STEPN and the move-to-earn trend, and PancakeSwap and the yield-farming trend.</p>
<p>When we research cryptocurrencies to watch, we look for projects with disruptive potential — whether that be displacing outdated projects, the capability to reach and onboard new user demographics, or a level of creativity to inspire a generation.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, several of our picks for the top crypto to watch today are trendsetters in their own right and could form the heart of an entirely new ecosystem of products. </p>
<h3>Competitive Advantages</h3>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry is vast and for every use case, there is usually a handful of different platforms competing for dominance.</p>
<p>The top cryptos to watch tend to have a strong advantage over their competition — one that cannot be easily matched. This can include an impressive technical team, vibrant community, excellent marketing, or an experienced founding team.</p>
<p>When we list promising cryptos to watch in 2023, we take into account the competition and try to pick the project most likely to lead the market long term.</p>
<h3>Value Drivers</h3>
<p>A token’s utility is a strong indicator of its likely performance. Tokens that have little to no utility are not likely to appreciate in value.</p>
<p>That said, the best cryptocurrency to watch in 2023 will almost certainly have a highly demanded use case and/or specific economic drivers that act to increase its value. </p>
<p>This might include staking yields offered by platforms like Wall Street Memes, or the dividend distribution model of platforms like Nexo.</p>
<p>The newest crypto to watch in 2023 and beyond are those that have clear, specific mechanisms in place to drive value to holders and incentivize new buyers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In this guide, we identified several popular and penny cryptos to watch. Each has the fundamentals necessary to achieve substantial success over the long term and potentially reach a much greater value.</p>
<p>Unlike most traditional markets, cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile and can generate substantial returns or losses over very short periods. Because of this, it’s important to take the time to filter the most promising projects and gauge an attractive entry price for each. This will help you make volatility work in your favor.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token is a new crypto token that offers a dynamic token burn mechanism linked to developments in the Bitcoin ETF space. Users can stake $BTCETF tokens and get a high APY. This token is priced at $0.0052 on presale, and will increase significantly by the final stage of the presale.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Best Future Crypto Project With High APY For Early Stakers And Token Burns For Long Term Growthm<br /></strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is overall the best future crypto project with high upside potential, given the recent trends in the Bitcoin ETF space.</p>
<p>The platform is gaining attention due to the SEC&#8217;s anticipated approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF. Designed as a speculative and deflationary asset, $BTCETF leverages the potential market shifts associated with Bitcoin ETF approvals, offering attractive staking rewards and token burn events.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF’s presale is divided into ten stages and offers an initial circulating supply of 840 million tokens from a total of 2.1 billion. </p>
<p>Currently, at $0.0052 per token, the price is structured to rise to $0.0068 in the final stage, offering an immediate upside for early investors. Also, the presale&#8217;s early success is notable, with nearly $830K raised in a few days, showing strong investor interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>A key feature of Bitcoin ETF Token is its high staking yields. Initially, investors could earn over 1500% APY, with the rate set to decrease as more tokens are staked, making early participation particularly advantageous.</p>
<p>The APY currently stands at 500%, with over 90 million tokens already staked. 25% of the total token supply is allocated for staking rewards over five years, improving the passive income potential for $BTCETF holders. </p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF whitepaper</a>, $BTCETF opts for a deflationary model, planning to burn 25% of its total supply. This burn is triggered by reaching specific milestones related to Bitcoin ETFs, such as SEC approval, the first Bitcoin ETF launch, $BTCETF achieving $100 million in trading volume, and Bitcoin&#8217;s price exceeding $100,000. </p>
<p>Each milestone achievement also leads to a 1% reduction in the token’s 5% transaction tax, benefiting both early and long-term holders by potentially increasing the token’s scarcity and value.</p>

<p>Investors can buy the Bitcoin ETF tokens using ETH, BNB, USDT, MATIC, or card payments by connecting a wallet like MetaMask to the platform&#8217;s presale page.</p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/334676/screen-shot-2023-10-23-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix presale" /></figure>
<p>Users looking to benefit from Bitcoin mining cost-effectively can join the Bitcoin Minetrix platform to access tokenized cloud mining credits. Cloud mining is a process through which individuals can get rented mining times through third-party corporations since it saves the costs associated with buying hardware and advanced equipment to mine cryptos. </p>
<p>However, Bitcoin Minetrix is the first platform to decentralize the cloud mining process. By offering ERC-20 cloud mining credits, Bitcoin Minetrix ensures transparency and security of the user’s assets. The tokens can be earned by purchasing and staking $BTCMTX &#8211; the native token. These tokens are staked on an Ethereum-powered smart contract on the Bitcoin Minetrix ecosystem. </p>
<p>While the cloud mining credits cannot be traded, they can be burned to earn Bitcoin cloud mining power. Thus, users can access allocated mining times and earn a portion of Bitcoin mining fees. Bitcoin Minetrix is also witnessing huge success &#8211; having raised over $2.1 million since the launch of the token presale. </p>
<p>While $BTCMTX has a low supply of 4 billion tokens &#8211; 70% are being allocated for the ongoing presale. Currently, the token is priced at just $0.0112 &#8211; but will jump to $0.0129 by the final round. This represents a price increase of 15.17%. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/334660/bitcoin-minetrix-cloud-mining.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix cloud mining" /></figure>
<p>By the end of the presale, Bitcoin Minetrix aims to raise a hard cap of $33.46 million. Once the token is listed on crypto exchanges, we can potentially see the price flourish with an increase in trading volume. Bitcoin Minetrix is also offering annual yields as high as 270% to staked token holders. </p>

<h3><b>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Fight with Meme Coin Avatars on a Battle Arena, Get 112% Staking Rewards</b></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency that can potentially soar in the future is $MK &#8211; the native token of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/">Meme Kombat</a>. Meme Kombat&#8217;s main feature is a play-to-earn battle arena &#8211; which will be built using artificial intelligence. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-124026" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home.png" alt="Meme Kombat home" width="900" height="418" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home.png 1439w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698753869-meme-kombat-home-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The battle arena will allow users to engage in virtual battles through Player vs Player and Player vs Game modes. Notably, players can engage in fights by picking their own meme coin avatars. The meme coin characters will include the likes of Spongebob and Pepe Coin. To further entice investors, $MK can be wagered as bets on the live battles. </p>
<p>You can bet on the outcomes of fights, and the first moves your opponent will make. Furthermore, Meme Kombat will also offer community rewards to promote collaborative growth and reward the loyal customers of the ecosystem. Finally, Meme Kombat will also introduce staking rewards through the $MK token. </p>
<p>After buying $MK on presale &#8211; your holdings will be staked on the Meme Kombat staking contract. At press time, Meme Kombat is offering APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) as high as 112%. After the presale ends, tokens can be staked on a staking pool. The APYs will be based on the total number of tokens staked in the pool. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-124043" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698754484-meme-kombat-tokenomics.png" alt="Meme Kombat tokenomics" width="900" height="369" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698754484-meme-kombat-tokenomics.png 1435w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698754484-meme-kombat-tokenomics-300x123.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698754484-meme-kombat-tokenomics-1024x420.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698754484-meme-kombat-tokenomics-768x315.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Currently, $MK is priced at $0.1667 on presale. Since the start of the presale, Meme Kombat has raised more than $760K. A total of 60 million tokens have been allocated for the presale &#8211; comprising 50% of the total 120 million supply. </p>
<p>Due to the multiple use cases $MK offers, the token may see widespread adoption in the future. Once the battle arena releases in the coming months, we may see the token price increase.

<h3>4. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Best Future Crypto Project to Invest In 2023</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/312117/wall-street-memes-best-fu.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes viral meme posts" /></figure>
<p>The global crypto market has been swarmed with meme coins since brands like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu took off in 2021. However, few have enjoyed the success the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/wall-street-memes/"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> project has experienced over the last four weeks. This blockchain-based crypto went into presale on May 26 and raised over $4 million in a week and a half. Let’s dissect what made it an overnight phenomenon.</p>
<p>At first glance, Wall Street Memes works like every other meme coin available today. It’s a crypto based on viral images from the internet, so it has little intrinsic value. There’s no business or economic utility to it either, which makes it highly volatile, even for a crypto coin. So, what’s so special about WSM to make it our best future crypto to invest in for 2023?</p>
<p>The power of Wall Street Memes lies in its mission — a protest against capitalism. Drawing from the 2021 GameStop fiasco, this project’s creators aim to empower traders to compete against institutionalized investors by harnessing the power of meme virality. In their view, investing in these tokens can net millions, much like meme stocks do for their competitors.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>WSM developers owe much of their success to external support. The brand, which gained recognition with its NFT collection in 2021, had over a million social media followers before the coin went into presale. On top of that, the most popular meme coin advocate, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1649784663924244482"><u>Elon Musk, promoted the currency on Twitter.</u></a> Plenty of influencers and followers have continued to support this campaign since.</p>
<p>If these arguments have convinced you to join the community, don’t waste any time. Visit WSM’s official website and purchase the coin for $0.0337 at a discounted presale price. However, if you’re still hesitant about investing, Wall Street Memes’ website, <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram</u></a>, and other socials can help you learn more about the initiative.</p>

<h3><br />5. Launchpad XYZ &#8211; Cryptocurrency Platform Giving Entry to Multiple Web3 Services, $1.5M Raised</h3>
<p>With the evolution of Web3, more and more users are accessing decentralized networks. However, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a> aims to offer a platform that makes all the popular decentralized protocols accessible from one ecosystem. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/273457/launchpad-web3.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ web3 project" /></figure>
<p>With $LPX, the native token that powers this platform, users can access Launchpad XYZ’s decentralized exchange (DEX), P2E hub, and more. One of the features offered on Launchpad XYZ is a Web3 wallet, which can be downloaded after providing just an email address or phone number. </p>
<p>With your Web3 wallets, you can interact with other decentralized applications, access Web3 services, and purchase and swap tokens. On the DEX, users can access hundreds of asset pairs, and even access perpetual contracts for certain pairs. </p>
<p>With $LPX, traders can benefit from lower trading fees on the DEX. The native token can be used to also purchase fractionalized assets, which include <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-real-world-asset-tokens.htm">real-world assets</a> such as real estate and art. Launchpad XYZ also allows members to search NFTs from the top exchanges and curate their collections through an NFT gallery. </p>
<p>Those looking to gain more knowledge and insight into the crypto space can access the Launchpad XYZ quotient. Through this tool, the platform utilizes live data to provide over 400 data points on top tokens. The data points are generated after leveraging technical indicators such as moving averages and buying sentiment. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/273458/launchpad-roadmap.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ roadmap" /></figure>
<p>Currently, $LPX is available to buy on presale for just $0.0445 per token. While investing in any presale is not a risk-free investment, the utility Launchpad XYZ aims to provide may help increase the adoption of the token. From a low supply of 1 billion tokens, 250 million $LPX coins have been allocated across ten presale rounds. </p>
<p>By the final round, the price of $LPX will double to $0.07. Launchpad XYZ aims to raise a soft cap target of $5 million from the presale and has already raised over $1.5 million since the presale started. </p>

<h3>6. Chimpzee &#8211; Provides 20% APY While Helping Save The Planet, $1.3M Achieved From $1.8M Hard Cap </h3>
<p>Several crypto projects are creating innovative financial solutions, but there is a shortage of functional environmental and social solutions. However, a new trend is emerging, with a few pioneering initiatives leading the way.</p>
<p><a href="/ext/chimpzee/"><u>Chimpzee</u></a> is among these projects, with a key focus on preserving the planet and its wildlife. It provides various features that allow users to earn passive income while also contributing to environmental causes. These features include Play-to-Earn, Shop-to-Earn, and Trade-to-Earn, which can be accessed through the Chimpzee shop, NFT marketplace, and Zero Tolerance Game. The team has allocated 10% of the token supply and a portion of the profits to support organizations working towards these causes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/275722/image1.jpg" alt="Chimpzee project affiliations" /></figure>
<p>Earning passive income in a highly lucrative manner is possible by possessing a Chimpzee NFT passport, which enables users to earn additional CHMPZ tokens and receive rewards by engaging with various components of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Chimpzee has unveiled a mobile app that leverages AI technology to generate personalized Chimpzee avatars for its users. These avatars can be used to create a personalized Chimpzee NFT passport, which shares some of the same benefits of a Diamond NFT Passport.</p>
<p>To participate in the Chimpzee presale and acquire these exclusive NFT passports, a total of 40 billion CHMPZ tokens will be distributed across four rounds. In the current round, the price for 1 CHMPZ starts at 0.0005 USDT, with the next round increasing the price to 0.0007 USDT. The final price will be listed three times higher at $0.00185. Receive free bonus tokens when you buy in the presale only.</p>
<p>Acquiring the opportunity to mint a Chimpzee Diamond NFT passport when it becomes available after the presale provides users with the greatest benefits and highest earning potential since the supply is restricted. Those who fail to participate in the presale have to pay a higher price for the passports and wait until after the whitelist NFT passport prelaunch, which is solely accessible to presale investors.</p>
<p>Chimpzee has the potential to be one of the biggest green crypto projects and is worth observing. Grabbing the chance to participate in the presale early on offers benefits that are hard to resist.<br /> </p>

<h3>7. yPredict &#8211; Analytics Platform Offering Passive Income Earning Opportunities</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> ecosystem allows members to trade cryptocurrencies after accessing data-driven insights and knowledge. The platform works with a team of AI developers and financial quants who provide predictive analytics and models on the potential outlook of different cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p> <img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/271812/ypredict-use-cases.jpg" alt="yPredict market research tools" /></p>
<p>With $YPRED, the native token, members can purchase monthly predictions to access the models from a financial marketplace. Some of the information provided includes AI trading signals generated by the top 1% of AI developers. The platform conducts sentiment analysis by using AI tools and utilizes various technical indicators to predict a token’s price. </p>
<p>yPredict uses a patent-pending pattern recognition algorithm, which scans multiple trading charts to identify whether a token is bearish or bullish in the short term. Along with all these features, users can learn more about cryptocurrencies by accessing yPredict’s Learn2Earn ecosystem. </p>
<p>On this, members can take assessments and quizzes about cryptos and earn $YPRED tokens for passing the tests. With the $YPRED token, users can participate in P2E ecosystems and bet on the future outlook of certain crypto tokens. The participants with the closest predictions are also rewarded with tokens. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/273460/screen-shot-2023-05-04-at.jpg" alt="yPredict crypto presale" /></figure>
<p>While there is no guarantee on whether the $YPRED token will rise, this cryptocurrency can be staked on the ecosystem to generate passive income. yPredict runs staking pools, which will regularly receive 10% of all the revenues generated from new platform subscriptions. Furthermore, 15% of all swapping fees collected on the ecosystem will also be allocated to the staking pools. </p>
<p>$YPRED can be purchased on presale for a price of $0.05 per token. However, the price will jump to $0.12 by the final round. Since the presale went live, over $3.8  million has been collected through the presale. </p>

<h3>9. BNB &#8211; Token with Impressive Track Record and Use Case</h3>
<p>Binance is well-known as a cryptocurrency exchange titan, with trading volume that dwarfs all other centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>With the recent advent of BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain), Binance has made its foray into the smart contract space in a big way. BNB Chain is now the third most popular blockchain by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-10-defi-defi-20-tokens-projects-2022.htm">DeFi</a> total value locked (TVL) and the second by market capitalization.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/218767/bnb1.jpg" alt="BNB price chart via CoinMarketCap" /></figure>
<p>For those looking for the best future crypto to invest in, BNB stands out as a promising candidate. Widely heralded as the king of token utility, BNB has a huge number of uses in the Binance and BNB Chain ecosystem — being used for paying gas costs on BNB chain, participating in Binance launchpad sales, unlocking trading fee discounts, and more.</p>
<p>BNB has also proved to be heavily resistant to bear markets. In 2019, a time when most cryptocurrencies were collapsing in value, BNB was shattering record highs. Likewise, while most cryptocurrencies have lost upwards of 80% since the 2021 bear market, BNB is down just 60% — demonstrating its relative strength. According to most <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-price-prediction.htm">BNB price predictions</a> this promising crypto could reach highs of $2k by the end of 2030.</p>
<p>Part of this may be attributed to the large number of BNB burned through the buy back and burn campaign and the more recent pioneer burn program, reducing its supply. To date, more than 1.95 million BNB has been burned, worth more than $500 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong>Buy BNB on eToro</strong></a></p>

<h3>10. Bitcoin &#8211; Original Cryptocurrency Fiat Alternative</h3>
<p>The one that started it all. Bitcoin is a staple in the portfolio of most cryptocurrency investors due to its impressive price action and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long-term prospects</a>.</p>
<p>As a cryptocurrency designed to be a direct replacement for traditional fiat, Bitcoin has seen rampant adoption by individuals, businesses, and enterprises worldwide, and is now considered legal tender in El Salvador and the Central African Republic.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/218768/bitcoin1.jpg" alt="CoinMarketCap price chart for BTC" /></figure>
<p>Despite having a market cap of more than $380 billion, Bitcoin actually has no major competitors. Other simple payment cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin and Monero, fall utterly short when it comes to global adoption and nothing has managed to even come close to Bitcoin’s success.</p>
<p>Indeed, Bitcoin is now held by numerous sizeable firms, including the likes of Tesla, Coinbase, Block, and MicroStrategy.</p>
<p>This gradual adoption has fueled one of the most impressive price rallies ever seen, with Bitcoin exploding from essentially $0 to a peak value of more than $69,000 since 2009. Many believe it is just a matter of time before it shatters this value to reach even greater heights.</p>
<p>And with Bitcoin’s utility and uptake set to dramatically increase over time thanks to the growth of the Lightning network, and the development of Bitcoin DeFi solutions like Portal, there is good reason to believe Bitcoin is the best crypto of the future.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection.Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3>11. DAO Maker — Popular Launchpad and Retail Venture Platform</h3>
<p>Spotting promising new crypto projects can be a challenge, given the sheer volume of new projects hitting the market each day.</p>
<p>DAO Maker looks to simplify this by democratizing access to promising new projects through its token sale platform. The platform allows DAO token holders to access a range of hand-curated opportunities, making finding and taking part in early-stage sales a simple task.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/218769/daomaker1.jpg" alt="CoinMarketCap price chart for DAO" /></figure>
<p>DAO is arguably the best future cryptocurrency to invest in if you’re got limited time on your hands to research your own investments.</p>
<p>Since the platform launched in 2018, DAO Maker has hosted sales for some of the most successful projects in recent years — including heavyweights like Orion Protocol, XCAD Network, and My Neighbor Alice.</p>
<p>The team is constantly releasing new products and upgrades, and the platform continues to go from strength to strength in terms of partnerships and ecosystem growth. Because of this, the DAO token looks like a strong pick for those that want to make the most of the next bull run.</p>

<h3>12. Moonbeam — A project bringing smart contracts to Polkadot</h3>
<p>Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain designed to make it easy to build interoperable blockchain applications.</p>
<p>As an EVM implementation for Polkadot, Moonbeam allows developers to easily port their Ethereum (and EVM chain) smart contracts over to Polkadot. These would then benefit from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-interoperability-can-it-achieved-blockchain-space.htm">interoperability</a> with the broader Polkadot ecosystem, which includes other popular parachains like Astar, Acala, and Parallel.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/218770/moonbeam1.jpg" alt="Moonbeam price chart from CoinMarketCap" /></figure>
<p>The Polkadot ecosystem is widely considered to be a hotspot of innovation in the blockchain space, with dozens of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-tools.htm">crypto tools</a>, platforms, and protocols currently in development.</p>
<p>As the Polkadot user base grows and its product and services landscape swells, developers may begin to flock to Moonbeam as a simple way to deploy their applications on Polkadot. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://roadmap.moonbeam.network/c/9-support-xcm-to-evm-calls"><u>official roadmap</u></a>, work is currently underway to support XCM — which will allow Moonbeam smart contracts to communicate with other applications across all Polkadot blockchains.</p>
<p>As the primary <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/understanding-appeal-purpose-of-utility-tokens.htm">utility token</a> of the Moonbeam Network, Glimmer (GLMR) is required for paying for smart contract operations and facilitating on-chain governance. As such, demand for the token should skyrocket alongside growing demand for Moonbeam network resources.</p>
<p>Though the Moonbeam token has been on a long-term downtrend, it is important to note that its ecosystem is only in the very early stages of development — as such, there is limited utility for the GLMR token right now. </p>
<p>If, or when, this ecosystem begins to expand, GLMR could be arguably one of the best future crypto coins for growth — particularly when you consider it is the leading smart contract platform on Polkadot.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong>Buy GLMR on eToro</strong></a></p>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection.Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3>13. Cosmos — Bet on the Cross-Chain Future</h3>
<p>Interoperability has been a long-standing problem in the blockchain space. </p>
<p>Right now, most blockchains operate as closed-off ecosystems with essentially no way to communicate with other platforms. This limits their utility since it prevents developers from leveraging the unique properties of different blockchains within their dApps.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/218771/cosmos1.jpg" alt="Cosmos price chart" /></figure>
<p>It also leads to a great deal of redundancy and friction for end-users — since popular dApps are forced to deploy on multiple different chains, and users are forced to get to grips with multiple different blockchains and wallets to access their favorite dApps.</p>
<p>Cosmos, however, wants to make this a thing of the past by powering an interchain landscape of products and services — all of which is connected by its proprietary cross-chain message passing and inter-blockchain communication protocols. </p>
<p>This will allow value (e.g. tokens) and data to be transferred across compatible blockchains seamlessly, while allowing Cosmos ecosystem chains to interact with existing external blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Cosmos is tackling one of the hardest challenges in the blockchain space. If it succeeds, the ATOM token could potentially be the best future cryptocurrency to invest in, since there are a huge number of rails that deliver value to ATOM holders. This includes regular airdrops, staking fees, and on-chain governance.</p>
<p>Arguably the best cryptocurrency of the future, ATOM has demonstrated long-term growth and could be set to retake its previous all-time highest value of $44.70 in the coming years.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong>Buy ATOM on eToro</strong></a></p>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection.Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3>14. Ethereum — The Ever-popular Smart Contract Platform</h3>
<p>No list of promising long-term cryptocurrency investments would be complete without Ethereum — the juggernaut that introduced smart contracts to the world.</p>
<p>As a smart contract platform, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum.htm">Ethereum</a> is used to host decentralized applications (dApps), which are powerful blockchain-based apps that can be accessed from anywhere, by anyone, at any time.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/218772/ethereum1.jpg" alt="ETH price chart" /></figure>
<p>The platform is currently the dominant smart contract platform, with over 3,000 dApps now running on the blockchain, and more than $34.1 billion controlled by Ethereum DeFi services.</p>
<p>Despite growing competition among other smart contract platforms, including the likes of Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and more, Ethereum is set to complete one of its biggest ever upgrades in mid-September. </p>
<p>The upgrade, known as ‘The Merge’ will see Ethereum move from its energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus system to the much more environmentally friendly Proof-of-Stake. It will also set the stage for a range of further upgrades that could help Ethereum secure its position as one of the most technically advanced blockchains in operation. This could make ETH the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-energy-efficient-cryptocurrency.htm">most energy-efficient crypto</a> of the year.</p>
<p>As the native gas token of the Ethereum platform, the ETH token is set to become the main beneficiary of this growth. This is why ETH has managed to perform better than most in the bear market and stands to experience potentially meteoric growth in the months and years ahead.</p>

<h3>15. Sweat Economy — A massive new move-to-earn platform</h3>
<p>In recent years, blockchain technology has demonstrated its capacity to reshape the way that applications are monetized and users are rewarded.</p>
<p>Besides the incredibly popular play-to-earn niche, the move-to-earn sector also gained a great deal of popularity during this time, since it provided users a way to earn cryptocurrency rewards for simply keeping fit.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/218773/sweat1.jpg" alt="Sweat economy web3 project" /></figure>
<p>Until now, no move-to-earn project managed to properly balance rewards and growth — usually due to poor tokenomics or a lack of ecosystem development.</p>
<p>But Sweatcoin, a move-to-earn project built on the NEAR blockchain, could be set to change that.</p>
<p>Sweatcoin is a blockchain-based move-to-earn project that rewards users in SWEAT tokens for being active. These tokens can then be spent in the marketplace on a range of rewards, like iPhones, anti-gravity yoga classes, audible books, and more.</p>
<p>Or they can be withdrawn and used on-chain, where they can be staked or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The platform currently has partnerships with hundreds of brands and healthcare partners, more than 100 million registered users, and millions of app downloads. </p>
<p>Unlike the other projects on this list, the SWEAT token isn’t currently in circulation, so can’t be bought on exchanges. But given that it will launch with an initial market capitalization of just over $15 million, it could be the best future crypto to invest in — particularly if you can get in early.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, its two largest competitors — STEPN and Step App — achieved market capitalizations of $2.3 billion and $175 million respectively. Despite being orders of magnitude less successful.</p>
<h2>How to Find the Best Future Cryptocurrencies</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-get-rich-off-crypto.htm">get rich off cryptos</a>? Cryptocurrencies are, without a doubt, the most profitable asset class of the 21st Century. Indeed, the returns provided by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hottest-crypto-to-buy.htm">hottest cryptocurrencies</a> like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum have eclipsed those provided by traditional asset classes over the same time period.</p>
<p>But not all cryptocurrencies are built equal. Indeed, only a small minority of cryptocurrencies achieve the parabolic growth typically associated with the asset class. Most, unfortunately, fail to gather significant momentum. Even those using the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">best crypto signals</a> cannot accurately pinpoint which cryptos will explode in the near future.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86865/218809/jeremy-bezanger-9opihrpivr0-unsplash.jpg" alt="COIN stock technical analysis" /></figure>
<p>Because of this, it’s important to take the time to separate the best future crypto coins from the likely failures, rather than deploying funds indiscriminately. Contrary to popular belief, not all cryptocurrencies will grow in value, and many of today’s most popular assets will never return to their former glory.</p>
<p>Determining the best future crypto to invest in can be a challenge, but it’s very possible with the right strategy. Some of the things you’ll want to consider include:</p>
<h3>Understand supply changes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>Cryptocurrencies tend to be inflationary. Put simply, this means the number of coins or tokens in circulation usually increases over time — typically due to staking rewards, early investor vesting, and treasury unlocks.</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For tokens without significant buy-side demand, this can lead to significant and sustained sell pressure, collapsing the value. </p>
<p>Tokens with a large fraction of their maximum supply in circulation tend to be least affected by this phenomenon but also tend to have less upside potential. Meanwhile, newer tokens tend to suffer more from this challenge, but also have more potential upside.</p>
<h3>Changing trends</h3>
<p>Every bull market has its themes and trends. Spotting these early is one of the best ways to secure substantial profits. </p>
<p>In many cases, the best future crypto to buy is a first mover in a new trend, whether that be meme coins &#8211; or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoins</a> as they can be known &#8211; the metaverse, blockchain gaming, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm">NFTs</a>, interoperability protocols, or something entirely new. </p>
<p>History has shown that the first mover advantage is present even in the crypto sector. </p>
<h3>Token utility</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>Token utility refers to the actual value a cryptocurrency can offer during the ecosystem. Utility can be generated by a number of means, including staking rewards, in-platform purchases, discounts on fees, and more. </strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of cryptocurrency tokens lack significant utility or the correct product/market fit. As a result, their long-term prospects are weak.</p>
<p>But for projects with well-crafted token utility, buyer-side demand can help sustain the token’s value during a bear market, and send it skyrocketing in a bull one.</p>
<p>As such, it’s always wise to scrutinize a token’s real utility before speculating on it.</p>
<h3>Team and backing</h3>
<p>Many of today’s most successful projects are created by repeat entrepreneurs who have a history of success. </p>
<p>Likewise, the partners, collaborations, and integrations a project has can play a pivotal role in its success or demise.</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s wise to check who is behind the project, to see if they’ve got what it takes to produce the results you’re looking for. </p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Is cryptocurrency the future?</strong></p>
<p>Most crypto future predictions paint cryptocurrencies as not only the future of money but also the future of stored digital value. Over time, the types and use cases of cryptocurrencies have expanded considerably and there are now crypto-based options for most online services. This gives investors a chance to easily invest in the next generation of digital and financial infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best future crypto to buy?</strong></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency landscape is as deep as it is wide. There are quite literally tens of thousands of different cryptocurrencies now available — many of which are attractive investment opportunities. </p>
<p>Some of the most popular choices for the best future crypto to buy include BTC, ETH, BNB, and ATOM, while we recommended Bitcoin ETF Token, which is getting huge interest in its early presale.</p>
<p><strong>Which crypto is best for the long term?</strong></p>
<p>Not all cryptocurrencies have long-term growth potential. But the best crypto to invest in for future returns tends to be those that offer strong token utility, target a large audience, and have enough funding to develop a killer product. Crypto projects such as Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix, Meme Kombat, Wall Street Memes, and Launchpad XYZ have the potential to be listed on Coinbase in the future. </p>

<p>As with most investment vehicles, not all metaverses or metaverse projects will deliver on their promises, but a select few will go on to shatter expectations and deliver a potentially world-changing product.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at some of the best metaverse coins of 2023. Each of these was chosen based on its long-term potential and disruptive qualities — giving them a strong chance of pulling off an impressive performance in the coming months and years.<b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. Meme Kombat &#8211; Wager Tokens on a Battle Arena Metaverse and Earn 112% in Staking Rewards</b></h3>
<p>Our #1 pick for the best metaverse cryptocurrency coin is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK). This new platform offers an AI-driven battle arena metaverse where players can engage in virtual battles. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-121626" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398624-meme-kombat-home-300x139.png" alt="Meme Kombat presale homepage" width="900" height="418" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398624-meme-kombat-home-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398624-meme-kombat-home-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398624-meme-kombat-home-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398624-meme-kombat-home-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398624-meme-kombat-home.png 1439w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Combining your love of meme coins with income-earning opportunities &#8211; Meme Kombat will let users earn rewards by battling with meme coin avatars. This battle arena metaverse uses AI tools to offer advanced visualization and offer realistic battle sequences. </p>
<p>By accessing Player vs Player and Player vs Game modes, one can leverage their favorite meme coin avatars in battle. The battle arena mode will be released in different seasons &#8211; the first one comprising 11 meme avatars such as Spongebob and Pepe Coin. </p>
<p>To up the stakes, players can wager $MK on various live battles to earn free tokens. For instance, you can bet on the first move your opponent will make, or the outcome of the battle with $MK. Currently on presale, $MK can be purchased for $0.1667 per token. </p>
<p>Once you purchase tokens, Meme Kombat automatically stakes your holdings. Through the presale, token holders can generate 112% in staking APYs (Annual Percentage Yields). After the presale ends, Meme Kombat will release a proper staking pool &#8211; where the yields will vary depending on the amount of stakers. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-121625" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398570-meme-kombat-presale-apys-300x99.png" alt="Meme Kombat staking APY" width="900" height="296" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398570-meme-kombat-presale-apys-300x99.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398570-meme-kombat-presale-apys-1024x337.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398570-meme-kombat-presale-apys-768x253.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398570-meme-kombat-presale-apys.png 1286w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>From a maximum supply of 100 million tokens &#8211; Meme Kombat has allocated 40 million for presale. The presale has raised $760K &#8211; from a hard cap target of $10 million. Another 30% of the token supply will be offered as staking and battle rewards. Meme Kombat will also offer community rewards to reward loyal token holders. </p>

<h3><b>2. DogeStar &#8211; New Meme Coin Offering a Metaverse Gaming Environment, Priced at $0.00000025 on Presale</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://dogestar.net/index.html">DogeStar</a> (DOGESTAR) is a meme ecosystem full of exciting possibilities &#8211; DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse gaming environments among the upcoming prospects. The platform wants to develop a strong community of followers looking for financial prowess while striving for innovation and engagement. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-121627" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398720-dogestar-presale-300x150.png" alt="DogeStar presale" width="900" height="451" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398720-dogestar-presale-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398720-dogestar-presale-1024x514.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398720-dogestar-presale-768x385.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398720-dogestar-presale.png 1322w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>While DogeStar is another Doge-themed token, it will feature several use cases through the $DOGESTAR token to build a long-term reputation. One of the central components of DogeStar will be its upcoming metaverse gaming platform. On a well-defined platform roadmap, DogeStar has laid out upcoming developments in seven different phases. </p>
<p>By phase 5, DogeStar hopes to integrate the metaverse games, and then launch its NFT platform. Thus, $DOGESTAR token holders can also possess a valuable token, that could potentially grow in demand. The short-term focus is on concluding a successful presale. </p>
<p>Currently, DogeStar is already in phase 4 of its presale. The $DOGESTAR token is priced at only $0.00000025 but will rise to $0.0000006 by the exchange listing. This equates to a price jump of 140%. Therefore, early investors can acquire the token before it lists on centralized and decentralized exchanges. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-121629" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398759-dogestar-community-300x191.png" alt="DogeStar community" width="900" height="574" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398759-dogestar-community-300x191.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398759-dogestar-community-1024x653.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398759-dogestar-community-768x490.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698398759-dogestar-community.png 1142w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This reliable project is being developed by a team of skilled Web3 and blockchain developers. The smart contract has already been audited by Coinsult. In the future, DogeStar wants to focus on education, collaboration, and building strategic partnerships to keep expanding its new cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>The presale has already raised more than $260K since launch. Join the <a href="https://t.me/dogestar_en">DogeStar Telegram channel</a> and follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/DogeStar_Token">Twitter</a> account for more information. </p>

<p>The game takes place in the virtual world of Dreva &#8211; which comprises four different kingdoms. Through the exploration mode, players can explore the different regions, interact with NPCs, and find new Pikamoon avatars to expand their empire. </p>
<p>The battle mode allows players to leverage their Pikamoon NFTs in battle, to earn rewards. $PIKA is also awarded as a reward through the online tournaments that will feature on this ecosystem. </p>
<p>Pikamoon will feature an NFT marketplace, through which users can buy healing NFT items, boosts, and capture devices. The first NFT mint will offer more than 18,000 Pikamoon NFTs. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-125702" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698914751-pikamoon-nft.png" alt="Pikamoon NFT" width="900" height="329" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698914751-pikamoon-nft.png 1271w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698914751-pikamoon-nft-300x110.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698914751-pikamoon-nft-1024x375.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698914751-pikamoon-nft-768x281.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>

<h3>4. Tamadoge (TAMA) &#8211; Metaverse Meme Crypto to Buy in 2023</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">Meme coins</a>, play-to-earn gaming and the metaverse are widely considered to be among the most promising crypto niches in the coming years, thanks to their ability to expose a huge number of users to the benefits and capabilities of blockchain technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge</a>, a new NFT pet-based metaverse project, combines all of these themes into an ambitious new ecosystem filled with a variety of rewarding arcade games, NFT critters, a pet marketplace, and a powerful augmented reality application.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87549/222392/tamadoge-king.jpg" alt="tamadoge token graphic" width="771" height="631" /></figure>
<p>Tamadoge had one of the best crypto presales of the year after raising $19 million in just eight weeks before making near-2,000% gains from its early presale price.</p>
<p>The token has performed well in 2023 so far and is expected to be a breakout coin in the next bull run, given the huge amount of utility and plans for the future.</p>
<p>The Tamadoge Arcade is now up and running with five retro platform games to play &#8211; with more monthly players than The Sandbox and Decentraland combined.</p>
<p>Its augmented reality app, where Tamadoge&#8217;s metaverse elements come into play, is also on the way, with applications to list on iOS and Android app stores recently sent.</p>
<p>The TAMA token provides utility across the ecosystem and is also deflationary.</p>

<h3>5. Chainlink (LINK) &#8211; The Most Trusted Oracle Provider for Metaverses</h3>
<p>Chainlink is a powerful decentralized oracle network that allows blockchain-based applications to receive tamper-proof data from external sources.</p>
<p>The data provided by Chainlink’s oracles enables blockchain dApps to leverage information from the real world — such as from IoT devices, stock exchanges, and a huge number of APIs — helping to power a huge number of use cases. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87549/311508/chainlink.jpg" alt="chainlink homepage" width="1757" height="760" /></figure>
<p>Though this might not seem important at first glance, Chainlink’s oracles currently serve data to a huge number of popular DeFi applications, including Aave, Synthetix, Compound, Nexus Mutual, dYdX, and dozens more.</p>
<p>A number of metaverse and metaverse platforms also integrated Chainlink&#8217;s oracles and/or VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to power their internal economies and game mechanics. This includes Axie Infinity, Over the Reality, and Gala Games.</p>
<p>Chainlink is widely regarded as a pillar in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-interoperability-20-laying-the-foundation-for-a-multi-chain-ecosystem.htm">blockchain interoperability</a> and connectivity with non-DLT technologies. Because of this, it isn’t hard to imagine a future where most top metaverse crypto coins rely on its oracles and other technologies to provide their services — potentially driving significant demand for the Chainlink (LINK) token.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection.Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3>6. Cosmos (ATOM) &#8211; Powering an Interoperable Metaverse Ecosystem</h3>
<p>In recent months, the Cosmos ecosystem has expanded dramatically, and it is now widely expected to host the next generation of breakthrough blockchain applications — including metaverse and DeFi platforms.</p>
<p>As an interoperability network, Cosmos is designed to allow applications on independent blockchains to communicate with one another, forming an information superhighway of sorts for the blockchain landscape.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87549/311514/cosmos.jpg" alt="cosmos homepage" width="1311" height="643" /></figure>
<p>Given this functionality, it is likely that Cosmos will help to power at least some next-generation interoperable metaverses, making it a top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">future crypto</a>, while existing metaverses may leverage its technology to expand their horizons.</p>
<p>Several projects are already looking to establish a metaverse in the Cosmos ecosystem, this includes a digital world and NFT marketplace known as Passage. Likewise, several blockchains built using the Cosmos SDK are now capable of hosting metaverses — including Terra, Oasis Network, Secret Network and Agoric.</p>
<p>The best metaverse crypto coin projects include those that focus on interoperability, since it can help them reach a huge audience. This appears to be reflected in the price of the Cosmos (ATOM) token, which has been on an uptrend for three months solid.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection.Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3>7. Decentraland (MANA) &#8211; One of the Top Metaverse Coins by Market Capitalization</h3>
<p>One of the first blockchain-based metaverses, Decentraland hit the market with a bang in February 2020. </p>
<p>Since then, it has grown to become a phenomenon in its own right, being one of the most popular metaverses and host to some of the biggest metaverse-based events — like the massively popular Metaverse Fashion Week and Metaverse Music Festival.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87549/311515/decentraland.jpg" alt="decentraland homepage graphic" width="1123" height="556" /></figure>
<p>By the end of 2021, the platform had notched up an impressive 300,000 monthly active users, along with tens of thousands of LAND owners — many of which develop their land into interesting products, environments, and works of art.</p>
<p>The platform’s native cryptocurrency, known as MANA, will go down in history as one of the most profitable metaverse assets of all time. To this day, it remains a must-have in any best metaverse crypto coins list. </p>
<p>The MANA token is currently trading at around $0.50, providing room for up to 1,000% growth to reclaim its all-time highest value of $5.85.</p>

<h3>8. ApeCoin (APE) &#8211; The Token For BAYC’s Otherside Metaverse</h3>
<p>No metaverse crypto coins list would be complete without ApeCoin, the native asset of the Bored Ape Yacht Club universe.</p>
<p>In March 2022, Yuga Labs — the firm behind Bored Ape Yacht Club and several other NFT collections — announced it is developing its own NFT project, known as &#8220;Otherside&#8221;.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87549/311511/apecoin.jpg" alt="apecoin token graphic" width="1179" height="766" /></figure>
<p>Given the size and reputation of Yuga Labs for delivering quality NFT-based products, expectations are extremely high for the ambition and scope of the Otherside metaverse.</p>
<p>The Otherside is one of the few blockchain-based metaverses to focus on interoperability, and blends aspects of massively multiplayer gaming and Web3 accessibility to produce a bustling and immerse digital world.</p>
<p>The ApeCoin (APE) token is the native transactional unit within the Otherside metaverse and will be used as a peer-to-peer currency between users. It will also likely be required to buy and/or rent land within Otherside.</p>
<p>Given the massive potential of Otherside, ApeCoin is a solid contender for the most promising metaverse crypto.</p>

<h3>9. Enjin (ENJ) &#8211; A Powerful Platform for Building Metaverse NFTs</h3>
<p>Enjin is a popular platform that allows developers and creators to deploy powerful NFT projects and collections. </p>
<p>One of the most promising applications of blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens have the potential to enrich the metaverse and provide both users and brands with access to new opportunities.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87549/311516/enjin.jpg" alt="enjin homepage" width="1306" height="634" /></figure>
<p>Today, the vast majority of blockchain-based metaverses support NFTs. This includes digital land in platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox, collectible critters in Tamadoge and Axie Infinity, and works of art in the Cryptovoxels metaverse.</p>
<p>As NFTs become increasingly woven into the metaverse, crypto coins/projects operating in the metaverse will need an intuitive and capable platform for creating and deploying their NFT collections.</p>
<p>As the &#8220;blockchain for NFTs&#8221;, Enjin has an excellent chance of becoming the platform of choice for these projects. This, in turn, could drive up demand for the ENJ token — which can be used to create NFTs using Enjin.</p>

<h3>10. Polygon (MATIC) &#8211; Making Metaverse Crypto Projects More Accessible</h3>
<p>In order for metaverses to grow in popularity, they need to be accessible. Right now, one of the primary barriers to entry is transaction fees — many blockchains are just too expensive to use.</p>
<p>Polygon looks to change this by providing a high-speed and low-cost layer-2 blockchain that can support Ethereum dApps and tokens. The platform supports DeFi applications, NFTs, and interoperability protocols, making it well-suited for metaverse applications.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87549/311517/polygon.jpg" alt="polygon blockchain homepage" width="1306" height="538" /></figure>
<p>It’s also incredibly popular among developers, with over 19,000 dApps already running on the platform. </p>
<p>Several Metaverse crypto coins projects already leverage Polygon&#8217;s technology to reach a wider audience, including the likes of Neon District, Vulcan Forged, and Carrieverse. Likewise, metaverse juggernaut The Sandbox <a href="https://medium.com/sandbox-game/the-sandbox-is-deploying-on-polygon-c44e026afeb2">recently deployed</a> on the energy-efficient chain.</p>
<p>As the primary gas token and medium of exchange on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-founder-raises-50m-for-first-vc-fund-built-by-web3-founders.htm">Polygon</a>, the MATIC token has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">huge potential</a> and could be set to see skyrocketing demand in the months and years ahead, as more users get to grips with Polygon-based metaverses.</p>

<h3>11. My Neighbor Alice (ALICE) &#8211; One of the Most Promising Metaverse Crypto Projects</h3>
<p>A blockchain-based multiplayer builder game, My Neighbor Alice allows players to buy, own, and monetize their own virtual land. It is similar to Animal Crossing in its gameplay, but also features an NFT lending system, DeFi features, and a complex in-game economy centered around the ALICE token.</p>
<p>One of the best-known <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn games</a> and metaverse projects, My Neighbor Alice launched with a bang in March 2021 and will go down in history as one of the most profitable IDOs of all time — generating public sale participants a whopping 26,000% profit at its peak.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87549/311518/my-neighbor-alice.jpg" alt="About My Neighbor Alice metaverse" width="1417" height="688" /></figure>
<p>As a play-to-earn game and micro-metaverse, My Neighbor Alice provides players with a range of ways to earn tokens and is also free-to-play — making it incredibly accessible.</p>
<p>Since its launch, the ALICE token has fallen from a peak of over $26 to under $2, but the hype for the project remains high. </p>
<p>Further, given that it’s expected to become one of the first metaverses titles available via the Steam store when it launches later this year, ALICE remains a key <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm">crypto to watch</a> in the coming months.</p>

<h2>What are Metaverse Crypto Coins?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Despite popular belief, cryptocurrencies and digital tokens can vary quite considerably in their form, functions, and use cases. </p>
<p>In 2021, metaverse crypto coins exploded in popularity after it was announced that Meta (formerly Facebook) would be building its own metaverse and rebranded to a social metaverse company.</p>
<p>Since then, it has emerged that blockchain technology will likely play a fundamental role in powering a range of new metaverses — thanks to its impressive security, resistance to censorship, accessibility, and smart contract capabilities.</p>
<p>But more than this, the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could be set to facilitate entirely new ways of shopping, working, networking, and playing online. </p>
<p>These cryptocurrencies can enable metaverses to have their own self-contained economies and can be used to funnel value back to the users, allow users to govern how the metaverse works, and even how they transmit value between one another and the brands that inhabit the metaverse.</p>
<p>Any cryptocurrency associated with a metaverse — whether that be its native currency, governance token, utility token, or an underlying layer-1 token— can be considered a metaverse crypto coin. </p>

<h2>Are Metaverse Coins a Good Investment?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/metaverse-market-size-worth--824-53-billion-globally-by-2030-at-39-1-cagr-verified-market-research-301585725.html#:~:text=According%20to%20Verified%20Market%20Research,39.1%25%20from%202022%20to%202030.">recent report</a> by Verified Market Research, the metaverse was a $27.2 billion industry in 2020 but is expected to reach $824 billion by 2030 — achieving a compound annual growth rate of 39.1%.</p>
<p>Given that the industry is still in its early days, savvy analysts and investors are beginning to take positions in promising metaverse projects, with the expectation that some will go on to become massively successful as their potential is revealed.</p>
<p>Indeed, even several governments, countries, and U.S. states are betting on the metaverse — including the South Korean government, which has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/30/south-koreas-investment-in-the-metaverse-could-provide-a-blueprint.html">reportedly</a> set aside 223.7 billion won (around $160 million) for investment into various metaverse initiatives.</p>
<p>Given the huge amount of attention the space is receiving, the metaverse is shaping up to be an incredibly attractive investment. </p>
<p>But not all metaverse coins are built equal, and only some will go on to achieve meteoric growth, while there has been some pullback from institutional investors, with many major companies &#8211; including Meta &#8211; switching focus to artificial intelligence in 2023.</p>
<p>Here’s how to spot potential winners:</p>
<h3>Development scope</h3>
<p>Metaverse projects can vary considerably in their potential given that some are more ambitious than others. </p>
<p>Metaverse platforms that offer the best mix of features, accessibility, and opportunities stand the best chance of achieving significant adoption. That said, it’s important to be wary of platforms that make exaggerated claims — since these are unlikely to deliver.</p>
<h3>Underlying technology</h3>
<p>Most metaverses are built using blockchain technology. The specific platform the developers opt to build on can directly impact the uptake, utility, and longevity of the metaverse. </p>
<p>Proven platforms like Ethereum and BNB Chain are among the most popular, but a range of competitors are also gaining ground — including Solana, Avalanche, and NEAR. </p>
<p>But more than this, the most ambitious metaverses often have technological advantages that can help them thrive.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>The top metaverse coins typically have one major thing in common — they all manage to build a strong community. </p>
<p>As a powerful new medium for work, play, and entertainment, the metaverse is also an incredibly social place. Those with a strong community stand the best chance of achieving long-term success.</p>
<h2>What Determines Metaverse Crypto Prices</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Metaverse cryptos, like all digital assets, are subject to the whims of supply and demand. Changes in this balance can lead to changes in the value of the asset over time.</p>
<p>The best metaverse coins to buy tend to be those with the potential to reach the largest audience and deliver the most value to users. This tends to be a function of their utility, the opportunities available in the associated metaverses, and the sentiment of both current and prospective investors. These features help to ensure demand consistently outstrips supply, leading to growth.</p>
<p>During overall bear markets — that is, periods of significant market decline — even promising metaverse coins might lose value as demand dwindles and selling pressure mounts. But those that are fundamentally strong have the potential to quickly recover during bull markets, and deliver impressive returns to those that bought when they were undervalued.</p>
<p>By having a good grasp of market cycles and risk/reward ratios, you can both identify and take positions in promising metaverse coins at logical entry prices, giving yourself an excellent chance of achieving long-term gains.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The metaverse is, without a doubt, one of the most ambitious and innovative sectors but its true potential is still being unraveled.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, several early movers have demonstrated the extraordinary opportunities the metaverse presents to both users and developers — providing new ways to create, shop, socialize, work, and relax.</p>
<p>In the coming years, there is a strong chance that we will be spending more and more of our time in the metaverse. Along with the popularity of the metaverse, several new crypto presales are offering high-growth opportunities to investors. </p>
<p>One of the top cryptos we have reviewed is Meme Kombat &#8211; which will offer an AI-driven battle arena metaverse where players can battle with meme coin avatars. Users can stake and wager $MK &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. During the ongoing presale, staked token holders are earning 112% in annual yields. </p>
<p>Meme Kombat ($MK) is priced at $0.1667 during the ongoing presale.</p>

<h2>The Best NFT Trading Platforms Reviews</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As platforms that allow users to easily buy and sell NFTs either directly from their wallet (decentralized platforms) or through a simple centralized interface, NFT marketplaces catalyze much of this growth.</p>
<p>The following platforms are our picks for the 9 best NFT marketplaces operating today.</p>
<h3>1. OpenSea &#8211; Highly Liquid and Comprehensive NFT Marketplace</h3>

It has a clean and simple interface, enabling newbies to mint, trade, and display their NFTs with ease.</p>
<p>That said, the platform does have a problem with fraudulent NFTs, with the company <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1486843204062236676"><u>recently admitting</u></a> that around 80% of NFTs lazy minted on the platform are plagiarized in some manner. Because of this, it’s important to do due diligence if you choose the use the platform.</p>
<p>Despite this, OpenSea is a popular platform for both creators and users, it supports up to 10% royalties on secondary sales, and has perhaps the most extensive range of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cool-nft-projects.htm">cool NFTs</a> on offer anywhere.  It’s also well-established, reputable, and available on desktop and mobile — a nice touch for those typically on the go.</p>

<h3>2. Lucky Block &#8211; Top New NFT Marketplace in 2023</h3>
<p>Despite being relatively new, nft.luckyblock.com is one of the best NFT marketplaces around thanks to its multi-chain support. </p>
<p>Launched in February 2022, the platform has already gained a considerable following across both BNB Chain and Polygon — the two platforms the marketplace currently supports. It also benefits from a large library and collection variety, giving users a wide variety of NFT assets to choose from.</p>

<h3>5. Rarible &#8211; Multichain NFT Marketplace</h3>
<p>Rarible is a popular multichain and mixed marketplace that allows users to buy, sell and mint on NFTs across four different blockchains — with further blockchains set to be added.</p>
<p>The marketplace features flexible royalty options, allowing creators to include up to 10% royalty commissions on subsequent sales — making it a suitable place for creators.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224230/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-21-46.jpg" alt="Rarible NFT marketplace" /></figure>

Its founders, Alexander Salnikov and Alexei Falin, are based in Moscow and are well-known figures in the blockchain space. </p>
<p>Like many new NFT marketplaces, Rarible has its own native utility token — known as RARI. This is primarily used for platform governance. </p>
<p>Besides this, Rarible is rare among the top NFT marketplaces in that it supports debit and credit card purchases from users in over 150 countries.

<h3>6. Nifty Gateway &#8211; Popular NFT Art Platform</h3>
<p>As one of the top NFT platforms, Nifty Gateway ticks all the right boxes. It’s easy to navigate, has a simple account creation process, and supports NFT purchases in both fiat and ETH. </p>
<p>That said, it’s a lot smaller than some of the others on this list. It primarily supports artists and features assets from over 6,000 collections on offer — covering the most popular collections.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224231/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-22-20.jpg" alt="nifty Gateway NFT marketplace" /></figure>
<p>As part of its bid to become the top NFT marketplace, the Nifty Gateway team confidently proclaimed they “will not rest until 1 billion people are collecting NFTs.” </p>
<p>That said, it does form somewhat of a walled garden since creators need to jump through several hurdles to mint their assets on the platform. The platform is owned by the Gemini crypto exchange and carries through the same quality people expect from the well-reputed platform.</p>
<p>Users can buy and sell on the platform without obstacles but must be approved to become a creator. This platform prides itself on exclusivity, which makes it one of the best NFT platforms for those looking for rarer items — this can include some exclusive celebrity collections.</p>
<p>Its exclusivity also prevents fake NFTs in the marketplace, reducing a major barrier to entry for some collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple user interface</li>
<li>High-profile creators</li>
<li>Fiat payments</li>
<li>Exclusive drops</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<li>ETH payments only</li>
<li>Massive 15% fee</li>

<h3>7. NBA Top Shot &#8211; The Native Marketplace for NBA Top Shots</h3>
<p>The leading sports NFT marketplace, the NBA Top Shot marketplace is popular among sports memorabilia enthusiasts and trading card collectors. </p>
<p>The platform offers officially licensed NBA NFT collections, including highlight clip NFTs of popular events in sports history known as ‘Moments’. Every moment NFT has a fixed number of copies with a serial number and can vary in rarity.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224232/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-23-22.jpg" alt="NBA Top Shot NFT marketplace" /></figure>
<p>The number of copies an NBA Top Shot moment has as well as the specific moment it captures helps to determine its rarity and value.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020 by NFT juggernaut Dapper Labs, NBA Top Shot has grown to become one of the leading NFT art marketplaces.</p>
<p>Catering to both NBA fans and web3 enthusiasts, NBA Top Shots is unusual among NFT marketplaces in that it also features a challenge feature — which users can take advantage of to potentially win VIP tickets, access to special events, and more.</p>
<p>The platform is built on the highly efficient Flow blockchain and supports payments in six cryptocurrencies as well as debit/credit card purchases. Top Shot stands out from other NFT platforms. Sellers are charged a flat 5% fee on every NFT sold.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy registration</li>
<li>Fiat payment options</li>
<li>Low transaction fees</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. SuperRare &#8211; Ethereum-based NFT Marketplace and DAO</h3>
<p>This NFT marketplace focuses on exclusive works of crypto art. It only lists the best NFT collections, the vast majority of which are digital artworks, avatars, or profile pictures (pfps).</p>
<p>SuperRare raised $9 million and launched on the Ethereum mainnet in 2018, since then it has grown to become one of the most popular NFT marketplaces — amassing several thousand users and regularly clocking in over $1 million in weekly trading volume.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224233/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-24-19.jpg" alt="SuperRare NFT art" /></figure>
<p>This platform is designed for more experienced collectors but still caters to newer users through a simple-to-use interface and simplified order options.</p>
<p>Like a growing number of top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/playdapp-mikey-nft-stands-out-bustling-nft-marketplace-gets-sold-out-within-three-hours.htm">NFT marketplaces</a>, SuperRare has its own token — known as RARE.

<li>Simple interface</li>

<h3>9. Sudoswap &#8211; Zero Royalty NFT Platform</h3>
<p>One of the first DeFi NFT trading platforms, Sudoswap was launched in July 2022 and was created by an anonymous developer.</p>
<p>The platform is based on Ethereum and featured user-supported NFT pools that allow users to buy or sell NFTs gradually across a dynamic price curve — similar to Uniswap but for NFTs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224234/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-25-37.jpg" alt="Sudoswap NFT marketplace" /></figure>
<p>Sudoswap is rare among NFT trading platforms in that it allows users to sell their NFTs instantly without needing to find a buyer thanks to its automated market maker (AMM) features. The platform also completely nixes NFT royalties, reducing the barriers to profitability and ensuring sellers retain more of the sale price.</p>
<p>It features some of the lowest fees around, with a simple 0.5% commission rate.</p>
<p>Sudoswap is set to launch its own governance token, known as SUDO. XMON holders will be able to redeem SUDO in the future once it is released.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No royalties for sellers</li>
<li>Decentralized</li>
<li>Powerful AMM capabilities</li>

<h2>What is an NFT Marketplace?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In short, an NFT marketplace is an online store that allows traders and investors to buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<p>These platforms are generally accessed through a website or mobile app, through which users can browse, buy, sell, or mint NFTs.</p>
<p>In most cases, NFT marketplaces are centralized. This simply means that they are owned by a parent company and provide custody services to NFT sellers and buyers. These are typically simpler to use, but some argue they are less secure.</p>
<p>Decentralized NFT marketplaces, on the other hand, are non-custodial but may be more difficult to use and more expensive than centralized options. These can be accessed by anyone from anywhere, and usually don’t require an account to use.</p>
<h2>How do NFT Platforms Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>NFT trading platforms are similar to regular cryptocurrency exchanges in that users can exchange one asset for another over a secure interface. But in the case of NFT platforms, users exchange cryptocurrency tokens for non-fungible assets.</p>
<p>Top NFT marketplaces are typically simple to use, making it easy for sellers to list their NFT/s for sale or buyers to purchase the NFT/s of their choice. </p>
<p>From a seller’s perspective, top NFT platforms like OpenSea and Rarible typically allow users to either mint their NFT directly on the platform before listing or simply list a pre-existing NFT from their collection.</p>
<p>This can then generally be listed under multiple sale formats, such as a bidding auction (with or without reserve), buy-it-now, or Dutch auction (where a price starts high and reduces at set intervals).</p>
<p>Sellers will usually be provided a clear breakdown of the expected fees prior to submitting the listing. Upon submission, they will need to provide the NFT platform with authorization to transfer the NFT upon successful sale.</p>
<p>Once listed, it’s then presented on the NFT marketplace website, where prospective buyers can view and potentially purchase it.</p>
<p>From the buyer’s perspective, the user simply connects their wallet to the NFT marketplace platform, browses the selection of NFTs available, and makes their bid or purchase on the assets they want. </p>
<p>By bidding, the user needs to provide authorization for the platform to spend the agreed funds should they win, or immediately if they buy the item right away. The funds are then transferred to the seller (less the platform fees) and the NFT is transferred to the buyer.</p>
<h2>Different Types of NFT Marketplaces</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Today, the NFT marketplace landscape comprises both established and well-reputed options like OpenSea, as well as a range of up-and-coming potential disruptors like <a href="https://nft.luckyblock.com/"><u>nft.luckyblock.com</u></a> and SudoSwap.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224658/opensea-bored-ape.jpg" alt="OpenSea BAYC NFTs" /></figure>
<p>Given the sheer number of different platforms, individuals researching where to buy NFT tokens can be befuddled with options — since many platforms seem to offer the same range of features and have similar designs.</p>
<p>But while most NFT marketplaces may be similar, there is actually a wide range of different NFT platforms which can vary considerably based on the blockchain they’re built on and support, as well as the types of NFTs they offer.</p>
<p>Some of the most common types include:</p>
<h3>Multi-chain NFT Marketplaces</h3>
<p>Some of the more established NFT marketplaces can be considered multi-chain marketplaces. This essentially means they support NFT collections hosted on multiple different blockchains — whether that be Ethereum, Tezos, BNB Chain, or other prominent chains.</p>
<p>There are also smaller, more obscure platforms like NFTrade, tofuNFT, and AxelarSea, while some popular larger platforms like OpenSea and LooksRare opt to stick with a single blockchain. </p>
<p>That said, it’s likely just a matter of time until all of the best NFT platforms go cross-chain.</p>
<h3>Ethereum NFT Marketplaces</h3>
<p>The vast majority of generic NFT and NFT art marketplaces operate on Ethereum and only support Ethereum-based assets — such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs.</p>
<p>As by far the most popular platform for NFT collections and with the largest number of individual NFT holders, Ethereum remains a crucial pillar of the NFT landscape.</p>
<p>As it stands, 9 of the top 10 NFT collections by trading volume are deployed on the platform, making it an excellent starting position for those looking at where to buy NFT tokens.</p>
<h3>Solana NFT Marketplaces</h3>
<p>Though not quite as popular as Ethereum, Solana is also up-and-coming as an NFT platform, due to its fast speed, low fees, and user-friendliness.</p>
<p>It’s also home to some of the top NFT art marketplaces, including the likes of SolSea, Magic Eden, and Solanart.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224657/magic-eden.jpg" alt="Magic Eden Okay Bears NFTs" /></figure>
<p>If you’re looking at where to buy NFT art with low fees, the Solana ecosystem is a good place to start.</p>
<h3>Algorand NFT Marketplaces</h3>
<p>One of the newer smart contract platforms, Algorand is a popular choice for NFT creators and investors thanks to its low fees and environmental friendliness — tackling two problems previously associated with Ethereum-based NFTs.</p>
<p>Its NFT art marketplace landscape still remains thin, with several smaller platforms like Shufl, ALGOxNFT, and OG2D competing for dominance.</p>
<h3>Tezos NFT Marketplaces</h3>
<p>Another up-and-coming platform for NFT, Tezos has seen its popularity grow in recent months thanks to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/5-nft-success-stories-2022-projects-with-bright-future.htm">success of quirky NFT collections</a> like Tezzards, Dogami, Ottez, and Neonz.</p>
<p>The platform now hosts multiple NFT art marketplaces, including objkt, Tezos Art, and Kalamint. With objkt currently standing out as the best place to buy NFTs on Tezos thanks to its simple mint capabilities and diverse library.</p>
<h3>BNB NFT Marketplaces</h3>
<p>BNB Chain is quickly being recognized as one of the best NFT platforms, as is demonstrated by the sheer meteoric growth of its NFT landscape — with popular NFT collections like those from PancakeSwap racking up more than $40 million in trading volume in 2021.</p>
<p>Binance NFT marketplace currently stands out as the best place to buy NFTs on BNB Chain due to its low fees and massive selection, but a range of upstarts like NFTrade and Refinable is hot on its heels.</p>
<h3>NFT Music Marketplaces</h3>
<p>Though most NFT platforms can be considered NFT art marketplaces, there is also a growing number of NFT music marketplaces — which as you might have guessed, allow users to trade music NFTs.</p>
<p>These are simple blockchain-based certificates that identify the owner of a musical work. They typically include royalty capabilities ensuring the creator (and sometimes secondary sellers) receive a fraction of future sales.</p>
<h2>How We Rank the Best NFT Marketplaces</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As you might expect, not all NFT marketplaces are built equal. Top NFT marketplaces can offer significant advantages over less-established or lower-quality platforms, while newer more ambitious options can offer features that are difficult to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>To select the best NFT trading platforms, we compared a wide range of both established and trending players using a handful of key metrics. Those that scored the best across the following five metrics were included in our list.</p>
<h3>Range of NFTs</h3>
<p>If an NFT marketplace doesn’t support the NFT collection you’re interested in, then it likely doesn’t matter how good the platform is.</p>
<p>When choosing where to buy NFTs, users will invariably favor the platforms that support the widest range of collections — ranging from blue chips to new and less established collections. </p>
<p>After all, the best place to buy NFTs is the platform that actually has the NFT you’re looking to buy available.</p>
<h3>Quality of the Collection</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, many smaller or less-established NFT marketplaces fail to attract high-quality sellers and top-quality collections.</p>
<p>As a result, the quality of their library suffers. This can make it difficult to buyers to find highly sought-after NFTs, rare items, or assets from popular collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) or CryptoPunks.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://nftevening.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/boredapeheader.jpg" alt="Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs" /></figure>
<p>This is particularly problematic among newer NFT art marketplaces, which typically largely feature artworks from unknown artists or creators.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Despite the advent of so-called “fee-free” NFT marketplaces — which just nix transaction fees, not sale commissions — even the best NFT platforms charge a fee.</p>
<p>In order to attract the largest array of users (including creators, sellers, and buyers), marketplaces should keep fees down to a bare minimum.</p>
<p>The industry standard is currently 2.5% of the sale price, but some charge upwards of 10% while a handful charge 1% or less — including the Binance NFT marketplace.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>Ease of use is a critical factor for NFT marketplaces, with top NFT platforms like Binance NFT marketplace and nft.luckyblock.com providing an intuitive user experience.<br /><br />In particular, these platforms make it easy to identify trending and popular collections — providing crucial guidance for users.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224249/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-11-05-33.jpg" alt="LaunchPad NFTs" /></figure>
<p>For beginners first choosing where to buy NFT tokens, usability can be a critical factor, but few platforms manage to keep things simple.</p>
<h3>Liquidity</h3>
<p>As a seller, you would want to use an NFT marketplace website that has a large user base — giving you the best chance of finding a buyer and attracting a high bid for your NFTs. </p>
<p>Whereas as a buyer, you’d likely opt for an NFT marketplace with an extensive range of sellers, ensuring prices remain competitive and there is sufficient variety on offer.</p>
<p>For these reasons, top NFT marketplaces typically notch up considerable trading volume, making them more attractive than less liquid alternatives.</p>
<h2>How to Buy NFTs on a Marketplace</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Since the first NFT marketplaces appeared in 2015, a huge amount of progress has been made in making them more capable, accessible, and easy to use.</p>
<p>Today’s NFT marketplaces are in a different league from their predecessors, with modern platforms like nft.luckyblock.com offering an intuitive interface that is suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>Here, we show you how to buy your first NFT onnft.luckyblock.com. In this example, we’ll purchase a Platinum Rollers Club NFT from Lucky Block — since it is a popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-yield-farming-crypto-platforms.htm">yield farming</a> utility NFT. </p>
<p>Bear in mind that the process is similar for all other NFTs on the platform.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Connect Your Wallet</h3>
<p>Head over to the nft.luckyblock.com homepage and click the pink wallet icon. Select the wallet you wish to make your purchase with and connect it to the site.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224240/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-42-06.jpg" alt="Crypto wallet" /></figure>
<h3>Step 2: Find Your NFT Collection</h3>
<p>Using the search box, enter the name of the NFT collection you’re interested in. From the list of options, select the one that matches your query.</p>
<p>In this case, we searched for “Platinum Rollers Club” using the &#8216;All Collections&#8217; selector.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224241/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-50-52.jpg" alt="Launchpad NFT collections" /></figure>
<h3>Step 3: Pick an NFT to Buy</h3>
<p>From the list of NFTs up for sale within your chosen collection, select the one you wish to purchase.</p>
<p>This will pull up the NFT details as well as the purchase interface.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224242/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-53-10.jpg" alt="Lucky Block NFTs" /></figure>
<h3>Step 4: Complete Your Purchase</h3>
<p>From here, you can either place a bid using the &#8216;Make offer&#8217; option or buy it immediately using the &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; option.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89312/224244/screenshot-2022-09-30-at-10-53-59.jpg" alt="NFT purchase checkout" /></figure>
<p>We’ll go with the ‘Buy Now’ option. After clicking &#8216;Buy Now&#8217;, click the &#8216;Pay&#8217; button to submit your purchase. This will open a transaction prompt on your connected Web3 wallet, which you will need to approve to send the payment.</p>
<p>Once this is complete, your NFT will be transferred to your payment wallet for use.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<p>New-age platforms like nft.luckyblock.com now make it easier than ever before to buy or sell NFTs, and access trending NFT collections like BAYC and <a href="https://nft.luckyblock.com/users/0x1eec6c20a0542928ba83377d19a77fa29c6675ca"><u>LuckyBlock Competitions</u></a>. </p>

Though most indicators suggest that Bitcoin is now nearing the bottom of its recent bear market, it remains unclear just how low it can go or when it will occur.</p><p>But by repurposing the popular Pi Cycle Top indicator, we may now be inching closer to an answer.</p><h2>How it Works</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Created by Philip Swift, the founder of LookIntoBitcoin, the Pi Cycle Top indicator uses a combination of the 111-day simple moving average (111SMA) and 2x multiple of Bitcoin&#8217;s 350-day simple moving average (2x 350SMA) to forecast the top of Bitcoin&rsquo;s market cycles.</p><p>Historically, the 2x 350SMA has proven to be an accurate predictor of Bitcoin&rsquo;s top, having closely predicted the height and timing of the past 3 bull markets.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/91443/228806/1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/91443/228806/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_1600_900.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/news/91443/228806/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_1200_675.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/91443/228806/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_900_506.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/91443/228806/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/91443/228806/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_600_337.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/91443/228806/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_300_168.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1600" class="content-img"></figure><p>Though the Pi Cycle Top Indicator is primarily used for indicating Bitcoin&rsquo;s top, it also demonstrates impressive predictive power for its bottom &mdash; with the 111SMA overlapping the bottom of the 2012, 2015, and 2019 bear markets.</p><p>Backtested on historical data, the 111SMA has been shown to predict the depth and timing of the Bitcoin bottom to within 5 months.</p><h2>What it Means for the Bitcoin Price</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-added-guinness-world-records-book-find-out-more.htm">Bitcoin</a> is widely known to have a roughly four-year cycle centered around the halving event &mdash; with Bitcoin tending to bottom around 380-550 days prior to its halving date, and topping out around 360 to 520 days post-halving.&nbsp;</p><p>But these figures are far from precise enough to really take advantage of.</p><p>According to the 111SMA, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-casper-pumps-over-27.htm">Bitcoin price</a> now appears to be between 1-5 months away from its bottom, which means a further slide can be expected at some point before March 2023.

Should this be the case, then a further 49% drop could be on the horizon.</p><p>This is further corroborated by Bitcoin&#8217;s sliding <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-trading-volume-picking-up-again-end-of-bear-market.htm">trading volume</a> &mdash; which has decreased by more than a third in the last three months.

But Glassnode, a prominent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/on-chain-analysis-data-providers-who-are-they-and-what-do-th-6962.htm">on-chain analytics</a> and research firm, recently unveiled a novel model to accurately identify both &mdash; with a 100% hit rate against backtested data.</p><p>The new model, known simply as the drilling method, leverages multiple new and existing data points to help accurately identify market extremes &mdash; providing an additional source of data for traders and speculators.</p><p>This is how it works.</p><h2>The Bitcoin Price and Mayer Multiples of 2.4</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Created by the prominent investor Trace Mayer, the Mayer Multiple is defined as the multiple of Bitcoin&#8217;s price over its 200-day moving average (MA) &mdash; such that a current price of $50,000 and a 200-day MA of $25,000 would yield a Mayer Multiple of 2.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2022/09/MP-202209-14-06.png" alt="bitcoin price mayer multiple"></figure><p>The Mayer Multiple has been used to indicate whether Bitcoin is in a bubble or not. By backtesting data, Trace Mayer found that a Mayer Multiple of 2.4 could accurately predict the top of a bull market, whereas a number less than 1 indicates a bear market.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, many traders believe that a Mayer Multiple of 2.4+ indicates the Bitcoin price is overvalued or that buyer exhaustion is near.</p><p>Going one step further, Glassnode created a construction that tests whether the Mayer Multiple is above 2.4, in addition to several other parameters to determine the condition of the Bitcoin market.</p><p>By taking the Mayer Multiple, the current price, and the percent of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/bitcoin-on-chain-percentage-of-supply-in-profitloss.htm">Bitcoin supply in profit</a>, Glassnode was able to accurately identify whether Bitcoin is currently at the peak or trough of a market cycle.</p><h2>What Is The Drilling Method?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As an incredibly volatile asset class, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are known to regularly shake out overleveraged speculators and fair-weather holders. But until now, there was no indicator that could gauge holder resistance to price volatility &mdash; a good measure of market hardiness.</p><p>As part of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insights.glassnode.com/market-pulse-drilling-techniques/"><u>the report</u></a>, Glassnode made the unusual connection between the resistance to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-max-pain-is-sideways-chop-until-2024-bluntz.htm">Bitcoin price</a> volatility and the measurement while drilling (MWD) technique &mdash; which describes how rock hardness/strength varies at different drilling depths.</p><p>Where MWD records parameters like depth, penetration rate, rock density, porosity, and more to determine drilling resistance, Glassnode&rsquo;s new drilling method instead tracks the correlation between Bitcoin&#8217;s price change and the change of the percent of supply in profit to help identify cycle extremes.</p><p>Using this method on backtested data, Glassnode identified top (red columns) and floor points (green columns) between 2010 and 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Glassnode did this by looking at points where the Mayer Multiple was above 2.4 and then looking at the correlation between price and percentage of the supply in profit.</p><p>Based on the Mayer Multiple and whether the realized price (price the last time the BTC was moved) was higher or lower than the market price, Glassnode found the following:</p><p>When the correlation was under 0.75 while the Mayer Multiple was above 2.4, this indicates the market is close to the top of a cycle.</p><p>When the correlation was under 0.75 and the current price is below the realized price, this indicates the market is close to the bottom of a cycle.</p><p>After applying this to Bitcoin&rsquo;s market data for the past decade, the columns detected by the drilling method clearly overlap with the peaks (green columns) and troughs (red columns) of each cycle with high accuracy.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2022/09/MP-202209-14-04.png" alt="bitcoin price supply in profit correlation"></figure><p>Put simply, the new technique provides an accurate gauge of market cycle extremes &mdash; with the potential to help traders better manage their risk.</p><h2>What This Means for Bitcoin Price</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As we have seen time and time again, Bitcoin (and most other cryptocurrencies) are highly cyclical assets &mdash; with their values forming a new absolute high and relative trough approximately every three to four years.</p><p>This is confirmed by Glassnode&rsquo;s drilling method, which correctly identified the peaks of the previous four bull markets.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2022/09/MP-202209-14-07.png" alt="bitcoin price top detection via drilling method">It also accurately identified the bottoms of the interdigitating bear markets seen between 2011-2012, 2014-2015, 2018-2019, and most recently 2021-2022.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2022/09/MP-202209-14-05.png" alt="bitcoin price floor detection via drilling method">As shown in the above chart, the Bitcoin market is now squarely in bear territory.
