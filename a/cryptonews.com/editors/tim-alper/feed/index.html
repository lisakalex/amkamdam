<p>Another leading South Korean crypto exchange has listed the US dollar-pegged stablecoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">USDT</a> as global trading volumes begin to climb.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.khgames.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=222263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyunghyang Games</a>, Bithumb – the second biggest exchange in the nation – launched support for the coin on December 7.</p>
<p>The listing follows Coinone’s November 30 listing of the coin. Both exchanges provide support for USDT on the Tron blockchain protocol.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140215" style="width: 1596px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140215" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964404-bithumb-ext-1.png" alt="A Bithumb customer center in Seoul, South Korea." width="1596" height="676" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964404-bithumb-ext-1.png 1596w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964404-bithumb-ext-1-300x127.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964404-bithumb-ext-1-1024x434.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964404-bithumb-ext-1-768x325.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964404-bithumb-ext-1-1536x651.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964404-bithumb-ext-1-150x64.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1596px) 100vw, 1596px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140215" class="wp-caption-text">A Bithumb customer center in Seoul, South Korea.

<p>Scrutiny of the coins listed on South Korean exchanges has risen in recent years, with<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-south-korean-crypto-exchanges-purging-altcoins-in-late-n-10738.htm"> trading platforms purging so-called “kimchi coins” in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>These low-cap altcoins, popular mainly in South Korea, have gained notoriety, with many used as a vehicle for price manipulation.</p>
<p>Experts think regulators pressured South Korean exchanges to slim down their token offerings, leading to multiple delisting events.</p>
<p>Tether’s stablecoin has experienced some controversy regarding its USD reserves in the past.</p>
<p>But the South Korean exchanges appeared to shrug off concerns. Coinone was quoted as stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Tether regularly updates its audit reports and publishes reserve details. Investors can check on [details such as] collateral and distribution volume.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>USDT Gaining Ground in South Korea?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
USDT is popular in South Korea, as is the case in much of Asia, where many traders use the coin to trade Bitcoin on peer-to-peer markets.</p>
<p>But until very recently, most domestic crypto traders “had to send their assets overseas” and then use the proceeds for USDT “to trade in the coins of their choosing,” the media outlet wrote.</p>
<p>Bithumb <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-crypto-exchange-bithumb-still-aiming-for-ipo-despite-deep-troubles.htm">posted some of its most sluggish financial results in years at the end of FY2023 Q3</a>.</p>
<p>However, the platform appears to be hoping the USDT listing will revive its fortunes.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140214" style="width: 1540px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140214 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964282-bithumb-0712.png" alt="A chart showing the top five cryptoassets by trading volume on the Bithumb crypto exchange on December 7." width="1540" height="367" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964282-bithumb-0712.png 1540w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964282-bithumb-0712-300x71.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964282-bithumb-0712-1024x244.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964282-bithumb-0712-768x183.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964282-bithumb-0712-1536x366.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964282-bithumb-0712-150x36.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1540px) 100vw, 1540px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140214" class="wp-caption-text">The top five coins by trading volume on the Bithumb crypto exchange on December 7.

<p>The exchange told customers they could receive fractional Bitcoin “cashback”-type rewards when placing maker orders.</p>
<p>The trading platform said the event was being held to mark the new listing, and would run until December 11.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140213" style="width: 832px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140213" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964212-usdt-0712.png" alt="A graph showing USDT’s market cap over the past 12 months." width="832" height="589" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964212-usdt-0712.png 832w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964212-usdt-0712-300x212.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964212-usdt-0712-768x544.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701964212-usdt-0712-150x106.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140213" class="wp-caption-text">USDT’s market cap over the past 12 months.

<p>The development comes in the wake of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-customs-service-swoops-on-intl-usdt-gambling-ring.htm">a customs service raid on a suspected international gambling ring that used USDT</a>.</p>
<p>Officials think the ring paid online casino users winnings in USDT, which the ring swapped for fiat on an “illegal” Philippines-based crypto exchange.</p>

<p>More Chinese cities will give away <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-firms-can-now-make-digital-yuan-housing-fund-payments.htm">digital yuan</a> tokens and discount vouchers this month, as the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) looks to spur CBDC adoption.</p>
<p><a href="https://finance.hebnews.cn/2023-12/07/content_9109393.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hebei News Network</a> reported that the PBoC’s Hebei branch and local government authorities in the province will give out up to $2.8 million worth of coins and vouchers this month.</p>
<p>Recipients can spend their coins and vouchers at “more than 50,000 participating merchants,” with a “two-phase giveaway” planned.</p>
<p>Residents must open or hold digital yuan wallets with commercial banks or the Alipay e-pay platform to register their interest. Entrants will have four separate chances to win.</p>
<p>Winners will receive their coins in “lucky” red digital envelopes, and can receive up to $28 in each envelope.</p>
<p>In China, red is considered a luck-bestowing color. Chinese tradition dictates senior family members and firms must give money to children and employees in red envelopes at the year’s end, ahead of the Lunar New Year.</p>

<h2>Chinese Cities End 2023 with Digital Yuan Handouts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Elsewhere, similar incentives are already underway in Suzhou, <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/741995031_115865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Beijing Business Daily</a> reported, where banks are focusing on e-CNY discount vouchers.</p>
<p>These vouchers allow citizens to enjoy discounts of up to 80% when paying with the CBDC in local stores.</p>
<p>The news outlet explained that the city issued vouchers worth some $620,000 on December 6.</p>
<p>The city gave out different types of vouchers, offering a maximum of $28 off purchases of goods and services costing $70 or more.</p>

<p>The city issued a total of 68,200 vouchers in total, in conjunction with the commercial bank China Construction Bank.</p>
<p>The same media outlet additionally noted that more e-CNY giveaway events are also being held in Jinan.</p>
<p>The Jinan Municipal Government is distributing digital CNY subsidies to low-emission vehicle owners this month.</p>
<p>The Jinan event is being held in conjunction with Qilu Bank. Drivers can receive up to $704 worth of CBDC coins if they meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>Previously. Shenzhen’s Yantian District told couples they <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinese-newlyweds-to-scoop-digital-yuan-giveaways.htm">could receive e-CNY coins if they register their marriages in the district before the end of the year</a>.</p>

Emart is South Korea’s largest retailer, with hypermarkets across the nation, in addition to smaller outlets like Emart24.</p>
<p>The firm was founded in November 1993 by the retail giant and department store operator Shinsegae.</p>
<p>Emart24 has rolled out POS machines compatible with e-pay platforms popular in China, such as Alipay, Alipay Plus, WeChat Pay, and Union Pay.</p>

<p>The firm also accepts payments from the Japanese card issuer Japan Credit Bureau (JCB).</p>
<p>There is a high possibility that Myeongdong-based merchants like Emart24 and others will begin exploring overseas CBDC payments in the near future.</p>
<p>Myeongdong merchants’ clientele is predominantly Chinese, with many Japanese tourists also visiting.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, the South Korean news agency Yonhap <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-merchants-may-accept-digital-yuan-from-chinese-6776.htm">claimed these merchants could be prime movers in CBDC adoption</a>.</p>
<p>The report’s author claimed that “tourist shops such as those in Seoul’s Myeongdong District” are already “used to processing Alipay payments,” and added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“These same South Korean merchants may soon begin accepting digital yuan payments to cater to Chinese customers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>All forms of coin issuance are still illegal in the country, following a partial crypto crackdown in early 2018.</p>
<p>The current government has previously indicated a willingness to let regulated domestic firms issue STOs.</p>
<p>However, a series of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-lawmakers-must-declare-crypto-holdings-coin-gate-fallout-continues.htm">high-profile crypto controversies</a> appears to have slowed this legislation’s progress.</p>

<p>The CVM, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-financial-giant-nubank-partners-with-circle-for-usdc-integration.htm">Brazil</a>’s markets regulator, has co-launched a glossary of crypto-related terms in a bid to “standardize” terminology in the Latin American nation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://abcripto.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/glossario_abcripto_v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glossary</a> was co-compiled and published by the Brazilian Cryptoeconomics Association (ABCripto), a crypto industry group.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The glossary is in line with the work that the CVM has been doing to [&#8230;] make [crypto-related] language clearer and simpler. We are focusing on facilitating knowledge and rapprochement with individual investors […].”</p></blockquote>
<p>ABCripto wrote that the resource was “developed to offer a comprehensive guide to terms related to [&#8230;] cryptocurrencies, digital assets, tokenization, and related areas.” The group added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our main objective is to establish standardization in language. We wanted to make it accessible and understandable to everyone.”</p></blockquote>

The media outlet quoted the CVM as explaining that ABCripto created a working group that authored the document.</p>
<p>The CVM then “reviewed and validated the material.” The parties then “sought consensus regarding the definitions presented.”</p>

<p>The glossary contains some 200 crypto and blockchain-related entries. It contains definitions of popular English and Portuguese terms.</p>
<p>These terms range from crypto mining tax-related terminology to English words and acronyms such as “<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-stablecoins-features-and-differences-2655.htm">stablecoin</a>,” “bear market,” and “ATH.”</p>
<p>Bernardo Srur, the CEO of ABCripto, claimed that the glossary was “a source of pride for ABCripto and the CVM.” Srur explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is a work that features technical rigor and editorial quality. Many contributors took part in this project. The glossary will be a source of knowledge and structure for the development […] of everyone in the digital assets market.”</p></blockquote>

<p>According to the broadcaster <a href="https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/pc/view/view.do?ncd=7833903" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KBS</a>, officers arrested seven people in raids, with one remanded in custody.</p>
<p>The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office will now handle the group’s cases.</p>
<p>The seven people were charged with violating the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act.</p>
<p>But two suspected gambling ring members have reportedly fled abroad in a bid to avoid arrest.</p>
<p>Officers said the individual they retained in custody was the group’s unofficial leader. The search continues for the rest of the alleged gang.</p>
<p>The customs service held a press conference where they showed images of some of the items they seized in the raids, including KRW and USD banknotes.</p>

<h2>How Did South Korean-Filipino ‘USDT-Gambling Ring’ Operate?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Officers claimed that the ring used social media channels to find “customers” for illegal gambling sites.</p>
<p>The ring allegedly converted the money it received to USDT, amassing over $12 million worth of the USD-pegged stablecoin.</p>
<p>Customs officials said the group paid gamblers their winnings in USDT tokens.</p>
<p>They said the group used an “illegal gambling establishment in the Philippines” to convert fiat to USDT.</p>
<p>The group allegedly worked out of two “secret offices” in Seoul, South Korea, and Bonifacio Global City, near the Philippine capital.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139432" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139432" style="width: 841px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139432" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701785559-usdt-0512.png" alt="A graph showing USDT’s market cap over the past month." width="841" height="607" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701785559-usdt-0512.png 841w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701785559-usdt-0512-300x217.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701785559-usdt-0512-768x554.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701785559-usdt-0512-150x108.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139432" class="wp-caption-text">USDT’s market cap over the past month. (Source: CoinMarketCap)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Officers further claimed that the group’s leader “set up multiple shell companies for arbitrage crypto trading.”</p>
<p>Customs officials said the ring also “created fake documents to pretend to pay for imports.” Seoul-based customs officers confiscated “materials related to illegal remittances” and “cash” worth almost $182,000.</p>
<h2>Crypto and Gambling Crackdowns Continue</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
South Korean gambling laws are famously strict. Only one brick-and-mortar casino in the country has a license to admit domestic customers.</p>
<p>Authorities have been cracking down on online gambling sites and illegal casinos for over a decade.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, South Korea’s five biggest crypto exchanges said they would join financial regulators to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-koreas-biggest-exchanges-help-regulators-hunt-undeclared-crypto-operators.htm">hunt “undeclared crypto operators.”</a></p>
<p>Last month, police in South Jeolla Province arrested a group of people they suspect of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-police-shut-down-170-victim-robot-themed-crypto-scam.htm">duping 170 “crypto investors” by posing as crypto-issuing robot developers</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/belarus-says-crypto-firms-can-operate-tax-free-until-2025.htm">Belarus</a> wants to accelerate the launch of its CBDC as it looks to evade US and EU-led sanctions and let its firms trade with international partners.</p>
<p>Per Belarus’ <a href="https://neg.by/novosti/otkrytj/vozmozhnosti-biznesa-obhodit-sankcii-rasshirjajutsja/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta</a>, President Alexander Lukashenko could issue a CBDC-related verdict in the coming days. The media outlet wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A decision on the introduction of a new form of money is set to be made after a meeting that will be attended by the head of state.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Minsk, like Moscow, has been hit with several packages of economic sanctions following the outbreak of war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trade firms have been hit especially hard. Belarusian importers and exporters are effectively frozen out of the international baking network.</p>
<p>But, like Moscow, Minsk has been trying to find ways around sanctions that involve dollar-free transactions.</p>
<h2>Belarus Preparing to Use Digital Ruble to Dodge Sanctions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Belarusian government officials have been exploring CBDC issuance for several years.</p>
<p>However, the nation <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/belarus-prepares-to-launch-cross-border-cbdc-russias-digital-ruble-an-inspiration.htm">stepped up its plans for a digital Belarusian ruble in August this year</a>, announcing plans for “real-world” testing.</p>
<p>Tellingly, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) began talking up the digital BYN’s cross-border credentials from the outset.</p>
<p>Dmitry Kalechits, the NRBR Deputy Chairman, called the CBDC a “most significant large-scale project.”</p>
<p>Kalechits also spoke about the coin’s potential “use at the cross-border level.”</p>
<p>The media outlet called the CBDC a “mechanism” that “may appear in Belarus to allow businesses to overcome sanctions.”</p>
<p>The NRBR reiterated its claims from earlier this year, stating that a digital Belarusian ruble “will be of greatest interest in the cross-border payments space.”</p>
<p>The meeting could take place later this month after Lukashenko returns from a state visit to China.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was welcomed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Monday. </p>
<p>Lukashenko has become increasingly isolated following a crackdown on political opponents and his support for Russia in its war on Ukraine. <a href="https://t.co/D2svzCiImu">https://t.co/D2svzCiImu</a> <a href="https://t.co/SoEJQr4nNR">pic.twitter.com/SoEJQr4nNR</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Lukashenko met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, where the latter decried “external interference” in Belarus’ internal affairs.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202312/1302978.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Times</a>, Xi applauded Minsk’s attempt to “look East,” and promised to provide “strategic support.”</p>
<p>The developments come at a time when China is also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-hong-kong-banks-set-to-join-digital-yuan-pilot-govt-confirms.htm">testing its own CBDC’s cross-border capabilities</a>.</p>
<p>Minsk’s long-standing ally, Moscow, has also sped up its own CBDC pilots, with a nationwide launch slated for 2025.</p>

<p>Russian politicians have similarly stated that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-lawmaker-suggests-china-russias-cbdcs-are-compatible.htm">the digital (Russian) ruble will be used in the international trade space</a>.</p>
<p>However, until CBDC-powered trade becomes a reality, Belarusian traders could be forced into much cruder measures.</p>
<p>The same media outlet explained that the central bank recently approved a law that allows “exporters to make payments in cash” until the end of 2024.</p>

<p>DAXA will team up with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which answers to the Financial Services Commission – the nation’s top financial regulator.</p>
<p>The parties have asked members of the public to come forward with anonymous tipoffs about “undeclared virtual asset business operators.”</p>
<p>South Korea’s crypto exchange industry is one of the most tightly regulated crypto sectors in the world.</p>
<p>Currently, only the five DAXA members have operating permits that allow them to offer crypto-to-fiat trading pairs.</p>
<p>This has given rise to several “unofficial” South Korean crypto trading platforms.</p>
<p>Many of these platforms advertise their services in crypto-themed public chat rooms and social media sites.</p>

<h2>Will South Korean Crypto Exchanges Help Close Down Illegal Crypto Firms?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
DAX and the FIU asked whistleblowers to provide “business-related information” on these “unregistered platforms.”</p>
<p>They also called for whistleblowers to provide “evidence of unreported business activities.”</p>
<p>DAXA said it would carry out “initial reviews” of whistleblower reports and would pass on relevant information to the FIU.</p>
<p>However, DAXA and the FIU are not only targetting “unreported” South Korea-based crypto firms.</p>
<p>The bodies said their targets were “domestic and overseas virtual asset business operators who do not report their activities under the Specific Financial Information Act.”</p>
<p>This means that overseas platforms that “target South Koreans” could also be in DAXA and the FIU’s crosshairs.</p>
<p>The parties also asked whistleblowers to provide “reasons for suspecting” that “undeclared businesses” target South Korea-based users.</p>
<p>The FIU will likely send firms it suspects of breaking South Korean crypto law “cease and desist”-type orders.</p>
<p>Firms that fail to respond to these orders could face legal action, particularly if they have a presence in South Korea. A DAXA spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The FIU has said that it plans to take all necessary measures, including notifying investigative agencies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, a Chinese government minister <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-japan-and-south-korea-explore-collaboration-in-big-data-blockchain-and-ai.htm">called on Seoul and Tokyo to streamline its blockchain and IT policy with Beijing’s efforts</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchanges-including-okx-bybit-bitstamp-working-with-russian-arbitrators-on-bankruptcy-cases.htm">Russia</a>’s Central Bank says there has been a drop in the number of citizens trading crypto – with citizens staying away from major overseas trading platforms.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/crypto/news/65685b6b9a79478faced3692" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RBC</a>, the bank’s data shows Russians’ crypto activity “decreased in the second and third quarters of 2023.”</p>
<p>The bank said it had recorded a fall in Russian visits to “the websites of the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading platforms.”</p>
<p>The bank added that it had noticed a drop in “the volume of [Russian-owned] cryptocurrency flowing” on exchanges.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bank said, Russians have now effectively turned their backs on centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) in favor of the P2P and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/is-crypto-otc-trading-for-you-3576.htm">OTC</a> markets.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a crypto security provider claimed that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-p2p-crypto-market-worth-296m-day-are-banks-danger.htm">some $296 million worth of P2P crypto trades are made available every day in Russia</a>.</p>
<p>The bank said that P2P transactions are now Russians’ “main channel for acquiring cryptoassets.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the bank claimed the average monthly volume of Russian P2P crypto transactions had “increased by 53.9% compared to the same period last year.”</p>
<p>The bank said Russian credit institutions were “becoming better at identifying transactions related to P2P crypto trading.”</p>

<h2>Russian Crypto Traders Feeling Sanctions Bite?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Many major international crypto exchanges bar Russia-based crypto traders as a result of US- and EU-led sanctions.</p>
<p>However, media outlets have reported that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heres-how-russians-dodge-sanctions-to-use-intl-crypto-exchanges.htm">many Russians are using loopholes to evade sanctions</a>. Many traders, they report, continue to use overseas CEXs.</p>
<p>Binance this year announced its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-to-opt-out-of-ruble-payment-deal-with-advcash-amid-russian-exit.htm">“complete withdrawal from Russia”</a> and the sale of its business to CommEX.</p>
<p>The firm has also halted ruble deposits on its platform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-to-halt-russian-ruble-deposits-as-part-of-exit-strategy-from-russia.htm">and will end withdrawals at the end of January next year</a>.</p>
<p>The bank warned that “alternative” CEXs could be “risky” for citizens. It warned of the dangers of platforms that specifically “target Russians.”</p>
<p>However, the bank suggested that the fall in crypto trading may not be due wholly to sanctions. The bank wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The activity of Russian [crypto] users fell noticeably in the third quarter. This correlates with a global decline in investor interest in the cryptoasset market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The bank concluded that the “share of Russian visitors” in the total number of visits made to CEXs in the second and third quarters of FY2023 had “decreased from 5.8 to 4.9%.”</p>

<p>The launch of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchanges-including-okx-bybit-bitstamp-working-with-russian-arbitrators-on-bankruptcy-cases.htm">Russian</a> digital ruble will trigger the nation’s “largest monetary reforms since the 1990s,” a media report has claimed.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://progorod33.ru/news/82449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProGorod</a>, Russia’s CBDC project will be the biggest transformative event in the nation’s economic history since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The digital ruble “real-world” pilot began in August this year <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/600-russians-trial-cbdc-next-week-digital-ruble-pilot-begins.htm">in 11 cities nationwide</a>, including Moscow and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-beauty-salon-becomes-first-process-cbdc-payment.htm">Yekaterinburg</a>.</p>
<p>But the Central Bank has grand plans for rapid expansion in 2024, with at least 16 more banks joining the pilot.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has announced that the government also wants to start using the coin next year.</p>
<p>The ministry additionally suggested Moscow is targetting a nationwide rollout no later than 2025.</p>
<p>This claim is somewhat bolder than the Central Bank’s original timeline of a “2025 to 207 rollout.”</p>

<h2>‘Marked Digital Rubles’ to Debut in 2024?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finance minister Anton Siluanov said Moscow wants to use the coin to make “social payments” and pay “subsidies.”</p>
<p>However, the ministry appears keen to push ahead with plans to “color” or “mark” some digital RUB coins.</p>
<p>The plan, first mooted by the Central Bank in September, could allow the bank and others to “track the use of funds allocated for specific purposes.”</p>
<p>Previously, the bank’s Deputy Governor said that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-central-bank-may-mark-cbdc-tokens-track-digital-ruble-transactions.htm">“color-coded” digital rubles</a> could be used to issue “state budget funds.”</p>
<p>Siluanov suggested that the ministry would begin the year by piloting a range of Treasury payments, possibly including subsidy transactions.</p>
<p>The ministry may also seek to experiment with “marked” digital ruble-powered child benefits and pensions in 2024.</p>
<p>The media outlet explained that a practical “example,” of CBDC “coloring” could come in the child benefits sphere.</p>
<p>ProGorod wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Colored digital rubles] could be used to ensure child benefit payments are used as intended, and not to pay off loans and fines.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Late last month, the government indicated that it was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-bailiffs-will-get-more-powers-to-seize-cbdc-crypto.htm">preparing to give Russian bailiffs more power to seize CBDC coins and cryptoassets</a>.</p>
<p>However, some lawmakers are not content with the Central Bank’s digital ruble plans.</p>
<p>A group of MPs <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-lawmakers-urge-central-bank-to-rethink-digital-ruble-plans.htm">wants to ditch the current retail model in favor of a wholesale CBDC</a>.</p>

<p>Chinese firms can now use the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-hong-kong-banks-set-to-join-digital-yuan-pilot-govt-confirms.htm">digital yuan</a> to pay into employee housing funds, as the nation’s banks look for new CBDC applications.</p>
<p>Per the Guangzhou Daily (via <a href="https://www.gz.gov.cn/zwfw/zxfw/zffw/content/post_9354881.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Guangzhou government’s website</a>), the Guangzhou Housing Provident Fund Management Center has “launched digital yuan remittance services.”</p>
<p>In China, housing provident fund policy requires employers to pay into funds that allow company workers to pay for accommodation.</p>
<p>The funds provide financing for employees to buy, construct, renovate, or repair houses.</p>
<p>The innovation allows companies in the city to use the CBDC – rather than conventional bank transfers – to make fund payments.</p>
<p>The city government explained that local companies can use online portals to set up digital yuan payments.</p>
<p>It has also created service areas for digital yuan-paying firms in government buildings.</p>

<h2>China’s Big Bank CBDC Involvement Deepens</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The initiative has been co-launched by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).</p>
<p>The ICBC is one of the biggest state-run banks in the country and is a key digital yuan pilot player.</p>
<p>After an initial setup process, firms can choose to make direct debit-type payments to funds digital yuan wallets from their corporate wallets.</p>
<p>The city claimed that the process was faster and more convenient than using conventional bank transfers</p>
<p>CBDC payments are instantaneous, whereas traditional bank transfers can take “up to two or three days” to process, city officials explained.</p>
<p>A real estate agency owner surnamed Huang told the media outlet they had used the digital yuan to pay into a fund for 10 employees. Huang said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The whole process of depositing into funds with the digital [yuan] is speedy. It is a much faster way to send funds. They arrive in real-time.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>China’s Digital Yuan Progressing?</h2>

<p>Elsewhere, the Bank of Beijing, a commercial bank based in the Chinese capital, is also pursuing digital yuan business.</p>
<p>The bank has teamed up with local government organizations in the city’s Shijingshan District to issue digital yuan loans for the district’s SMEs.</p>
<p>The bank said these were China’s first “innovative incentive loans” for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Last month, the world’s biggest small commodities market – in China’s Yiwu – <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-links-digital-yuan-to-worlds-biggest-commodities-market.htm">officially linked to the digital yuan network</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Shenzhen’s Yantian District, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinese-newlyweds-to-scoop-digital-yuan-giveaways.htm">newly married couples are being awarded up to $715 worth of digital yuan tokens and vouchers</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/usdt-stablecoin-adoption-in-brazil-skyrockets-to-80-share-of-crypto-transactions.htm">Brazilian</a> senators have voted in favor of a bill that proposes taxing crypto tax profits earned on overseas crypto platforms at a fixed rate of 15%.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.camara.leg.br/propostas-legislativas/2383287" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parliamentary website</a> and a report from Brazil’s <a href="https://livecoins.com.br/senado-aprova-imposto-de-15-para-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Livecoins</a>, lawmakers “seriously amended” the bill to ensure no loopholes were included.</p>
<p>Should the bill become law, users of international crypto exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kucoin will need to declare their earnings.</p>
<p>The law is slated to come into force on January 1, 2024. It will require Brazilian crypto investors to declare these gains “separately from other income and capital gains.”</p>
<p>Some more active crypto traders will breathe a sigh of relief, however.</p>
<p>The amended bill replaces an initial proposal for a “sliding scale”-type structure.</p>
<p>Under this proposal, those earning less than $1,200 from crypto trading on overseas platforms would have been exempt from taxation.</p>
<p>But crypto traders earning over $10,140 per year would have faced tax bills of over 22%.</p>

<h2>Brazilian Crypto Traders Bracing for New Tax Bills</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Livecoins quoted Ana Paula Rabello, an accountant specializing in crypto, as saying the bill includes a clause that classifies crypto wallets as “overseas financial applications.”</p>
<p>This bill stipulates that the Special Secretariat of the Federal Revenue of Brazil – the country’s tax service – will be given regulatory powers.</p>
<p>The amended bill also includes a clause that requires all companies that have a presence in Brazil and handle crypto to “provide periodic reports on their activities and their customers.”</p>
<p>This will apply to all firms active in the nation, no matter where they are headquartered.</p>
<p>The firms will have to submit their reports to the Federal Revenue Service and another financial watchdog, the Financial Activities Control Council.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ismael Decol, the legal head of Declare Cripto, explained that the law also contains “no provisions” for traders who want to write off their losses.</p>
<p>However, Decol claimed that “the Federal Revenue Service, the Central Bank, and other regulatory bodies” still needed to “fill in the gaps and provide further clarification.”</p>
<p>He noted that failure to do so would prevent the legislation from “becoming clearer to users and investors.”</p>
<p>Unless lawmakers raise additional objections to the bill, it will be passed to the President’s office.</p>
<p>The President will then have 15 working days to decide whether to approve or veto the bill.</p>

<p>Mainland China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), wants to expand its CBDC’s cross-border applications.</p>
<p>And it seemingly wants even more overseas banks to join the pilot, as it focuses on international e-CNY expansion.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.kwongwah.com.my/20231130/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E5%BC%95%E5%85%A5%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%9A%E9%93%B6%E8%A1%8C-%E5%8F%82%E4%B8%8E%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E5%B8%81%E8%B7%A8%E5%A2%83%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kwongwah</a>, Christopher Hui, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, told attendees at a Shenzhen fintech conference that “more Hong Kong banks” would be invited “to participate.”</p>
<p>Hui also talked up the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-connects-digital-yuan-hong-kongs-fast-payment-system.htm">recent linking of the digital yuan network to Hong Kong’s fast payment system (FPS)</a>, saying the connection “adds value to digital CNY wallets.”</p>
<p>The government minister added that “the preliminary technical testing” phase for digital yuan adoption in the cross-border payments space was now “complete.”</p>
<p>He added that the PBoC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (the HKMA; Hong Kong’s central bank) were now in a “second phase of technical testing.”</p>
<p>Hui stated that the government would update the “relevant regulatory and compliance protocols” to “support innovative cross-border applications of the digital yuan.”</p>
<p>He reiterated claims that Hong Kong wants to “facilitate retail payments” using both the FPS and the digital yuan.</p>
<p>And he spoke of a “two-way interconnection” between the two innovations. But the minister refused to put a timeline on further developments.</p>
<h2>More Banks Keen to Join Digital Yuan Pilot?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hui’s comments came after the Hong Kong-based banking giants <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hsbc-hang-seng-join-chinas-digital-yuan-pilot.htm">HSBC and Hang Seng Bank joined China’s digital yuan pilot earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p>The duo joined a group of “four foreign banks” that “officially announced the launch of digital yuan business.”</p>
<p>Also joining the digital yuan pilot is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-to-participate-in-trials-of-chinas-digital-yuan-cbdc-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Standard Chartered</a>, a UK bank with a strong presence in Asia, as well as the mainland Chinese arm of Taiwan’s Fubon Bank.</p>

<h2>Hong Kong Deepening Digital Yuan Bond?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
China and Hong Kong have made <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jdcom-bank-of-china-join-mainland-china-hong-kong-digital-yuan-pilot.htm">several digital yuan-themed “cross-border” breakthroughs this year</a>.</p>
<p>Mainland Chinese tourists can, for instance, use their digital yuan wallets to top up accounts on their Octopus apps and smartcards.</p>
<p>Hong Kong residents and visitors can use the Octopus app to pay for public transport fees and make micropayments.</p>
<p>Hong Kong visitors to the mainland have also been encouraged to use the digital yuan to pay public transport fees in cities like Shenzhen.</p>

<p>The HKMA and the PBoC are currently working on mBridge pilot with the Thai and UAE central banks.</p>
<p>The initiative focuses on using international CBDCs to process cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Mu said that projects like these could help regulators eliminate “unregulated cross-border payments.”</p>

<p>Dunamu, the South Korean operator of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/s-korean-market-regulator-wants-label-upbit-bithumb-large-conglomerates.htm">Upbit crypto exchange</a>, has seen year-on-year profits fall by a staggering 82% in the third quarter of FY2023.</p>
<p>The South Korean media outlet <a href="https://www.businesspost.co.kr/BP?command=article_view&amp;num=334509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Post</a> reported that Dunamu published its financial report for the third quarter of 2023 on November 28. The report’s highlights included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dunamu posted just under $149.5 million in sales in Q3</li>
<li>The operator’s operating profits were $78.8 million</li>
<li>The firm’s (consolidated) net profits were $22.8 million</li>
<li>Compared to Q3 of FY2022, these numbers represent a 29% drop in sales, a 39.6% fall in operating profits, and a net profit decline of 81.6%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Has Caused Dunamu/Upbit’s Drop in Profits?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Dunamu claimed that its economic performance had declined due to a rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>It also blamed the economic recession and falling cryptoasset prices. A Dunamu spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We will strive to revitalize the blockchain ecosystem and create an advanced investment environment. We will do our utmost to provide innovative services based on Dunamu’s unique technological capabilities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The numbers make grim reading for a company that was – until recently – <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-banks-earned-usd-312m-crypto-transaction-fees-last-year.htm">being talked up as the first South Korean crypto firm to attain official “conglomerate-size” status</a>.</p>
<p>At the height of the last crypto bull market, South Korean financial experts claimed that Dunamu was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/upbit-operator-may-follow-coinbase-with-nasdaq-ipo-bid-analy-9686.htm">preparing to float on the New York Stock Exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Police in the South Korean city of Daegu say they have raided a “drug trafficking organization” that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/s-korean-crackdown-has-not-dampened-youths-thirst-for-bitcoin-powered-drug-dealing.htm">used crypto as a payment tool</a> – and arrested 48 people.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.chosun.com/national/incident/2023/11/29/F34KDJLCSJD57EQRNZZC4KPOSI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chosun Ilbo</a>, the Daegu Police Agency’s metropolitan investigation unit arrested 44 people connected to a suspected “overseas drug sales organization.”</p>
<p>The group of arrestees included both “drug dealers and buyers,” police spokespeople said.</p>
<p>The same police agency charged another four individuals – apparently unconnected to the “organization” – with similar crypto-powered drug trafficking offenses.</p>
<p>Officers said an unnamed individual, identified for legal reasons as “A” (age 31), worked as the organization’s “general manager.”</p>
<p>Police added that the organization was “international,” and had operatives working abroad.</p>
<p>Nine people, including A, were remanded in police custody. The remainder were released on bail pending a prosecution service investigation.</p>

<p>Police said that the group hired drug “mules,” who swallowed bags of narcotics or hid them in body cavities.</p>
<p>Officers said they were initially unaware of A’s existence, but began to close the net on the 31-year-old after investigating the organization’s lower-ranked operatives.</p>
<h2>Police Bust Thwarts International Operation?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A was based in an overseas location, but South Korean police managed to track the “general manager” down by cooperating with international police forces.</p>
<p>Police spokespeople confirmed detectives had seized “over $1.7 million worth of drugs” in their raids.</p>

<h2>Rise in South Korean Crypto-powered Drug Trafficking?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<em>Cryptonews.com</em> has seen hundreds of posts from what appears to be South Korean drug dealers on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>Many of these posts feature images of bags of narcotics and make promises of “nationwide delivery.”</p>
<p>The social media posts also typically include narcotics prices denominated in South Korean won.</p>
<p>The posts’ authors typically invite would-be customers to contact them via Telegram channels to organize payment and delivery.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/s-korean-president-calls-for-war-on-crypto-powered-drug-trafficking.htm">South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol called for an “all-out war” on crypto-powered drug dealing</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fourteen-ukrainian-officials-receive-advanced-crypto-crime-investigation-training.htm lawmakers">Ukrainian</a> lawmakers are set to debate two <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-taxes-statistics.htm">crypto tax</a> bills, as Kyiv looks to raise money from crypto traders.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://minfin.com.ua/crypto/articles/dva-varianta-nalogooblozheniya-kriptovalyut-chto-deputaty-gotovyat-rynku/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minfin</a> and <a href="https://psm7.com/ru/news/v-verxovnuyu-radu-podadut-eshhe-neskolko-zakonoproektov-o-virtualnyx-aktivax-pochemu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSM7</a>, Yuriy Boyko, a member of the National Commission on Securities and the Stock Market, confirmed that the regulator was the author of one of the bills.</p>
<p>Boyko said he assumed that “specialists from the Ministry of Finance and the State Tax Service worked on” the second bill.</p>
<p>This bill’s author is MP Anton Shvachko, and the text was drafted, at least in part, by the Ministry of Digital Transformation.</p>
<p>Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We expect parliament to support this draft law and help develop new digital industries. Business support will be the foundation of Ukraine’s economic growth.”</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_137229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137229" style="width: 805px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137229" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701184917-myf.png" alt="Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation, speaking at an event earlier this year." width="805" height="448" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701184917-myf.png 805w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701184917-myf-300x167.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701184917-myf-768x427.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137229" class="wp-caption-text">Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation, speaking at an event earlier this year. (Source: The Lisbon Council/YouTube)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the regulator, which is yet to reveal the full details of its own proposal, said that it had worked with EY (Ernst &amp; Young) and the USAID Financial Sector Reform Project on the draft.</p>
<p>The bills are now in the consultation stage. Boyko noted that “almost 200 comments” had been made on the commission’s draft law.</p>
<p>He added that 33 of these comments had been “taken into account” in a revised version of the bill.</p>
<p>Boyko claimed that the commission’s bill had been “verified for compliance with European law.”</p>
<p>He added that the bill was “consistent with the recommendations of the European Union.”</p>
<p>Boyko said that this had been done “as part of Ukraine’s application for EU membership.”</p>
<p>But Alexey Zhmerenetsky, a Ukrainian MP and the Chairman of the NGO Blockchain4Ukraine, said the two bills “differ greatly.”</p>
<h2>Ukrainian Lawmakers Faced with Two ‘Rival’ Crypto Tax Bills</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Zhmerenetsky said the bills included “different tax rates, as well as different scales of implementation of [the EU’s] MiCA regulations.”</p>
<p>MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/eus-mica-law-nears-final-vote-raising-high-hopes-for-crypto-regulation.htm">is a set of rules governing cryptoassets, exchanges, brokers, and stablecoin issuers</a>.</p>
<p>MiCA was<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-framework-signed-into-law-by-eu-officials.htm"> signed into EU law last year</a>, marking the first time a political bloc has streamlined crypto regulation.</p>

<p>Zhmerenetsky suggested that the bills would take time to consolidate. And he urged ministries to temper their regulatory zeal, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ukraine is not yet a member of the EU. And the regulations detailed in MiCA are more complex. In the current conditions, [&#8230;] Ukraine does not have a large crypto market [&#8230;]. As such, the implementation of strict regulations will make our country less competitive.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The MP suggested that politicians would need to “reach a compromise” between the two proposals.</p>
<p>Zhmerenetsky added that MPs would also need to “take into account the wishes of the FATF [Fiancial Action Task Force] and the European Commission.”</p>
<p>The MP stated that the process would not be complete before 2024 at the earliest, explaining:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In an optimistic timeline, a [consolidated bill] will be ready by the end of spring [2024]. And, after that, it will be possible to [pass the bill into law] in a month or six weeks.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Both HSBC and Hang Seng have been stepping up their CBDC adoption plans of late, in Hong Kong and abroad.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Visa announced the completion of a Hong Kong Monetary Authority-led CBDC pilot program, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/visa-successfully-concludes-cbdc-pilot-program-in-hong-kong-with-hsbc-and-hang-seng-bank.htm">with both banks participating</a>.</p>

<p>Police in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/100000-south-koreans-will-start-using-cbdc-next-year.htm">South Korea</a> have arrested a group of people they suspect of duping 170 “crypto investors” – by posing as cryptoasset-issuing robot developers.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25210173" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joongang Ilbo</a>, the Jeonnam Police Agency, officers made at least two arrests, with a 63-year-old and a 36-year-old charged with fraud-related offenses.</p>
<p>The alleged masterminds have been handed over to prosecutors, who are now investigating the case.</p>
<p>Officers think the group managed to raise almost $3 million from their victims, promising lucrative rewards.</p>
<p>Police said the group tried to convince victims that it developed robots and artificial intelligence software.</p>
<p>Police spokespeople said that the group began advertising a bogus coin in 2021, and sought to “recruit investors” through “false advertisements and robot exhibitions.”</p>
<p>The group also allegedly held “investment briefing sessions” at locations across the country.</p>
<p>Police explained the group claimed their firm had signed a contract to supply robots.</p>
<p>The group allegedly claimed it would send robots to more than 5,000 residential and care home facilities.</p>
<p>But detectives said that the robots one of the alleged masterminds claimed to have developed was actually made by “a large domestic robotics company.”</p>
<p>Police said that one of the alleged masterminds had purchased a robot from the aforementioned developer and made “cosmetic” changes to the device.</p>
<p>Officers claimed that the masterminds had “in particular” targetted “low-income individuals,” including “elderly citizens.”</p>
<p>The masterminds allegedly claimed that their coin would “soon be listed on South Korean and American exchanges.”</p>

The group reportedly told victims that they could expect to “at least double” their money when making coin purchases.</p>
<p>But officers said the group had “already used part of the investment stakes for personal purposes.”</p>
<p>Officers said they were “collecting and holding” money they had recovered from the group.</p>

<p>The bitcoiner Max Keiser has apparently retracted his bid to get <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/athena-bitcoin-to-integrate-lightning-network-for-bitcoin-atms-in-el-salvador.htm">El Salvador</a> President Nayib Bukele and Argentina’s President-elect <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/argentinian-presidential-hopeful-reportedly-faces-crypto-scam-promotion-wrap.htm">Javier Milei</a> to talk BTC.</p>
<p>Keiser last week <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1726380099480494353" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to X</a> (formerly Twitter) to publicly ask Bukele for permission for the El Salvador Bitcoin “team” to invite Milei to San Salvador.</p>
<p>When asked why Keiser would need to seek Bukele’s “permission” to invite Milei to his adoptive country, the American bitcoiner wrote that it was a matter of “protocol.”</p>
<p>The Salvadoran President has still not responded to the request at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Keiser is working as a “senior advisor” to the El Salvador leader on BTC-related matters.</p>
<p>Another bitcoiner noted that Bukele – once so vocal about his Bitcoin adoption plans – has recently changed his tack on social media.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nayibbukele</a>  has been kind of quiet about bitcoin lately</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, Bukele took the time on November 27 to repost a picture of a Bukele t-shirt- and cap-sporting supporter, along with Keiser’s wife and fellow bitcoiner Stacy Herbert.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Keiser later appeared ready to temper his expectations, writing of the need to ensure that El Salvador becomes “Bitcoin country.”</p>
<p>He suggested that “trying to get Argentina up to speed” could end up “diluting efforts” to keep his adoptive nation “shitcoin-free.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Makes more sense to focus on making <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ElSalvador?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ElSalvador</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BITCOIN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BITCOIN</a> COUNTRY (and shitcoin free) than diluting efforts by trying to get Argentina up to speed.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Just How Bitcoin-keen Are Bukele and Milei?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bukele is aiming to make history by running for re-election in next year’s presidential elections.</p>
<p>The BTC-keen President, whose government adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, successfully changed the constitution to allow him <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvadors-pro-bitcoin-president-registers-for-re-election-in-2024.htm">to run in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, Salvadoran law dictated that presidents could only serve one term in office.</p>
<p>But Bukele’s sky-high popularity has shown no sign of wavering following the legal change, although the leader has slowed down his government’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bukele-showcases-bitcoin-city-plans-buys-btc-dip-amid-stark-warning.htm">controversial BTC-buying policies</a>.</p>
<p>Keiser was apparently hopeful that Milei and Bukele would find common ground on the subject of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Milei has praised Bitcoin in the past and has spoken about plans to abolish his nation’s fiat peso.</p>
<p>Ona TV show in the run-up to his election, he destoryed a piñata representation of the Argentine Central Bank.</p>
<p><iframe title="Javier Milei revienta el Banco Central para su cumpleaños- 22/10/18" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/syjZ8sVdMCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>However, the two men may find themselves at loggerheads: While Bukele appears keen to de-dollarize his nation’s economy, Milei wants to do the opposite.</p>
<p>The Argentine President-elect says he plans to dollarize the country in the next few years, despite critics’ claims that the idea is implausible.</p>
<p>Some leading Argentine <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lawyer-says-argentina-should-bin-dollarization-plans-adopt-btc.htm">political figures have tried to convince Milei to turn his back on the USD, however, and embrace BTC instead</a>.</p>
<p>Milei <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pro-bitcoin-javier-milei-wins-argentina-presidential-elections.htm">swept to victory in the presidential election run-off vote last week</a>, scooping 55% of the vote, 3 million more than his opponent, the economy minister Sergio Massa.</p>

<p>A state-owned <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinese-bank-rolls-out-digital-yuan-supply-chain-financing-solution.htm">Chinese bank</a> will link the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-debuts-solar-power-industry-digital-yuan-smart-contracts.htm">digital yuan</a> to the “world’s biggest small commodities market” via the latter’s payment platform.</p>

<p>Not to be confused with the central People’s Bank of China, the Bank of China is a leading commercial bank.</p>
<p>It is majority-owned by the Chinese state and is thought to be the world’s fourth-largest financial institution.</p>
<p>Yiwu’s Futian District, in Zhejiang Province, is home to a 7km-long market.</p>
<p>Its thousands of vendors retail “small” commodities to importers the world over.</p>
<p>The Bank of China deal will see digital yuan interoperability options added to a payment platform named Yiwu Pay.</p>
<p>Yiwu launched Yiwu Pay, a “global payment platform,” earlier this year, claiming that it could provide service to “100 countries and regions.”</p>
<p>The platform can handle payments in 16 fiat currencies, allowing customers and vendors to make and receive international payments.</p>

<p>The development allows merchants to process digital yuan “cross-border payments.”</p>
<p>It will also integrate “cross-border capital circulation” compliance solutions for digital CNY customers.</p>
<p>The solution will also adhere to an array of foreign exchange compliance protocols.</p>
<p>The bank said that the solution had already been “successfully implemented” by some Yiwu-based merchants.</p>

<h2>Chinese Digital Yuan Making Cross-border Progress</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The breakthrough comes months after Yiwu <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/310000-private-digital-wallets-opened-chinas-nanjing-since-2022-cbdc-taking-off.htm">announced that 90% of its vendors accept digital yuan payments</a>.</p>
<p>The city claimed that its market was collectively aiming to process some $1.5 billion worth of CBDC transactions before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Yiwu is unofficially known as the “world’s capital of small commodities,” manufacturing and trading items such as clothing, toys, household goods, smartphone accessories, and jewelry.</p>
<p>Its vendors have established trade relations with more than 230 countries and regions around the world.</p>
<p>The physical Futian District marketplace remains popular among tourists.</p>
<p>But in recent years, the city has looked to expand its online presence, supplying many leading international e-commerce platform clients.</p>
<p>Chinese banks have been expanding their efforts <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-looks-make-asean-digital-yuan-move-cbdc-breakthrough-imminent.htm#:~:text=China%20is%20planning%20to%20showcase,are%20politically%20aligned%20with%20China.">to move the digital yuan into the cross-border payments space in recent months</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/osaka-digital-exchange-to-launch-trading-of-japans-first-digital-securities-on-december-25.htm">Japanese</a> National Tax Agency (NTA) has revealed it has recently investigated hundreds of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-japanese-businesses-ask-govt-reform-crypto-tax-system-1.htm">crypto tax</a> violations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nta.go.jp/information/release/kokuzeicho/2023/shotoku_shohi/pdf/shotoku_shohi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NTA released its annual report</a> on tax investigations ahead of the weekend, including a section on crypto taxation.</p>
<p>The data in the report, and also reported by Japan’s <a href="https://coinpost.jp/?p=493857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinPost</a>, shows that the agency launched 615 investigations into Japanese residents’ crypto holdings in the financial year 2022.</p>
<p>The NTA noted that it had found tax violations in 548 cases, marking a significant rise from the previous financial year.</p>
<p>In FY2021, the NTA launched 444 crypto-related investigations, uncovering 405 violations.</p>
<p>But there appears to have been a drop in the value of crypto-related tax violations, possibly reflecting a fall in global crypto prices.</p>
<p>NTA added that the average value of undeclared income in crypto-related cases was around $206,000 per case in FY2022, down from $245,000 in FY2021.</p>
<p>The cumulative value of the undeclared income for FY2022 was $126.5 million, up from over $110 million.</p>

<h2>Why Are Japan’s Crypto-related Tax Violations on the Rise?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On X, the Japanese crypto analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeanscpa/status/1727270239535353901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeanscpa</a> claimed that the rise in violations was partly due to an increase in NTA investigations in FY2022.</p>
<p>The analyst noted that the NTA “increased its number of investigations” into suspected crypto irregularities by “approximately 1.4 times compared to the previous year.”</p>
<p>Jeanscpa claimed that the discrepancy was “due to the coronavirus pandemic.”</p>
<p>The pandemic allegedly saw the NTA slow the rate of its probes, and focus on higher-income individuals.</p>
<p>The analyst claimed that “the number of tax audits” into crypto holders would “be similar” in 2023 “or even higher than [FY2022].”</p>
<p>The Japanese crypto community has repeatedly asked the government to reform the tax system.</p>
<p>Many critics, including politicians and business leaders, claim the current system is unfair.</p>
<p>Crypto is taxed as “other income” in Japan, while in other countries coin-related profits are taxed via capital gains levies.</p>
<p>In other nations, crypto holders’ profits are only taxable when they trade their coins for fiat.</p>
<p>Some<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/politician-challenges-japanese-gov-t-on-crypto-tax-rate-urge-6230.htm"> lawmakers have tried to convince Tokyo that taxes on crypto are currently “too high,”</a> but have thus far failed to sway the government.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/japanese-opposition-leader-urges-crypto-tax-reform-provide-nation-with-web3-boost.htm">Corporations and political leaders claim</a> the system discourages firms from holding coins by taxing unrealized income.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/japans-prime-minister-reportedly-open-idea-of-crypto-tax-reform.htm">Tokyo has effectively agreed to reform the law for firms</a>, but has thus far refused to consider changing the way it taxes individuals.</p>
