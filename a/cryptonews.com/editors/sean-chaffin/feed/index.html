										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instant messaging giant <b>Telegram</b> and the <b>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</b> (SEC) are meeting today, February 19, in front of a New York federal judge in a case that may impact the future of many cryptoassets. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e4/d2ecbd58e4.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e4/d2ecbd58e4.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5e4/d2ecbd58e4.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5e4/d2ecbd58e4.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5e4/d2ecbd58e4.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5e4/d2ecbd58e4.jpg 1256w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/cobalt</figcaption></figure><p>As reported, Telegram seeks that its digital token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/gram/">Gram</a>) sale should be allowed to move forward as the SEC wants to further block its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/telegram-s-blockchain-could-open-a-new-era-9-more-crypto-new-4758.htm">USD 1.7 billion project</a>. The SEC argues that Gram is a security and should be regulated like any other stock, bond, or similarly traded asset. Also, the Commission charges Telegram with violating investor protection laws.</p><p>However, attorneys <a href="https://www.law360.com/fintech/articles/1244307/telegram-sec-lock-horns-in-court-over-1-7b-token-offering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Law360 they do not expect any resolution at the hearing Wednesday, though Judge P. Kevin Castel may provide some indication as to which way he is leaning through the questions he poses, and he is likely to rule quickly on the preliminary injunction.</p><p>Therefore, the Telegram case could offer a glimpse into the future of how cryptoassets are regulated, at least in the U.S. A tightening of regulatory control over tokens could make for major changes in the industry.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Given the size of the offering and the different players here&#8230; I think this will be a seminal case going forward,&#8221; Rebecca Rettig, a partner and litigator focused on fintech at <b>FisherBroyles LLP</b>, told Law360.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, William Brannan, counsel at <b>Lowenstein Sandler LLP</b>, added that the need for clarity is particularly important for early stage companies. According to him, &#8220;the chilling effect&#8221; as a result of regulatory uncertainty in the digital asset and blockchain space &#8220;is something that we&#8217;ve certainly seen and experienced.&#8221;</p><p>&ldquo;Issuers, brokers, exchange platforms, payments service providers, investors and others will all need to consider the extent to which a given token falls within the perimeter of regulators in the relevant jurisdictions, as this may have a substantial impact upon their obligations and/or rights within the market,&rdquo; Peter Stewart, an associate at law firm <b>Cooke Young and Keidan</b>, recently <a href="http://www.globallegalpost.com/big-stories/high-stakes-telegram-cryptocurrency-case-nears-final-determination-19008671/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in Global Legal Post.</p><p>Meanwhile, yesterday, in a response by the New York Southern District Court, the <b>U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission</b> (CFTC) <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/okmUUBS/cftc-letter-in-telegram-case.pdf#page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that &#8220;we express no view on&#8221; whether Gram is a security or commodity.</p><p>&#8220;While digital currency is a commodity, that does not resolve the question of whether the [Securities Act of 1933] applies to Gram. That depends on the securities laws,&#8221; the CFTC said. The SEC argues that the token sale violates registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.</p><p>&ldquo;Telegram takes the position that the rights to future Grams sold under the GPAs [Gram Purchase Agreements] are distinct from the Grams themselves in that the former were sold pursuant to investment contracts and are therefore securities, whilst the latter are not because, once issued, Grams will operate as a simple medium of exchange like a currency,&rdquo; according to Stewart.</p><p>It has been reported that under the terms of the investment, Telegram was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/telegram-s-gram-might-be-available-to-the-public-within-two-4533.htm">contractually obliged</a> to provide around 2.9 billion of its tokens to its investors in October 2019, or face the possibility of returning the entire USD 1.7 billion to its 100+ investors. However, investors agreed to wait. About USD 425 million of that capital raise reportedly came from 171 Americans. <br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto makes some aspects of sports wagering so easier.
It is likely a traditional betting European company will be the most successful crypto sports betting option.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b8/81095dd5c8.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b8/81095dd5c8.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5b8/81095dd5c8.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5b8/81095dd5c8.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5b8/81095dd5c8.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5b8/81095dd5c8.jpg 1143w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/marlenka</figcaption></figure><p>After a May Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for expanded sports betting in the U.S., more states are moving toward legalization. Where do cryptocurrencies stand in all this? Bitcoin and others have gained some acceptance in some jurisdictions as well the murky world of offshore wagering.</p><p>While there seems to be growing acceptance among gamblers and some operators, what&rsquo;s the future and what do gamblers have to gain from wagering crypto? As soccer season kicks off in Europe and football season approaches in the U.S., more bettors may be laying the favorite using crypto.</p><p><b>Blockchain advantages</b></p><p>Despite volatility among Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies, many remain bullish on the digital currency and that includes some who want to drop a few coins at the virtual betting window. India&rsquo;s government is considering legalizing sports wagering and appears on board for crypto transactions.</p><p>In July, the government released a legal framework of how sports betting would operate. The proposal noted: &ldquo;Gambling transactions should be made cashless, making use of electronic means of payment such as credit cards, debit cards, net-banking, Virtual Currencies (VC &ndash; also known as Cryptocurrency), etc.&rdquo;</p><p>But with the anonymity of digital currencies, the idea of &ldquo;legalized&rdquo; sports wagering become gray as far as bettors are concerned. Numerous online sports books already accept crypto such as Sportsbetting.ag, which accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.</p><p>In the Internet wild west, plenty of sites offer action to players of virtually any country. Eric Thies is a crypto market analyst with <b>UTR Equities</b>, a financial education service, and he believes sports books will have no option but to accept cryptocurrencies even in legalized and regulated jurisdictions.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>
</p><p>&ldquo;Cryptocurrencies have been a great option both for bettors and casino groups in the space, even prior to legalization,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This will add even more interest from a wider range of people with how easy cryptos make it to to play sports action.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Crypto makes some aspects of sports wagering so easier, Thies argues, including depositing into an account and getting payouts quicker.</p><p>Paulius Mikaliunas, head of operations at <b>CoinPoker</b>, a blokchain based online poker platform, agrees that cryptocurrencies give gamblers global accessibility and instant payouts, which are invaluable to sports betting operators and fans in particular.</p><p>&#8220;Our team embraced the benefits of crypto to address limited transparency and bureaucracy in traditional online poker, but the opportunities of crypto wagers are applicable to all gambling services and sectors,&#8221; Mikaliunas said.</p><p>According to him, one example beyond the obvious benefits of crypto transactions is applying cryptographic functions to develop a decentralized RNG (Random Number Generator).</p><p>&#8220;Our team is currently in the final stages of implementing this on CoinPoker, and it will allow players to view their impact on deck order without any risk to us as room operator. This tech could be adapted for any gaming service that employs an RNG, and is just one of many ways this versatile tech can revolutionize the gaming industry,&#8221; Mikaliunas explained.</p><p><b>A new economy</b></p><p>Ben Godfre is a general partner with <b>SportVEST</b>, an asset-backed digital token built on blockchain technology and linked to the performance of the company&rsquo;s venture fund portfolio. He&rsquo;s interested in seeing how the market plays out, but sees crypto in its future.</p><p>&ldquo;These new laws will create a whole new economy while putting daily fantasy sports companies under a lot of pressure,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We have already seen the acquisition of <b>Fanduel</b> by <b>Betfair</b> and are likely to see many more merger and acquisition deals over the coming year.&rdquo;</p><p>He sees numerous positives in crypto betting &ndash; and one stands out for operators. Blockchain allows for a transparent ledger of betting transactions and increases providers&rsquo; security from hackers. </p><p>While it&rsquo;s still early, Godfre sees companies accommodating to crypto, and Europe as the hope to expand the market.</p><p>&ldquo;Blockchain technology and crypto have a part to play over the medium term in sports betting, but to date no company has successfully managed to integrate the two,&rdquo; he says. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;While there are startup companies currently developing this, it is likely a traditional betting European company will be the most successful crypto sports betting option purely because they already have a huge user base, existing tech framework, and unlimited budget for both development and marketing. The future of sports betting is definitely a tokenized blockchain model.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><b>Challenges ahead</b></p><p>Achieving a more accepted crypto betting model won&rsquo;t be easy. Marc Edelman is a professor of law at the <b>Zicklin School of Business</b> at the <b>City University of New York</b>, and gaming/fantasy sports law is one of his specialties. Edelman notes that American companies have great risks involved when it comes to the anonymity factors associated with cryptocurrencies.</p><p>&ldquo;There might some companies out there that choose to accept Bitcoin because they believe there&rsquo;s a value in doing so from a business perspective,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;However, any company that&rsquo;s seeking to offer online gaming using Bitcoin would be troublingly confused if they believe there were any legal advantages. Irrespective of whether a company were to use Bitcoin for online gaming or traditional currency, these activities would be seen as wagering and the exact same set of federal and state laws would apply.&rdquo;</p><p>Foreign sites catering to American players using crypto or some other form of deposit also face possible legal entanglements.</p><p>&ldquo;Each company that does business in the United States is subject to long-arm jurisdiction of the states in which they operate and the U.S. overall,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Fundamentally, it makes no difference if a company is based in New Jersey, Texas, or Panama. To the extent that are doing business and targeting customers within the United States, they&rsquo;re subject to the law in every state in which they have customers as well as the laws of the U.S.&rdquo;</p><p>While offshore companies  accept American customers, Edelman says those companies face legal liabilities and owners could ultimately be extradited if prosecuted. The means of currency is irrelevant.</p><p>Godfre and Thies both agree there are significant challenges for casinos, but that crypto is too easy of payment method and companies and government regulators will adjust.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;Casinos will want to be at the forefront and take advantage of an additional huge revenue stream,&rdquo; Godfre says. &ldquo;We will see casinos eventually offering some kind of crypto sports betting, which will be either through a proprietary software or through a strategic partnership with a large betting company.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>FanDuel has already put a toe in the water. During the NFL playoffs in January, it hosted the Bitcoin Bowl Free Play, a winner-take-all freeroll that paid one BTC to the winner. It also hosted a USD 3 event paying out a total of three BTC to the top four places. Considering the price was still above USD 10,000 by Jan. 31, the winners took home a nice payday.<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was an interesting time in the world of poker last week. Most may be think of the crowning of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event champion in Las Vegas. But a small tournament at <b>Harrah&rsquo;s Resort and Casino</b> in Atlantic City may strike a bigger chord for those in the crypto world.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b5/9cc5dceb53.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b5/9cc5dceb53.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5b5/9cc5dceb53.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5b5/9cc5dceb53.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5b5/9cc5dceb53.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5b5/9cc5dceb53.jpg 1254w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/ivanmateev</figcaption></figure><p>The first-ever all-crypto, live poker tournament was held as part of the Blockchain World Conference (BWC). While the turnout may have been tiny compared to the WSOP, many are hoping the crypto-tournaments continue and are proof that similar events could safely transfer funds &ndash; and are more than just a gamble.</p><p><b>50 players and 4 coins</b></p><p>The BWC tournament was much the same as traditional poker tournaments. Fifty players gathered around tables and battling it out with bets and bluffs, hoping to be the last person standing.</p><p>However, players brought in using ticket-buying technology from <b>Blockparty</b>, a blockchain startup. The USD 250 buy-in (an up-front payment required to enter a poker tournament) could be made using bitcoin, ether, litecoin, or BOXX, the Blockparty token, via Jaxx wallet after registering on the Blockparty app. The company&rsquo;s bigger aim is to solve issues such as ticket fraud, large reseller prices, and friction at event check-in. Company officials used the tournament to showcase the app&rsquo;s capabilities.</p><p>&ldquo;The tournament was a success,&rdquo; said Vladislav Ginzburg, Blockparty vice president and head of business development. &ldquo;There was good buzz around the conference leading up to the tournament among those who were already poker players, but also those who wanted to be a part of another element in mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.&rdquo;</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b5/9ca83e819a.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b5/9ca83e819a.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5b5/9ca83e819a.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5b5/9ca83e819a.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5b5/9ca83e819a.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5b5/9ca83e819a.jpg 4032w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>The BWC tournament. Source: Blockparty</figcaption></figure><p>As a new event, Ginzburg said there weren&rsquo;t any major challenges beyond issues that come with any &#8220;first-ever&#8221; event.</p><p>&ldquo;At a basic level, a sanctioned poker tournament is just another live event, but still using a relatively old-fashioned registration procedure,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;By using our platform, the entire process (registration, buy-in, check-in at arrival) is streamlined and efficient.&rdquo;</p><p><b>From bucks to block</b></p><p>So what is the future of crypto when it comes to poker and gambling? At the WSOP, which featured more than 70 tournaments this summer, players can use any number of methods to buy into an event, including cash or wire transfer.</p><p>While some properties may take the crypto-plunge, WSOP officials believe there are still too many hurdles in regards to regulation and financial reporting that make it difficult to feature crypto buy-in events.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, not us, not happening,&rdquo; says Seth Palansky, <b>Caesars&#8217;</b>, a gaming company, vice president of corporate communications and WSOP spokesman.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;We have Know Your Customer and FinCEN [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network] financial protocols, and AML [anti-money laundering] rules to follow. Not knowing the source of funds is going to make this not something we can ever touch and remain in compliance.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Officials at Blockparty believe they have built-in security features that minimize these risks and may be of more value to casinos in the long run.</p><p>&ldquo;A core feature of Blockparty&#8217;s platform is ID verification, and a core feature of blockchain is the immutability of the ledger for accurate auditing. Combining these core tenets allows the property to know who their players are, and tie them to their buy-ins. Traditionally, this process would be done in cash, which carries a much higher risk for money laundering or identity fraud,&rdquo; Ginzburg says. </p><p><b>Growing the game</b></p><p>Obviously the future of this type of technology and poker is still a bit murky. In a game that attracts all ages, will crypto be prevalent enough for properties to take a chance on tournaments like this? Do regulatory concerns make if too risky?</p><p>On the contrary, crypto may offer opportunities &ndash; a way to expand the number of players looking to ante up and opening up tournaments to players who may not have been casino gamblers otherwise.  </p><p>Crypto entrepreneur and poker player Alan Percal knows quite a bit about both worlds. He has USD 660,000 in live tournament poker winnings and won a WSOP event in 2016. As early adopters of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology, he sees poker tournaments and this technology as a natural fit.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great for the game since tons of poker players got into crypto fairly early and are likely still holding a decent amount,&rdquo; says Percal.</p></blockquote><p>Percal believes the two worlds will merge even more in the coming years. In the meantime, Percal sees continued acceptance in the marketplace in general including slow expansion of poker tournaments utilizing crypto.</p><p>&ldquo;Anywhere I see crypto adoption I generally view as a good thing since it brings more awareness to the community,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;As far as the future, I&rsquo;m not sure this will be much different from buying into a tournament with U.S. dollars not too long from now, assuming things head in the direction I think they will.&rdquo;</p>
