That concept would involve a shared infrastructure that would avoid the emergence of &ldquo;settlement blocks,&rdquo; which is the &ldquo;last thing we want&rdquo; to avoid further economic fragmentation, Georgieva said at a conference in Morocco.&nbsp;</p><p>Georgieva has been managing director of the IMF since 2019 and was previously the CEO of the World Bank.&nbsp;</p><h2>CBDCs around the world</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So far 11 countries have launched a central bank digital currency and all G7 economies have moved into the development stage of a CBDC, according to the <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"><u>Atlantic Council</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now 114 countries, representing over 95 percent of global gross domestic product, are exploring a CBDC, when in May 2020, only 35 countries were considering it, the council said.&nbsp;</p><p>Advocates for a CBDC say they can provide better financial services to their citizens, while critics warn that CBDCs could violate privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>The US is looking into the creation of a CBDC, but a US Treasury official said last week that the agency is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-treasury-looking-into-privacy-studying-potential-of-cbdc-official-says.htm"><u>looking</u></a> into privacy behind a CBDC.</p><p>A retail CBDC has pros and cons, said Graham Steele, assistant secretary for financial institutions at US Treasury, on Tuesday at the Transform Payments US 2023 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1530">Conference</a> in Texas.&nbsp;</p><p>One challenge of a retail CBDC could be privacy, Steele said.&nbsp;</p><p>Some lawmakers have staunchly opposed a CBDC due to privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and now Republican presidential candidate, signed a bill last month, banning CBDCs, and said Florida was the first state to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The movement to establish a central bank digital currency is an attempt to surveil &amp; control the finances of Americans. It would violate privacy, limit consumer choice &amp; undermine market competitiveness,&rdquo; DeSantis tweeted in March.&nbsp;</p><p>Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has also suggested banning the US Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC, and introduced a bill in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-senator-suggests-banning-fed-from-issuing-direct-consumer-cbdc.htm"><u>March 2022</u></a> that would ban the Fed from developing a direct-to-consumer CBDC.&nbsp;</p>
