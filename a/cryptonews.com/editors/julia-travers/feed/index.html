										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paying the right farmers fairly is a problem.
Companies are already using distributed ledger technology to solve this issue.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b3/f6a8d76209.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b3/f6a8d76209.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5b3/f6a8d76209.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5b3/f6a8d76209.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5b3/f6a8d76209.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5b3/f6a8d76209.jpg 3194w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/warrengoldswain</figcaption></figure><p>While coffee travels the world, beans from different farms are often mixed together. Therefore, knowing where coffee originated and paying the right farmers fairly is a problem. Especially, when coffee growers typically receive between 1 and 3 percent of the price of a cup sold in Europe or North America, while the global coffee industry is estimated to be worth over USD 100 billion. </p><p>But, a promising solution is already here. Enter blockchain: companies are using distributed ledger technology to track coffee and reward farmers more appropriately. Also, by proving their beans come from environmentally sustainable farms and/or those with fair trade practices, they can charge consumers more for peace of mind. </p><p><b>CoffeeCoin</b> Founder James Allen says, &ldquo;Using blockchain technology to create a more direct-source supply chain creates a higher perceived value for the end consumer &mdash; the coffee drinker.&rdquo;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few projects that already have working solutions.</p><p><b>Onda Origins and Yave</b></p><p><b>Onda Origins</b> coffee company out of Seattle works with blockchain-based coffee trading platform <b>Yave</b>. Brothers Scott and Paul Tupper launched Onda Origins and Scott founded Yave. Yave uses blockchain tech to record each step and process coffee beans go through, along with taste test scores. </p><p>When it comes to using blockchain to manage coffee origins, Tupper says the biggest challenge and opportunity is people; &ldquo;navigating a human ecosystem.&rdquo; He explains:</p><blockquote class="left"><p>Coffee is a long value chain that starts with production by over 25 million smallholder farmers &mdash; and a big handful of larger ones &mdash; around the tropics, representing countless ethnic groups, levels of market access, geopolitical realities and societal structures.</p></blockquote><p>He says Yave approaches this challenge by investing in and relying on strong partnerships &ldquo;with organizations who truly understand the coffee production milieu in specific geographies.&rdquo;</p><p>One of Yave&rsquo;s earliest blockchain initiatives was in Guatemala. Scott Tupper says it resulted in a more than 40% increase in revenue for the coffee producer and her co-op. </p><p><b>FairChain, Moyee and bext360 </b></p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;The coffee industry is notorious for its lack of transparency and value is distributed very unfairly,&rdquo; Guido van Staveren van Dijk says. </p></blockquote><p>He founded the <b>FairChain Foundation</b> and <b>Moyee Coffee</b> with the goal of making supply chains more equitable. Van Dijk wants to disrupt international &ldquo;Big Coffee&rdquo; and keep up to 50% of coffee&rsquo;s value in countries of origin. It aims to do this by keeping more of the coffee refining process &mdash; the burning and packaging &mdash; where it is grown and by using blockchain for secure record-keeping. Moyee states its methods can leave about 300% more money in the countries where coffee is produced.</p><p>In late 2017, Moyee Coffee and FairChain partnered with farmers in Ethiopia and <b>bext360</b>, a startup that created a coffee-analysis machine and blockchain platform. It brings its &ldquo;bextmachine&rdquo; directly to farmers, where it uses AI and machine learning to analyze the weight and quality of coffee cherries and beans. This information is then saved with blockchain tech from international payments platform Stellar. Farmers can be paid at these stations, instead of waiting days or even months to be compensated.</p><p>As the coffee makes its way to consumers, all related information on origin, quality and payment are stored on bext360&rsquo;s distributed ledger. </p><p>Bext360 CEO Daniel Jones says the program with Moyee Coffee provided proof of living-wage payments to the farmers, who &ldquo;saw a 20 percent increase in revenue.&rdquo; He adds that they plan to deploy seven more bextmachines in Ethiopia this year.</p><p>Van Dijk says it is &ldquo;too soon to say,&rdquo; whether the pilot projects are financially successful for everyone involved. He points out that being one of the first to undertake this type of endeavor has &ldquo;some PR advantages, but this is not our goal.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Other Coffee Blockchain Projects</b></p><p>CoffeeCoin, or COF, is a digital token built on the <b>Waves</b> blockchain platform. It is a cryptocurrency for person-to-person global coffee payments. It takes less than 20 seconds for COF to transmit and the transaction fee for the sender is 1 COF, or currently about USD 0.03 USD. COF also serves as a utility token on the blockchain to send and save coffee trade data. </p><p>With CoffeeCoin, a coffee roaster in the U.S. can instantly send payment to a coffee producer in Indonesia, CoffeeCoin Founder James Allen says. The Indonesian producer can then exchange the tokens for fiat on a local exchange. &ldquo;We have already done this with coffee from farmers in Indonesia and Thailand,&rdquo; he says.</p><p><b>IOHK</b>, the company behind the <b>Cardano</b> blockchain, is partnering with the government of Ethiopia to explore how blockchain can be applied within the country. IOHK will train Ethiopian software developers in Haskell, the programming language of Cardano, with a focus on educating women. </p><blockquote class="left"><p>
</p><p>&ldquo;In Ethiopia, we have been working on the possibility of adopting blockchain for marketing of agricultural products, especially for coffee,&rdquo; the Minister Getahun Mekuria Kuma said while signing a memorandum of understanding with IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson.</p></blockquote><p>Also, on February 2018, <b>Starbucks</b> Executive Chairman Howard Schultz <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/morning-news-two-giants-reveal-crypto-plans-coincheck-woes-d-1295.htm">suggested</a> that the American coffee company and coffeehouse chain might launch a blockchain app in the future. The company also announced in March 2018 it was piloting a &ldquo;bean to cup&rdquo; traceability program, which may utilize distributed ledger technology. Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Goldberg, Founder and CEO of Simple Token, a network for consumer apps tokenization, believes every company, from &ldquo;a global brand to an emerging app maker,&rdquo; should be able to easily issue branded tokens and &ldquo;transform its business into a dynamic economic ecosystem,&rdquo; he said in an interview with <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5aa/629227bb21.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5aa/629227bb21.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5aa/629227bb21.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5aa/629227bb21.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5aa/629227bb21.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5aa/629227bb21.jpeg 1190w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Goldberg is a veteran internet entrepreneur and world traveler with an extensive background in finance, tech innovation and politics. He&rsquo;s been devoted to empowering mainstream consumer adoption of blockchain technologies since 2016, which is Simple Token&rsquo;s main focus. Simple Token completed a successful ICO in December 2017, raising USD 21 million &mdash; 189 % of their target.</p><p><b>Who is Goldberg and What Is His Vision? </b></p><p>Goldberg founded Simple Token in 2016 with Director Nishith Shah. Goldberg is also the CEO of Pepo, an app that connects users with local experts. He previously founded the social news network Social Median and the design-oriented online shopping sites Fab and Hem, where Shah worked as well. He also launched the employment site Jobster. He has led product and strategy teams for telco T-Mobile and online service provider AOL. </p><p>Goldberg has an MBA from Stanford University. &ldquo;But before my career in business, my first startup was actually Bill Clinton&#8217;s campaign for President of the U.SA in 1992, which carried me to a 6-year stint in the White House,&rdquo; he said. During his time in the White House, he worked both in the Cabinet Affairs office and as the special assistant to Clinton&rsquo;s chief of staff. He currently splits his time between Germany, India and Hong Kong.</p><p>Goldberg researched consumer app tokenization for several years before Simple Token was conceived.</p><p>When he was building Pepo, he and his team investigated rewarding users with digital currency. He said they realized they would have to build &ldquo;a ton of new technology, scalability solutions and user experiences to tokenize just one app, Pepo. That led to a big &lsquo;aha&rsquo; moment; rather than building for only Pepo, we decided to build the Simple Token protocol and software suite for any company to utilize.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We think there is a technological elegance to blockchain technology and it has the potential to benefit all facets of society, commerce and business, but there is a gap between the reality of blockchain technology today and the ability of mainstream businesses to utilize it effectively and seamlessly,&rdquo; Goldberg explained. Simple Token aims to bridge that gap and provide an on-ramp for companies to create their own economic ecosystems with blockchain.</p><p><b>What Is Simple Token?</b></p><p>&ldquo;Put simply, Simple Token helps companies make use of blockchain and crypto-currencies without having to on board crypto experts and programmers &hellip; [it] gives consumer-facing companies the tools to design, launch and manage their own branded tokens &hellip; ,&rdquo; Goldberg said.</p><p>&ldquo;We can give companies the power of cryptocurrency without the complexity because we have developed a two-tier structure,&rdquo; he continued. Firstly, the Simple Token team created their cryptocurrency called Simple Token (OST): a freely tradable ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainnet. Secondly, companies can buy OST and are then empowered to mint their own branded tokens, which are ERC20 tokens recorded on open and scalable side-chains. </p><p>Each company can choose a name and various uses for their tokens &ndash; these may include accepting payment; giving customers loyalty incentives or contributors incentives for contributing content, data or computing power; and/or as the currency for a marketplace wherein customers trade with each other. Users can also exchange their tokens for any other company&rsquo;s tokens on the Simple Token platform or easily cash them out into fiat currencies like dollars or euros. </p><p>Simple Token has welcomed 21 companies into its tokenization network, including Lookhave, a social fashion network smartphone app, and Tomorrow, a sustainable checking account for smartphones. A project currently still in development is Medical Trials, an Oxford University health care spinoff, which is tokenizing a pharmaceutical app that will match Phase 3 clinical trials with patients from a decentralized data pool, &ldquo;in a manner that adheres to the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) standard.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Upcoming Developments</b></p><p>Simple Token is partnered with the Hong Kong-based nonprofit The OpenST Foundation, which focuses on supporting initiatives that further mainstream blockchain adoption. Goldberg said Simple Token plans to publish the core code that drives the creation of branded tokens as an open-source protocol called OpenST, governed by the foundation. This will allow developers &ldquo;to build powerful experiences with branded tokens that can interoperate with any other system built on OpenST,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>He explained that Simple Token and the Foundation can provide &ldquo;developers and companies OST token grants to help fund their OST-powered projects.&rdquo; Goldberg said that on top of the OpenST platform, his company will offer its &ldquo;sophisticated suite of software-branded tokens setup, management, fraud-detection and analytic tools.&rdquo; Goldberg is an OpenST board member.</p><p>Simple Token will soon announce new member companies and programs for developers. Goldberg said it is also ramping up in 2018 and will be hiring for more than 20 positions in its Berlin, Germany and Pune, India offices, as well as remotely. The company makes every team member an owner and stakeholder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Justin Tabb is passionate about the internet. &ldquo;When done right, it can provide an equal playing field for everyone on the planet, regardless of where you live,&rdquo; he told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. Tabb is the CEO and Co-Founder of Substratum Network (&rdquo;Substratum&rdquo;), an open-source network comprised of a worldwide collection of nodes that use cryptography to deliver secure content anywhere. </p><figure style="max-width: 431px"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a9/4fc008c55a.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 431px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a9/4fc008c55a.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a9/4fc008c55a.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a9/4fc008c55a.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a9/4fc008c55a.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5a9/4fc008c55a.jpg 431w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Substratum</figcaption></figure><p>Substratum was founded in 2017, which is also when Tabb released the related white paper. It ran an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) from August to September of that year and sold about USD 13.8 million worth of the SUB token. Tabb&rsquo;s goal is to see Substratum achieve mass adoption as the vehicle of a decentralized, censorship-free web. </p><p><b>How Did Tabb End up Here? </b></p><p>Tabb has been a software developer for almost 15 years. He started out in healthcare software development and then opened the software company OverridePro, which has delivered software solutions for Apple, Facebook, HP and OpenStack, among other companies. </p><p>One past OverridePro project that he &ldquo;had a lot of fun working on was a theme park attraction interface for Disney, inside Disney&rsquo;s EPCOT.&rdquo; Tabb has now moved from being a managing partner to just a partner with OverridePro, so he can focus all of his time and energy on Substratum.</p><p>Tabb was an early adopter of and investor in cryptocurrencies. He said &ldquo;the original Bitcoin white paper peaked [his] interest many years ago,&rdquo; and that he appreciates the innovation blockchain is bringing to the world. While he recognizes that &ldquo;bad players&rdquo; in the ICO realm can hurt the industry&rsquo;s growth, he said, &ldquo;Good companies like Substratum and many other players in the space who offer good user experience and quality products that will function at scale will provide the solutions to any and all challenges and further growth in the space.&rdquo; </p><p><b>Tabb&rsquo;s Vision for Substratum</b></p><p>Tabb wants to demystify blockchain and make it accessible to those who don&rsquo;t see themselves as technically inclined. He thinks free and open internet should be available to all and references censorship practices in China and the recent reversal of net neutrality rules in the U.S. as issues that Substratum seeks to address and solve. </p><p>Tabb also expressed that he has learned to develop a thick skin in response to naysayers during his journey with Substratum and to focus on the tens of thousands of supporters the company has instead. </p><p>He has come to recognize the prime importance of friends and family in life. </p><p>&ldquo;Making the internet a place where all family and friends can communicate and share, even across country borders, is something that is very important to me and that I will feel very good about when Substratum succeeds,&rdquo; Tabb said.</p><p>***</p><p><b>What Does Substratum Do?</b><br>
<i>Substratum empowers any individual &ldquo;to allocate spare computing resources to make the internet a free and fair place for the entire world,&rdquo; according to  the company site. This happens through the interactions of three basic roles or players within the network: hosts, nodes (network members) and web users. <br>
Hosts are entities or businesses that use the network to host their apps, databases and sites. In order to do this, they must pay the network members who run nodes in SUB coins. <br>
Network members run Substratum&rsquo;s broadcast software and receive SUB when they serve requests form hosts. End web users are any viewers of the Substratum-hosted content. Content is viewed with seamless integration through traditional web browsers &ndash; as Tabb said in a February 2018 update video on Twitter, &ldquo;The vast majority of the system, you will never see. It&rsquo;s under the hood.&rdquo;<br>
Substratum&rsquo;s own description explains that the network uses AI to geolocate &ldquo;the right Substratum Network machine to serve up the content, ensuring the fastest load time.&rdquo; The company explains that the network interface is user-friendly and that an API (application programming interface) and SDK (software development kit) are provided to help users create tools and apps on the platform. Substratum employs &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; cryptography to ensure network data are secure. Its goal is to provide &ldquo;free, unrestricted and uncensored access to content for a new web 3.0,&rdquo; without the use of VPNs (virtual private networks) or Tor (internet-privacy software). In 2018, Substratum plans to also offer Cryptopay. This will allow the sites on the network to process transactions in any publicly-traded digital coin. Substratum Bridge is another upcoming function for 2018, which will use SUB as a bridge coin for all transactions on the network.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As news spreads about a looming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/predictor-of-bitcoin-s-death-calls-for-wider-crypto-crackdow-1032.htm">suppression of cryptocurrency mining</a> operations in China, Canada&rsquo;s largest energy utility, Hydro Quebec, has begun to receive numerous inquiries about new mining operations. </p><p>China is currently a world leader in cryptocurrency mining because it offers relatively low energy prices, which Canada does as well. According to numerous media reports, Hydro Quebec welcomes the surge of interest but has been unsure of its ability to supply ample energy for the growing sector.  The current number of potential new mining projects is over 100 and dozens of new requests come in weekly. </p><p>&ldquo;Right now, we are analyzing the requests. It&rsquo;s too soon to confirm anything. It&rsquo;s important to note that we don&rsquo;t know if all these projects are serious enough to materialize,&rdquo; Spokesperson at Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Jonathan C&ocirc;t&eacute; told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. &ldquo;Since we have available energy, it is an interesting source of growth. One of the challenges is dealing with a large number of requests that we are receiving and to evaluate them,&rdquo; he added. </p><p>The mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies involves solving complex puzzles using enormous computing power and energy in order to validate transactions and be awarded in a digital currency. According to Hydro Quebec, it has an energy surplus of 100 terawatt hours (TWh) available over the next 10 years (one TWh is equal to 1 million megawatt hours or MWh and can power about 60,000 homes annually). <br>
Bitmain, GMO Internet and BTC.Top are among the major mining farms reportedly eyeing opportunities in Canada. BTC.Top did not respond to our request for comment and Bitmain declined to comment &ndash; both of these companies are based in China. </p><p>GMO Internet of Japan, which is now developing cloud mining services and a mining chip, said the details of its expanding operations, &ldquo;such as the exact date of launch, the price, investment opportunities, ICO token sale, specification, [distributor, etc.] are yet to be decided.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Diversity and Innovation</b></p><p>Pierre-Luc Quimper, the founder of established Canadian mining company Backbone Hosting Solutions, known as Bitfarms, describes Hydro Quebec&rsquo;s energy pricing as &ldquo;competitive,&rdquo; and also points out that Hydro Quebec relies on eco-friendly hydroelectricity to serve the eastern province. </p><p>While Quimper recognizes that competition can bring challenges, he told <i>Cryptonews.com</i> his company embraces local growth in the crypto-mining industry, saying, &ldquo;We believe a diversity of players in that emerging market will bring innovations and will convince decision makers that the blockchain technology is the future.&rdquo; </p><p>Canada&rsquo;s Bitfarms currently has 87 employees and four mines: Saint-Hyacinthe, Farnham, Notre-Dame-de-Stanbridge and Cowansville. Quimper said it is expanding and has a goal to go from using 27.5 MW (1 million watts) to 187 MW by December 2018. It plans to &ldquo;hire Quebecers and train them to have new skills: electrician, technician, engineer, developer, [etc.],&rdquo; Quimper conveyed. He also said the company is carrying our research and development into &ldquo;innovative ways to use the heat coming out of our miners.&rdquo; Bitfarms&rsquo; revenue in the last six weeks of 2017 was USD 10 million, according to Reuters.</p><p>Israel-based Blockchain Mining (BLCM) is scheduled to buy control of Bitfarms in February 2018. BLCM is also planning to list its stock on both Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange by the summer of 2018.  </p><p>Like Chinese mining organizations, BLCM is coming to Canada in response to threats of regulatory crackdowns; in early 2018, the Israel Securities Authority proposed rules to ban companies working with cryptocurrencies from the Tel Aviv exchange. In acquiring Bitfarms, BLCM says it will be &ldquo;creating one of the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency mining companies by installed power and hash power&rdquo; and it reportedly plans to open three more facilities this year. </p><p>C&ocirc;t&eacute; said most new mining facilities in the region will likely be in the urban Montreal, Quebec area. He adds that existing facilities that can accommodate large amounts of power consumption, like old factories, are also of interest. Bitfarms&rsquo; Farnham facility is an example &ndash; it is located in a former carpet factory. Quimper said this repurposing of abandoned space is an example of how Bitcoin mining can usher in new economic opportunities and added, &ldquo;There are very strict zoning bylaws so industrial facilities like ours do not negatively impact local communities.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pilot project based on the blockchain platform Ethereum will track and publish Canadian government research grant and funding data with blockchain technology,  Canada&rsquo;s National Research Council Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP) announced in a blog post.</p><p>The NRC IRAP is working with Canadian blockchain company Bitaccess to run this Ethereum trial. </p><p>&ldquo;These are early days yet, but the experiment is expected to provide constructive insight into the potential for blockchain technology and how it may be used for more open and transparent function of public programs,&rdquo; the NRC IRAP says. It is relying on the Catena Blockchain Suite built by Bitaccess to securely store up-to-date information on government grants. </p><p>Each time a grant is awarded, Bitaccess creates a permanent record of the data on the blockchain and the NRC IRAP posts the information online. Canadians can search for funding opportunities by date, recipient, amount and geographic area. Each grant also has a unique transaction ID on the Ethereum transaction explorer.</p><p>The project is now live, and it currently shows a top grant of USD 11.8 million was given to Ryerson University in late 2016. The most recent award released was to Chinova Bioworks for USD 19,997 in late 2017. </p><p>NRC IRAP first revealed plans for this initiative in June 2017 at a blockchain &ldquo;kickoff session&rdquo; at the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) Service Lab. Funding for the blockchain project also comes from Public Services and Procurement Canada&rsquo;s Build in Canada Innovation Program (BCIP).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nonprofit uses blockchain in order to help the homeless
It wants to raise 3,334 ETH</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a6/1e2126a143.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a6/1e2126a143.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a6/1e2126a143.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a6/1e2126a143.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a6/1e2126a143.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5a6/1e2126a143.png 1948w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who has experienced chronic homelessness, Latricia Mercer does not take spending time with her grandchildren or having a steady job for granted. Her life went through a dramatic change when she participated in &ldquo;Project Comeback,&rdquo; a free vocational rehabilitation program for homeless individuals in New York City. The program is run by a nonprofit called The Association of Community Employment Programs for the Homeless (ACE). Now, ACE is employing blockchain technology to empower even more homeless people. </p><p>Mercer has reconnected with her family and has her own place in a neighborhood where she once slept on benches. She was a Project Comeback participant before ACE ventured into using blockchain technology in 2017.</p><p>In March 2017, SingularDTV, a blockchain entertainment studio, approached ACE about using a technology they created called Tokit (it&#8217;s a dApp, or an app based on decentralized blockchain technology, which individuals or groups can use to connect with a broader community of supporters in a variety of ways). ACE agreed.</p><p>Last November, the nonprofit issued its tokens called &ldquo;ACEs&rdquo; and named its campaign Project Comeback, after its central program. It&rsquo;s selling ACEs through November 2018 to support its community programs for the homeless.</p><p>&ldquo;The blockchain community is aware of the problems our society is facing and coming up with the most innovative approaches to promoting equality and justice,&rdquo; ACE Director of Development Travis Tinney tells Cryptonews.com. He says working with SingularDTV&rsquo;s Tokit has taught his organization to &ldquo;keep [their] eyes open for ways to be innovative and share our story with new audiences.&rdquo; While he sees the volatility of some cryptocurrencies and public skepticism toward them as one downside to using the technology, to him, the upside is that &ldquo;people from all over the world are able to make a true difference in the lives of people facing real hardships with the click of a button.&rdquo; </p><p>ACE&rsquo;s traditional donors are commonly New Yorkers who tend to skew &ldquo;a little older, but that is starting to change,&rdquo; he says. Tinney appreciates that this innovative fundraising strategy connects ACE with new donors &ldquo;from a spectrum of age groups, locations and backgrounds.&rdquo; ACE is also open to the idea of working with other blockchains to connect with supporters and serve the homeless, should the opportunity arise. </p><p>From Tinney&rsquo;s point of view, &ldquo;Not everybody is on board with blockchain technology yet, but that just shows us there is still great potential for its growth and expansion.&rdquo;  </p><p><b>ACE Wants to Raise 3,334 ETH</b></p><p>The ACE team is working to &ldquo;tell the stories of the individuals [they] serve and how the support of the blockchain community will make a difference in their lives,&rdquo; Tinney conveys. The only cost to the organization has been the investment of staff time to the project.</p><p>ACE&#8217;s Project Comeback campaign has a goal of receiving 3,334 ether (ETH) (more than USD 4.4m as of January 15, 2018) and runs for a year. Money raised will be split between ACE&rsquo;s initiatives in this manner: 70% will be used to fund paid work experiences for participants, 20% will go to classes and trainings, and 10% will be used to pay for long-term support for graduates. </p><p>One ACE equals 0.003334 ETH. So far, ACE has raised 167 ETH, or 5% of the goal. Tinney says he and his colleagues are very pleased with the results. Even if they don&rsquo;t reach their goal, they will keep all the funding earned. He explains the nonprofit will likely convert some of the funds into USD and leave some in Ether, depending on &ldquo;the strength and trajectory of Ether at the end of 2018.&rdquo; </p><p>ACE will continue to market the ACE tokens through its social platforms and plans to reach out to media outlets with press releases in the future as the campaign continues. While Tinney and the rest of the ACE team typically use phone calls and hand-written notes to thank supporters, the Tokit campaign does not provide traditional contact information. So, they are still working out how best to connect with contributors and in the meantime, Tinney has this message for supporters:</p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;If [you] are reading this now&#8211;we can&#8217;t overstate how grateful we are and how much your contribution makes a difference.&rdquo; </p></blockquote><p>ACE is not the only nonprofit or social good organization to embrace blockchain as a useful tool. For example, the human rights charity Restless Beings is using blockchain technology to provide IDs to stateless and prosecuted Rohingya refugees. Since 2016, the United Nations&rsquo; World Food Programme has used its blockchain-based aid delivery system called &ldquo;Building Blocks&rdquo; to deliver assistance to more than 10,000 Syrian refugees. Bithope is an online fundraising platform that allows visitors to donate to a variety of charities with bitcoins. Blockchain for Good is an international think tank organized around the goal of exploring how blockchain can best be developed &ldquo;for the greater good of humanity, society, economy and our environment.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p><i><b>What Tool Is ACE Using?</b><br>
Tokit is a dApp; an app based on decentralized blockchain technology. Tokit allows creators, nonprofits and other users to interact directly with supporters by creating and selling their own token on the Ethereum blockchain. <br>
After putting significant funding and time into developing Tokit technology, SingularDTV is empowering users &ldquo;to start their own tokenized ecosystems and tokens within minutes and at virtually no cost,&rdquo; explains CEO of SingularDTV Zach LeBeau.</i> </p><p><i></i></p><p><b>About ACE</b><br>
Project Comeback is ACE&rsquo;s main program. It provides paid work experience (14 hours per week), Adult Basic Education, job and life skills training, and field-specific experience and certificates. For example, participants can gain credentials in Food Handler&rsquo;s Safety, Construction Safety, Security and other professional areas.<br>
ACE also offers a retention program called &ldquo;Project Stay.&rdquo; Through Project Stay, it supports its graduates (participants who have gotten jobs) with life-long support and enrichment services, such as counseling, workshops and job and life-skills assistance. Through a third initiative, &ldquo;Project Home,&rdquo; ACE affords a rent stipend during a set time period for those graduates who pursue additional training and education to boost their career prospects and success. <br>
Tinney tells Cryptonews.com that ACE&rsquo;s funding currently comes primarily from &ldquo;private donors, foundation support, event revenue and program revenue through providing sanitation services&rdquo; (a maintenance crew made up of ACE participants provides street sanitation and horticultural services in New York City). </p><blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;We offer opportunities to folks who often find themselves without any. All they want is a door open; an opportunity, and for 25 years ACE has afforded them that,&rdquo; says Executive Director James Martin.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China, which once dominated the global Bitcoin markets, continues its efforts to stamp out crypto-trading within its borders. </p><p>Following up on a 2017 nationwide ban on cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) , a senior Chinese banking official is now supporting the prohibition of additional services related to and involved with crypto-trading, Reuters reported, citing a memo outlining a government meeting in early January. </p><p>Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng of China&rsquo;s central bank, The People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC), said the government would implement additional regulations to shut down branches of the cryptocurrency industry including settlement providers, market-makers, guarantors, peer-to-peer lending vehicles, alternative trading platforms and cryptocurrency wallets, according to the report. </p><p>Moreover, Pan suggested local governments heighten their monitoring of mining energy consumption and use electricity price, taxes, and land use and environmental regulations as tools to guide the mines &ldquo;toward an orderly exit.&rdquo; China is currently a world leader in cryptocurrency mining because of its low energy prices.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>In late 2017, Pan famously predicted the death of Bitcoin, saying, &ldquo;There is only one thing left to do: Sit by the river bank and see Bitcoin&rsquo;s body pass by one day.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Since the recent crackdown on the crypto-sphere, major Chinese exchanges such as OKEx and Huobi Pro have redirected their business development into over-the-counter (OTC) trading, which typically uses private dealers rather than centralized exchanges, as well as overseas crypto-to-crypto venues. Pan feels websites and apps that facilitate these practices and/or help people move money overseas should be sanctioned. </p><p>Meanwhile, some major Chinese mining groups are now moving to the U.S., Canada or Iceland. BTC.Top, the third-largest mining pool, is opening a new location in Canada, according to media reports.</p>
