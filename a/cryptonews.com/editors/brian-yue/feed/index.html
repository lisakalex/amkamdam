<p>Sotheby’s has announced the start of its inaugural Bitcoin Ordinals sale, an online auction showcasing three items from the BitcoinShrooms NFT collection.</p>
<p>In an X <a href="https://twitter.com/Sothebysverse/status/1732475103567348141">post</a> on December 6, the auction house said it was “thrilled” to present its first Bitcoin Ordinals sale, which will run from December 6 to 13. </p>
<p>“Elegantly weaving the nuanced tapestry of Bitcoin’s history, culture, and core technicalities, each unique, pixelated, and hand-crafted piece forms part of a masterful, yet playful guide to the revolutionary realm of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/while-bitcoin-btc-holds-firm-above-43000-the-graph-grt-and-inqubeta-qube-prepare-for-big-shifts.htm">Bitcoin</a>,” Sotheby’s noted in a <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/digital-catalogues/bitcoinshrooms-an-ordinals-auction">press release</a> announcing the start of the auction. </p>
<p>Conceived by the pseudonymous digital artist Shroomtoshi, the BitcoinShrooms features pixelated art aimed at illustrating the history, culture, and core technical aspects of the blockchain, according to Sotheby’s. </p>
<p>Although the BitcoinShrooms collection consists of 222 works, only three items will be up for auction. </p>
<p>The three items up for auction include “S,” symbolizing “Self-Sovereignty;” “Sovereign Individual,” drawing inspiration from the Bitcoin-related book by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg; and “BIP39 Seed,” a reference to the commonly used 12 to 24 recovery seed phrase backups.</p>
<p>Up until now, there have been a total of 107 bids placed across the various lots, with “S” garnering the highest interest at 47 bids. </p>
<p>While each lot was initially estimated to be valued in the range of $20,000 to $30,000 with no reserve, current bid highs have already surpassed these estimates. “S,” “Sovereign Individual,” and “BIP39 Seed” currently boast bid highs of $42,000, $50,000, and $28,000, respectively.</p>
<p>“The BitcoinShrooms collection is a pixelated recap of the first 13 years of Bitcoin, a homage to the 8-bit style of art that expresses a slight nostalgia for the 90s, a way to soil tens of thousands of SSDs spread across the world with my art (next level cyber-vandalism), a tool to raise awareness about Bitcoin and what I personally view as its core principles, an ironic way to vent at what I see as its annoying pop elements and aberrations,” Shroomtoshi said about the collection.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-ordinals-nft-collections.htm">Bitcoin Ordinals</a> protocol provides a novel method for storing and exchanging digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain. Leveraging satoshis, the smallest units of bitcoin, users can etch NFTs, BRC-20 tokens, and other arbitrary data directly onto the blockchain, transforming each piece into a distinctive and tradable asset.</p>
<p>While the terms “Ordinals” and “inscriptions” are often used interchangeably, an ordinal specifically serves as a unique serialized identifier for an individual satoshi, whereas an inscription refers to the content or data attached to that particular satoshi.</p>

<p>Crypto exchange One Trading will launch its new trading venue in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The Block <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/266449/thiel-one-trading-launch-crypto">reported</a> on Thursday that the crypto exchange, which emerged as a spin-off from Bitpanda in June this year, is set to introduce its new trading venue, F.A.S.T.</p>
<p>One Trading claims that its new trading platform will be the “fastest-ever digital asset trading venue,” according to an announcement this morning. </p>
<p>“Our team has worked relentlessly to create a trading venue that redefines speed and efficiency. With F.A.S.T, we aim to empower our customers with unparalleled advantages in the competitive world of crypto trading,” said Josh Barraclough, CEO of One Trading.</p>
<p>One Trading asserts that its matching and risk engine functions in under one microsecond. Users can execute over 200 complete cycles of price discovery, order creation, and cancellation before placing a single order on well-established competitor exchanges.</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services, the cloud services provider, conducted an independent speed test on the platform. The results revealed that One Trading&#8217;s round trip of 112 microseconds was superior to the 126 microseconds offered by the London Stock Exchange Group&#8217;s Turquoise venue. It was also found to be 1,000 times faster than CME&#8217;s global Matching Engine.</p>
<p>One Trading will initiate its launch by offering free trading on all cryptocurrency pairs, a strategy aimed at attracting significant institutional traders. The platform has also submitted an application for a MiFID II Trading Venue License in the European Union.</p>
<p>One Trading previously raised €30 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Venture, and is led by Josh Barraclough, who had overseen Bitpanda Pro and was a former digital innovation head at JPMorgan.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the startup has been conducting beta testing of its platform with market makers. Upon its official launch, the venue will be accessible to both institutional and retail customers, with dedicated colocation services available for institutional clients.</p>
<p>Greg McLoughlin, the Strategy and Growth Lead at One Trading, is optimistic that the platform&#8217;s emphasis on speed will set it apart from other trading venues. </p>
<p>“Given the price discovery and execution advantage versus other venues we believe that we can be the central risk transfer venue for all major liquidity providers,” McLoughlin told The Block. “On top of this, making it free to trade means that big institutions can exchange risk and axes at the lowest costs. If you are an institution, you almost have a fiduciary responsibility to trade on our venue given the cost and execution advantage.”</p>

<p>Binance will compensate users who bought the Euro-pegged AEUR stablecoin during a recent 200% surge, the company said.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/updates-on-aeur-spot-trading-2023-12-06-7a7eef8366b7459494e7b2f7d935dbad">blog post</a> published Wednesday, the company said it would create a compensation plan for users who bought the stablecoin after its value surged nearly 200% to more than $3. The sudden spike in price was attributed to a misunderstanding among certain Binance traders who failed to recognize the stablecoin nature of AEUR.</p>
<p>The newly launched AEUR stablecoin, issued by Swiss-based Anchored Coins, experienced a 200% surge in price shortly after its listing on the spot market on Tuesday. The AEUR-USDT trading pair reached a peak of $3.25, far surpassing its expected value of approximately $1.07.</p>
<p>In response to the sudden surge, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/?post_type=post&amp;p=133178&amp;preview=true/">exchange</a> swiftly halted trading for four of the asset&#8217;s trading pairs, including AEUR/USDT, BTC/AEUR, ETH/AEUR, and EUR/AEUR. The decision was attributed to the abnormal volatility observed in the stablecoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>“As AEUR has been well received by the community, including users who might not have realized its standing as a stablecoin, there was a strong demand for AEUR, which resulted in its price deviation,” Binance wrote.</p>
<p>The exchange added that eligible traders for this compensation will be those who purchased AEUR between 17:41 UTC and 18:31 UTC on Dec. 5 and were unable to sell them. </p>
<p>“Eligible users’ net AEUR purchase amount during the Compensation Period will count toward the calculation of their respective compensation,” the company noted. “The calculation will be based on the price of AEUR on Binance Spot at 17:41 UTC (i.e., 1.07999 USDT per AEUR).”</p>
<p>The company announced that eligible users impacted by the trading suspension would receive compensation in the form of USDT token vouchers by December 9. These vouchers will be valid for 30 days from the date of distribution.</p>
<p>AEUR originally had a supply of five million coins on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-binance-ceo-richard-teng-addresses-compliance-issues-in-first-interview.htm">Binance</a>, with the exchange also initially incentivized trading of the new stablecoin with a zero-fee promotion.</p>
<p>AEUR’s issuer, Anchored Coins, cautioned the community to exercise caution regarding potential scammers. In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anchored-coins_aeur-anchoredcoins-activity-7137477023676911616-eEl0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn</a> post on December 5, Anchored Coins revealed that they had received reports of fraudulent social media accounts posing as them.</p>
<p>The impostors requested users to disclose their personal wallet addresses. The company emphasized that it never makes such requests and urged users to be vigilant against such scams.</p>

<p>Nova Labs’ Helium Mobile service has launched a nationwide plan in the U.S. with unlimited data, text, and talk that costs $20 a month. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.hellohelium.com/nationwide/">blog post</a> published Tuesday, Helium Mobile announced the launch of its unlimited mobile plan, which the company claims will be the “nation’s largest 5G network.”</p>
<p>“At Helium Mobile, we believe that cell phones are an essential service and unlimited data, text and calls are table stakes,” said Amir Haleem, CEO of Nova Labs, parent company of Helium Mobile. “We are tired of carriers that hide high subscription rates, roaming and additional data fees behind free phone upgrades that lock you into years of expensive plans. Americans deserve better.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-startup-nova-labs-introduces-affordable-5-phone-plan-crypto-adoption-rise.htm">Nova Labs</a> has been working towards the launch of its nationwide phone plan since September 2022 when it entered into a partnership with T-Mobile.</p>
<p>Helium Mobile’s service will integrate the peer-to-peer Helium Network, an internet-of-things initiative on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solanas-bonk-token-hits-record-high-amid-crypto-surge.htm">Solana</a> blockchain, and a comprehensive 5G network spanning the nation. This unveiling comes on the heels of a limited trial conducted in Miami earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Helium Network is structured for individuals to operate hotspot nodes from their residences or businesses, receiving rewards in the form of Solana-based tokens. </p>
<p>Nova Labs currently provides a hybrid cell service, allowing users to connect through its decentralized network. In instances where Helium hotspots cannot offer coverage, T-Mobile will take over to ensure continuous service.</p>
<p>“With Helium Mobile Hotspots, subscribers can own and set up ‘mini cell towers,’” the company said in its blog post. “Dead zones can become a thing of the past when anyone can become a builder and set up a hotspot to expand the network for themselves and the community.”</p>
<p>Helium Mobile, which calls itself “the world’s first cryptocarrier,” will offer an outdoor Helium mobile hotspot for $499 and an indoor one for $249.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://explorer.helium.com/stats">Helium Hotspots Map</a>, the network currently boasts 3,831 operational mobile hotspots, in addition to 357,087 active hotspots dedicated to internet-of-things devices.</p>
<p>The price of Helium’s HNT token, employed to reward operators using the network, experienced a modest increase on Tuesday following the company’s announcement. Its current value stands at $4.25, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/helium/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

<p>Binance’s $4.3 billion fine from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should be used as a “template” for how to operate, CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson said.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Financial Times’ Crypto and Digital Assets Summit: Winter Edition on Tuesday, Johnson asserted that US crypto regulators are trying to establish “guardrails” and bring “order and structure” to the market, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-might-be-peak-us-crypto-enforcement-cases-says-cftc-official-2023-12-05/">Reuters</a> reported.</p>
<p>“My hope would be that we have seen a spike, and what we will see going forward is that these early cases will really be a bit of a cautionary tale for those firms that really do want to successfully operate in this ecosystem,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>The $4.3 billion penalty imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/richard-teng-claims-binance-has-changed-following-record-breaking-compliance-settlement.htm">Binance</a> were described as “heightened” by Johnson, with the commissioner citing the CFTC’s previous public warnings to cryptocurrency firms to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>“There’s a common assumption that enforcement actions in the crypto or digital assets ecosystem connote bad actors or bad conduct,” Johnson said. “Admittedly, there is plenty of evidence to support this assumption,” she continued, but noted that in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-backed-crypto-wallet-firm-web3auth-and-safe-launch-safeauth.htm">Binance’s</a> case, “the matter and the resolution of the litigation did not involve any allegation of fraud or similar misconduct.”</p>
<p>Johnson clarified that the regulatory agency took action against the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-absence-at-binance-settlement-announcement-raises-questions.htm">Binance</a> because it “simply failed to comply with regulation.” She noted that Binance’s case could provide a “template” for other crypto firms who want to learn how to operate successfully. </p>
<p>“For those firms that really do want to successfully operate in this space, there is an increasingly clear template for how to operate,” Johnson said. “Take the hint.”</p>
<p>Johnson added that going forward, the CFTC would seek to be “deeply thoughtful” on requiring better disclosures at crypto firms that combine different activities under one roof.</p>
<p>Binance made international headlines last month after being fined the largest sum in corporate history. After being convicted of money laundering and other charges, the crypto exchange agreed to pay $4.3 billion to the CFTC, the Department of Justice, and other US government agencies. </p>
<p>The CFTC had previously sued Binance in March for operating as an unlicensed crypto trading platform in the US while trying to hide from regulators. </p>
<p>As part of the deal, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao agreed to step down and pay a $150 million fine to the CFTC. </p>

<p>Web3 developer Thirdweb has disclosed a security vulnerability that has the potential to affect a range of smart contracts within the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/3-out-of-every-4-web3-games-have-met-their-demise-coingecko-report.htm">Web3</a> ecosystem.</p>
<p>In an X <a href="https://twitter.com/thirdweb/status/1731841493407576247">post</a> on Monday, the firm notified its followers that it had found a vulnerability in a commonly used open-source library that could impact specific pre-built smart contracts, including some of its own. <b><br />
</b><br />
Luckily, Thirdweb’s investigations determined that the smart contract vulnerability remains unexploited, providing a brief window of opportunity for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decoding-web3-blockchain-laboratories-set-to-revolutionize-esg-markets-with-innovative-solutions.htm">Web3</a> firms to take preventive measures and mitigate the risk of a potential hack.</p>
<p>“In most cases, the mitigation steps will involve locking the contract, taking a snapshot and migrating to a new contract without the known vulnerability,” the firm said on X. “The exact steps you need to take will depend on the nature of your smart contract, and you can determine these using the tool.”</p>
<p>Thirdweb noted that the impacted pre-built contracts include but are not limited to DropERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 (all versions), and AirdropERC20. The company included a <a href="https://blog.thirdweb.com/security-vulnerability/">link</a> to see a full list of impacted smart contracts and mitigation steps. </p>
<p>The company advised users who had deployed the listed smart contracts before November 22 to immediately take mitigation steps or use a company-provided tool. </p>
<p>Thirdweb also recommended developers assist users in revoking approvals on all affected contracts through revoke.cash. DefiLlama developer “0xngmi” noted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/0xngmi/status/1731889230387814893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1731889230387814893%7Ctwgr%5E31e49defe282bba318660acfff3efd3155286fc7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Ftaiwan-review-global-trends-before-crypto-etfs">reply</a> to the post that this would “protect your users if you choose not to mitigate the contract.”</p>
<p>Following the discovery of the vulnerability, Thirdweb has committed to increasing investments in security measures. The firm plans to double bug bounty payouts, raising them from $25,000 to $50,000, and is implementing a more stringent auditing process. The Web3 developer will also provide a grant to cover the costs associated with contract mitigations.</p>
<p>“We understand that this will cause disruption, and we are treating the mitigation of the issue with the utmost seriousness,” the firm continued in its post. “We will be offering a retroactive gas grant to cover fees for contract mitigations.”</p>
<p>Thirdweb is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/socrates-redefining-web3-social-media-by-rewarding-engaging-debates.htm">Web3</a> developer that provides multichain smart contract deployment tools for minting, gaming, wallets, and more. The firm claims to have more than 70,000 developers using its services monthly.</p>
<p>The company previously raised $24 million in a Series A funding round with Haun Ventures, Coinbase, Shopify and Polygon in August 2022.</p>

<p>28 Indian crypto platforms have registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit, the country’s Minister of State for Finance said. </p>
<p>In response to queries in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-protocol-algorand-forms-strategic-collaborations-in-india-for-web3-push.htm">India’s</a> bicameral Parliament, Indian Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary told the Parliament’s Lower House in a <a href="https://sansad.in/ls/questions/questions-and-answers">written reply</a> that 28 virtual digital asset service providers had been given the green flag by the country’s anti money-laundering department. </p>
<p>Notable exchanges such as CoinDCX, WaxirX and CoinSwitch have all successfully registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), while none of the 28 entities appear to be offshore companies.</p>
<p>The move follows India’s Finance Ministry’s announcement in March, when the government unit mandated that crypto businesses will have to register with the FIU and adhere to various processes outlined in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). </p>
<p>Crypto businesses in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/india-seeks-extradition-of-prime-suspect-in-240m-crypto-scam.htm">India</a> are now legally obligated to carry out verification processes like Know Your Customer (KYC). Entities subject to the PMLA are also required to uphold and maintain KYC details, along with other pertinent documents related to transactions, clients, and beneficial owners.</p>
<p>Chaudhary also affirmed that the guidelines and reporting requirements for crypto service providers are applicable to offshore crypto exchanges serving the Indian market. This approach is taken to reinforce future crypto regulations in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indian-authorities-prepare-chargesheet-in-240m-crypto-scam.htm">India</a>, aiming to protect its citizens from potential exchange collapses.</p>
<p>“Appropriate action under PMLA” would be taken against non-compliant offshore platforms, Chaudhary added. </p>
<p>Alongside heightened regulatory compliance, the Indian crypto market is grappling with additional challenges, notably in the realm of taxation. The government&#8217;s imposition of a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on crypto transactions exceeding INR 10,000 and a 30% tax on profits has reverberated throughout the industry.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) has also been openly critical of crypto, and has called for a cryptocurrency ban. </p>

<p>Osmosis and UX Chain are preparing to merge in a move that seeks to create a comprehensive DeFi hub.</p>
<p>Subject to approval, the merger would result in the fusion of lending protocol UX Chain’s lending logic and algorithms with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/aaron-kong-growth-strategy-lead-at-osmosis-labs-cosmos-ecosystem-decentralized-exchanges-interoperability-ep-247.htm">Osmosis’</a> decentralized exchange, the largest DEX on Cosmos.</p>
<p>In an announcement posted on Osmosis’ forum on Sunday, the companies jointly detailed a <a href="https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/merger-between-osmosis-and-umee/780">plan</a> for the proposed merger. The procedure will take place in incremental steps, starting with the assimilation of UX Chain’s codebase into the Osmosis Chain.</p>
<p>“When looking through the Cosmos, it is clear that Osmosis has shown a dominant presence as the most successful DEX in the ecosystem,” Osmosis said in its post. “Concurrently when looking at lending platforms in Cosmos it is quite apparent that the Umee UX Chain is the dominant lending platform in Cosmos with more special features than any other lending platform in crypto. Considering the potential synergies, we’re proposing a merger of these blockchain protocols into one of the most powerful DeFi ecosystems possible.”</p>
<p>The merger seeks to maximize the capabilities of both platforms, with the initial phase expected to include the harmonization of shared total value locked across the two networks. During this preliminary step, both chains will maintain the separate trading of their respective tokens — the Osmosis token and the UX token.</p>
<p>There might also be a subsequent step involving the consolidation of the two tokens, potentially through a token swap or migration process. As per the proposal, this phase aims to establish a unified token representing both networks. The specific configurations for the token swap will be determined through community governance.</p>
<p>“Each chain will have a separate governance vote from each blockchain network,” said Brent Xu, co-founder of UX Chain, in an interview with <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/265824/osmosis-ux-chain-merger-cosmos">The Block</a>. “The community governance will manage the processes separately for each network toward achieving consensus around the end goal of creating the DeFi hub.”</p>
<p>The proposed merger seeks to empower UX Chain to enhance the mesh security of Osmosis—the network&#8217;s ability to secure other blockchain projects. This could be achieved by leveraging the combined expertise or merging validator sets from both networks. </p>
<p>UX Chain and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/namada-osmosis-to-co-fuse-blockchain-to-fund-public-goods.htm">Osmosis</a> may also investigate opportunities to develop advanced liquidations, native margin trading, and MEV markets.</p>
<p>“This proposal to merge the Umee UX DeFi experience into the Osmosis chain would enable some really powerful new features and functionalities for our users — and we’re excited to continue our collaboration with UX Chain with what the community decides is best,” <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rebus-announces-public-coin-distribution-via-osmosis.htm">Osmosis</a> co-founder Sunny Aggarwal said.</p>

<p>Forkast Labs has laid off a majority of its editorial staff after completing a merger with data provider CryptoSlam.</p>
<p>According to sources cited by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/265619/forkast-layoff-cryptoslam">The Block</a>, the crypto news site underwent a series of layoffs throughout the year, leading to the eventual decision to suspend editorial operations by the end of November.</p>
<p>In January, Forkast.News merged with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-shows-signs-of-recovery-with-surging-crypto-prices-nft-sales.htm">CryptoSlam</a> to form a &#8220;Web3-focused data intelligence and media platform&#8221; under the new brand Forkast Labs. However, the crypto news site seems to have ceased publishing articles and video content last month, with the latest article dated November 22. </p>
<p>“Forkast.News is now Forkast Labs,” the website currently says.</p>
<p>“The majority of editorial operations have been incorporated into Forkast Labs as a result of the merger between Forkast and CryptoSlam earlier this year,” according to an internal memo the company shared with its staff last month. “There will be an increased focus on the data side going forward.”</p>
<p>According to its website, Forkast Labs is focused on exploring new frontiers in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-web3-gaming-investment-arena-overcorrecting-possibly-wax-exec-says.htm">Web3</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptopunks-and-bored-apes-dip-as-nft-500-index-falls-despite-crypto-rally.htm">NFTs</a>, and the metaverse. Back in March, the company unveiled a suite of indices, including the Forkast 500 NFT Index, showcasing its commitment to staying at the forefront of digital trends. It also formed a partnership with The Sandbox, signaling its entrance into the world of metaverse indexing. </p>
<p>CryptoSlam, a non-fungible token data tracker, was established in 2018 and secured $9 million in funding in January 2022, with Animoca Brands leading the investment round. The merger between CryptoSlam and Forkast.News was orchestrated by Yat Siu, founder and executive chairman of Animoca, as reported by Bloomberg in January. Forkast.News is also part of the Animoca portfolio. </p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Forekast.News previously <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/19/2232082/0/en/Forkast-Ltd-raises-1-7-million-seed-round-to-expand-global-coverage.html">raised a $1.7 million seed round</a> in 2021. </p>
<p>CoinDesk, another crypto news outlet, underwent significant restructuring by laying off 45% of its editorial staff in August. Subsequently, it was sold to Bullish, a crypto exchange led by former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley, in an all-cash deal last month.</p>

<p>The Central Bank of Solomon Islands has revealed a partnership with Japanese blockchain Soramitsu to launch a proof-of-concept for a CBDC named Bokolo Cash. </p>
<p>In a Keynote <a href="https://www.cbsi.com.sb/keynote-address-of-the-prime-minister-at-the-launching-of-the-proof-of-concept-central-bank-digital-currency-bokolo-cash/">speech</a> on Tuesday, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said his country was embarking on the CBDC journey with the goal of leveraging technology as “a catalyst for inclusive and sustainable development, ultimately fostering shared prosperity across our beautiful nation.”</p>
<p>Bokolo Cash will be equivalent to one Solomon Islands dollar, and citizens will be able to use it for transactions in retail environments within the capital city of the island nation, Honiara, as well as for person-to-person transfers.</p>
<p>Commercial banks will test wholesale transfers, along with simulated cross-border payments and remittances. Additionally, users will be subjected to a “two-tier” Know Your Customer verification process, according to Soramitsu.</p>
<p>Bokolo Cash is set to run on a specifically tailored blockchain built on Hyperledger’s Iroha, while will also integrate with Soramitsu’s public Sora blockchain. Through this connectivity, users will have the ability to conduct transfers using QR codes and leverage the self-custody Fearless Wallet, a product developed by Soramitsu.</p>
<p>While the project started in early November, the official announcement was only unveiled earlier this week. The pivotal legislative step, the CBSI Amendment Act 2023, necessary to empower the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands to issue the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/canadians-support-cash-payments-over-cbdcs-report.htm">CBDC</a>, was successfully enacted on November 3rd.</p>
<p>“By embracing digital currency, we position our nation at the forefront of the global technological landscape,” Sogavare continued in his speech. “The CBDC Pilot Project signifies our commitment to embracing the future, capitalizing on the efficiency, transparency, and security that digital currency offers.”</p>
<p>The Solomon Islands, comprising over 900 islands to the west of Papua New Guinea with a population of approximately 700,000, is now part of a growing trend among island nations exploring <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/project-tourbillon-cbdcs-can-meet-privacy-requirements-bis-research-reveals.htm">CBDC</a>. Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Mauritius have previously experimented with CBDC. Notably, the Eastern Caribbean countries have already embraced an official <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-apex-banks-jump-on-e-cny-pilot-trial-program-the-rise-of-global-cbdc-issuance.htm">CBDC</a> known as DCash.</p>

<p>A memecoin minted shortly after billionaire <a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=137427&amp;action=edit">Charlie Munger’s death</a> experienced a staggering surge of over 31000% on Wednesday, but lost more than 98% of its value the next day. </p>
<p>As news broke of the Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman’s death, the MUNGER memecoin rose more than 31000% as investors quickly ran to decentralized exchanges with millions of dollars worth of Ether and stablecoins.</p>
<p>Daily trading volume for MUNGER peaked at $3.5 million on Wednesday, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0x7993868ef2c6f8b4e7e01c933e096db555f67ac6/#TradeHistory">CoinMarketCap.</a></p>
<p>However, the token suffered a substantial decline of over 98% in value on Thursday following revelations about the token’s smart contract which was revealed to contain erroneous functions, enabling developers to impose restrictions on the sale of the asset.</p>
<p>The smart contract included a blacklist function and authorization that could potentially manipulate users into approving a malicious smart contract, according to <a href="https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0x7993868ef2c6f8b4e7e01c933e096db555f67ac6">GeckoTerminal.</a></p>
<p>Daily trading for MUNGER now sits at less than $40,000 at time of writing, with the token now worth $0.00000003039.</p>
<p>Often referred to by Warren Buffett as his closest partner and right-hand man, Munger was a steadfast skeptic of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bitcoin-dips-nearly-1-eyes-etfs-mungers-critique-in-market-rally.htm">Bitcoin</a> and cryptocurrencies in general. He once described Bitcoin as “detestable.”</p>
<p>“I’m not proud of my country for allowing this crypto s***,” Munger said earlier this year. “It’s worthless, it’s no good.”</p>
<p>Munger’s reasons for his dislike of Bitcoin were based on its volatility and the lack of established regulatory frameworks. He also previously expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s potential facilitation of criminal activities, including drug dealing, terror funding, kidnapping, and extortion.</p>
<p>“I don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth, nor do I like just shuffling out of your extra billions of billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air,” he once said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of memecoins are created daily, and they have a rich and storied history of capitalizing on breaking news to pump highly speculative tokens of questionable origin. Last week, a newly minted CZ token, spawned right after Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s resignation as Binance&#8217;s CEO, experienced an 18,000% surge.</p>
<p>However, the rapid rises also come with significant risks. Memecoins such as MUNGER are frequently subjected to “rug-pulling” by their anonymous creators, who withdraw liquidity, leaving investors with substantial losses.</p>

<p>A federal judge has accepted confidential materials from Jump Crypto Holdings in discovery as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Terraform Labs.</p>
<p>In a Nov. 28 filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge Jed Rakoff <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150.135.0.pdf">sanctioned</a> the confidential treatment of specific materials generated by Jump Crypto Holdings, the cryptocurrency division of Jump Trading.</p>
<p>“The Court retains discretion to make public any confidential materials in connection with future motion practice or trial,” the filing read. “If such disclosure is contemplated, the Court will provide prior notice to counsel for Jump so that counsel may be heard on any objections.”</p>
<p>Jump Trading had <a href="https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1722296209971241250">reportedly</a> come under investigation by the SEC for its purported role in the events that triggered the depegging of TerraUSD (UST) and the subsequent decline of the Terra ecosystem, a major catalyst for the crypto market downturn of 2022.</p>
<p>Prior to the collapse of Terraform Labs, Jump Crypto had a notable role in the company&#8217;s ecosystem, engaging in funding rounds with the goal of creating a reserve for Terra&#8217;s stablecoin, UST. </p>
<p>However, in May, investors filed a lawsuit against Jump Trading, accusing the firm and its CEO, Kanav Kariya, of manipulating the price of UST to secure approximately $1.3 billion in profits.</p>
<p>According to the SEC, Terraform Labs loaned Jump 30 million Terra tokens in November 2019 and an additional 65 million <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-lunc-jumps-28-50-whats-driving-the-surge.htm">LUNA</a> in September 2020. </p>
<p>Terra claimed that the &#8220;loans&#8221; were intended to enhance liquidity; however, the SEC asserted that the trading firm was consistently selling LUNA into the market.</p>
<p>In February this year, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gary-gensler-remains-tight-lipped-on-future-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">SEC</a> filed charges against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon, alleging their involvement in a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. The case is still ongoing, with both the SEC and Terraform Labs submitting motions for summary judgment in October. Jury selection is scheduled to begin next year on January 29 in New York, should the case proceed to trial.</p>
<p>Montenegro authorities <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-founder-do-kwons-extradition-approved-by-montenegrin-court-heres-the-latest.htm">arrested Kwon in June</a> for using forged travel documents, leading to a four-month prison sentence. On November 24, a Montenegrin court granted approval for Kwon’s extradition, pending the Minister of Justice’s approval. He could be extradited to either the United States or South Korea to face the charges.</p>
<p>In addition to the SEC&#8217;s civil suit, Do Kwon is also facing criminal charges in the United States regarding the collapse of the Terraform ecosystem.</p>

<p>Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said he would not “pre-judge” the future of spot Bitcoin ETFs when asked if the SEC would take any action soon regarding the matter. </p>
<p>Speaking at a conference hosted by the Healthy Markets Association on Wednesday, Gensler reiterated his position that Bitcoin is a commodity, while also continuing to express apprehension about the overall state of the crypto industry.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like common sense versus the hyperbole in this field,” Gensler said. “This is a field that is rife with bad actors and rife with fraud and manipulation and money laundering.”</p>
<p>Several asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have been waiting patiently for the SEC to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The companies have filed multiple applications over the past few months, but have all faced delays so far. </p>
<p>When asked about Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam’s remarks regarding the necessity of additional authority for the derivatives regulator to supervise crypto, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-executive-flags-gary-genslers-speech-highlights-secs-shortcomings.htm">Gensler</a> conveyed his support for granting the CFTC increased authority, particularly surrounding bitcoin.</p>
<p>Gensler has previously called the agency’s review method a “time-tested process.”</p>
<p>“When an asset manager is seeking to take something public, these exchange traded products need to register with the SEC, and they go through a filing, somewhat similar to going public, like an IPO,” Gensler said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV2-UJWwMiE">Bloomberg TV</a> last month.</p>
<p>“And so it’s really the work of our Division of Corporation Finance that gives feedback, our Division of Trading and Markets of course looks at the filings,” he continued. “This is a time tested process that goes back decades. The staff of the SEC, it’s called the Disclosure Review Team, but in that group, they respond and give feedback to potential issuers.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the SEC engaged in new discussions with delegates from Invesco and BlackRock to explore possible strategies for addressing concerns related to &#8220;balance sheet impacts and risks.&#8221; The SEC had also convened meetings with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-keeps-quiet-on-bitcoin-etf-plans-after-grayscale-ruling-heres-the-latest.htm">Grayscale</a> and BlackRock last week, as outlined in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-301179-767742.pdf">memo</a> released by the regulatory agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gary-gensler-crypto-frauds-extend-beyond-a-single-case.htm">Gensler</a>, a former chair of the CFTC, has previously asserted that numerous cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. </p>
<p>During the conference, he also referenced a prior speech in which he likened the lack of compliance in the crypto industry to the conditions of the 1920s, a period before the implementation of federal securities laws.</p>
<p>“That was being kind,” he remarked on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Decentralized crypto exchanges Velodrome and Aerodrome have warned users about a front-end security breach on their websites.</p>
<p>In X posts published on Wednesday, Velodrome and Aerodrome warned users against interacting with their websites until further notice.</p>
<p>“Our frontend is currently compromised,” the Velodrome team wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1729771762752135463">X</a>. “Please do not interact with Velodrome for the time being. The team are investigating and will communicate more here when we have it.”</p>
<p>The same warning was posted on Aerodrome’s X account.</p>
<p>The security breach seems to involve a domain name system (DNS) attack targeting the Aerodrome and Velodrome’s official websites. DNS is a widely utilized protocol crucial for the functioning of websites. </p>
<p>In DNS attacks, hackers seize control of a site and redirect users to a phishing site linked to a malicious contract, with the intention of illicitly acquiring users&#8217; funds.</p>
<p>On-chain analyst ZachXBT identified two specific addresses that funds from Aerodrome and Velodrome were being sent to, providing a glimpse into the amount of damage the hackers caused. At time of writing, a combined $70,000 worth of crypto assets have been drained into these two addresses.</p>
<p>“Looks like stolen funds are going to these two addresses: 0x02BA13f39D7df9C3F7592257b636eD6C7CC4ae78 [and] 0xf64fCEdFCe714Bbe835761e54D7067f2f8231443,” ZachXBT <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1729777066780815540">wrote</a> on X. </p>
<p>Aerodrome provided an alternate solution, asking its users to only access Aerodrome from its decentralized frontend.</p>
<p>“Please ensure you are accessing Aerodrome only from our decentralized frontend at <a href="http://aero.drome.eth.limo">http://aero.drome.eth.limo</a>,” Aerodrome <a href="https://twitter.com/aerodromefi/status/1729795692577624465">posted</a> on X, while also noting that “protocol funds are safe and contracts are unaffected.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/velodrome-introduce-aerodrome-dex-coinbases-base-network.htm">Velodrome</a> is the second-largest decentralized exchange protocol on the OP Mainnet (previously Optimism) based on total value locked and revenue. The company currently boasts over $139 million in total locked value.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aerodrome is the largest protocol on Base in terms of total value locked (TVL), holding over $63 million in funds.</p>
<p>Last month, Web3 credentials and rewards platform Galxe <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-credentials-platform-galxe-refund-396000-affected-users-post-dns-attack-heres-latest.htm">announced</a> its intention to refund over $396,000 to more than 980 users who were impacted by a significant DNS attack.</p>
<p>The project has also pledged to supplement the refunded amount by an additional 10% as a gesture of goodwill, as outlined in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTfVZefCJZf4d2ZPdmXfqhD_dg69ARiD3T5zuVje-5xwhx6Q4DSAVv6rCMyXvQ02SvVIjwhD4kX3VN4/pubhtml">shared document</a>.</p>

<p>Crypto firm Paxos has secured two in-principle approvals from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority in the Abu Dhabi Global Market.</p>
<p>The company said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paxos-receives-in-principle-approvals-from-the-financial-services-regulatory-authority-to-issue-stablecoins-and-conduct-digital-asset-services-from-the-abu-dhabi-global-market-302000692.html">press release</a> published on Wednesday that the approvals would allow Paxos to issue stablecoins and provide cryptocurrency brokerage and custody services.</p>
<p>The in-principle approvals granted to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/deloitte-paxos-share-insights-on-stablecoins-and-financial-innovation-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Paxos</a> are specifically for two new entities established within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). </p>
<p>“Today’s announcement marks yet another milestone in Paxos’ ability to provide billions of users with safe and trusted digital asset services,” said Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos. “Our IPAs from the FSRA, on the heels of our IPA from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, solidify our commitment to pursuing international growth through regulated frameworks. Paxos is unique in the industry for this approach and we will continue expanding our regulatory licensing to serve global enterprises as a trusted, innovative partner.”</p>
<p>The company added that expanding to Abu Dhabi would solidify its position as the “most comprehensively regulated blockchain platform in the world,” adhering to the highest operating standards in New York, Singapore and the ADGM.</p>
<p>A Paxos spokesperson told <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/265174/paxos-stablecoin-abu-dhabi-expansion">The Block</a> that the full approvals are expected in the first half of next year, and will empower the company to launch new stablecoins backed by USD and other currencies from Abu Dhabi. However, Paxos is presently concentrating on the introduction of a new stablecoin backed by USD.</p>
<p>Paxos’ expansion into Abu Dhabi follows closely on the heels of receiving in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for its new local entity, which is set to introduce a USD-backed stablecoin in Singapore.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://paxos.com/2023/11/16/paxos-receives-in-principle-approval-from-mas-for-new-entity-that-will-issue-usd-backed-stablecoin-in-singapore/">statement</a> released on November 15, Paxos announced that it had <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-issuer-paxos-receives-preliminary-nod-from-singapore-regulator.htm">obtained preliminary approval from the MAS</a> for its newly established entity, Paxos Digital Singapore Pte. Ltd.</p>
<p>Similar to its Singaporean counterpart, the Paxos unit in ADGM will help the establishment of partnerships akin to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptocom-paypal-paxos-partner-for-paypal-usd-integration-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">PayPal</a> in the U.S., according to The Block’s spokesperson. It will also have the capability to onboard customers based in Abu Dhabi for its crypto brokerage and custody services.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Paxos boasts support from prominent investors such as Bank of America, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and Coinbase Ventures. With over $540 million in total funding to date, the company achieved a valuation of $2.4 billion in its latest Series D funding round in 2021.</p>

<p>DOGE-1, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-adoption-grows-to-5-million-wallet-addresses-can-doge-reach-10.htm">Dogecoin</a>-funded SpaceX moon mission, has received a key regulatory approval from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. </p>
<p>The approval is one of the precursors to the final Federal Communications Commission license, which the mission is still yet to receive.</p>
<p>The project was first unveiled in May 2021, with space technology firm Geometric Energy Corporation currently in the process of developing the DOGE-1 satellite. This satellite is scheduled to be deployed into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>In an X <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelReidGEC/status/1729650317191422051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1729650317191422051%7Ctwgr%5Eedbf28f2d0d3a8ae82740becbab1bad51ada19c0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Ftech%2F2023%2F11%2F29%2Fdogecoin-funded-spacex-doge-1-moon-mission-gets-a-step-closer-to-launch%2F">post</a> published on Tuesday, Samuel Reid, CEO of Geometric Energy Corporation, confirmed that DOGE-1 had received approval for DOGE-1 X-Band, but was still waiting on other approvals.</p>
<p>“The National Telecommunications and Information Administration approved DOGE-1 X-Band (0083-EX-CN-2022 on <a href="http://ntia.doc.gov/">http://ntia.doc.gov</a>),” Reid said in his post. “We have yet to get the FCC license grant which will address X-Band and S-Band.”</p>
<p>The DOGE-1 satellite will feature a miniature screen designed to showcase advertisements, images, and logos, with the content being broadcast to Earth. Notably, the launch of DOGE-1 will mark the first instance of a satellite being entirely funded using <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hollywood-meets-crypto-director-uses-netflix-funds-for-risky-dogecoin-bet.htm">DOGE</a> tokens.</p>
<p>The launch of DOGE-1 was initially <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1391523807148527620">announced</a> in May 2021 by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who disclosed that the satellite would be part of a rideshare collaboration aboard a rocket launched jointly by Intuitive Machines and NASA.</p>
<p>The planned launch of DOGE-1 has faced repeated delays attributed to Intuitive Machines&#8217; launch provider, SpaceX. Consequently, the originally scheduled launch for 2022 has been postponed, with the current target set for January 2024.</p>
<p>DOGE-1 isn’t the only Dogecoin-related moon mission currently in the works.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Dogecoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/astrobotic-to-send-physical-dogecoin-to-the-moon-in-2024.htm">announced</a> plans to send a physical Dogecoin to the Moon next year in collaboration with space robotics firm Astrobotic Technology.</p>
<p>The upcoming Peregrine Mission One (PM1) by Astrobotic is poised to ferry 21 payloads, featuring cargo contributed by various entities including governments, companies, universities, and NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.</p>
<p>As a part of the PM1 mission, the rocket is slated to carry a physical Bitcoin token sponsored by crypto exchange BitMEX. Additionally, it will transport a replica of the Genesis Block, commissioned by Bitcoin Magazine, symbolizing the first block of Bitcoin ever mined. </p>

<p>Chainlink has enhanced its native staking mechanism through the introduction of Chainlink Staking v0.2, featuring an increased pool size of 45 million.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainlink-staking-v0-2-is-now-live-301999507.html">press release</a> on Tuesday, the initiation of the v0.2 upgrade will commence with a nine-day Priority Migration phase for current v0.1 stakers.</p>
<p>During this period, users will have the opportunity to transfer their staked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chainlink-price-prediction-as-link-surges-16-6-in-two-weeks-can-link-reach-100.htm">LINK</a> and associated rewards to v0.2. The access is set to gradually broaden, with Early Access scheduled for December 7 and General Access on December 11.</p>
<p>With the staking pool size elevated to 45 million LINK, equivalent to 8% of the existing circulating supply, the decentralized computing protocol aims to attract a broader range of LINK token holders. </p>
<p>“Because we are seeing a consistent increase in the amount of value secured by and paid for over the Chainlink Network, it’s increasingly important to improve the cryptoeconomic security of the network,” said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. “Staking v0.2 introduces important new security features and sets the system up for even further growth in the year to come.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/white-hat-hackers-awarded-300k-after-uncovering-critical-chainlink-vrf-vulnerability.htm">Chainlink</a> plays a pivotal role in supplying blockchain applications with external real-world data as the most widely used oracle network in the crypto space. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vodafone-and-chainlink-collaborate-on-blockchain-enabled-proof-of-concept-for-global-trade.htm">Chainlink</a> first introduced staking in December, enhancing the token’s utility and allowing LINK holders to support the performance of oracle services. Initially, staking was limited to securing the Ethereum ETH/USD price feed, with a capped pool of 25 million LINK tokens.</p>
<p>Chainlink Staking v0.2 was created with the intention of introducing a more versatile unbonding mechanism, enabling stakers to withdraw their staked tokens with increased efficiency. The upgrade also brings improved security guarantees to the staking process. The modular architecture of Chainlink Staking v0.2 is designed for enhanced adaptability, simplifying the integration of future upgrades and improvements into the system.</p>
<p>Chainlink Staking v0.2 will also incorporate “dynamic rewards mechanisms that can seamlessly support new sources of rewards in the future,” the team said.</p>
<p>Once the Priority Migration period concludes on December 7, 2023, at 12 PM ET, LINK token holders who meet at least one predefined criterion on the updated Early Access Eligibility List will be eligible to stake up to 15,000 LINK in v0.2, assuming the v0.2 pool capacity has not been reached.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of Early Access on December 11, 2023, at 12 PM ET, the v0.2 staking pool will become available for General Access. During this phase, anyone will have the opportunity to stake up to 15,000 LINK, contingent upon the v0.2 pool not reaching its maximum capacity.</p>

<p>Animoca Brands has become the largest validator on the TON Network after its investment in TON Play.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-based investment firm announced in a <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/ton-foundation-welcomes-animoca-brands-as-ton-blockchain-largest-validator">press release</a> published Tuesday that it had partnered with the TON Blockchain to provide funding, research, and an analytics platform for third-party TON applications.</p>
<p>With its investment in TON Play, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/animoca-ceo-blockchain-game-sector-rejuvenated-by-spot-bitcoin-etf-enthusiasm.htm">Animoca</a> also plans to deliver an array of blockchain-based games to messaging app Telegram’s 800 million users. </p>
<p>“Animoca Brands’ investment in The Open Network is a pivotal step towards the next era of blockchain-based gaming,” said Justin Hyun, Director of Growth at TON Foundation. “Its new analytics platform and in-depth research reports represent alignment with TON Foundation’s mission. Together, we will infuse Web3 seamlessly into the daily experiences of Telegram users, particularly in gaming, for a global audience to enjoy.”</p>
<p>In particular, the company intends to support TON Play, a gaming infrastructure initiative built upon the TON blockchain. This framework enables the development of gaming applications on TON, facilitating their launch on the messaging app Telegram. Additionally, it provides the capability to seamlessly transfer existing web-based games to the messaging application.</p>
<p>With its investment in TON Play, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/animoca-brands-subsidiary-launch-unique-bitcoin-metaverse-token.htm">Animoca</a> also plans to deliver an array of blockchain-based games to messaging app Telegram’s 800 million users through its web app and mobile app’s PlayDeck bot, which contains a selection of mobile games for users to browse through.</p>
<p>The exact amount of Animoca’s investment was not revealed in the press release. However, it is understood that a portion of the investment was directly allocated to Toncoin, which has been staked as part of the validator agreement.</p>
<p>The investment firm is exploring the potential of transferring a curated selection of its gaming titles and applications, drawn from its extensive portfolio of over 400 Web3 projects, to the Telegram platform.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/animoca-brands-japan-and-klktn-partner-with-cool-cats-for-web3-expansion-into-japanese-anime-market.htm">Animoca Brands Research</a> has created its own TON Analytics Dashboard, a tool that aggregates diverse metrics from TON’s open internet ecosystem. This encompasses data from TON Blockchain, TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites.</p>
<p>Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, emphasized that the investment in TON aligns with the company’s commitment to easing the transition from Web2 to Web3.</p>
<p>“This strategic investment in TON is a key part of our broader commitment to help onboard the next million Web3 users by facilitating a seamless transition from Web2 to Web3,” Siu said. “Taking part in the network’s validation underlines our faith in the successful realization of the vision behind the TON project as it looks to bring Web3 into the mainstream. We have already seen significant growth potential in games with TON, and we’re looking forward to working with the other innovative teams building exciting TON-based games.”</p>

<p>The Jito Foundation is introducing a governance token designed to oversee and stimulate the development of the Solana-based liquid staking protocol.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.jito.network/blog/announcing-jto-the-jito-governance-token/">statement</a> released on Monday, the company disclosed plans to create 1 billion JTO tokens to facilitate the governance of its Jito Network. This includes tasks such as establishing fees for the JitoSOL staking pool, overseeing revenue, and managing the DAO treasury.</p>
<p>Initially, 115 million JTO tokens will be in circulation. The allocation plan designates 34% of the tokens for community growth, 25% for ecosystem development, 24.5% for core contributors, and 16% for investors.</p>
<p>With the launch of JTO tokens, Jito Foundation seeks to empower “community members to have a direct impact on the decision-making and direction of the Jito Network,” the organization said.</p>
<p>As part of the Jito Foundation, Jito Labs constructs infrastructure aimed at alleviating the adverse effects of maximum extractable value on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-gains-6-65-in-third-week-of-november-will-the-bullish-momentum-continue.htm">Solana</a>.</p>
<p>Solana Foundation said last month that <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/254589/solana-foundation-says-nearly-a-third-of-stake-running-through-jito-labs-client">nearly a third</a> of its stake is running through the Jito Labs client, while the Jito Foundation revealed in its announcement that the Jito MEV network of validators is currently being utilized by over 40% of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-shows-remarkable-performance-but-attention-turns-to-a-rising-newcomer.htm">Solana</a> network&#8217;s stake weight.</p>
<p>10% of the tokens will be distributed as an airdrop to Jito community members, the Jito Foundation added, acknowledging its members’ contributions to bootstrapping the network and ensuring their participation in governance right from the outset.</p>
<p>The Foundation is overseen by two independent Directors, Matt Shaw and Glenn Kennedy, and a supervisor provided by FFP Corporate Services. Webslinger, an advisory firm specializing in prominent crypto projects, will serve as the DAO administrator.</p>
<p>Token holders will wield ultimate control over the Foundation, possessing the authority to remove both the supervisor and the two independent directors. Jito noted that its Foundation would release regular transparency reports to keep stakeholders informed.</p>
<p>Jito Foundation will be governed by its Constitution, Bylaws and Articles of Association and Memorandum of Association, with the company promising to provide further detail when possible.</p>
<p>Jito Labs investors include Solana Ventures and Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko. Last year, the company <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jito-labs-raises-usd-10m-from-multicoin-capital-framework-ventures-build-performant-mev-infrastructure-for-solana.htm">raised $10 million</a> in a Series A funding round led by Multicoin Capital and Framework Ventures, with other investors including Alameda Research, Solana Ventures, Delphi Digital and Robot Ventures.</p>

<p>The decentralized exchange protocol recovered the funds following a security attack last week.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-exploited-in-46-million-attack-due-to-infinite-money-glitch.htm">initial attack</a> last week, KyberSwap said that it had lost a total of $47 million from its concentrating liquidity pools.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a portion of the funds recovery was successfully achieved through negotiations with the operators of front-running bots. Approximately $5.7 million in cryptocurrency, extracted from KyberSwap pools on the Polygon and Avalanche networks during the hack, has been reclaimed, the exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1728800315955437743">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>Under the negotiated agreement, the operators of the bots committed to returning 90% of the embezzled funds to a designated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-announces-first-ever-arb-token-liquidity-pools-liquidity-mining-trading-campaigns-arbitrum.htm">KyberSwap</a> address on the Polygon network. As an incentive, a 10% bounty was offered to the operators for their cooperation in the recovery process, meaning KyberSwap will recover $4.67 million in total. </p>
<p>According to KyberSwap’s update, the recovered funds include 361.92 axl-wstETH ($870.5k), 441.8 WETH ($919k), 261.5 wstETH (~$624k), 711,430.9 WMATIC (~$547.8k), 443,011.6 USDT (~$443k), 385,630.7 USDC (~$385.6k), and 65,130 USDT (~$65.1k).</p>
<p>The hacker specifically targeted KyberSwap’s Elastic pools, affecting funds across various blockchains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<p>This negotiation stands apart from discussions with the primary event&#8217;s hacker, who had previously expressed a willingness to engage in talks. Although the team had proposed a white hat bounty, it appears that progress in those negotiations has not been achieved thus far.</p>
<p>The hacker exploited a vulnerability associated with the tick interval boundaries in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/proof-of-trust-btcx-consider-ipos-kyberswap-leaves-malta-mor-5554.htm">KyberSwap’s</a> concentrated liquidity pools. The hackers used the vulnerability to artificially double the liquidity and drain the pools of their assets.</p>
<p>After this initial recovery of funds, KyberSwap reassured its users that it would continue to do anything possible to retrieve the rest of the stolen money. </p>
<p>“Following this recovery of users’ funds from the frontrun bots, we will continue to support law enforcement and cybersecurity on track down and recovery of users’ funds from the perpetrator of the exploit attack,” KyberSwap said. </p>
