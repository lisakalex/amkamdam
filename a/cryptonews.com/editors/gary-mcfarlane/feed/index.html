<p><i>Wednesday, December 6th, 2023</i> – The Bitcoin price is powering higher to trade above $43,000, its highest level since April 2022, igniting a firestorm of interest in Bitcoin cloud-mining innovator <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a>, which has raised $5 million from investors with more to come.</p>
<p>Market watchers are expecting Bitcoin to surpass the $50,000-mark by the end of the month and to continue in that bullish vein going into the new year, as a spot Bitcoin ETF approval beckons and the top cryptocurrency’s block reward halving event takes place in late April 2024.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is benefiting from the fair wind lifting Bitcoin. The new token is especially well-positioned due to its direct relationship with the Bitcoin ecosystem through the unique tokenized way in which it mines BTC via the cloud.</p>
<p>Priced at $0.0121 in Stage 12 of its ICO, there is no time to lose before the price increases in the next stage to $0.0122, which comes in under five days or possibly sooner if the raise goal of $5,828,309 is hit before then.</p>
<p>Because of its low-cap pricing and upside potential, an investment of $1,000 could be turned into $1 million if the coin returns 1,000x. </p>
<p>Given the 20,000%-plus returns seen on various meme coins in recent times, $BTCMTX with its unique use case and Bitcoin association warrants pride of place in a diversified crypto portfolio.</p>

<h2>Good news for Bitcoin and crypto is good news for Bitcoin Minetrix </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Good news for Bitcoin and crypto keeps piling up. The latest comes from the Swiss city of Lugano where you can now pay your taxes in Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, France’s Société Générale has become the first big bank to issue a stablecoin, and to offer it for sale on a crypto exchange (Bitstamp) in another signal that crypto will be mainstreaming in a big way going into the new year. The stablecoin is backed by euros. </p>
<p>Although Bitcoin is not involved, it is a vote of confidence in blockchain technology and the potential of tokenization to make trading traditional assets cheaper and much more efficient, while holding out the possibility of opening up hitherto hard-to-access markets to retail investors. </p>
<p>What’s more, all this good news comes before any of the 13 spot Bitcoin ETFs gain approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>On that, BlackRock updated its S-1 SEC filing yesterday, revealing that its iShares Bitcoin Trust has received seed funding of $100,000 so it can issue the first units of its ETF, subject to its approval. </p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence analysts say there is a 90% chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval and this latest news from BlackRock may have nudged the dial closer to 100%.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Minetrix revolutionizes mining and could see price appreciation in multiples of 100x as bull run takes hold</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Running on Ethereum, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> rewards stakers of its native $BTCMTX token with cloud mining credits. By doing so, it opens up a passive income stream offering a percentage of the mining revenue based on the share of cloud mining credits which can be exchanged for cloud mining power.</p>
<p>Interest in Bitcoin is surging as a new bull run begins. Old hands and new entrants into the crypto markets are searching out ways to gain exposure to the Bitcoin melt-up that doesn’t require either waiting to buy a spot Bitcoin ETF or purchasing the coin directly.</p>
<p>There are currently many eye-watering price predictions to pick from for Bitcoin. They range from $120,000 by the end of next year, according to Standard Chartered, to as much as $1.48 million by 2030 according to Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood. </p>
<p>However, savvy investors know there are other ways to secure returns on investment that could be multiples of both of those example Bitcoin target prices.</p>
<p>Although a crypto bull run typically begins with Bitcoin leading the way, as its dominance of the market begins to top out, market participants start to focus on the value differential offered by alternative coins with arguably more tempting risk-reward profiles. Bitcoin Minetrix is one such coin.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Minetrix makes cloud mining BTC easy, safe and secure</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin Minetrix’s advantages over buying mining rigs and trying to set up a business by yourself are obvious in terms of the far lower upfront capital outlay involved in cloud mining. </p>
<p>There’s also no need to worry about getting to grips with the complicated intricacies of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
<p>But while the pay-as-you-go approach of the cloud mining model is attractive, it has its downsides – that is until <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> appeared on the scene to offer a different approach. </p>
<p>Cloud mining, unfortunately has developed a bad reputation for acting as a fraud magnet. </p>
<p>A quick Google and it won’t take long before coming across a story about victims handing over hard cash for a cloud mining contract, only for no mining rewards ever to be earned and distributed by the service purveyor.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is fraud-resistant because everything is on-chain. The system’s stake-to-mine smart contract handles all of the cloud credits and allocation to mining and the time period over which mining is to take place, all set by the user via their own bespoke dashboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-140154" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701954097-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-12-56-51.png" alt="" width="1484" height="974" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701954097-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-12-56-51.png 1484w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701954097-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-12-56-51-300x197.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701954097-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-12-56-51-1024x672.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701954097-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-12-56-51-768x504.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701954097-screenshot-2023-12-07-at-12-56-51-150x98.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1484px) 100vw, 1484px" /></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Minetrix strengthens the Bitcoin network in a win for crypto and your investment returns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Transparency and efficiency combine to deliver an easy-to-use product that threatens to unleash revolutionary change in the cloud mining space.</p>
<p>A byproduct of this near-frictionless route into mining Bitcoin is the way in which it can help to grow the hash power (computing resource) of the network, making it even more secure and decentralized.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Bitcoin’s journey to transform money, it was possible to mine the digital currency on a laptop, but those days are long gone. However, with Bitcoin Minetrix the door has been reopened for the little guy.</p>
<p>Tokenized Bitcoin cloud mining is a business model that is sure to gain traction. </p>
<p>Its ability to yield substantial gains from modest capital inflows positions it as a promising investment. Presale buyers can start earning a yield today of 121% APY. At the time of writing 343 million $BTCMTX tokens have been staked.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Minetrix FOMO is growing online</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bolstering a sense of FOMO is the buzz in crypto media. Michael Wrubel explains to his 310,000 YouTube subscribers why he is bullish on Bitcoin Minetrix. There have also been ringing endorsements from crypto influencers such as <a href="https://youtu.be/37ne69bgi4c?si=Shg1s8emMINZAatM">Jacob Crypto Bury</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fNrRPkRvG0">Crypto Lab</a>, but do your own research.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bitcoin Minetrix: Why I Am BULLISH on BTCMTX" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cr48YdiTmUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Keep abreast of all the Bitcoin Minetrix presale news and product developments on the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix">Telegram channel</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HDSx3AQWwV">Discord server</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinminetrix?s=21">X (Twitter)</a>.</p>
<p>As the Bitcoin price continues its ascent, Bitcoin alternatives will come to the fore. But instead of picking Bitcoin derivatives such as Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV, why not consider a coin that brings something genuinely new to the table with its innovative value proposition? </p>
<p>If you want a combination of capital growth and an income stream, then a relatively modest contribution to the Bitcoin Minetrix presale could go a long way to serving up tasty ROI. </p>

<p><i>Thursday, November 24, 2023</i> – The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount is evaporating and the new Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) has attracted $2 million from traders in the latest two indications that bets on the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF are piling up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings, Michael Novogratz, believes that a spot Bitcoin ETF approval will see the Bitcoin price return to its all-time high near $69,000 printed in November 2021. </p>
<p>“We will see a pretty successful shift of psychology when the government says you are allowed to buy Bitcoin,” says Novogratz, who expects billions of dollars of new money currently sitting on the side-lines to flood into the market.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence analysts reckon there is a 90% chance of a Bitcoin ETF being approved. It is this expectation that has seen the price of Bitcoin double this year to outperform all other asset classes.</p>
<p>The new Bitcoin ETF Token is gaining traction as the only cryptocurrency designed specifically to reward its holders when a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved. </p>
<p>Its value is tied to real-world milestone events related to Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETF products, such as their approval, launch, assets under management, and trading volumes. </p>
<p>These milestone achievements act as trigger points for burns that drive up the value of the $BTCETF token, which is proving to make the new cryptocurrency one of the smartest ways to play the Bitcoin ETF investment theme.</p>
<p>For those who are able to access the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust over-the-counter market through their broker of choice, this provides an alternative approach for playing this market. </p>
<p>At the beginning of this year the discount was -46%, but today it is just -8%. The discount measures how much less than the net asset value (the value of the Bitcoin it holds) the shares are trading for. If the trend continues or speeds up, then GBTC could start to trade at a premium again, as it has done in bull markets. </p>
<p>However, the downside of the GBTC bet is that when the trust is converted to an ETF from its current closed-end structure, funds are likely to exit as profit-taking kicks in.</p>
<p>Also, to the extent to which it trades at a premium, this has been an add-on price that institutional investors have been willing to pay in order to secure a regulated route into the crypto asset class. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF will wipe out the rationale for the premium, if GBTC were ever to trade at a premium again. </p>
<p>Market participants expect the spot Bitcoin ETF to be approved as soon as January 10 2024, so there is not much time for GBTC to flip to premium pricing.</p>
<p>With $BTCETF there are none of these issues. On the contrary, because the coin has been designed to leverage approval and other product development events, it will continue to grow as a value proposition for traders and investors.</p>
<p>The $BTCETF ICO began a couple of weeks ago but there are less than 48 hours to go before the next staged price rise, from $0.0060 to $0.0062. </p>
<p>However, the current Stage 6 price ends when $2,498,109 is reached, which could come sooner than the allotted time remaining, increasing the FOMO in the market. There are 10 price stages in all on the road to the $5 million hard cap. As the run rate for the ICO accelerates there is no time to lose, but prospective buyers must conduct their own due diligence.</p>
<p>Such is the excitement in mainstream finance that every week a new issuer enters the spot Bitcoin ETF fray. Swiss asset manager Pando Asset has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2001771/000182912623007712/pandoasset_s1.htm">filed an S-1 form</a> at the Securities and Exchange Commission for the Pando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered Bank analyst Geoff Kendrick has set a price target of $100,000 for Bitcoin by year-end 2024 as optimism that the next halving cycle bull run is starting to take root alongside the ETF furore.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin ETF Token is the only crypto that directly rewards owners as Bitcoin ETFs are approved</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the $BTCETF token initially includes a burn tax when the coin launches on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The tax decreases by 1% as each milestone is achieved. </p>
<p>There is also a separate burn mechanism of up to 25% of the total supply in order to boost the deflationary scarcity of the coin. 5% of the total supply is burned for every $BTCETF milestone that is passed.</p>
<p>These two mechanisms mean that owners of $BTCETF  have the most tightly aligned rewards of any cryptocurrency for the spot Bitcoin ETF growth theme.</p>

<h2><strong>Buy and stake $BTCETF today and earn 120% APY</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
$BTCETF tokens can be bought in presale today and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">staked to earn</a> an annual percentage yield (APY) of 120% at the time of writing. </p>
<p>There have been 212 million $BTCETF tokens deposited into the staking smart contract to date, in a testament to the popularity of this passive income route. Staking rewards are distributed in $BTCETF over a five-year period. Each ETH block produced generates a reward of 119 $BTCETF.</p>

<h2><strong>YouTube crypto expert on $BTCETF: “This honestly looks appealing”</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There’s a bandwagon rolling for Bitcoin ETF Token as evidenced by the number of top influencers that are getting behind the coin. </p>
<p>Sampling just some of the media coverage, there’s influential crypto YouTuber Matthew Perry who has told his 200,000+ subscribers that he likes the concept behind the $BTCETF token – <a href="https://youtu.be/v7zuwvFZ-Ds?si=VlH0lTFKLzKK9Tid">“This honestly looks appealing,”</a> he says. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138040" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701353555-unnamed-2023-11-30t141220-880.png" alt="" width="702" height="400" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701353555-unnamed-2023-11-30t141220-880.png 702w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701353555-unnamed-2023-11-30t141220-880-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p>Other YouTube crypto experts who like what they see include Michael Wrubel with 310,000 subscribers. He is <a href="https://youtu.be/-Kg6r3h7Ubs?si=F9gTFuQ2nOwxu6q1">super bullish on $BTCETF</a>, as he explains in his day-old video which has already amassed 21,000 views.</p>
<p>Austin Hilton is also blown away by the coin’s concept and tells his 235k subscribers that he thinks it has a unique use case because it is <a href="https://youtu.be/xyKxJ5iotm4?si=k1nf_rqsVBb9vBT2">“like nothing you have ever seen.”</a></p>
<p>Yet another crypto analyst on YouTube tells his viewers to get ready to <a href="https://youtu.be/GbPkmeUKDo0?si=PCxX4qHwXCD76SBa">ride an explosive wave</a> by investing in $BTCETF.</p>
<h2><strong>Use $BTCETF to gain direct exposure to a pivotal moment in the Bitcoin market</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It cannot be underestimated just how seismic a spot Bitcoin ETF approval will be for the crypto industry and its markets. For the first time, ordinary retail investors, as well as professional traders and institutions, will be able to gain regulated and cheap access to Bitcoin. </p>
<p>In addition, asset managers and financial advisors will soon be able to allocate client funds to Bitcoin without having to enter the futures markets or worry about custody and regulations. </p>
<p>If the advent of a spot Bitcoin ETF is anything like as impactful as the launch of the first gold exchange-traded fund in 2003, then hundreds of billions of dollars could flow into the market in the coming years. In the inception year for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Galaxy Digital is expecting inflows of $14 billion. </p>
<p>Thanks to $BTCETF, market participants don’t need to wait for the launch day of the first spot Bitcoin ETF  in the US to get exposure to this inflection point in the crypto market. Instead, investors can buy <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> today to align their portfolio with the historic Bitcoin bull run to come.  </p>
<p>To purchase $BTCETF, connect a crypto wallet funded with ETH or USDT or use a bank card to make your contribution.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, November 23, 2023</i> – The settlement of criminal charges against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ) has sent shockwaves through the crypto industry, but the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval have increased, which is good news for new coin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF).</p>
<p>$BTCETF has raised $1.4 million in days and its future value is tightly aligned with the price explosion expected to accompany the approval and launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the lowest available price for the innovative new token, buyers will need to move quickly as the current ICO stage ends in less than 48 hours, after which the price rises in Stage 5 of the ICO from $0.0056 to $0.0058.</p>
<p>With Binance’s global exchange shuttered in the US, a clear and present bad actor in the market, in the eyes of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at least, has been removed from the scene.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price traded erratically as news seeped out about the settlement. BTC is down around 2% to currently trade at $36,650, still within the trading range of the past week or so. The main loser as far as top cryptocurrencies are concerned has been BNB, the native coin of the BNB exchange ecosystem, which is down 10% at $235.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETF Token by design will be a major beneficiary as way ahead for spot Bitcoin ETF is cleared after Biance’s demise</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin ETF Token which, by design, ties its value to the progress of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval and future product performance, is set to reap the rewards from the latest turn of events.</p>
<p>Although the SEC civil charges against Binance are still on the table after the US Department of Justice settlement, in which Binance and CZ admitted to anti-money laundering and sanctions-busting crimes, a significant step forward has been made in cleaning up what the SEC alleges is weak market surveillance and an environment conducive to price manipulation in the crypto sector.</p>
<p>Some crypto commentators have gone so far as to float the idea that giant asset manager BlackRock, which has submitted a spot Bitcoin ETF for approval by the SEC, has had a hand in pushing the DOJ into filing criminal charges against Binance and CZ.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow!! Did BlackRock take down Binance? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/yKlxRKXQqC">pic.twitter.com/yKlxRKXQqC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1727028621368557916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Although such claims are highly likely to be wide of the mark, BlackRock is known to be well-connected to the institutions of power in Washington DC. The connections in the form of the individuals, who have swapped between the various financial regulators and the firms that they regulate, have long been a source of discussion and claims of conflicts of interests.</p>
<p>Whatever the extent of informal connections between the two spheres, BlackRock and other big players in the traditional financial world that have decided to enter crypto, are likely to be pleased that Binance is out of the way.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">DOJ points out</a> in its charges against Binance, it was able to grow its global business on the back of a large US customer base for its unregistered trading businesses. Now, with Binance out of the picture – although it&#8217;s much smaller Binance.US business which is slowly atrophying, remains open – the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity will have one less potential competitor to worry about.</p>
<h2>Is DOJ and the SEC clearing the way for TradeFi to enter crypto with less competition?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
And it is not just Binance that has been laid low. The regulators have thrown down the gauntlet to all crypto exchanges operating in the US: they must register with the requisite regulatory authorities as exchanges, broker-dealers, settlement houses and custodians.</p>
<p>Yesterday Kraken was charged by the SEC with operating an unregistered securities business. This emerging regulation-through-enforcement landscape puts TradeFi new entrants into crypto at an advantage over the pioneers that opened up crypto trading in the first place.</p>
<p>As the dust settles and the bombshell reverberations subside, the implications of the Binance settlement will assert themselves in a positive way for spot Bitcoin ETF prospects.</p>
<p>Another beneficiary, counterintuitively perhaps to the line of argument above, is Coinbase. Coinbase is a very different exchange to Binance, in that it is probably the most regulatory-aligned of the exchanges operating in the US or elsewhere, despite its current legal dispute with the SEC.</p>
<p>Don’t be too surprised when a settlement emerges between the SEC and the largest US exchange.</p>
<p>Coinbase has already been selected by BlackRock as its partner in a recently agreed surveillance-sharing agreement. But the relationships between TradeFi and Coinbase are much more extensive than the BlackRock relationship.</p>
<p>Among Coinbase’s top shareholders are fund behemoths Vanguard and Fidelity, as well as BlackRock and Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ETF Token enables traders to position today for future Bitcoin ETF theme profits</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It is not easy to position investment portfolios to capture the value that the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF promises to unleash. For example, should you buy Bitcoin in the open market or wait until the first spot ETF is launched and invest in that vehicle?</p>
<p>There are also scammy coins popping up hoping to steal money from investors, such as the recently launched $ETF token that has pulled the rug on early investors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-135694" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740340-screenshot-2023-11-23-at-11-50-47.png" alt="" width="1430" height="1146" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740340-screenshot-2023-11-23-at-11-50-47.png 1430w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740340-screenshot-2023-11-23-at-11-50-47-300x240.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740340-screenshot-2023-11-23-at-11-50-47-1024x821.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740340-screenshot-2023-11-23-at-11-50-47-768x615.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1430px) 100vw, 1430px" /></p>
<p>Thankfully, the advent of the Bitcoin ETF Token makes investor decision-making much easier. Contribute to the $BTCETF Token presale today and you will be exposed to an asset that is 100% aligned with the upside expected from the steady flow of ETF approvals coming down the pipe.</p>
<p>One prolific YouTube crypto analyst renowned for his ICO coverage, believes the $BTCETF Token could be a <a href="https://youtu.be/fb7xFdKLykg">10x opportunity</a> for early investors.</p>
<p>$BTCETF tokens are available to be purchased in presale today. Buyers can start earning immediately by staking to receive an annual percentage yield, currently of 184%.</p>
<p>There are 144 million $BTCETF tokens already deposited into the staking smart contract. The APY is calculated dynamically and rewards are disbursed over a five-year period.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> links its valuation to the lifecycle of the spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>For instance, the burn mechanism is tied to real-world events related to spot Bitcoin ETF news flow, where milestones such as approval and launch dates and the level of assets under management (AUM), trigger burn events.</p>
<p>For example, when the trading volume of $BTCETF reaches $100 million the transaction tax reduces from 5% to 4%. There are other clever milestones, such as when the first spot Bitcoin ETF is approved the transaction tax is reduced from 4% to 3%.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinETF</a> introduces a 5% transaction burn tax, gradually reducing the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Token?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Token</a> supply.</p>
<p>Targeting a 25% token burn as milestones are reached.</p>
<p>This strategy aims to reward holders and alleviate selling pressure with a deflationary approach. <a href="https://t.co/UiheUjIZB8">pic.twitter.com/UiheUjIZB8</a></p>

<p>$BTCETF is the perfect vehicle to position portfolios to profit from the spot Bitcoin ETF FOMO.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token also has a deflationary burn mechanism that is price-supportive because it reduces the total token supply. $BTCETF launches with a 5% burn on all transactions. Up to 25% of the total token supply is eligible to be burned.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token has a total supply of 2.1 billion (2,100,000,000). The project’s website has a helpful newsfeed to keep you up to date with all the news related to Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin price.</p>

<p>The $BTCETF token is probably one of the smartest and cheapest ways to capture the alpha returns promised by the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The token is in presale today and only costs $0.0056. There is a low hard cap total of $4,956,000 million, which is adding to the FOMO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/bitcoin-trades-past-36-000-on-possible-etf-investment-approval">Bloomberg Intelligence analysts</a> James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, believe the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval are 90%.</p>
<p>On January 10, the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF comes up for consideration by the SEC and the outcome of its deliberations will be closely watched by the market.</p>
<p>There’s no time to lose to position investment portfolios for what could be one of the most consequential moments in crypto history. <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is an excellent choice to help investors gain exposure to the profitable spot Bitcoin ETF investment theme, but do your own research.</p>

<p><i>Saturday November 18th 2023</i> – Move over Rollbit as GameFi sensation <a href="https://tg.casino/">TG.Casino</a> raises $2.5 million after raising $300,000 in one day, leaving less than 50% of $TGC tokens available to buy in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p>The breakout of GameFi tokens such as Rollbit’s $RLB has been one of the key outperformers in the 2023 crypto market. Now TG.Casino is set to follow suit with an ecosystem that beats out the competition.</p>
<p>TG.Casino has many advantages over Rollbit and other gaming competitors. For starter, staking means that unlike with $RLB you can earn passive income by holding and staking $TGC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, TG.Casino’s 40% burn is price-supportive and a percentage of daily profits goes towards token buybacks, which, in turn, funds the staking rewards income.</p>
<p>There are only three days to go before the presale price of the $TGC token increases, so there’s no time to lose to grab the lowest available prices. The token price rises by $0.005 every five days until the hard cap of $5 million is reached.</p>

<h2>Rollbit whales are selling $RLB to buy and stake TG.Casino ($TGC) – maybe you should too</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Endorsements for $TGC are rolling in from key opinion leaders (KOLs) and influencers in the Web3 space, evident in a flurry of activity on social media.</p>
<p>Just some of the crypto notables who have taken notice of TG.Casino are <a href="https://twitter.com/EricCryptoman">Eric Cryptoman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IHunt100xGems">Erik Stevens</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/realdogen">Dogen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Poe_Ether">Poe</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptotalkman/">CTM</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sibeleth">Sibel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cheatcoiner">CheatCoiner</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wizardofsoho">Wizard of Soho</a>.</p>
<p>Underpinning the explosion of interest on crypto X/Twitter is a discernible positive shift in the investment backdrop for TG.Casino, with the Rollbit community starting to stir.</p>
<p>On-chain analysis shows that $150,000 has recently been diverted from Rollbit into TG.Casino by one whale, in a deepening of a rotation trend that has fuelled the $300,000 inflows in the past 24 hours mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>This particular Rollbit whale made one transaction in which $50,000 worth of $TGC was purchased in the TG.Casino presale and immediately staked.</p>
<p>The funding wallet address is shown below:</p>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x4272c884eb01147588c38a92fc1a22455013ca7c">https://etherscan.io/address/0x4272c884eb01147588c38a92fc1a22455013ca7c</a></p>
<p>The commitment from the whale is a major signifier of the strengthening in the position of $TGC in the market, contributing to an acceleration in the run rate for the ICO.</p>
<p>Erik Stevens, spotted the whale move and let the cryptoverse know all about it:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It is great that whales are taking notice of $TGC’s potential but what is perhaps even more significant is the rotation out of Rollbit and directly into TG.Casino that is taking place.</p>
<p>On-chain data shows that the whale in question sold part of his/her $RLB bag in order to buy and stake $TGC, as can be seen at the Etherscan link:</p>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xaa48d06c2c800f4f3d0065d64e63bb6d5c713ec99ad6ef01f7a7d5b5c26ec279">https://etherscan.io/tx/0xaa48d06c2c800f4f3d0065d64e63bb6d5c713ec99ad6ef01f7a7d5b5c26ec279</a></p>
<p>TG.Casino and its native token $TGC is at a tipping point. Clearly, whale investors have been doing their research and like what they see.</p>
<h2>TG.Casino’s competitive advantages over Rollbit and other competitors is fuelling rapid growth</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Telegram messaging app is the go-to tool of the cryptoverse and has grown to become much more than just a messaging app because of its powerful bot features.</p>
<p>The frictionless way in which users of apps on its platform can be accessed means TG.Casino is quickly adding to its user base. There is no KYC required for Telegram-based customers.</p>
<p>TG.Casino’s brand recognition is taking off in the DeFi Gaming space, with competitors like Rollbit, and others, looking over their shoulders at the new competitor eating their lunch.</p>
<p>The competitiveness of the TG.Casino offering means it is a superior product to not just Rollbit, but to market leader Stake.com.</p>
<p>Unlike Stake.com, TG.Casino has its own token, and offers staking, passive income and higher roller rewards.</p>
<p>Putting some numbers on the competitive offering from TG.Casino, if you buy and stale $TGC today, you can currently earn an annual percentage yield of 225%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-133234 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316219-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-58-53.png" alt="rollbit competitor tg.casino - staking" width="1630" height="364" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316219-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-58-53.png 1630w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316219-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-58-53-300x67.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316219-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-58-53-1024x229.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316219-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-58-53-768x172.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316219-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-58-53-1536x343.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1630px) 100vw, 1630px" /></p>
<p>In addition, TG.Casino now has 6,450 members of its <a href="https://t.co/g2Xm298LUi">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<h2>$TGC now fully integrated into the casino platform as growth booms on 200% rakeback and 25% net cash-back</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
User growth has accelerated since TG Casino went live and the token was fully integrated into the platform. Helping to fuel growth has been the 200% rakeback bonus up-to 10 ETH.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-133235 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316251-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-59-05.png" alt="rollbit competitor tg.casino" width="556" height="992" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316251-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-59-05.png 556w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700316251-screenshot-2023-11-18-at-13-59-05-168x300.png 168w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></p>
<p>Now fully integrated into the TG Casino platform, a huge demand-side incentive has fostered renewed interest in the $TGC token courtesy of a unique cashback opportunity.</p>
<p>Players are able to place bets across the TG Casino bot using most leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), players betting using the $TGC token are eligible for a 25% net cash-back on losses.</p>
<p>This added measure not only incentivizes buy pressure in the $TGC tokenomics, but also offers you the opportunity to balance your high-risk wagers with a layer of protection on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Keeping you in the game for longer, crypto gambling enthusiasts are now flocking to the TG Casino platform to make the most of their gambling balance.</p>

<h2>Forget $RLB, 100x gains could be incoming for $TGC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to coinmarketcap, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rollbit-crypto-casino-going-zero-rlb-price-tumbles-22-as-fresh-telegram-gambling-coin-nets-15-million-investments.htm">Rollbit coin $RLB</a> is up 5,813% since launch and on present form there is no reason why TG.Casino can’t emulate or beat that performance.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, therefore, leading crypto influencer Crypto V.O reckons TG.Casino is ‘the next 100x presale gem’:</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This the Next 100x Pre-sale Gem?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvui0-kksqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Crypto market participants are looking to TG Casino’s $TGC token to match the best of the returns seen elsewhere in GameFi, as the gambling market goes from strength to strength, making a tier-1 centralized exchange listing later this year only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Also helping to encourage buyers is $TGC’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAz5Z8dG0xuN-qgYRdJOA95clI7-YYGy/view?pli=1">contract audit by Coinsult</a>, which found no significant issues.</p>
<p>To make sure you don’t miss any important milestones and product developments, join the project community on <a href="https://t.me/TG_CasinoCommunity">TG Casino Telegram</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/TGCasino_"> X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>
<p>GameFi is the hottest sector in crypto right now and TG.Casino is increasingly being seen as the next Rollbit, so an investment today could go a very long way, but do your own research.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, November 16th, 2023</i> – Two days after launching, $ETHETF coin has announced a 21 million token burn program, reducing total token supply by 21%.</p>
<p>The price of $ETHETF jumped 25% on the news to $0.01601 and is now up 12% at $0.1448. News of the burn program comes at the same time as fund giant <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2000638/000143774923032233/iset20231114_s1.htm">BlackRock officially filed</a> its application to issue a spot Ethereum ETF.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ETHETFToken/status/1725145844729680022">X/Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/c/2016078299/3608">Telegram</a> posts, the ETHETF Token team has said that the tokens will be burned over a 21-day period, starting with <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd423c8aa50808a4c957e75cee8729b515d8498f6644ff2ebec8812faa951b89e">1 million tokens burned today</a>.</p>
<p>Burning is a method whereby tokens are sent to a null address on the blockchain that only has a receive function, effectively removing from circulation tokens sent to it.</p>
<p>By removing 21% of the total supply it helps to boost the price of the remaining tokens. For those considering buying the token, the burn program is a strong demonstration of the team’s commitment to the project and its intention to continue seeking out ways to enhance the value of the token.</p>
<h2>21% supply burn + 2% transaction buy burn = $ETHETF price pump</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Linked to the spot Ethereum ETF theme, $ETHETF already has a burn mechanism, whereby each buy attracts a 2% token burn. These buy burns will cease when a spot Ethereum ETF is launched. Today’s news of the 21% burn program hugely buttresses the value-creating deflationary properties of the token.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in another sign of the team’s commitment to the project, more than half a million dollars of liquidity was locked. This move makes trading much smoother by facilitating both smaller and larger trades. It also is something that traders will look out for when seeking reassurance that a project is not a rug pull.</p>
<p>$ETHETF now trades on the V2 and V3 liquidity pool versions of the Uniswap decentralized exchange. V3 has locked liquidity of $572k while V2 has liquidity of $241k.</p>
<p>The token has a market cap of $1.35 million and 405 holders, meaning it is early days for the coin with plenty of scope for upside progress. Following the strategic move by the team, the next three weeks will be price-supportive, as, no doubt, will be the news flow.</p>

<h2>BlackRock Ethereum ETF Fever can push ETHETF Token price higher 10x or more</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BlackRock’s Form-S1 registration filing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) states that the fund’s name will be iShares Ethereum Trust, just as its Bitcoin stablemate will be named the iShares Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>When the largest asset manager in the financial industry comes calling, it is time to sit up and take notice for all those not already inside the crypto tent.</p>
<p>BlackRock doesn’t make applications for ETFs unless it thinks it can gain approval for them. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-14/grayscale-s-bitcoin-etf-push-what-s-next-after-sec-doesn-t-appeal-court-ruling">Bloomberg analysts</a> put the chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved at 90%. If the Bitcoin variant succeeds then an Ethereum product is likely a shoo-in.</p>
<p>The SEC has previously failed to approve spot Bitcoin products because of the lack of surveillance in the market and the dangers of price manipulation.</p>
<p>However, in a recent court ruling the judge called out the SEC for being inconsistent and wrong by approving a futures product that depends on the same underlying pricing environment while applying a higher bar to a spot product.</p>
<p>On the second point about surveillance, BlackRock is teaming up with Coinbase in a ‘surveillance-sharing agreement’ to explicitly address those concerns.</p>
<p>A steady flow of corroborating nuggets of news is expected over the coming days and weeks, all of which will reinforce the value of the $ETHETF token, making 10x gains a reasonable probability for this ETH derivative coin.</p>

<h2>FOMO will grow as spot Ethereum ETF news flow hots up</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All those looking for a way to play the spot Ethereum ETF theme are highly likely to come across ETHETF Token while conducting their due diligence research.</p>
<p>Choosing to introduce the supplementary burn program at this time is a masterstroke. There is nothing like rising prices to encourage more buyers and further rises in price. Market participants watching this price action will be likely to succumb to FOMO.</p>
<p>For traders and investors hunting for a way to leverage the spot Ethereum ETF frenzy, $ETHETF presents a solid way to get ahead of the crowd. It is the perfect way to ‘buy the rumor’. And because $ETHETF buyers are getting in early, well before the ETF itself is launched, they are protected against any temporary ‘sell the news’ sell-off.</p>
<p>Ethereum is the most-used blockchain for running applications based on smart contracts and as such is the base layer of Web3 decentralized applications. There are many other blockchain ecosystems vying to be Ethereum-killers, but none comes close to Ethereum.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to wait for the approval by the SEC and the subsequent launch of a spot Ethereum ETF, because $ETHETF is already trading on decentralized exchanges, enabling smart traders to get exposure to the Ethereum ETF investment theme immediately.</p>
<p>To purchase the ETHETF Token, connect a crypto wallet to Uniswap, copy and paste in the contract address to make sure you are buying the correct coin, and then make your purchase. Be sure to have at least $20 spare in your wallet to pay the transaction gas fee. You can also buy the token using the Uniswap widget available on the ETHETF Token website.</p>

<p>A new cryptocurrency launched today called <a href="https://ethetftoken.io/">$ETHETF Token</a> and it is the go-to digital asset to capitalize on approval of a spot Ethereum ETF from fund giant BlackRock.</p>
<p>Launched at 1pm GMT on Uniswap the price of the coin has rocketed 186% within the first 10 minutes of trading, currently priced at $0.02834. $ETHETF could easily 10x today as news of the launch spreads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-131096" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968185-img_0224.jpeg" alt="" width="1060" height="458" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968185-img_0224.jpeg 1060w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968185-img_0224-300x130.jpeg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968185-img_0224-1024x442.jpeg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968185-img_0224-768x332.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1060px) 100vw, 1060px" /></p>
<p>News that the world’s largest asset manager is planning to launch a spot Ethereum ETF, sent the price of ETH rocking through the important $2,000 level.</p>
<p>BlackRock’s move has added to the excitement surrounding the likely approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF to be made available to investors in the US.</p>
<p>On November 9, 2023, the <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/rulebook/nasdaq/filings/SR-NASDAQ-2023-045.pdf">official filing</a> for BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF was made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Nasdaq. A few days before, BlockRock had registered a corporate entity in Delaware named iShares Ethereum Trust.</p>
<p>When the Delaware news broke, the price of ETH shot up 3% and then pumped again when the filing was confirmed. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,048, gaining 10% since the Delaware registration and the SEC filing took place.</p>
<p>Ethereum is the most-used blockchain for running applications based on smart contracts and as such is the base layer of Web3 decentralized applications. There are many other blockchain ecosystems vying to be Ethereum killers, but none comes close to Ethereum.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to wait for the approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and their subsequent launch, because ETHETF is already trading on decentralized exchanges, enabling savvy investors to get exposure to the Ethereum ETF investment theme and capture the positive returns that have already started to flow.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-131098" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968254-img_0225.jpeg" alt="" width="1083" height="646" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968254-img_0225.jpeg 1083w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968254-img_0225-300x179.jpeg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968254-img_0225-1024x611.jpeg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699968254-img_0225-768x458.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1083px) 100vw, 1083px" /></p>
<h2>An Ethereum ETF will take crypto mainstream and ETHETF Token lets you get in early</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Just as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF will provide unprecedented validation for the top digital currency, approval of an Ethereum ETF will have a similar effect.</p>
<p>By providing a regulated way to gain exposure to the crypto asset class, exchange-traded funds promise to transform the existing investment landscape.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds track the price of an underlying asset by replicating its price performance. This can often be achieved by mirroring an index such as the S&amp;P500. To achieve this end, a fund would need to buy a weighting of the 500 companies that comprise the S&amp;P500 or use derivatives to achieve the same result.</p>
<p>Applying that to ETH, it would mean issuers must buy the asset on the open market or over-the-counter, thus increasing the demand for the token.</p>
<p>ETFs exploded onto the financial scene when the first gold products appeared. Gold was the ideal candidate for the ETF treatment. By tracking an index of the gold price ordinary people were able to gain exposure to the precious metal without having to worry about custody expenses and accessing liquidity to trade their bullion.</p>
<p>What ETFs have done for commodities, equities, fixed income and other asset classes, they can also do for crypto. Opening up cheap and regulated access to the two most valuable cryptocurrencies could see a wall of new money flowing into the markets.</p>
<h2>ETHETF price is head for the moon as Ethereum goes mainstream with ETF approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Welcoming Ethereum into the world of ETFs is the $ETHETF Token. If Bitcoin&#8217;s defining value proposition is its digital gold store of value properties, then Ethereum can reasonably claim to be the king of dApp blockchains.</p>
<p>As might be expected, $ETHETF is an ERC20-compliant asset, which means it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This design decision means the coin is linked to the fortunes of the Ethereum ecosystem, providing investors with a foothold inside the ecosystem of the premier blockchain platform.</p>
<p>However, to incentivize holding the token and to boost its price, each purchase attracts a 2% burn tax.</p>
<p>Burning 2% of the purchase amount eats into the total supply of 1 billion, thereby enhancing the value of the remaining tokens.</p>
<p>In addition to the ERC20 connection to Ethereum, the coin also builds into its tokenomics a direct way of celebrating the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF – the 2% burn tax will be lifted when the fund is approved.</p>
<p>Finally, the token’s debut on the Uniswap decentralized exchange is a fair launch as there is no team allocation. The tokenomics allocates 95% of supply to DEX liquidity and 5% for CEX (centralized exchange) listings.</p>
<p>To buy the token, simply connect your crypto wallet to the DEX, copy and paste in the contract address to make sure you are buying the correct coin and then make your purchase. Be sure to have at least $20 spare in your wallet to pay the transaction gas fee.</p>

<p><i>Friday, November 10th, 2023</i> – The Pepe coin’s price has climbed 25% to $0.000001298 over the past seven days, but <a href="https://www.memekombat.io/">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK) is the one to watch for 100x gains after raising $1.44 million as the altcoin season takes off.</p>
<p>Since bottoming on October 19 at $0.000000626, $PEPE price has been pumping. The PEPE price has doubled over the past month, surging in the latter half of October as the meme coin chalks up a market capitalization of $524 million.</p>
<p>However, the Meme Kombat gaming and betting ecosystem threatens to blow Pepe out of the water after yesterday introducing dynamic yield staking, currently earning stakers 1,000%-plus annual percentage yield (APY). </p>
<p>Although the Meme Kombat platform has not launched yet, you can buy and stake the token in presale.</p>
<h2><strong>New dynamic staking – Meme Kombat uniquely blends off-chain and on-chain for cheap, efficient and secure staking and gaming</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
$MK staking is unique because it seamlessly blends on-chain and off-chain transactions. End users only pay network fees when they stake and unstake their $MK, while all claiming of rewards inside the staking platform happens off-chain and incurs no fees. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Stakers can see all their interactions with the staking platform, such as deposits and claims, logged in real-time.</p>
<p>This is also integrated with the on-chain game contracts, meaning you will be able to play the games with staked tokens. </p>
<p>With Meme Kombat, all claiming and gaming is gas-less, courtesy of its state-of-the-art hybrid off- and on-chain system. There are similar systems available from some big players in the crypto industry but their designs depend on cold wallets whereas Meme Kombat uses smart contracts. </p>
<p>Cold wallets are an inefficient way of trying to keep systems secure. Meme Kombat, however, has chosen a different, more efficient and secure approach, by requiring six block confirmations before a transaction can go through.</p>
<p>Holders of $MK can stake their previously purchased tokens direct on the website, at <a href="https://memekombat.io/">Memekombat.io</a>. So far nearly 2.3 million $MK has been staked, which amounts to 26% of the tokens sold.</p>
<p>In less than 24 hours since the introduction of dynamic staking, more than 35,000 $MK tokens have been rewarded to stakers.</p>

<h2><strong>As the bull run explodes, investors are looking for more from their meme coins – $MK fits the bill</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Sure, the frog meme has taken crypto markets by storm this year, but investors are now looking for something more from their meme coins, and Meme Kombat fits the bill with its platform where meme characters join battle and users bet on the outcomes. There is nothing else like Meme Kombat on the market.</p>
<p>As the crypto winter rapidly thaws, traders and investors are souring the market for the best risk-reward opportunities. The problem for those chasing Pepe for outsized returns is that the price explosion has already happened.</p>
<p>Pepe reached an all-time high of $0.000003766 on May 5 this year. To reclaim that price would require an 184% uplift on the current price. That is a reasonable price target for meme coins but it might be a stretch to expect further parabolic run-ups after that milestone is reclaimed.</p>
<p>As the crypto bull run ignited by the prospect of bitcoin halving and a spot bitcoin ETF approval takes wing, projects are coming under closer scrutiny. In this context, a new breed of meme coins that combines cheeky, humorous irreverent virality with actual utility value is coming to the fore.</p>
<p>Many buyers will be entering the meme coin sector for the first time on the lookout for the next big thing. Even better, then, if that coin can show that it is not just a cartoon character but a product offering people will want to engage with, and in so doing generate revenues and profits. Meme Kombat is that coin.</p>
<p>The Meme Kombat ($MK) platform as a first-of-its-kind platform for battling and wagering with meme characters will likely have wide appeal to all types of meme coin traders and investors. </p>
<p>It not only targets the two booming crypto sectors of GameFi and GambleFi, but it is also perfectly positioned in the high-octane meme coin segment. </p>
<p>$MK is currently priced at $0.189, but will be rising 10% to $0.205 in Stage 3 of the presale, which starts on November 16. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.memekombat.io/">Meme Kombat</a> presale has only six days to go before the next price increase, so prospective buyers will need to move quickly to make sure they snatch the lowest possible price. The next milestone $1.5 million also triggers a community giveaway of 5k USDT. </p>
<p>Although the site countdown shows six days left before the next price rise, the current stage could sell out much sooner than the time allocated. </p>
<p>You can get a feel for the virality of the project from the fun that the team’s artists are already having with the meme characters. </p>
<p>So whether you are won over by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe or Sponge, meme coin watchers will find their character, and many others, represented in Meme Kombat</p>
<p>For degens focused on where to find the next 100x gem Meme Kombat has to be front and center. Put succinctly, Meme Kombat captures the latent value of arguably the top-valued sectors in crypto today – gaming and gambling. </p>
<p>Not only will you be able to battle with meme characters, but you will also be able to wager on the outcome of those head-to-heads. When the full innovative platform is live, token holders will be able to seamlessly stake-to-bet on the battle in the Meme Kombat Arena.</p>

<h2><strong>Meme Kombat Season 1 features the top meme coins, so there’s something for everyone</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme Kombat’s Season 1 will be available after the presale is sold out and the project is launched. </p>
<p>There are 11 meme characters you can battle with in Season 1: Milady, Baby Doge, Doge, Floki, Kishu, Mong, Pepe, Pepe2, Shiba, Sponge and Wojak.</p>
<p>Players bet on the meme characters and are rewarded with $MK tokens if they back the winners.</p>
<p>Our sources tell us that Season 2 meme characters will be landing just before Season 1 wraps up.</p>
<p>Blockchain comes into its own when it comes to gaming and gambling. On the gaming side, there is verifiable randomness and for gambling, its trust and security features are also well suited to the platform’s requirements. </p>
<p>Although often absent from most meme coin projects, in Meme Kombat’s case a <a href="https://coinsult.net/projects/meme-kombat/">security audit</a> of its smart contract has been conducted. Prospective buyers will be pleased to note that the audit was passed with flying colors and no major issues detected.</p>
<p>All told, 50% of the total token supply is being sold in the presale, 30% for staking and battler rewards, 10% for community rewards, and 10% for decentralized exchange liquidity. The total token supply of $MK is 120,000,000.</p>
<p>Helping buyers to make their decision is the fact that the Meme Kombat project is doxxed. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattw8047814774/">Founder Matt Whiteman</a> is chief operations officer at Netherlands-based <a href="https://northapp.com/">North Technologies</a>, an NFT trading and analytics business.</p>
<p>Whiteman’s footprint in the NFT space is thought to be helping Meme Kombat to garner traction in the Web3 venture sector.</p>

<h2><strong>Novel stake-to-bet paradigm will create growing value for $MK token holders</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme Kombat is at the center of the intersection of gaming and gambling in the cryptocurrency industry. </p>
<p>By freeing up staked tokens for use as gambling chips, Meme Kombat allows network participants to earn from staking as well as the opportunity to win big in the battle arena.</p>
<p>Priced at $0.189, <a href="https://www.memekombat.io/">Meme Kombat</a> token can be purchased today with ETH, BNB or USDT (ERC-20 and BEP-20 versions).</p>
<p>Gambling is a booming industry and today crypto is only a very small part of the whole.  However, the industry is changing fast, as witnessed by the rise of online venues. <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/worldwide">Data compiled by Statista</a> shows that the online gambling industry’s market size is $95 billion for 2023. </p>
<p>With its well-suited technological advantages of decentralization to deliver secure, fair and transparent gaming and betting, crypto-based gambling is growing rapidly. Meme Kombat is in the vanguard of this Web3-led transformation. </p>
<p>Don’t miss out on a coin that has Pepe&#8217;s price potential with the added certainties of real-world utility.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, November 7, 2023</i> – The Bitcoin price can hit $40,000 in November for three reasons, making the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF token</a> a must-buy at ICO for those who want exposure to the Bitcoin ETF theme.</p>
<p>Bitcoin halving, the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF, and the Bitcoin digital gold thesis are the three factors converging to send the top cryptocurrency’s price to $40,000 this month, and possibly into the $60,000s early next year.</p>
<p>An expected bull run that accompanies the Bitcoin halving cycles has probably already begun – providing the first major reason for the doubling in the price of Bitcoin since its near-term lows printed in November last year.</p>
<p>The logarithmic price chart below showing the previous Bitcoin halving epochs illustrates the powerful price-positive driver that accompanies the reduction of the bitcoin block reward. In April 2024 the reward halves from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin per block mined.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-128014" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363094-unnamed-2023-11-07t131703-009.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363094-unnamed-2023-11-07t131703-009.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363094-unnamed-2023-11-07t131703-009-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363094-unnamed-2023-11-07t131703-009-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363094-unnamed-2023-11-07t131703-009-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363094-unnamed-2023-11-07t131703-009-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Best way to position your portfolio for stellar returns for when a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, a second reason for bullish sentiment returning to the market is undoubtedly the narrowing odds that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, as soon as January next year.</p>
<p>In anticipation, traders have already started diverting their cash into Bitcoin derivative coins such as the Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) in order to be ready for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Traders are incentivized to buy the $BTCETF token in the presale through the ecosystem’s staking feature. At the time of writing more than 3 million $BTCETF tokens have been staked, earning an astronomical annual percentage yield (APY) of 10,000-plus. The yield will taper lower as more funds are deposited into the staking smart contract.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-128015" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363226-unnamed-2023-11-07t131707-219.png" alt="" width="1600" height="798" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363226-unnamed-2023-11-07t131707-219.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363226-unnamed-2023-11-07t131707-219-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363226-unnamed-2023-11-07t131707-219-1024x511.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363226-unnamed-2023-11-07t131707-219-768x383.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363226-unnamed-2023-11-07t131707-219-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363226-unnamed-2023-11-07t131707-219-1536x766.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Burn mechanism tied to real-world events such as trading volume and spot Bitcoin ETF approval and launch dates</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin ETF Token launches with a 5% burn mechanism on all transactions. Up to 25% of the total token supply is eligible to be burned.</p>
<p>Ingeniously, the burn mechanism is tied to real-world events related to spot Bitcoin ETF news flow, where milestones such as approval and launch dates and the level of assets under management (AUM), trigger burn events.</p>
<p>For instance, when the trading volume of $BTCETF reaches $100 million the transaction tax reduces from 5% to 4%. There are other clever milestones, such as when the first spot Bitcoin ETF is approved the sales tax reduces from 4% to 3%.</p>
<p>If you are looking to ride the enthusiasm surrounding the hottest investment in crypto right now, Bitcoin ETF Token is the best way to get your portfolio positioned for when the SEC approves the first spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token has a total supply of 2.1 billion (2,100,000,000). The project’s website has a helpful newsfeed to keep you up to date with all the news related to Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin price.</p>
<p>The $BTCETF token is the best way to play the spot Bitcoin ETF theme. The token is in presale now and only costs $0.005. There is a hard cap total of just under $5 million, with the presale divided into 10 price stages, so investors need to buy today to lock in the lowest possible prices.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin is digital gold – and Bitcoin ETF Token is a cheap way of getting in on the action</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Our third reason why Bitcoin can hit $40,000 in November is the persistent attractiveness of Bitcoin as a store of value – the digital gold narrative is coming to the fore once more. Again, purchasing Bitcoin ETF Token is a way of gaining exposure to this third leg of the bull case for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There’s nothing like war and economic uncertainty to stir the pot for gold bullion and Bitcoin is arguably a more portable and divisible version of that asset, with similar investable properties, but without the custodial costs required to store it in a vault.</p>
<p>ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood outlined the digital gold case for Bitcoin in a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-11-03/cathie-wood-says-bitcoin-is-digital-gold">Bloomberg interview</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>On the Merryn Talks Money podcast the CEO and founder of Ark Investment Management, says she would bet on Bitcoin rather than gold or cash to safeguard against the possibility of deflation in the coming decade.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><strong>With Bitcoin ETF Token there is no expense ratio fee deductions you see with ETFs</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Also worth mentioning is the fact that buying the Bitcoin ETF Token is a cheaper way to gain exposure to the Bitcoin value proposition via an actual spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>ETFs come with management fees. Although the total expense ratio (the percentage of returns deducted for fees) is usually less than 1%, making ETFs cheaper than mutual funds, the expenses can still add up to a lot of money, especially for bigger pots.</p>
<p>When you buy $BTCETF tokens you pay a one-off amount to cover the gas fees on Ethereum, as opposed to having to fork out an ongoing annual percentage charge.</p>
<p>There is also no pesky tracking error (when the underlying asset and the ETF price diverge slightly) to worry about, as there is with exchange-traded funds.</p>
<h2><strong>Dollar losing its luster, Bitcoin gaining a shine and it’s programmable too</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Those are the three major reasons, but there are other positives associated with the macroeconomic backdrop and Bitcoin protocol fundamentals.</p>
<p>On that, the waning power of the dollar and sticky inflation make a disinflationary asset like Bitcoin a great portfolio diversifier, even if that wasn&#8217;t really apparent when inflation first returned as a top concern for policymakers.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the dollar index (dollar weighted against other leading internationally traded currencies) against the Bitcoin price.</p>

<p>At the protocol level developments around NFT ordinals demonstrated the flexibility of Bitcoin as a programmable form of money that is practically, and theoretically, able to adapt and evolve.</p>
<p>Despite the much-talked-about governance drawbacks that have previously slowed progress, the hype around ‘inscriptions’, which allowed block space to be used for unintended and novel purposes such as storing NFTs, showed what is possible.</p>
<p>Even if you are doubtful of the value proposition of NFT ordinals, their existence proves the point about the revolutionary extensibility of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Transactions surged on the Bitcoin blockchain when ordinals innovation began, leading to criticism in some quarters that they were clogging up the chain and pressuring transaction fees higher. Nevertheless, it showed the innovative possibilities of the Bitcoin protocol in contrast to the sterility of non-programmable fiat money.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-128017" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363319-unnamed-2023-11-07t131716-150.png" alt="" width="1600" height="937" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363319-unnamed-2023-11-07t131716-150.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363319-unnamed-2023-11-07t131716-150-300x176.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363319-unnamed-2023-11-07t131716-150-1024x600.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363319-unnamed-2023-11-07t131716-150-768x450.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699363319-unnamed-2023-11-07t131716-150-1536x900.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>Having re-established itself around the $35,000 level, traders are looking at upside Bitcoin price targets between $47,000 and $60,000 going into 2024.</p>
<p>If the price stays within its current ascending channel then it will hit $40,000 in January.</p>
<p>But the Bitcoin price could blast off in January because it is on the 10th of that month that the deadline for an SEC decision on whether to approve the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF comes round.</p>
<p>An approval could see the price break out of the identified channel and arc higher on a trajectory to $47,000, where it will likely meet some resistance that formed at that level in April 2022.</p>
<p>Assuming Bloomberg Intelligence analysts who have nailed their mast to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-14/grayscale-s-bitcoin-etf-push-what-s-next-after-sec-doesn-t-appeal-court-ruling">90% probability of a spot Bitcoin ETF</a> being approved are correct, then a steady flow of other approvals will follow, including the big one – BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world.</p>
<p>Fuelling the speculation, and the contention that an approval is inevitable, was the inclusion of the iShares fund in the eligibility file of the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) clearing house, which handles post-trade settlement for US financial markets.</p>
<p>Although the iShares ETF’s inclusion in the file does not mean an approval is confirmed, it is a step that is indicative of such an outcome. No previous spot Bitcoin ETF applications have been included in the DTCC list.</p>
<p>The news propelled the Bitcoin price on a two-day rally to an 18-month high of $35,180, which is where the price is still currently trading.</p>
<p>After settling at $47,000 there is an open road ahead for the price to climb back into the $60,000s and to challenge the all-time high at $68k.</p>
<h2><strong>Spot Bitcion ETF and the $BTCETF token can open the floodgates to new money</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Not surprisingly then, of all the three major reasons behind the push to $40,000, market participants will be most focused on the prospects for a spot Bitcoin ETF and how it and other Bitcoin derivatives such as Bitcoin ETF Token can play a part in opening up the floodgates to new money.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds will provide both retail and institutional investors with safe and hassle-free ways of gaining exposure to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There will be no need to risk funds by investing in a latter day FTX, for example, which could open up investor money to fraud and losses.</p>
<p>Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers include the great and the good of the investment management world, from BlackRock to Fidelity and relative upstarts such as ARK Invest.</p>
<p>Having highly regulated and well-supervised companies such as the aforementioned entering the crypto space may be a threat to some ‘crypto native’ incumbents such as centralized exchanges. But for retail investors it means more security and choice, and for institutional clients it provides a regulated on-ramp.</p>
<p>The opening today of the Bitcoin ETF Token presale provides investors with perhaps the smartest way to leverage the investment theme around the spot Bitcoin ETF. It could be the best thing that happens to your crypto investment portfolio.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, November 1st, 2023 </i>– Exciting new web3 meme project Meme Kombat just hit a huge milestone in its closely watched presale.</p>
<p>The project, which takes inspiration from the multi-billion dollar <a href="https://www.memekombat.io/">Mortal Kombat </a>franchise, but with a meme coin spin plus a sprinkling of crypto degeneracy humor, has now raised a $1 million via the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presale</a> of its native $MK token.</p>
<p>Traders are rushing in ahead of a price slated to take place in under two days and ahead of the launch of Meme Kombat’s $MK token staking program, which will offer huge annual percentage yields (APYs) to its earliest participants.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat are looking to raise a minimum of $5 million via the sale of 50% of the $MK supply, with tokens currently available for $0.1667.</p>
<p>But on the 2nd of November, this price will jump 10% to $0.1833.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>After this point, the price will rise every seven days until it reaches $0.279 in just over 10 weeks’ time.</p>
<p>That means savvy investors who get in on the presale now will be on huge paper gains of 67% by the time the presale enters its last stage.</p>
<h2>Stakers Are Earning 112% APY – Staking Dashboard Goes Live This Week</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme Kombat’s staking dashboard will also be going live this week, as per a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The project’s website is already teasing that early staking participants can get APYs of up to 112%.</p>
<p>All $MK tokens bought in the presale are automatically entered into Meme Kombat’s staking program, meaning presale investors will start earning rewards right away.</p>
<p>30% of the $MK supply is dedicated to staking and battler rewards, 10% for community rewards, and 10% for decentralized exchange liquidity.</p>
<p>The project’s founder is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattw8047814774/">Founder Matt Whiteman</a> is Chief Operations Officer at Netherlands-based<a href="https://northapp.com/"> North Technologies</a>, an NFT trading and analytics platform.</p>
<h2>What is Meme Kombat?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme Kombat ($MK) is an all-purpose meme coin because it is building a one-of-a-kind platform for battling meme characters and will therefore likely have wide appeal to all types of meme coin traders and investors.</p>
<p>Not only will you be able to battle with meme characters, but you will also be able to wager on the outcome of those head-to-heads.</p>
<p>You can get a feel for the virality of the project from the fun that the team’s artists are already having with the meme characters.</p>
<p>So whether you are won over by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe or Sponge, meme coin watchers will find their character and more represented in Meme Kombat</p>
<p>For degens focused on where to find the next 100x gem, Meme Kombat has to be front and center. Put succinctly, Meme Kombat captures the latent value of arguably the top-valued sectors in crypto today – gaming and gambling.</p>

<h2>Here’s Why This Utility-Packed Coin Could Surpass Pepe</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At its current price of $0.00000115, Pepe Coin ($PEPE) has an enormous market cap of close to $500 million, a staggering achievement considering the coin offers literally no utility to its investors, beyond the sense that they are part of the admittedly large and engaged Pepe Coin community.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a lot of value in networks of highly engaged individuals, something which Pepe certainly has.</p>
<p>But as the crypto market enters its next bull cycle, one feature of the maturing nature of this market is that investors are becoming more demanding in what they expect from a coin.</p>
<p>Those higher expectations are also being put onto new memes coins.</p>
<p>Increasingly, meme coin investors are flocking towards projects that are offering genuinely unique and potentially valuable use cases – for a project to succeed now, there has to be a value differential.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat fits the bill perfectly. It not only hits on the two booming sectors of GameFi and GambleFi, it is also playing in the high-octane meme coin segment, where old and new money is sure to flow in powerful torrents as crypto winter recedes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t require much analysis to immediately see the value proposition in Meme Kombat and how it stacks up when compared to coins like Pepe.</p>

<h2>Crypto Industry Is Taking Note – Get $MK Before It Rises 100x</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme Kombat is at the center of the intersection of gaming and gambling in the cryptocurrency industry, two industries that are booming.</p>
<p>Indeed,<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/worldwide"> Data compiled by Statista</a> shows that the online gambling industry’s market size is $95 billion for 2023.</p>
<p>Crypto is at the forefront of the gambling growth story because of the way in which the unique properties of blockchain technology are so well suited for products like gambling that depend on verifiable randomness, trust and transparency.</p>
<p>Merge the gambling with gaming and meme coins and you have the recipe for success that can send Meme Kombat way beyond a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>With Meme Kombat looking to raise between $5 and $10 million via the sale of 50% of its $MK token supply in presale, a surge in the project’s market cap to over $1 billion could mean an increase of over 100x from the project’s presale valuation.</p>
<p>Of course, to reach a valuation of this level, Meme Kombat is going to need to become a household name in the crypto space.</p>
<h2>Giant Marketing Campaign Generates Surging Take-up Across Crypto Media</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
That requires a big marketing push, which is exactly what the project’s team has been cooking in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat has received coverage on top crypto news outlets, including<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/market-releases/new-meme-kombat-crypto-presale-goes-live-combining-p2e-and-staking-utility"> Cointelegraph</a>,<a href="https://coinpedia.org/press-release/pepe-price-prediction-could-these-new-meme-coins-pump-next/"> Coinpedia</a>,<a href="https://decrypt.co/198590/new-cryptocurrency-meme-kombat-mk-launches-public-token-presale-staking-platform/"> Decrypt</a>,<a href="https://coincodex.com/article/32782/meme-kombat-is-fighting-its-way-to-become-the-top-meme-coin-supported-by-betting-and-staking-features/"> Coincodex</a>,<a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coin-next-crypto-to-explode/"> BeInCrypto</a>,<a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/presale-token-news/new-p2e-and-staking-token-meme-kombat-hits-200k-in-presale-next-meme-coin-to-explode-202310021242"> FXStreet</a>, and<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/is-meme-coin-season-back-as-pepe-price-rises-by-34-5-coins-to-watch/"> CryptoPotato</a>.</p>
<p>It has even featured on popular gaming sites like<a href="https://gameishard.gg/news/meme-kombat-a-new-gaming-platform-with-high-potential/320143/"> Game is Hard</a>.</p>
<p>YouTube influencers are also taking note.</p>
<p>Cryptonews YouTuber Ari has also just published a video for<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge2aCCVj0VA"> Cryptonews</a> featuring Meme Kombat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto expert Joe Parys, who has 382,000 subscribers on YouTube, has selected Meme Kombat as one of his ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/xAMHgLP5Bw4?si=loJRnN2wGRlWuvmX">top 5 meme crypto coins for 2024</a> and beyond’.</p>
<p>Michael Wrubel, another respected crypto YouTuber with around 310,000 subscribers, is just as<a href="https://youtu.be/xAMHgLP5Bw4?si=loJRnN2wGRlWuvmX"> bullish on Meme Kombat</a>’s potential to carve out a valuable niche.</p>
<p>No Bs Crypto YouTube channel told his 36,000 subscribers that Meme Kombat ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/V-i9AMjT1Io?si=u7ZwuH86nKO02iBB">could kill Pepe</a>’.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 26, 2023 – Meme coin $SPONGE’s price is up 26% in the past seven days to $0.000117 after announcing the introduction of staking, to take place on November 1st.</p>
<p>With only six days to go, the staking news is attracting buyers to the <a href="https://sponge.vip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sponge project</a>, which was created as a homage to the SpongeBob cartoon character, although it has no affiliation with Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>There are no specific details as yet about the annual percentage yield or lock-up periods, however, $SPONGE staking provides all token holders with a way to earn a yield from their digital asset.</p>
<p>The timing of the introduction of the staking service couldn’t have been better as it coincides with an ‘everything’ rally in the meme coin sector, not to mention the broader crypto world.</p>
<h2><strong>Meme coins are catching fire and $SPONGE is a prime candidate for altcoin season mega returns</strong></h2>

<p>The $SPONGE price has bounced hard off its all-time lows, which makes it a prime target for investors looking to dollar-cost averaging into the market.</p>
<p>$SPONGE should definitely be on the altcoin season target list for savvy investors doing some bottom-fishing, as that’s where the largest upside is likely to be – especially in the meme coins scene.<br />
Meme coins continue to be one of the hottest sectors in the market and the green tide of recent days across top coins is a testament to that.</p>
<p>When we factor in the work that the team is now doing to stimulate positive price action, as witnessed in the staking news, and rumors of other plans in the offing, buying $SPONGE today is a smart move.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe Floki price pumping… and $SPONGE has started its march back to its $0.0023 all-time high</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are both up 8% today while Pepe and Floki have put on more than 20%.</p>
<p>Pepe has almost doubled in value in the space of a week. Meanwhile, the second-most valuable meme coin Shiba Inu, with a market cap of $4.7 billion, has risen 18% over the same period to $0.000007991.</p>
<p>Meme coin trading volume has spiked 72% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>When<a href="https://sponge.vip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $SPONGE</a> launched five months ago it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.0023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-120747 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698320413-unnamed-2023-10-26t123904-311.png" alt="Meme coin $SPONGE’s price up 26% in the past 7 days to $0.000117 after announcing the introduction of staking, to take place on November 1st." width="1600" height="1187" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698320413-unnamed-2023-10-26t123904-311.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698320413-unnamed-2023-10-26t123904-311-300x223.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698320413-unnamed-2023-10-26t123904-311-1024x760.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698320413-unnamed-2023-10-26t123904-311-768x570.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698320413-unnamed-2023-10-26t123904-311-1536x1140.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>Although it has come off the boil since then, a redoubling of efforts to recapture that value is in the works, according to sources close to the team.</p>
<p>The attraction of meme coins resides in their potential to ignite the growth of virally based communities of ardent followers.</p>
<p>But underneath that is the hyper-speculative urge to jump on board the next coin to deliver 1,000x returns or more, as has happened with all the named coins.</p>
<p>But in some respects the higher the price is now, the lower the future risk-reward potential, which means it is the bubbling-under coins that are often the ripest for a price explosion.</p>
<h2><strong>$SPONGE staking to be followed by more product development – burning, buybacks, Layer 2, games, DeFi…?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Clearly, the launch of staking is one way to boost value for token holders. However, there are other ways the team might be exploring to enhance the value of the <a href="https://sponge.vip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sponge project</a>.</p>
<p>Although there are no public statements available to confirm any future plans beyond staking, areas such as gaming could be explored as well.</p>
<p>Some financial engineering of token economics such as burning tokens and buybacks might be another possibility.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu is attempting to pivot into gaming and DeFi with its launch of Shibarium, an Ethereum Layer 2 protocol. A similar move on Sponge’s part would require major development resources but could be well worth the effort.</p>
<p>As the crypto winter thaws and the beginnings of a new bull run show green shoots, a new breed of crypto investor is on the lookout for coins that have meaningful utility, and that goes for meme coins too.</p>
<p>Staking is a great start in that direction and will certainly make the $SPONGE token much more attractive to hold for the long term.</p>

<h2><strong>After Shiba Inu rumors, is there a major partnership looming?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There’s also talk of partnerships with other projects where there might be mutually beneficial synergies.</p>
<p>A high-profile partnership deal could take the coin to the next level very quickly, especially if combined with product launches and design enhancements that are laser-focused on the aim of boosting the price.</p>
<p>And the commitment of the team to bring forward more price-supportive initiatives and products could help drive interest and market momentum for the coin.</p>
<h2><strong>Airdrop entries close on October 30 so don’t miss out on free $SPONGE</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last but not least, Sponge has an airdrop ongoing, entries for which end on October 30, with the winners of the airdrop chosen on November 1.</p>
<p>As much as 10% of the total token supply might have been allocated to the airdrop.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Other meme projects have successfully ignited more interest in their tokens by implementing features such as token staking, token buybacks, or even by launching dApps that are powered by the meme project’s native token.</p>
<p>Could $SPONGE’s utility as a meme coin be about to go ballistic? It seems highly likely.</p>
<h2><strong>$SPONGE 20x gains are up for grabs for new buyers</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xf935f557e06a7d040dea4691f90c9a755301818b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEXTools</a>, $SPONGE’s market cap was last a modest $2.74 million, very low considering the token has $3.4 million in liquidity and 11,400 holders.</p>
<p>HODLers and liquidity miners still clearly believe that $SPONGE has a lot of potential.</p>
<p>The new staking utility is already drawing in new buyers and that’s expected to continue when staking goes live, and also as a result of more product development and possible major partnerships.</p>
<p>The chances of $SPONGE rallying back to its all-time high price of $0.0023 are strong, which will deliver a gain of more than 20x.</p>
<p>With more product news to come, a 20x gain could be a conservative forecast of where the $SPONGE price may be headed as the altcoin season kicks into a higher gear.</p>
<p>It’s not too late to absorb the damp!</p>

As of now, at least 900 Israelis have been killed, with more than 2,600 wounded. It is estimated that at least 150 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were kidnapped and abducted into the Gaza Strip, according to official reports.</p><p>Crypto Aid Israel is hosting a multisig wallet, entrusted to respected members of the local Web3 community, that will be used to collect donations in over a dozen forms of cryptocurrency including BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, etc. Partnerships are being established with a leading Israeli bank and multiple government agencies in order to distribute the donations swiftly and efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>With regard to management of the crypto assets, Crypto Aid Israel has graciously accepted the help of Fireblocks. A strict policy has been implemented that requires at least of four out of seven signatories to move funds out of the wallet. All of the Crypto Aid Israel signers are respected leaders from the local Web3 space.</p><p>Local crypto organizer and CEO of CryptoJungle Ben Samocha said: &ldquo;Israel is currently suffering from a brutal, unprovoked attack by Hamas terrorists. Every Israeli citizen is fighting for the survival of their own life and the lives of their families. They need our utmost support, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re aiming to provide with Crypto Aid Israel. We hope to raise the necessary funds to provide food and shelter for families who lost their homes. We are also hoping to provide hygiene and medical products for the bombarded Israeli civilian populace and to raise awareness for the horrors the Israeli people are facing right now. We are especially hopeful to provide resources to Israeli children who have lost their parents to murder or abduction. Please donate and share our campaign &#8211; and we thank you for your support!&rdquo;</p><p>It is incredibly important to consider before donating that due to potential phishing scams and cyber attacks, please compare the crypto wallet address to the verified one on the <a href="https://cryptoaidisrael.com"><u>official website</u></a>, so that funds aren&rsquo;t sent to addresses that may have been sent to you through other sources.</p><h2>About Crypto Aid Israel</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Crypto Aid Israel is an emergency charity initiative formed by local leaders from the Israeli Web3 space such as 42Studio, MarketAcross, Collider Ventures, CryptoJungle, Nilos, BlockchainB7, Efficient Frontier, Ironblocks Israel Blockchain Association, and Bits Of Gold to kick-start a global fundraising campaign that supports Israeli citizens and families in desperate need of humanitarian aid.</p><p>Follow Crypto Aid Israel on <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoAidIsrael">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cryptoaidisrael/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cryptoaid_israel?lang=en">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/crypto-aid-israel/about/">LinkedIn </a>and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551917412384">Facebook</a>.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126159/333136/bitcoin-minetrix-822k-raised.jpg" width="2688" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>Much-talked-about Bitcoin cloud-mining project <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix</u></a> ($BTCMTX) has raised more than $822,000 from investors in a week as it sets out to revolutionize the industry by tokenizing Bitcoin cloud mining.</p><p>It looks like this carefully thought-through project and its innovative use case is already attracting imitators. MineLab coin which launched on decentralized exchanges yesterday has seen its native coin soar in price by 10,300%. But there are worries that the coin could be a scam.</p><p>Cloud mining of Bitcoin is an attractive idea, but there are many instances of fraudulent operations where customers hand over money only for the mining revenues never to materialize.</p><p>Bitcoin Minetrix eradicates those problems because no cash changes hands, as everything is handled at the level of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-1800-level-comes-into-play-what-are-indicators-showing.htm">Ethereum</a> smart contracts in a fully automated service.</p><p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-bitcoin-minetrix.htm">$BTCMTX</a> coin is currently in presale, and after a rejigging of its price ladder, the current first stage ends on October 16th (in 6 days and 20 hours at the time of writing).&nbsp;</p><p>However, the first stage could sell out before then, which means you could miss out on the lowest price available of $0.011 by delaying. The next price point is $0.0111.</p><p>With $822,000 raised, more than half of the first stage sale total ($1,540,000) is complete and selling out the rest of the tokens at a quickening pace. Up to 70% of the total supply of 4 billion $BTCMTX is available to purchase at presale.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitcoinminetrix/status/1711292699008024936[/embed]<h2>So how does Bitcoin Minetrix stack up against MineLab?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>It is important to note that Bitcoin Minetrix is <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/audit.pdf"><u>audited by blockchain security firm Coinsult</u></a>. The project passed the audit with no major issues.&nbsp;</p><p>However, MineLab looks like a different proposition &ndash; in a bad way. No audit has been commissioned or completed. If there had been one carried out the team would presumably have mentioned this on the website, but there is a general paucity of information there on all matters.</p><p>Alarmingly, though, for buyers of the MineLab coin, automated contract audit systems on sites such as DEXTools have detected that the contract owner is able to modify the balancers of token holders.</p><p>Until confirmed to the contrary, this major security hole could enable a bad actor to wipe all wallets and in effect transfer those funds to wallets under their direct control by resetting all balances. This would be a way of initiating a rug pull.</p><p><i><strong>Update</strong></i><strong> &#8211; several Twitter users have </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/StephenOAkoto/status/1711265507469410503"><strong><u>reported</u></strong></a><strong> their balance being set to zero.</strong></p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/StephenOAkoto/status/1711265507469410503[/embed]<p>Another worry that presents itself for potential MineLab buyers is the apparent lack of locked liquidity. This could be because the coin is listed on Uniswap V3 which prevents liquidity locks being shown on third-party analytics sites like DEXTools. But, a click-through to <a href="https://www.team.finance/view-coin/0x9cb00f90c22b2ac59d99544a92873cb76c22e561?name=MineLab&amp;symbol=MineLab"><u>Team Finance</u></a> shows there is no lock.</p><p>During the writing of this article, the price of MineLab has swung from a gain of more than 11,000% to now just 69%, adding to suspicions about the token.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126159/333137/minelab-usd-uni-dextools-.jpg" width="2388" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>Sources at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> say they will be locking liquidity when the coin launches on decentralized exchanges, although it will also be targeting listings on centralized exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>MineLab has a 95 out of 99 DEXTscore, which is a broad measure of project reliability, but only 12 have voted so far, so it is difficult to hold too much store by that.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the volume is only $340,000, and the number of token holders is relatively small at 400. When any coin makes such a dramatic run-up in price, it always raises suspicions of market manipulation.</p><p>The website of MineLab is underwhelming, to say the least. There is a &ldquo;start mining&rdquo; button that does nothing when clicked. There is an email but it looks like the individuals behind the website haven&rsquo;t even bothered to get a domain email, as it is a non-corporate Gmail address.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no whitepaper available at the website and the project claims to be based in the UK but provides no address to make this verifiable.</p><p>Finally, a 3% yield from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm">cloud mining</a> is promoted, but there is no explanation of the assumptions behind that percentage. The website, and by inference the project, has every sign of being thrown together in a hurry.</p><p>Now compare against Bitcoin Minetrix.</p><h2>Safe and secure cloud mining with Bitcoin Minetrix stops the scammers</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As we have seen, Bitcoin Minetrix is audited by Coinsult, and a link to both the audit and whitepaper are prominently displayed above the fold on the website.</p><p>MineLab says it is based in the UK. Aside from the possible regulatory issues presented by the new UK laws on crypto promotions which it should be abiding by, there is no address.&nbsp;</p><p>By contrast, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> is based in crypto-friendly&nbsp; Georgia, and the address of the project is provided in the website footer: Ana Politkovskaia Street 3, Block 6, T&#8217;bilisi, 0186, Georgia.</p><p>Also, anyone thinking of investing in MineLab should be seeking maximum transparency on where earnings are coming from. That is not provided. Again, in contrast, Bitcoin Minetrix has a well-worked-out stake-to-mine system that will take in deposits which will earn cloud mining credits.</p><p>Unlike MineLab, with Bitcoin Minetrix you can start earning from staking immediately while the coin is in presale. When the presale ends and the coin launches, it will switch to a stake-to-mine setup.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitcoinminetrix/status/1709944350275473795[/embed]<p>Buy and stake now to earn a yield of 733% with $BTCMTX, $30,000 Minedrop Giveaway is live now</p><p>Everything is above board and easily understandable with Bitcoin Minetrix. Of the total token supply of 4 billion $BTCMTX, 7.5% is allocated for staking.&nbsp; and you can earn two passive income streams.&nbsp;</p><p>First, there&rsquo;s the $BTCMTX tokens that can be earned, currently at an annual percentage yield of 733%. For every ETH block produced, 158.5 $BTCMTX are rewarded.</p><p>At the moment, 56 million $BTCMTX has been staked.</p><p>The second income stream will be from the mining operations, after the switch over to stake-to-mine has taken place. Encouragingly, the team has already entered into preliminary discussions with a number of cloud vendors.</p><p>Unlike MineLab, Bitcoin Minetrix is the real deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are still on the fence about where to put your hard-earned funds, the launch of a $30,000 Minedrop giveaway. Full entry details about the Gleam-hosted giveaway can be found on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix website</u></a>.</p><h2>YouTube crypto influencers think Bitcoin Minetrix is onto something big &ndash; 10x at launch?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Crypto experts are lining up to back Bitcoin Minetrix because of its positioning as a disruptive force in the industry.</p><p>A key factor in determining mining profitability is the cost of the electricity to run the ASIC rigs that operate 24/7 around the clock. It means that the days of individuals mining Bitcoin on their laptops are long gone.

<p>A lucky player has won a $1 million fortune on the slots at No.1 <u>Telegram casino, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice">Mega Dice</a></u>. A stake of $500 was turned into a $1 million haul in a series of high-payout spins. </p>
<p>The news has exploded onto the crypto betting scene, validating, yet again, the opportunities and advantages the decentralized gaming infrastructure has over their legacy competitors. </p>
<p>As is to be expected, the privacy of the player is being protected, but the team at Mega Dice has released a playback of the slots action. Head over to the <a href="https://twitter.com/megadice"><u>Mega Dice X account</u></a> to check it out:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YES!

<p>It all started rather sedately, beginning with congratulations for winning a bonus game:</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126120/333027/mega-dice-bonus-game.jpg" alt="mega dice $1m fortune win - bonus game" width="2398" /></figure>
<p>Then, halfway through the session, the punter was on a x8 total win. Not bad: </p>

<p>But soon the big money started to roll. A few spins and holds later and the total win had grown to 2,018x:</p>

<p>The player started off with a not-inconsiderable balance of $48,862 and walked away from the slots with 1,056,862 sitting in their account.</p>

<h2>It all goes to prove what a great proposition for bettors Mega Dice is</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although it is not so great for the house when a high-roller breezes in and walks away with a cool million, it is excellent publicity nevertheless.</p>
<p>Naturally, the casino will be hoping that the mega winner will be sticking around to continue wagering at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice">Mega Dice</a>.</p>

<h2>Telegram and Mega Dice are the perfect market fit</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Supported by the advantages of decentralization that flow from blockchain technology, Mega Dice is a trustless system, meaning it delivers the peace of mind of provable randomness, transparency, and the efficiency of on-chain gambling.  </p>
<p>Also, players have flocked to the casino, thanks in large part to its ease of use and the ability to play on Telegram without having to go through a laborious KYC process, as that is all handled at the Telegram end as a function of the phone number associated with the account.</p>
<p>Messaging app Telegram has built a stellar reputation by beating the competition in ways that make a crypto-powered casino the perfect fit. </p>
<p>Features such as the ability to create groups of unlimited size, unbreakable end-to-end encryption, and a powerful and versatile platform for hosting and running bots all come into their own for Mega Dice <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-casinos.htm">Telegram Casino</a>. </p>
<p>The casino includes a fully featured live casino with thousands of games.</p>
<p>Among the top providers in the live casino are Evolution Gaming and crazy popular titles with the crypto crowd, Plinko, and Aviator by Spribe.</p>
<p>Accessible through the easy-to-use Telegram app, there are slots favorites such as Gates of Olympus and Wanted Dead or Alive, as well as classic Novomatic titles like Book of Ra.    </p>

<h2>Mega Dice Telegram Casino is super convenient and easy to use </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Telegram’s ease of use can&#8217;t be beaten. Users of the Mega Dice Telegram Casino are verified through the telephone number associated with their account, so there is no tiresome and timely know-your-customer (KYC) onboarding to navigate.</p>
<p>Literally, in a couple of clicks, you can be up and running on the casino and making your first bet. A Telegram account is all you need to get started at Mega Dice. As the casino is licensed by the Curacao Gaming Control Board, naturally all license requirements are adhered to.</p>

<h2>Mega Dice is one of Telegram’s few licensed gambling operators, so your funds are safe</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Mega Dice is one of the few licensed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">crypto gambling operators</a> on Telegram. It is owned and operated by MIBS B.V., which has a Master Gaming License issued by the Governor of the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao.</p>
<p>The company complies with the EU’s strict anti-money laundering rules, so there is no need to worry about the platform being closed down by the authorities or your account holdings being endangered. </p>
<p>Also, gambling is not for everyone, and some can get in over their heads, so Mega Dice has signed up for the Responsible Gambling code of practice. </p>
<p>The Mega Dice platform complies with all legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates. </p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Mega Dice, join the <a href="https://t.me/Megadicecasino"><u>Community Telegram group</u></a>, where players engage with each other and the team is on hand to answer all your questions.

<h2>Mega Dice Casino, With Telegram’s help, is disrupting the $80 billion online gambling industry</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Mega Dice is not just targeting crypto users. It believes its full spectrum approach to accessing its products means there is something for everyone.</p>
<p>The team at Mega Dice has its online gambling industry competitors in its sights. Online is the fastest-growing sector of the gambling industry, forecast to be <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230601005842/en/Global-Online-Gambling-Market-Report-2023-Blockchain-IoT-and-VR-Technologies-are-Changing-the-Online-Gambling-Landscape---ResearchAndMarkets.com"><u>valued at $86 billion</u></a> in 2023. </p>
<p>Onboarding with Telegram adds another strong to Mega Dice’s competitive bow, where at the click of a button you can access the full casino and sportsbook service. </p>
<p>What’s more, Telegram aims to become a ‘super app’ in the same way that WeChat has in China, where all sorts of applications, from money transfer to playing games are available. </p>
<p>Telegram’s intent is shown in the teasing of the rollout of so-called <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps"><u>Mini Apps</u></a>, which will add even more power to the bot universe of tools on Telegram that already makes the platform so much more than a messaging app. <br /> </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126120/333019/telegram-web-apps-in-your.jpg" alt="Telegram Mini Apps - Mega Dice at the cutting edge with the next super app" width="1608" /></figure>
<p>Mega Dice is on the inside lane of an exciting future for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">online gambling</a> powered by Telegram functionality, security and ease of use combined with the transparency of blockchain. </p>
<p>As Telegram’s reach expands beyond its current user base of 800 million monthly active users, it will provide an ever-expanding audience for Mega Dice.</p>
<p>And if you are not a crypto-first person and still prefer ordinary ‘fiat’ money, Mega Dice has that covered too. </p>
<p>On the mobile and desktop versions of Mega Dice you can deposit fiat currency using various payment methods, including Wire transfer, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, for those not yet using crypto. </p>
<p>The same on-ramping service is also available on the Telegram casino, making for convenient use with the currency and payment method of your choosing.</p>
<p>Mega Dice combines the advantages of decentralized crypto-based betting with the tech-savvy of Telegram to create a new way of accessing betting services. </p>
<p>It is super slick and frictionless to use and will soon be appealing to millions of potential new users, both the casual wagerer who homes in on special occasions such as big annual sporting events and the more experienced betters.<br /> </p>

The new paradigm to achieve this end is Stake-to-Mine.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply by depositing your $BTCMTX tokens into the staking pool <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contract</a>, stakers earn credits that can then be used to mine Bitcoin in the cloud.</p><h2>Safe and secure cloud mining with Bitcoin Minetrix ends the reign of the fraudsters</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There&rsquo;s no need to join a mining pool or sign up for a cloud mining service with cash and risk it being stolen by the many fraudsters that sadly plague the sector.</p><p>Cilinix points out that the project is based in T&#8217;bilisi, Georgia, in eastern Europe, a country that is welcoming to crypto, so there are no regulatory worries, which can sometimes be an issue for miners as bans in China illustrated.</p><p>The Cilinix YouTube channel has 33,500 subscribers.

For every ETH block produced, 158.5 $BTCMTX are rewarded.</p><p>To date, 34 million $BTCMTX has been staked.</p><p>Prudent investors should normally steer clear of high yields that sound too good to be true. But Bitcoin Minetrix yields are earned from the token supply allocated to rewards, so everything is above board and there&rsquo;s no complicated or impenetrable algorithmic modeling to unravel to determine the source of the yield<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126047/332827/bitcoin-minetrix-staking.jpg" alt="" width="2632" class="content-img"></figure><p>Melos Crypto gives a shout to the yield, which was running at 1,481% when that video was published.&nbsp;</p><p>The yield is dynamic and will trend lower as more stakers enter the pool, but even so, a 1,000%+ annual percentage yield is an astronomical return that partly explains the flood of cash flowing into the presale.&nbsp;</p><p>Melos Crypto is keen to tell his viewers that buying 20 graphic cards and hooking up to expensive electricity is going to get you nowhere fast. That&rsquo;s why he is so positive about Bitcoin Minetrix, although he provides the upfront disclaimer that his video is sponsored by the $BTCMTX team.&nbsp;</p><p>Melos Crypto has 50,500 subscribers. Check out the video below:</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://www.youtu.be/1GkCRtjP4G0[/embed]<h2>$BTCMTX income stream from staking &hellip; and from Bitcoin mining&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>When the mining is turned on, the $BTCMTX stake-to-earn period ends and crypto&rsquo;s first Stake-to-Mine system comes into play, again managed automatically by smart contracts.</p><p>So not only do stakers earn yield up until the platform is built, they then get a profit income from the mining activity, depending on how many tokens they decide to devote to the Stake-to-Mine process.</p><p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-network-hits-new-record-hash-rate-above-300-ehs.htm">Bitcoin hashrate</a> is a measure of how much computing power is employed in verifying blocks of transactions. How much hash power is available for mining blocks is a rough measure of faith in the system and the prospects for profitability now and in the future.</p><p>Substantial capital outlays are required to mine Bitcoin, which makes a system where an intermittent, fully decentralized approach is possible particularly appealing for those of modest means.</p><p>These are points brought home by another YouTube influencer, this time Zach Humphries, with 116,000 subscribers:&nbsp;</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://www.youtu.be/4TKXCqeHP3M[/embed]<p>A key factor in determining mining profitability is the cost of the electricity to run the SIC rigs that are operating 24/7 around the clock. That has seen mining activity increasingly gravitate to regions that can offer low power costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Hydroelectricity, for example, has provided a cheap and green power source for Bitcoin miners.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bitcoin Minetrix keeps the complications and capital outlay out of the equation</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Meanwhile, cheap fossil-fuel-based subsidized generation in places like China, despite a supposed ban on mining, continues to command a significant share of the hashrate.</p><p>Increasingly the United States has come to the fore, again where electricity generation in certain states is cheaper than the Western average and can make mining a profitable activity.</p><p>Another factor that impacts miners&rsquo; decision-making and profitability is the difficulty mechanism of the Bitcoin protocol. As more hash power is deployed, the difficulty of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-work.htm">proof-of-work</a> verification process at the heart of mining increases.&nbsp;</p><p>With so many moving parts to consider, and the capital expense, it makes the cloud option even more enticing.</p><p>It is one of the reasons why Michael Wrubel proclaimed to his 310,000 subscribers that &ldquo;I am bullish on BTCMTX&rdquo;:&nbsp;</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://www.youtu.be/Cr48YdiTmUA[/embed]<h2>Bitcoin Minetrix helps to keep Bitcoin decentralized</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Also, there&rsquo;s the overall health of the mining sector to consider and what that means for the users of Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>There is an ever-present danger of mining becoming overly centralized through big mining pools controlled by a few entities or where the hash power becomes concentrated in certain jurisdictions, such as when China was the main player in mining.</p><p>Centralization is a security risk as, at least theoretically, it could lead to a 51% attack, where a majority of hash power is controlled by one entity, and there is a central point of failure that undermines the censorship resistance of the entire network.</p><p>Bitcoin Minetrix disrupts the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-bitcoin-mining-works.htm">Bitcoin mining</a> industry in a way that adds to its decentralization and therefore helps to maintain and strengthen the decentralization &ndash; and therefore security &ndash; of the network.</p><p>Crypto expert analyst Austin Hilton reckons <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> is a hidden gem precisely because of its competitive value differentials as highlighted above. He even goes so far as to call it &ldquo;the ultimate altcoin now&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>He shares how he has looked into mining on his own account and always found it too expensive &ndash; that was until Bitcoin Minetrix came along.&nbsp;</p><iframe title="Unveiling This Hidden Crypto Gem!

This is the minting mechanism of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin.htm">Bitcoin protocol</a>.</p><p>On the face of it, reduced rewards for mining Bitcoin should be a negative for miners but fewer coins coming into circulation puts upward pressure on prices. So even though the number of coins being minted/earned falls, the actual value of each coin rises.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what has happened in all previous mining cycles and is expected to happen again as the halving event approaches on April 25, 2024.</p><p>Bitcoin Minetrix&rsquo;s exposure to Bitcoin mining economics upside while minimizing the capital risks provides one of the best ways of gaining exposure to the halving investment theme.</p><p>With that in mind, it is no wonder that Bitcoin Minetrix is being cited by presale analyst Jacob Crypto Bury as having 10x return potential:<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://youtu.be/HOtU4UfV_3Y?si=Gv3wABQc6ERwnBGd[/embed]<p>Conor Kenny, a YouTube influencer with 165,000, is cheerleading for Bitcoin Minetrix and, again, is also blown away by the simplicity of the idea and the passive income routes it opens up for ordinary folk.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://youtu.be/b2bluNTXWZg?si=tRobMTTocdv2qnI9[/embed]<p>Crypto ZEUS is similarly impressed by the hugely disruptive possibilities presented by Bitcoin Minetrix and emphasizes the opportunity to get in early:</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://youtu.be/kweBOIuLmVs?si=j7v8mMdxuXqISvTP[/embed]<h2>How to buy Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Stake-to-Mine innovator Bitcoin Minetrix is in phase 1 of its four-part roadmap.

That compares with $79 million for Pepe, $103 million for Shiba Inu, and $222 million for Dogecoin &ndash; no mean achievement for a six-day-old token.</p><p>Over the weekend, $WSM was beating both Pepe and Shiba Inu in 24-hour volume traded. Rumors swirl that the next exchanges to list $WSM could include Binance or Kucoin.&nbsp;</p><p>As volume continues to pile up for Wall Street Memes, trading interest is exactly the metric that exchanges seeking out new coins to list are most interested in.</p><h2><strong>$WSM is the 4th most traded meme coin in the past 7 days</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/125883/332407/wsm-4th-most-traded-meme-.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/125883/332407/responsive-images/wsm-4th-most-traded-meme-___media_library_original_1600_816.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332407/responsive-images/wsm-4th-most-traded-meme-___media_library_original_1200_612.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332407/responsive-images/wsm-4th-most-traded-meme-___media_library_original_900_459.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332407/responsive-images/wsm-4th-most-traded-meme-___media_library_original_720_367.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332407/responsive-images/wsm-4th-most-traded-meme-___media_library_original_600_306.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332407/responsive-images/wsm-4th-most-traded-meme-___media_library_original_300_153.jpg 300w" width="1600" class="content-img" alt=""><figcaption>Coin Market Cap</figcaption></figure><p>At the moment $WSM can be traded on OKX, HTX, MEXC, LBank, CoinEx, BitMart and BingX centralized exchanges. It took Pepe 17 days from listing on decentralized exchanges to list on Binance, when its price rocketed 2,000%.</p><p>As &lsquo;Uptober&rsquo; and altcoin season kicks off, $WSM has exploded onto the scene at just the right time.</p><p>The fourth quarter of the year, going by past performance, is usually the best for crypto, and 2023 is looking like it will be no different in that respect.&nbsp;</p><p>What&rsquo;s good for crypto will of course be good for meme coins in general and $WSM in particular.</p><p>Wall Street Memes has also been attracting buyers because of its verifiable connection with multi-billionaire Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. Musk has interacted with the WallStMemes&rsquo; X (formerly Twitter) account on a number of occasions.</p><h2><strong>MEXC exchange initiates futures trading in $WSM</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Meanwhile, in an important breakthrough for a meme coin, the MEXC exchange has opened the first <a href="https://futures.mexc.com/exchange/WSM_USDT"><u>futures market for the $WSM/USDT token pair</u></a>, adding to positive sentiment for the new meme coin. The crypto futures markets are far bigger than the spot ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Market participants should expect to see other trading venues follow MEXC&rsquo;s lead, as exchanges compete to attract trading volume around popular trending tokens like $WSM.</p><p>News of $WSM debuting on futures markets comes in the wake of the launch of two new Ether-based futures exchange traded funds (ETFs): Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight (BTOP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Also helping to drive price momentum today for crypto &ndash; and $WSM &ndash; was the news that US exchange Coinbase has just landed a payments license from Singapore financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/125883/332408/fabri-crypto-wsm-prediction.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/125883/332408/responsive-images/fabri-crypto-wsm-prediction___media_library_original_1318_1258.jpg 1318w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332408/responsive-images/fabri-crypto-wsm-prediction___media_library_original_1200_1145.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332408/responsive-images/fabri-crypto-wsm-prediction___media_library_original_900_859.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332408/responsive-images/fabri-crypto-wsm-prediction___media_library_original_720_687.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332408/responsive-images/fabri-crypto-wsm-prediction___media_library_original_600_573.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/125883/332408/responsive-images/fabri-crypto-wsm-prediction___media_library_original_300_286.jpg 300w" width="1318" class="content-img" alt=""><figcaption>X / FabriLemus7</figcaption></figure><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WSM&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$WSM</a> REVERSAL INCOMING <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/xDhPLvayyl">pic.twitter.com/xDhPLvayyl</a></p>&mdash; FABRI CRYPTO (@FabriLemus7) <a href="https://twitter.com/FabriLemus7/status/1708588377199554677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2><strong>Wall Street Memes is the first top meme coin with utility by design</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Wall Street Memes aims to democratize the financial system by bringing its King of Stonks success with meme stocks to crypto.

There are now 36,706 members of its <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram channel</u></a>, where activity is frenetic as excitement about the project continues to grow.</p><p>An overarching theme driving interest in $WSM is the fact that in many ways it is not the average meme coin.&nbsp;</p><p>Meme coins, almost by definition, don&#8217;t do anything much other than pay homage to a meme character and stimulate the birth of a community around that.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding utility, if at all, is something that comes much later and is often an afterthought at best, as in the case of Shiba Inu.</p><p>Sure, as with all crypto, meme coins have the ultimate utility of being exchangeable, but as we know, the theory and practice of that are two entirely different things &ndash; in other words, the tokens can be issued, but whether they are actually exchangeable for goods and services depends on the potential receiving party.</p><p>However, the team at Wall Street Memes, by design, has been focused on utility from the outset.</p><p>To that end, it has been announced that a major product will be launched this month.

Its mission to democratize finance and take on Wall Street is finding an eager following in the crypto space.</p><p>Also, the project is being helped by the fact that Elon Musk has interacted with its X (formerly Twitter) account. There are even rumors that Musk may be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-whale-invests-1-million-wall-street-memes-presale-20-million-milestone-hit-wsm-next-meme-coin-explode.htm">whale buyers</a> of $WSM.</p><p>Add to that the fact that $WSM has staking utility out of the box, unlike many throwaway <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coins</a> that have no utility features.</p><p>Buying interest is being further incentivized by the news that the team will be launching at least one major product in October and undertaking a burn program. There were murmurs about product launches during the presale, but it is now official.</p><p>A product(s) linked to the $WSM token would boost its utility, potentially also boosting its demand, while a buyback program would decrease the $WSM token supply over time, increasing its scarcity and the value of remaining tokens.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/125827/332258/wsm-hot-pair-on-dextools.jpg" alt="WSM hot pair on DEXTools" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/125827/332258/responsive-images/wsm-hot-pair-on-dextools___media_library_original_910_703.jpg 910w, https://cimg.co/news/125827/332258/responsive-images/wsm-hot-pair-on-dextools___media_library_original_900_695.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/125827/332258/responsive-images/wsm-hot-pair-on-dextools___media_library_original_720_556.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/125827/332258/responsive-images/wsm-hot-pair-on-dextools___media_library_original_600_464.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/125827/332258/responsive-images/wsm-hot-pair-on-dextools___media_library_original_300_232.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="910" class="content-img"></figure><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wallstmemes.com/en"><u>Visit Wall Street Memes Here</u></a></p><h2>Trading volume beats Shiba Inu and Pepe &ndash; more top exchange listings coming in 3 days</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Wall Street Memes has ratcheted up 24-hour trading volume of $79 million, currently beating Siba Inu on $74 million and Pepe on $70 million.</p><p>As the market pulls in more traders, other big exchanges in addition to the likes of OKX and Huobi will be taking note.</p><p>Prior to its first listing, there were rumors of a Binance launch.

But, as mentioned, $WSM has utility that coins like Doge and Pepe lack. Even Shiba Inu, which has returned 26,000% for some early investors, has struggled to add a utility layer, as seen in its stuttering Shibarium launch.</p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.okx.com/trade-spot/wsm-usdt">OKX</a> and Huobi, MEXC, BitMart, LBank and Coinex have also listed $WSM, less than a week since launch.</p><p>The more exchanges $WSM is available on, the easier it is for retail investors to buy the token, creating a bullish virtuous circle for the price.</p><p>Regarding $WSM&rsquo;s yield-bearing utility, 540 million token are staked, earning an annual percentage yield of 37%. So as well as capital appreciation, owners of the $WSM token can lock in a passive income stream, making the token doubly attractive.</p><p>Traders should also note that Wall Street Memes is currently conducting a generous $50,000 airdrop competition, which can be entered <a href="https://t.co/ykaumLsjJ4"><u>on Gleam</u></a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 50K <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WSM&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$WSM</a> AIRDROP ALERT <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>Buy Now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/7wNmO5yIO5">https://t.co/7wNmO5yIO5</a><br><br>Enter Now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/ykaumLsjJ4">https://t.co/ykaumLsjJ4</a> <a href="https://t.co/ENuHb9mMlQ">pic.twitter.com/ENuHb9mMlQ</a></p>&mdash; Wall Street Memes (@wallstmemes) <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes/status/1707438245280141560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>As news about Wall Street Memes spreads like wildfire across the crypto space, it might not be too long before Elon Musk tweets about it.
