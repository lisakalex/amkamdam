<p>AI and metaverse technologies firm <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-startups-secure-2014m-funding-futureverse-risc-zero-lead-way.htm"><strong>Futureverse</strong></a> and American sports culture brand <strong>Reebok</strong> have joined hands to create AI, Web3, blockchain-based gaming, and metaverse experiences.</p>
<p>While the two are expected to make digital versions of Reebok wearables linked to non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heres-why-gamers-are-splurging-on-square-enixs-quirky-nft-characters.htm">NFTs</a>), it seems that they will focus heavily on gaming and metaverse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/futureverse--reebok-announce-exclusive-partnership-to-leverage-cutting-edge-ai-and-metaverse-technology-to-revolutionize-digital-fashion-302009135.html">According</a> to the press release, the premier collaboration &#8216;Reebok Impact&#8217; &#8211; digital shoes merged with AI and on-chain digital wearables &#8211; is set to launch in 2024.</p>
<p>It stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Reebok and Futureverse will debut &#8220;Reebok Impact,&#8221; a mind and heart-bending digital shoe experience that will allow mass consumers to dive into artificial intelligence and digital wearables.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Futureverse co-founders Shara Senderoff and Aaron McDonald commented that the collaboration is a fusion of artificial intelligence (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-ai-poses-serious-threat-to-humanitys-dominance.htm">AI</a>), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-web3-gaming-investment-arena-overcorrecting-possibly-wax-exec-says.htm">Web3</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-boost-gta-vi-trailer-leak-features-buy-btc-message.htm">gaming</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/megadeth-drops-nft-collection-offers-exclusive-access-to-metaverse-and-real-world-events.htm">metaverse</a> technologies. It will transform how consumers define digital fashion, they argued.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an invitation for consumers to step into a world in which their digital footprint is as significant as their physical one,&#8221; said the co-founders.</p>
<p>Todd Krinsky, CEO of Reebok, added that this major brand is &#8220;deeply entrenched&#8221; in consumer trends and transformative technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the companies said, this is just the first step in their long-term partnership.</p>
<p>They will continue to expand and add functionality and integrations. The two also have plans to launch new experiences.</p>
<h2>Participant, Not Spectator</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While the digital shoes are yet to hit the market, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlCFhu2Flo0">teaser video</a> has already been revealed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to partner with <a href="https://twitter.com/futureverse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@futureverse</a> to launch <a href="https://twitter.com/ReebokImpact?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ReebokImpact</a> in 2024, a mind and heart-bending digital shoe experience that will allow our community and beyond to dive into AI and digital wearables. <a href="https://t.co/uH4CgAiYQn">https://t.co/uH4CgAiYQn</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Reebok (@Reebok) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reebok/status/1732794420540449091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Through it, Reebok is promoting its &#8220;life is not a spectator sport&#8221; campaign. CEO Krinsky commented that the company&#8217;s ethos &#8220;champions the principle of moving with purpose and stepping out into the world as a participant, not a spectator.&#8221;</p>
<p>This campaign aligns with Futureverse&#8217;s &#8220;play-to-learn&#8221; strategy, the announcement said. The latter focuses on onboarding consumers via hands-on experiences.</p>
<p>According to the press release,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For people who want to show the world that life is not a spectator sport, Reebok Impact will leverage shared experiences that allow consumers to share major life moments that have shaped who they are and simultaneously impacted the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The company further opened a separate, Reebok Impact <a href="https://twitter.com/ReebokImpact">account</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in December 2021, Reebok <a href="https://www.rfox.com/blogs/reebok-and-a-ap-nast-drop-limited-edition-nfts-on-rfoxs-nft-platform-all-minted-in-under-5-minutes">partnered</a> with the metaverse company <strong>RFOX</strong>.

<p>Now, Futureverse stated that there is more than an NFT collection to its collaboration with Reebok.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">More. Make sure you’re following  <a href="https://twitter.com/ReebokImpact?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ReebokImpact</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ab.png" alt="💫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Before <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> had time to release the official version, an anonymous leaker revealed the <strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong> trailer &#8211; donning a buy-BTC ad.</p>
<p>There has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/will-gta-6-incorporate-an-in-game-cryptocurrency-lawyer-shares-insights.htm">a lot of debate</a> over whether the much-anticipated game would feature an in-game cryptoasset. Many wondered if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-execs-argue-bull-run-could-lead-to-100000-btc-in-2024-more-news.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> would be included in any way.</p>
<p>And somebody did find a way to include it.</p>
<p>The first one to reveal the trailer to the world earlier this week seems to have been the Twitter account &#8216;Gta6trailerleak.&#8217;</p>
<p>And though the account was banned pretty quickly, everything stays on the Internet. Other accounts saw it and started sharing it.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can still be <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetBTCX/status/1731812220479136231">found</a> today.</p>
<p>Notably, the &#8216;Buy BTC&#8217; is prominently placed throughout the shared video.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guy leaked the GTA VI trailer with a “Buy $BTC” watermark </p>
<p>Legend <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4af.png" alt="💯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The trailer looks dope, it’s the most anticipated game in history. </p>
<p>A message the world needed to hear<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44f-1f3fd.png" alt="👏🏽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>&mdash; Wall Street Bitcoin (@WallStreetBTCX) <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetBTCX/status/1731812220479136231?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It is safe to say that the company wouldn&#8217;t have taken this route &#8211; to cover the entire video &#8211; even if it were to feature BTC anytime in the future.</p>
<p>The fifth installment of GTA was launched in September 2013. The game is developed by the British development house <strong>Rockstar North</strong>. It is published by its American parent company, Rockstar Games.</p>
<p>On December 5, shortly after the leak, the company shared the official trailer. The new game is expected to be released in 2025.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello <a href="https://twitter.com/X?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@X</a>, watch Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1 <a href="https://t.co/smzxOLhh4o">pic.twitter.com/smzxOLhh4o</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the leaker&#8217;s Twitter account has been taken down.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Dad, What happened to GTA6trailerleak? ” <a href="https://t.co/i2cEVleXs6">pic.twitter.com/i2cEVleXs6</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Did the BTC Price React?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Though it was unexpected, or precisely because of it, the GTA-BTC trailer caused quite a stir. And not only in the crypto sphere, but in the mainstream gaming arena as well.</p>
<p>Some even argued that this may have been one of the most effective BTC ads yet. One of them is developer Udi Wertheimer.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">yesterday we saw the best mainstream bitcoin marketing campaign in years</p>
<p>the gta6 trailer was leaked early. the leakers slapped a huge “BUY $BTC” caption on it</p>
<p>millions of gamers couldn’t stop talking about it</p>
<p>2 min video, more effective than 10,000 hours of laser-eye podcasts <a href="https://t.co/5vAED3BdvL">pic.twitter.com/5vAED3BdvL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1732065838658621476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But what did the price of the coin have to say about it?</p>
<p>Notably, BTC had already been on the rise when the leaked trailer went live. So, it&#8217;s unclear how much (if at all) the trailer may have contributed to it.</p>
<p>Most experts have been contributing the recent price increase to, at least in part, the overall expectation for a potential Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/super-majority-of-bitcoin-holders-are-now-back-in-profit-more-news.htm">ETF</a>) approval in the USA.</p>
<p>That said, the BTC&#8217;s highest price on December 4 was $42,008, compared to December 3&#8217;s highest of $39,760.</p>
<p>It continued to climb, hitting $44,313 on December 6, per <strong>CoinGecko</strong>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing (Thursday morning, 10:45 UTC), BTC was trading at $43,259. It was down 2% in a day, up 15% in a week and 24% in a month.</p>
<p>Overall, it appreciated 157% over the past year.</p>

<h2>Super-Majority of Bitcoin Holders Are Now Back in Profit &#8211; Glassnode</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/biggest-crypto-gainers-today-on-uniswap-odoge-ord-matter.htm">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> has broken above the psychological $40,000 level, it appreciated over 140% year-to-date, it has more than doubled relative to gold, and it still dominates against the rest of the digital asset industry, <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-49-2023/">according</a> to on-chain analysis firm <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-introduce-innovative-framework-decode-bitcoin-economy-bear-market.htm">Glassnode</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Compared to previous cycles, the BTC return profile is “eerily similar” to the 2015-17 and 2018-22 cycles in terms of recovery duration and drawdown since the all-time high, it said, and added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“With such strong performance, the super-majority of Bitcoin holders are now back in profit, with a small proportion of them realizing those gains.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Several on-chain metrics suggest the recent rally is pushing the market out of a ‘transitional recovery zone.’ It now more closely resembles an ‘enthusiastic bull market.’</p>
<h2>‘There is Room for BTC to Rally Freely,’ Says Criptonite Exec</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Mathieu Ziaei, Portfolio Manager and Risk Officer at Swiss regulated digital asset investment manager <strong>Criptonite Asset Management</strong>, after the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vip-binance-traders-reportedly-heard-of-doj-settlement-in-september.htm"><strong>Binance</strong> and <strong>US DOJ</strong> settlement</a>, there is hype around the market’s belief that a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/institutional-funds-to-ethereum-products-flips-green-as-asset-trades-above-2200.htm">ETF</a>) would be approved in January 2024 and that the ETF will bring significant cash inflows to BTC – increasing prices across the crypto market.</p>
<p>Ziaei said in an email that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“My personal opinion is that traders are going to front run the ETF with the current price action of Bitcoin. I think that around $48,000 should be the local top for bitcoin on the short term. It’s been a long time since the planets have been aligned this perfectly. With the ETF hype, end of the financial cycle and most of the risks have been eliminated, this leaves room for bitcoin to rally freely.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are also rumors of &#8220;financial easing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the shift in market dynamics, traders or fund managers holding a short position in digital assets would not be in a good position, Ziaei said in an email. “I would find it hard for anyone to justify having a short position on bitcoin now with all the positive news,” he added.</p>
<p>Black Swan events such as <strong>FTX</strong>, <strong>Luna</strong>, and <strong>Three Arrows</strong> have acted as a cleansing force, creating a bearish sentiment – which may reverse once even more euphoria kicks in, likely driven by the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US.</p>
<p>However, there is also a high probability of the &#8220;buy the rumor, sell the fact&#8221; move in early 2024, leading to a sharp move to the downside.</p>
<h2>Amazon Prime Gaming Members Can Now Access Gods Unchained Content</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Web3 game development platform <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/games-backed-by-disney-alibaba-google-square-enix-will-build-on-immutable-zkevm-blockchain-gaming-to-become-synonymous-with-gaming.htm">Immutable Games</a></strong> announced that in-game content for its flagship trading card game (TCG) <strong>Gods Unchained</strong> is now available to <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-pos-now-supported-by-amazon-managed-blockchain-access.htm">Amazon Prime Gaming</a></strong> members.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazon-prime-gaming-members-can-now-access-content-from-gods-unchained-302006384.html">Per</a> the press release, as part of this collaboration, Prime Gaming members who connect their in-game accounts will gain monthly access to exclusive in-game items.</p>
<p>This announcement coincides with the Season 2 launch of Gods Unchained, named &#8220;Far Horizons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with Amazon Prime Gaming. Season 2 offers a new chapter in the game&#8217;s ever-evolving story that will introduce sweeping changes to the meta and players&#8217; strategies,&#8221; said Daniel Paez, VP and Executive Producer of Gods Unchained.</p>
<p>The new experience will be accompanied by <strong>Tides of Fate</strong>, the company&#8217;s first major card expansion set since <strong>Mortal Judgement</strong> over a year ago.</p>
<p>The Tides of Fate set includes 142 collectible cards and nine in-game-only &#8220;chained&#8221; cards, which are linked to the effects of other cards.</p>
<p>Going forward, Gods Unchained is gearing up for its full launch on mobile devices, the announcement said.</p>
<h2>Bitrefill Partners with Suku to Launch Cashback NFTs Minted by Tweeting</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-platform-strike-and-checkout-com-partner-to-bring-bitcoin-buying-to-65-countries.htm">Bitrefill</a></strong>, a digital marketplace for gift cards that can be purchased with crypto, launched an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heres-why-gamers-are-splurging-on-square-enixs-quirky-nft-characters.htm">NFT</a> campaign with Web3 wallet <strong>Suku</strong>. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitrefill-partners-suku-launch-cashback-170000514.html">According</a> to the announcement, the campaign enables anyone to mint a &#8220;Secret Code&#8221; cashback NFT by posting a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/elon-musks-x-social-media-platform-acquires-crypto-payments-license.htm">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Any Twitter user can mint by tweeting bitrefill and sukuthis, which automatically generates a unique Bitrefill NFT containing a one-time-use code that redeems cashback on any gift card in the Bitrefill marketplace.</p>
<p>There is also a gamified component to the mints, with people having the chance to earn anywhere from 10% to 50% cashback NFTs.</p>
<p>After posting the Tweet, the user receives an NFT in their automatically-created Suku wallet, which abstracts away complicated seed phrases and private keys, the companies said, enabling an easy onramp into Web3.</p>

Nubank&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://international.nubank.com.br/consumers/nubank-partners-with-circle-to-offer-experiences-with-digital-dollars/">added</a> that the USDC availability in the country will be &#8220;gradually rolled out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The press release stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Availability of USDC on Nubank’s crypto platform is phase one of extending USDC access across Nubank’s products to more than 85M Brazilian customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, USDC support will be launched on the crypto platform <strong>Nubank Cripto</strong>. This will enable its Brazilian users to buy and hold the USD-backed stablecoin.</p>
<p>Future plans include integration with Nubank&#8217;s &#8220;broader digital banking platforms.&#8221; Therefore, the customers will benefit from blockchain-based financial services powered by USDC, the bank said.</p>
<p>Thomaz Fortes, General Manager of Nubank Cripto, opined that the USDC integration creates &#8220;great opportunities&#8221; for customers interested in having digital dollars in their portfolio.</p>
<p>He added that, &#8220;through this offering and the characteristics of Circle’s USDC, we are considering future possibilities to integrate Nubank Cripto with other financial services available in our app.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1732103407983640970"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139768" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701861607-screenshot-2023-12-06-120254.png" alt="" width="589" height="707" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701861607-screenshot-2023-12-06-120254.png 589w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701861607-screenshot-2023-12-06-120254-250x300.png 250w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701861607-screenshot-2023-12-06-120254-150x180.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></a></p>
<h2>Strong Demand for Access to USD</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The partnership includes contributions by both companies to campaigns that spread knowledge about USDC in the Brazilian market, said the announcement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nubank Cripto found that the USDC addition to the app meets the demands of active crypto holders. It also &#8220;keeps up with the constant evolution of the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire commented that there is a &#8220;strong demand&#8221; across <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-bakkt-reveals-international-and-domestic-expansion-justin-sun-offers-5-bounty-metaverse-platform-zep-to-build-on-near.htm">Latin America</a> for access to dollars. This is specifically the case in Brazil. This country, said Allaire, has emerged as a driving force for the region&#8217;s digital currency use and adoption.</p>
<p>Per the bank,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The accessibility factor should also be highlighted, as regulated digital dollars can be acquired without needing a global account, and competent authorities regulate their issuance with an independent audit process.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Nubank is a major digital financial platform, serving 90 million customers across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia.</p>
<p>With USDC, it has added 11 new crypto options to its platform in 2023. In November alone, it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bullish-brazilian-bank-nubank-adds-five-more-altcoins-to-banking-app.htm">added</a> trading capabilities for five altcoins to its banking app.</p>
<p>The bank launched crypto trading functions on the app in May 2022, offering customers access to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-price-to-hit-50k-soon-as-traders-rush-to-buy-up-bitcoin-etf-btcetf-token-after-successful-2-5-million-raise.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-spot-ethereum-etf-until-january-2024.htm">ethereum (ETH)</a>.</p>
<p>That same year, it announced its intention to buy BTC using its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Nubank also said it wanted to convert 1% of its available funds to BTC via its holding company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it launched its own cryptoasset, <strong>Nucoin</strong>, serving as a utility token for the loyalty program.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bank is working with the <strong>Central Bank of Brazil</strong> on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brazilian-central-bank-digital-currency-raises-alarm-as-developer-uncovers-fund-freezing-feature.htm">the real digital CBDC pilot project</a> with several local crypto companies.</p>
<p>Nubank’s major backers include Warren Buffet, <strong>Sequoia Capital</strong>, <strong>Tiger Global Management</strong>, and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>.</p>

<h2>Investors Believe the US Fed Will Pause Rate Hikes &#8211; Bitfinex Analysts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bitfinex-Alpha-83.pdf">According</a> to the latest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitfinexs-tokenized-bond-falls-short-of-investment-target-raises-only-1-5m-of-expected-10m.htm"><strong>Bitfinex</strong></a> report, &#8220;financial markets are now leaning towards a potential interest rate cut by the Fed [<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sofi-to-exit-crypto-business-amid-increased-regulatory-scrutiny.htm"><strong>Federal Reserve</strong></a>], with the CME FedWatch Tool indicating a 78 percent likelihood of such a move by the end of their May meeting in 2024. This is a notable shift from just a month ago when the probability was pegged at 41 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The analysts added that &#8220;investors currently believe the Fed will pause its rate hikes, viewing its current policy as sufficiently restrictive to moderate growth and stabilise prices without triggering a recession. This delicate balance is crucial for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-doj-seizes-9-million-in-usdt-from-cyber-scam-organization-tether-to-onboard-fbi.htm">US</a> economy as it navigates through uncertain economic conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-transaction-fees-outpace-ethereum-defi-tvl-surges-11-in-november-binance.htm">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> reached a new year-to-date high, reaching over $41,646 on December 4, surpassing its previous trading range&#8217;s upper limit, to which it had been confined for several weeks. The new peak came after BTC had seen its strongest monthly close since March 2022.</p>
<p><strong>BTC/USD Weekly Chart </strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_139409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139409" style="width: 756px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139409" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783113-bitfinex.png" alt="" width="756" height="357" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783113-bitfinex.png 756w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783113-bitfinex-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783113-bitfinex-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783113-bitfinex-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783113-bitfinex-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139409" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Bitfinex</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bitfinex analysts said that this upward movement can be attributed to a combination of factors, including a notable shift in the dynamics of the futures market compared to the spot market.</p>
<p>There was significant buying activity in the market, particularly aimed at absorbing the supply above $37,500, near the upper boundary of its recent trading range, they said. On December 1, BTC was still hovering below the range high.</p>
<p>Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) for the futures market, which measures BTC’s mid- to long-term buy and sell pressure by comparing buying and selling volume over time, was more resilient on downswings on the lower time frames than the CVD for the spot markets. As a result, the market was in a state of &#8220;perp premium,&#8221; implying a high relative difference in demand for BTC in the futures market compared to the spot markets.</p>
<p>This may be seen as a signal to be cautious in other contexts, as more leverage in the markets is not always healthy, they said, but it was notable that at the same time, open interest declined.</p>
<h2>Bear Market Applies &#8216;Fruit-Fly Crypto-Founder&#8217; Filter, Says NFX&#8217;s Morgan Beller</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Morgan Beller, general partner at <strong>NFX</strong>, a VC firm investing in pre-seed and seed-stage startups, said that &#8220;when the market was nuts,&#8221; the type of founders that can be described as &#8220;fruit flies&#8221; came into the crypto market.</p>
<p>Beller <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-12-04/nfx-bitcoin-regulation-needs-to-be-founder-friendly-video">told</a> Bloomberg that these founders thought it was like &#8220;the sexiest accessory to have a crypto company and thought overnight they would be worth a lot on paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>However,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What the market cooling down did is it filtered those founders out. So now you really only have founders coming in who really, really care, who actually have a problem to solve. So in a weird way, the bear market is very nice because it automatically applies a filter, at least to the top of the funnel of startups, that isn&#8217;t necessarily there in a bull market.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Asked about investments, she said that any project always needs to answer three questions: is this company solving a problem for anyone; is anyone using it; and is the product or company making money or has any potential to make money?</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you look at the history of crypto and crypto startups and blockchain companies, there&#8217;s very few that actually check all three of those boxes, let alone one or two. And Bitcoin is one of the few use cases that is, you know, checks all of those boxes and is real and is definitely a case study for potentially other investments,&#8221; Beller said.</p>
<p>Lastly, she added that she wished that crypto regulations were more founder-friendly in the US. If there were more clarity, she said, it would limit the amount of guessing or fear among founders looking to establish a crypto company in the US.</p>
<p>Beller is the co-founder of <strong>Libra</strong> and was Head of Strategy for <strong>Novi</strong>, <strong>Facebook’s</strong> digital wallet for the Libra payment system.</p>
<h2>The Notorious B.I.G. Lives On in the Metaverse</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ubisofts-nostalgic-leap-into-nfts-rayman-and-beyond-good-evil-characters-enter-the-sandbox.htm"><strong>The Sandbox</strong></a>, a decentralized gaming virtual world and subsidiary of <strong>Animoca Brands</strong>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/warner-music-polygon-labs-unleash-power-of-blockchain-for-music-innovation-1.htm"><strong>Warner Music Group</strong></a>, the global music entertainment company, <a href="https://www.wmg.com/news/experience-hip-hop-history-with-breakin-b-i-g-the-sandbox-and-warner-music-groups-latest-game-celebrating-the-legacy-of-the-notorious-b-i-g">announced</a> the launch of a new experience for hip-hop fans: &#8220;Breakin’ B.I.G.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is described as a nod to &#8220;the beloved side-scrolling games of the 1990s,&#8221; which immerses players in a neighborhood where The Notorious B.I.G. &#8220;reigns supreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>The game celebrates the era when US rapper Biggie rose to fame and brings the G.O.A.T. to today’s music fans in a whole new way, with homages to his Brooklyn roots and the formation of Junior M.A.F.I.A.</p>
<p>Several activities are set to launch in December, including the playable &#8220;Breakin’ B.I.G.&#8221; experience, an exclusive avatar collection, and the freshly revamped Warner Music Group social hub.</p>
<p>Players will be able to step into a 2D arcade-style world set in the music-infused backdrop of 1990s Brooklyn, where they assume the role of an aspiring rapper with deep admiration for Biggie, striving to make it big in the music industry, the announcement said.</p>
<p>Players will engage with Biggie and other characters to complete quests essential to earning his respect, &#8220;such as revitalizing Brooklyn neighborhoods, confronting those who dare to challenge Biggie’s influence, and assisting the hip-hop legend in achieving even greater success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Players will also be able to customize their digital selves with exclusive Biggie-themed avatars.</p>
<h2>Bitget Revales TraderPro Program with Zero Investment, Dual Profit-Making Reward</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-execs-argue-bull-run-could-lead-to-100000-btc-in-2024-more-news.htm"><strong>Bitget</strong></a> has launched the TraderPro program to give users the opportunity and incentives to become elite traders. <a href="https://www.bitget.com/support/articles/12560603800727">According</a> to the press release, the program is designed to identify &#8220;exceptional demo trading users who can become Elite traders on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>TraderPro Program is a demo trading competition that enables crypto traders to earn rewards of 10,000 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-doj-seizes-9-million-in-usdt-from-cyber-scam-organization-tether-to-onboard-fbi.htm">USDT</a> and dual profit &#8220;without investing real money.&#8221;  To provide greater recognition to top traders, Bitget offers initial investing capital to users, the company said.</p>
<p>The TraderPro program is divided into two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>TraderPro challenge phase: users join the TraderPro demo trading challenge and win by reaching certain goals;</li>
<li>Elite trader phase: users who win the challenge will become verified elite traders and receive funds to start making elite trades.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to trading profits, traders can grab a share of their followers&#8217; profits, it added. Users who stand out in the TraderPro program will also be highlighted in exclusive recommendation slots and labeled with special badges.</p>
<h2>European DeFi Platform Starts Offering Tokenized Gold and Silver</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-transaction-fees-outpace-ethereum-defi-tvl-surges-11-in-november-binance.htm">DeFi</a>) company <strong>Folks Finance</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/FolksFinance/status/1731706247261434051">said</a> it became the first platform to bring digital gold and silver to a wider audience by listing GOLD and SILVER — tokens tied to the real price of these precious metals.</p>
<p>Powered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-protocol-algorand-forms-strategic-collaborations-in-india-for-web3-push.htm"><strong>Algorand</strong></a>, these tokens facilitate lending, borrowing, and trading of precious metals directly on the Folks Finance platform, bringing traditional financial assets into the DeFi space, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each token is backed by a gram of physically secured gold or silver, enabling tangible assets to enter Algorand’s DeFi ecosystem for the first time. This historic development signifies a pivotal step in bridging conventional finance with decentralized finance, unlocking the utilization of real gold and silver in DeFi loans and trades,&#8221; the press relase said.</p>
<p>This strategic move is anticipated to draw in new users and capture the attention of traditional financial sector investors, Folks Finance added, given the accelerating growth of the real-world asset (RWA) market. Forecasts from digital asset management firm <strong>21.co</strong> predict the RWA industry could surge to $10 trillion by 2030.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/final-fantasy-publisher-square-enix-reveals-how-to-obtain-nfts-for-upcoming-game-symbiogenesis.htm"><strong>Square Enix</strong></a> has sold all character non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nike-rtfkt-nft-collections-generate-1-4-billion-in-trading-volume.htm">NFTs</a>) in the first auction for its upcoming game <strong>Symbiogenesis</strong>.</p>
<p>Square Enix is the publisher of titles such as <strong>Final Fantasy</strong>, <strong>Kingdom Hearts</strong>, and <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>. The company&#8217;s new projects are bound to draw major attention.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, the company decided to hold the auction in three phases between November 27 and December 3.</p>
<p>Notably, there was no public mint. Users had to join the Allow List Entry Campaign to mint NFT Characters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to suggest that this has contributed to the exclusivity aspect of the game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Phases 1 and 2 allowed users to bid only on one character. This means that more sought-after characters will see their prices rise swiftly.</p>
<p>And those who were outbid were allowed to move on to raise bids on a different character.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1730786393931337950">additional perks</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1729810208795557898">rewards</a> for top players were available along the way. Though not everybody enjoyed these, <a href="https://twitter.com/gh_rocks/status/1730862049511559284">describing</a> them as &#8216;overcomplicating things.&#8217;</p>
<p>The mint price for all phases started at 0 ETH. Bidding could be made in 0.01 ETH increments.</p>
<p>Winners will use these NFTs to log into the game, which is scheduled for launch on December 21.</p>
<h2>Sold Out</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Square Enix launched only 500 NFTs for Chapter 1 of the game. Ten were allocated for the first phase, 90 for the second, and 400 for the third.</p>
<p>On November 4, the team announced that &#8220;all 500 characters from Chapter 1 were minted.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_139363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139363" style="width: 651px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1731496147804664028"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139363" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701775343-screenshot-2023-12-05-121358.png" alt="" width="651" height="383" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701775343-screenshot-2023-12-05-121358.png 651w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701775343-screenshot-2023-12-05-121358-300x176.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701775343-screenshot-2023-12-05-121358-150x88.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139363" class="wp-caption-text">Source: symbiogenesisPR / Twitter</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some characters sold for over 1 ETH (currently $2,203). For example, Calyx <a href="https://symbiogenesis.app/">went for</a> 1 ETH, Newt for 1.3 ETH, and Wart for 1.6 ETH.</p>
<p>Murasaki was purchased for 2 ETH and Mistletoe for 2.06 ETH.</p>
<p>An additional selling factor is the combination of characters, story, and worldbuilding.</p>
<p>In this game, humanity has managed to survive the pollution by living on the Floating Continent. However, a Dragon attack puts everything in danger.</p>
<p>The World Mission is the last of the game. This story has multiple endings and will change depending on this mission.</p>
<p>Only three people who completed all the missions and collected special items will be able to participate in the World Mission.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s in a name?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another potential price contributor may be the quirky side of the NFTs &#8211; specifically, names.</p>
<p>The Protagonist&#8217;s name is Chroma (<a href="https://symbiogenesis.app/">not for sale</a>).</p>
<p>There is a character called Fungus, for example. He was sold for just above 1 ETH. Another is Warehouse, sold for 1.4 ETH.</p>
<p>Other characters have names like Lumber, Timber, Chamomile, Arm, Navigation, Kind, Lovesickness, Handshake, Cactus, Protein, Tattoo&#8230;</p>
<p>This looks like a string of random words. They don&#8217;t even seem connected to the character&#8217;s appearance. It remains to be seen how, if at all, the names reflect characters.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy, on the other hand, features Cloud Strife, Sepiroth, and Yuna.</p>
<p>While Final Fantasy has Noctis Lucis Caelum, Symbiogenesis has Instruction. While the former has Vincent Valentine, the latter has Beverage.</p>
<p>Some may find this naming witty, others nonsensical.</p>
<p>Either way, perhaps it is due to the combination of the above-mentioned factors, in addition to notable character designs and naming choices, that the gamers are willing to splurge on these NFTs.</p>

<h2>Crypto Execs Argue Bull Run Could Lead to $100,000 BTC in 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Executives in the crypto industry argue that we may be witnessing the start of a new bull run that could lead to all-time highs for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-nears-41000-amid-broader-crypto-rally.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> in 2024 &#8211; above $100,000.</p>
<p>Pascal Gauthier, CEO of hardware wallet maker <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ledger-and-fvckrender-launch-limited-edition-nano-x-more-collabs-coming.htm"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/04/bitcoin-price-at-100000-in-2024-crypto-execs-say-bull-run-has-begun.html">told</a> CNBC that it feels that 2023 &#8220;was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful&#8221; for 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p>Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets at crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indian-crypto-exchange-coindcx-lays-off-12-of-staff-citing-prolonged-bear-market-tds.htm"><strong>CoinDCX</strong></a>, commented that a number of market participants are expecting a bull run following the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-halts-btc-sales-remain-bullish-price-ahead-of-halving.htm">halving</a> next year, &#8220;but given the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">ETF</a> news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. That could cause a massive upward run in the price,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ayyar also warned that an all-out ETF rejection &#8220;could play havoc to this run as well, hence definitely something to be mindful of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last week, multinational bank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-zodia-integrates-ripple-owned-metacos-crypto-safekeeping.htm"><strong>Standard Chartered</strong></a> reiterated that bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of next year, driven by numerous ETF approvals.</p>
<p>Crypto financial services firm <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matrixport-doubles-down-45000-bitcoin-prediction-as-fomo-grips-crypto-market.htm"><strong>Matrixport</strong></a> also released a note last week projecting BTC would hit $63,140 by April and $125,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>David Marcus, CEO of Lightning Network infrastructure builder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-lightspark-ceo-david-marcus-envisions-bitcoin-as-global-payment-network.htm"><strong>Lightspark</strong></a>, told CNBC, &#8220;I think that once you get the speculative phase out of the way, which I think we’re almost done with, probably not yet completely done, then you can get real builders focusing on the technology and the problems that can solve in the world, rather than just having a giant digital casino for people to trade.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Spanish Police Arrest a Man for Working with ETH Dev in North Korea, Violating US Sanctions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spains-crypto-users-to-declare-digital-assets-on-foreign-platforms-as-tax-agency-updates-guidelines.htm">Spanish</a> police have arrested a Spaniard wanted by US officials for working with American crypto expert and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-layer-2-blast-closes-in-on-solana-after-reaching-600-million-tvl-in-10-days.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a> developer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/prosecutors-ethereum-foundation-knew-about-virgil-griffiths-north-korea-intentions.htm">Virgil Griffith</a> to provide cryptocurrency and blockchain technology services to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-korean-hackers-disguise-as-south-korean-govt-agencies-to-steal-cryptos-report.htm">North Korea</a>, thus violating US sanctions against the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/spanish-police-arrest-man-wanted-by-us-in-north-korean-crypto-case-/7380904.html">According</a> to VOA, the police said they had arrested Alejandro Cao de Benos (48) on Thursday. After appearing before a judge on Friday, Cao De Benos was released, pending the formal extradition process, which could take months to complete. He faces 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Justice Department</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-doj-seizes-9-million-in-usdt-from-cyber-scam-organization-tether-to-onboard-fbi.htm">DOJ</a>) indicted Cao de Benos and British citizen Christopher Emms (then 30) last April, accusing them of conspiring with Griffith to provide North Korea with training in the technology.</p>
<p>Griffith pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 63 months in prison. Emms remains at large.</p>
<h2>Bybit: Institutions Have Doubled Bitcoin Allocations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Institutional investors nearly doubled their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-space-force-member-proposes-bitcoins-pow-systems-in-cyberattack-prevention.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> holdings in the first three quarters of 2023, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/institutions-have-doubled-their-bitcoin-allocations-this-year-new-bybit-report-shows-302003220.html">according</a> to crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cftcs-request-for-coinbase-user-data-linked-to-bybit-investigation-whats-going-on.htm"><strong>Bybit&#8217;s</strong></a> new report, &#8220;Navigating Bull and Bear Markets — A Dive Into Asset Allocation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Institutional investors hold 45% in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-toniq-launches-first-ordinals-specific-nft-marketplace-built-on-bitcoin-l2-neobank-brighty-reveals-european-b2b-platform-brighty-business.htm">stablecoins</a>, 35% in bitcoin, and 15% in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-343038810-was-lost-to-hacks-and-fraud-in-november-a-15x-increase-from-october.htm">ethereum (ETH)</a>, emphasizing liquidity and strategic diversification.</p>
<p>The report further observed a decline in institutional interest in ETH. But upcoming market developments, like the rumored <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-files-spot-ether-etf-application.htm"><strong>BlackRock</strong> spot Ether ETF</a>, could shift the trend, it said.</p>
<p>Retail traders hold more stablecoins, the report found, suggesting a more cautious allocation to riskier assets compared to traditional finance norms.</p>
<p>Both retail and VIP traders show higher altcoin holdings than institutional investors. These, however, remain a minor part of total portfolios, indicating caution, perhaps as a result of the recent bear market, Bybit noted.</p>
<h2>Bitget Protection Fund Sees An All-Time High</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/illuvium-joins-blockchain-gaming-partnership-with-esports-powerhouse-team-liquid-more-news.htm"><strong>Bitget</strong></a> has released its Protection Fund Valuation Report for November 2023, including &#8220;an exciting all-time-high of $410 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With an average of over $400 million for the month, this was the highest value of the Protection fund since its launch,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/bitget-protection-fund-achieves-all-time-high-valuation-in-november-302004237.html">said</a>.</p>
<p>The highest value reported was $410.37 million (November 16), the lowest value was $389.36 million (November 1), and the average value was $401.31 million.</p>
<p>The Protection Fund is entirely self-funded, the exchange noted.</p>
<h2>Trezor Launches Education Program in Africa, Funds Bitcoineta Land Rover</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hardware wallet maker <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trezor-initiates-investigation-as-phishing-campaign-targets-crypto-hardware-wallet-users.htm"><strong>Trezor</strong></a> announced the launch of its education program, <strong>Trezor Academy</strong>, which will be rolled out in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-defi-can-bridge-the-forex-gap-in-africa-according-to-banking-ceo.htm">Africa</a>. Throughout 2024, the company plans to set up academies in more than ten new African countries to engage with and provide Bitcoin education for hundreds of local educators, the announcement <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/introducing-trezor-academy-bitcoineta-spreading-bitcoin-knowledge-where-it-matters-the-most-d68933c52a63">said</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of Trezor Academy follows a successful pilot program that took place throughout 2023 and saw the company and local influencers host events in Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi. They helped introduce attendees to the benefits of Bitcoin and the importance of self-custody.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative, Trezor is also funding Bitcoineta, a branded Land Rover that, in conjunction with <strong>Bitcoin Cowries</strong>, will tour the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The Bitcoineta road trip started on December 1 at the <strong>Africa Bitcoin Conference</strong>. Its progress will be shared via the official Bitcoineta X account.</p>
<p>The Bitcoineta vehicle is the fifth of its kind, with other educational road trips currently active in Central America, South America, Europe, and South Africa.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/amazon-drops-nft-bombshell-official-email-teases-digital-tokens-platform-gallery.htm">Amazon</a> Managed Blockchain</strong> (AMB) Access now supports the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm"><strong>Polygon</strong></a> proof-of-stake (PoS) mainnet and the Mumbai testnet in public preview.</p>
<p>AMB is a fully managed service that provides access to public and private blockchains. Polygon is a scaling solution leveraging the <strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine</strong> (EVM), known for higher transaction throughput and lower transaction fees. The blockchain is often used in building decentralized applications (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-hackers-stole-dollar141-billion-ytd-and-dollar222-million-in-october-google-cloud-launches-solana-network-dataset-on-bigquery.htm">dapps</a>) related to non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptopunks-and-bored-apes-dip-as-nft-500-index-falls-despite-crypto-rally.htm">NFTs</a>), Web3 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/illuvium-joins-blockchain-gaming-partnership-with-esports-powerhouse-team-liquid-more-news.htm">games</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/avax-soars-over-22-as-traditional-firms-increase-tokenization-efforts.htm">tokenization</a> use cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/amazon-managed-blockchain-access-adds-support-for-polygon-pos">According</a> to Polygon&#8217;s blog post,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[AMB] is adding support for Polygon PoS to offer developers a reliable, scalable and cost-efficient way to build Web3 applications.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The developer guide <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/latest/ambp-dg/what-is-service.html">adds</a> that AMB helps users build &#8220;resilient Web3 applications on the Polygon blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, it provides serverless and instant access to Polygon PoS without minimum cost. Access is free during the public preview, but standard <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (AWS) data transfer charges apply.</p>
<h2>Benefits for Developers, Consumer Brands, and Financial Institutions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AMB Access Polygon &#8220;caters to a variety of applications, from use cases calling for repeated and highly-available access to those with intermittent and unpredictable access,&#8221; Polygon said.</p>
<p>It noted that this access is beneficial for consumer brands, institutions, and developers alike.</p>
<p>Consumer brands, it said, can use AMB Access Polygon to offer NFTs through a loyalty system to reward customers.</p>
<p>Financial services institutions can utilize it to power digital asset offerings. These require <a href="https://nonamesecurity.com/learn/what-is-json-rpc/">JSON-RPC</a> application programming interface (API) for reading blockchain data and broadcasting users&#8217; signed transactions.</p>
<p>Finally, developers can use Polygon JSON-RPC APIs through &#8220;always-on endpoints that offer predictable pay-as-you-go pricing to build applications that interact with Polygon PoS.&#8221;</p>
<p>Web3 game developers can create NFTs, which players can then use in-game and/or exchange on marketplaces on Polygon PoS.</p>
<p>AMB Access Polygon offers developers benefits such as production-grade applications, faster time to market, and automatic scaling.</p>
<p>Additionally, with pay-per-request pricing, developers can save up to 80% in blockchain node spending compared to self-managed infrastructure, Polygon claims.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every day, developers are exploring more and more use cases for scalable and mainstream applications, utilizing Polygon PoS for reliability, quick transactions and low transaction fees. These use cases range from NFT marketplaces, loyalty rewards, real-world asset tokenization,… <a href="https://t.co/JtVuHwmAGf">pic.twitter.com/JtVuHwmAGf</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Not The First Polygon-AWS Collaboration</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AWS support of Polygon PoS through AMB Access further streamlines the development of scalable and mainstream applications, the post said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“AWS keeps expanding its enterprise-ready Web3 infrastructure and developer-friendly tools that businesses require to provide fast, seamless and secure access to applications for Web3 native and mainstream consumers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the projects across industries that already use AMB Access Polygon include wallet-as-a-service provider <strong>Magic</strong>, indie game developer studio <strong>Mystic Moose</strong>, music distribution-focused company <strong>RecoChoku</strong>, and global fintech infrastructure provider for real-world assets and digital securities <strong>Oasis Pro</strong>.</p>
<p>However, this is not the two companies&#8217; first partnership.</p>
<p>AWS, Polygon Labs, and gaming venture capital firm <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/animoca-brands-invests-in-ton-play-becomes-largest-validator-on-ton-blockchain.htm"><strong>Animoca Brands</strong></a> announced a strategic collaboration in mid-November. The announced <strong>MoonRealm Express Accelerator</strong> aims to support Web3 builders around the world to accelerate Web3 products and solutions through Animoca Brands’ flagship project <strong>Mocaverse</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of MoonRealm Express Accelerator is to support aspiring builders by helping them to turn concepts into real-world solutions&#8221;, the announcement said.</p>
<p>Now, they have the addition of AMB Access Polygon.</p>

Blockchain-based gaming platform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-illuvium-going-to-zero-ilv-price-suffers-6-2-fall-as-strange-mining-token-steals-the-limelight.htm"><strong>Illuvium</strong></a> joined <a href="https://illuvium.io/news/illuvium-x-team-liquid">a blockchain partnership</a> with esports organization <strong>Team Liquid</strong> to explore and limit-test Illuvium&#8217;s new auto battler game<strong> Illuvium: Arena</strong>&#8216;s competitive modes. The integration will see eight Team Liquid streamers &#8211; specializing in Teamfight Tactics, Hearthstone, and League of Legends &#8211; play the new game.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re cooking up a co-hosted tournament that will be a magnet for competitive spirits from both our communities with a $100,000+ prize pool,&#8221; the announcement said.</p>
<p>Kieran Warwick, Co-founder and CEO of Illuvium, emphasised the goal to reshape perceptions of blockchain gaming: &#8220;Overcoming the scepticism around blockchain games is crucial, and the way forward is by delivering exceptional gaming experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>This collaboration is a milestone in showing that blockchain games, including those with NFTs, can offer engaging and deep gameplay experiences on par with traditional games, Warwick said.</p>
<p>Per the press release, Illuvium unveiled the Early Access release of their Auto Battler and Overworld game following a three-year development journey and a $60 million investment.</p>
<h2>Nansen Unveils Nansen 2, AI-Powered Features, and Investment Strategy Tools</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Popular blockchain data analytics platform <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-binance-saw-significant-outflows-since-cz-announcement-kucoin-launches-kucard-10101-art-reveals-sale-of-banksys-turf-war.htm">Nansen</a> </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1729440221430006019">announced</a> the launch of Nansen 2. It&#8217;s described as a significant upgrade to its tool suite. The free version of the suite now includes access to Nansen&#8217;s popular features along with selected Nansen 2 features.</p>
<p>Nansen 2 is a faster and smarter platform designed to change how investors use blockchain data, it said. The update brings upgrades to its existing features, especially its wallet and token analytics tools.</p>
<p>These enhancements improve functionality, offering users comprehensive insights into multichain perspectives of any wallet or entity. They also provide a deeper understanding of specific on-chain token movements.</p>
<p>The new features in Nansen 2 allow users to label <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-343038810-was-lost-to-hacks-and-fraud-in-november-a-15x-increase-from-october.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a> wallets automatically based on their own criteria. This allows them to quickly identify, track, and monitor wallet addresses. These features also provide a detailed view of the holdings and activity within the chosen addresses.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nansen 2 also incorporates AI more extensively, enhancing user experience, it said New features like Smart Search and Signals enable users to search for data and find relevant dashboards using natural language queries.</p>

<h2>Pimlico and Safe Advance Account Abstraction with Launch of ERC-4337 Module</h2>

<p>Per the <a href="https://safe.mirror.xyz/Fq5gRPRx1cDdkKREcU-PvObfHPja4RhnlBoVtqxzyVo">announcement</a>, by integrating Safe’s module, Pimlico enhanced its infrastructure offering and enabled its clients to build Ethereum-based products more seamlessly and with greater UX options.</p>
<p>The Ethereum standard ERC-4337 was deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in March 2023. Its aim is to usher in more user-friendly crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/this-is-how-you-protect-crypto-in-your-wallet-according-to-expert-mark-venables.htm">wallet</a> designs.</p>
<p>Safe’s module enables developers to turn the Safe smart account standard into an ERC-4337 smart account. Developers and users can easily opt in or opt out of ERC-4337 without changing the account.</p>
<p>Also, the module will allow non-Web3 developers to offer Web3 functionalities in their Web2 consumer applications easily. Appealing to both Web2 and Web3 developers, Safe said, &#8220;it marks the first smart contract module that will be used massively in production.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Safe&#8217;s early backing and investment in Pimlico, the crypto startup recently closed a $4.2 million seed funding round led by <strong>a16z crypto</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gccbusinessnews.com/fasset-secures-vasp-license-from-vara/">According</a> to the press release, the operational license is the final stage in VARA’s approval process. It authorizes the company to provide digital asset broker-dealer services to retail and institutional investors, in and from <a class="c-link" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/head-of-dubais-digital-asset-regulator-steps-down-whats-going-on.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://cryptonews.com/news/head-of-dubais-digital-asset-regulator-steps-down-whats-going-on.htm" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Dubai</a>, to a global customer base.</p>
<p>This VASP &#8220;is authorised for specific activities and product types,&#8221; VARA <a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/licenses-and-register/public-register/fasset-fze/">said</a> on its website. The regulator stresses the importance of checking the full record of the regulated activities the company is allowed to do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Through its super-app, Fasset aims to provide the next billion with economic opportunity and access to buy, sell, send, store and do more with digital assets such as bitcoin and real-world asset tokens.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Fasset Connect&#8217; solution, said the brokerage, positions the company as a catalyst for faster user aquissiton and industry-wide digital transformation, it said.</p>
<p>Fasset will begin a beta launch next month and rollout to customers in January 2024.</p>
<p>Besides the license acquisition, Fasset has announced an investment from alternative asset manager <strong>Investcorp</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The license approval comes at the same time as Investcorp’s investment in Fasset, ahead of its imminent Series B round and highlights growing institutional interest in blockchain technology in the region.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fasset did not disclose the potential funding amount.</p>
<h2>The Middle East is Becoming an Attractive Crypto Hub</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Many crypto companies are starting to see the Middle East in general and Dubai and particular as an emerging cryptocurrency hub.</p>
<p>Consequently, the VARA license has also become quite attractive. Major companies within the crypto industry received viable product or VASP licenses. These include <strong>Binance</strong>, <strong>Bybit</strong>, <strong>Ripple</strong>, <strong>Crypto.com</strong>, <strong>OKX</strong>, <strong>Huobi</strong>, and others.</p>
<p>Fasset CEO Mohammad Raafi Hossain commented that the license bolstered the company&#8217;s &#8220;focus on enabling people across emerging markets to access [&#8230;] digital assets.&#8221; He added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As one of the most progressive regulatory frameworks in the world, the VARA approval is a crucial link in our global licensing portfolio, connecting places like Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Turkey.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Headquartered in the UAE and Indonesia, Fasset is a digital asset investment platform for emerging markets.</p>
<p>Prior to the company’s establishment in 2019, its founding team had worked at the UAE Prime Minister’s Office across regulations for emerging technologies. Therefore, they started the initial conversations for crypto regulation early, they said.</p>
<p>Fasset says it offers real-life use cases facilitated through digital assets, underpinned by blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it prioritizes &#8220;secure and stable cryptocurrencies&#8221; such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-evaporating-and-traders-back-new-bitcoin-etf-token-with-more-than-2m-as-sellout-looms-and-sec-approval-bets-mount.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-343038810-was-lost-to-hacks-and-fraud-in-november-a-15x-increase-from-october.htm">ethereum (ETH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-issuer-paxos-receives-preliminary-nod-from-singapore-regulator.htm">stablecoins</a>, and tokenized commodities and precious metals.</p>

<p>Crypto-friendly Swiss-based <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/seba-banks-hong-kong-branch-secures-full-license-for-crypto-services-from-sfc.htm"><strong>SEBA Bank AG</strong></a> has announced its new brand identity: <strong>AMINA Bank AG</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.seba.swiss/media-and-investors/">press release</a> shared with <em>Cryptonews</em>, the rebrand will not affect the bank’s current clients “other than encountering the new name.”</p>
<p>It stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“All operations will be business as usual across the board.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This rebrand marks a new chapter for this fully licensed Swiss crypto bank, it said.</p>
<p>The name ‘AMINA’ comes from the word ‘transamination.’ It means the transference of one compound to another. The bank said that the change represents “the transformation” of its clients’ financial future.</p>
<p>Explaining further, AMINA stated that the brand is driven by continuous change. It merges elements of traditional, digital, and crypto banking “to unlock new potential” for the clients.</p>
<p>AMINA Bank operates globally from its head office in Zug, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lugano-integrates-polygon-protocol-into-mylugano-payment-app-for-crypto-transactions.htm">Switzerland</a>. It has a branch office in Abu Dhabi and subsidiaries in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-chief-executive-expresses-willingness-to-cooperate-on-granting-more-powers-to-regulate-crypto-exchanges-report.htm">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-central-bank-chief-sees-no-future-for-private-crypto.htm">Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>The latter three will “subsequently” apply for a name change to align with Zug.</p>
<h2>Preparing for 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AMINA CEO Franz Bergmueller said that the company was proud of the group&#8217;s achievements under the name SEBA.</p>
<p>He commented that the new brand indicates a new era in the company’s growth and strategy. “We are a key player in crypto banking,” the CEO said, “and are here to define the future of finance.”</p>
<p>Bergmueller also briefly discussed what’s in the pipeline for AMINA in the coming year, saying that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“As we look forward to 2024, our ambition is to accelerate the growth of our strategic hubs in Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Abu Dhabi, and to continue our global expansion […]”</p></blockquote>
<p>AMINA was founded in April 2018. Its regulated hubs, said the announcement, offer fiat and crypto services to “progressive investors” – both traditional and crypto-native, be they individuals, corporates, or institutions.</p>
<p>In 2019, it received a Swiss banking and securities dealer license. The then-SEBA Bank became one of the first institutions regulated by the <strong>Financial Market Supervisory Authority</strong> (FINMA) to provide crypto banking services.</p>
<p>In November this year, SEBA Hong Kong <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/seba-banks-hong-kong-branch-secures-full-license-for-crypto-services-from-sfc.htm">received a full license</a> from the city’s <strong>Securities and Futures Commission</strong> (SFC). This regulatory approval enabled the bank to engage in a wide range of financial activities, including the handling and advisory of both digital and traditional assets.</p>
<p>The subsidiary CEO, Amy Yu, commented that “the region’s position at the forefront of finance, trading, and innovation has long been attractive to us, as servicing APAC clientele is an integral aspiration of the team’s DNA.”</p>
<p>Also in November, Switzerland’s fifth largest cantonal bank, <strong>St.Galler Kantonalbank</strong> (SGKB), partnered with SEBA to offer custody and trading services for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-crypto-gainers-today-on-dextools-mind-babyfroge-betrock.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-343038810-was-lost-to-hacks-and-fraud-in-november-a-15x-increase-from-october.htm">ethereum (ETH)</a>.</p>
<p>SGKB said that the service would initially be available to a select group of wealth-management clients. It plans to expand the offering to retail customers.</p>

<p>In a recent chat with <em>Cryptonews</em>, Michael Rubinelli, industry veteran and Chief Gaming Officer at Web3 ecosystem for gaming <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-play-earn-games-on-wax.htm">WAX</a></strong>, discussed how macroeconomic trends affect the gaming industry, what is happening in the gaming investment arena, and the positive future awaiting blockchain-based games.</p>
<h2>Gaming Industry is Not Insulated from Macroeconomic Trends</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Rubinelli stated that he may not be an expert on how global macroeconomic trends affect gaming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitfinexs-tokenized-bond-falls-short-of-investment-target-raises-only-1-5m-of-expected-10m.htm">investment</a>, but they “undoubtedly exert a considerable influence on the world of venture capital.”</p>
<p>He noted the reaction to the performance of major games like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-27-terraclassicusd-terra-axie-infinity.htm"><strong>Axie Infinity</strong></a>. Per Rubinelli, there was an initial overreaction to the success of such games.</p>
<p>Rubinelli argued that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“When a potential &#8216;Northstar&#8217; opportunity in a relatively unexplored market segment is identified, it often triggers a rush of investment driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO).”</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, many funding pitches revolved around the premise of being &#8216;like Axie, but better.&#8217; There is no need for a deep understanding of the underlying complexities, so this can be a persuasive strategy to secure investments. That’s especially the case in a rapidly trending sector.</p>
<p>As a result, “substantial amounts of capital” were given to projects that may not have undergone due diligence.</p>
<p>Rubinelli opined that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Unfortunately, the subsequent crypto-winter brought about a series of failures among gaming studios and broad investments in Web3, leading to a necessary correction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, a question arises, he said. Are we witnessing an overcorrection in the gaming investment landscape?</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a possibility,” Rubinelli said when talking to <em>Cryptonews</em> in late October.</p>
<p>He noted, however, that venture capitalists in general have been growing increasingly risk-averse.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Until a more robust and innovative Web3 approach/business is developed, a significant portion of capital may remain in reserve as investors seek more secure opportunities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/square-enixs-nft-game-symbiogenesis-sets-auction-dates-launches-december-21-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">gaming</a> industry is not insulated from the broader macroeconomic trends. The experiences with &#8216;hot&#8217; gaming investments serve as a valuable lesson, Rubinelli said.</p>
<p>Caution is a natural response to the recent market dynamics. But the executive opined that the industry will “adapt and continue to offer promising opportunities for investors as it matures and refines its investment models.”</p>
<h2>Blockchain Gaming Stands at Pivotal Crossroads</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per WAX’s Chief Gaming Officer, there is no doubt that we will continue to see the growth of “the harmonious coexistence of blockchain-enabled games alongside traditional non-Web3 titles” on popular platforms. This includes <strong>Google Play</strong>, <strong>the App Store</strong>, <strong>Epic Games Store</strong>, <strong>Humble Bundle</strong>, and eventually <strong>Steam</strong>, he said.</p>
<p>Looking into the future, Rubinelli stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I firmly believe that in the next 3 to 5 years, a substantial majority, exceeding 75%, of newly launched games will incorporate a mechanism enabling players to sell the digital assets they own.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Game publishers and developers must strike “a delicate balance” between generating sufficient revenue to sustain their operations and ensuring that players do not feel restricted by in-game purchases.</p>
<p>That said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The current landscape of blockchain gaming stands at a pivotal crossroads, on the cusp of achieving mainstream acceptance.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, a major challenge has been that non-game developers tried creating games that “essentially amounted to the gamification of decentralized finance websites.” It lacked the true essence of gaming, Rubinelli argued. This approach proved unsustainable and ineffective.</p>
<p>But 2021’s bull run brought a significant development.</p>
<p>Many renowned AAA game developers secured funding to create authentic gaming experiences where players could genuinely own assets acquired through purchase, in-game crafting, or other means.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to note here that producing a high-quality game typically requires 18 to 36 months of meticulous work, Rubinelli said.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are on the brink of witnessing the release of remarkable and enjoyable games that are set to revolutionize the blockchain gaming sphere.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This shift is instrumental in countering the prevailing skepticism and misconceptions surrounding Web3 gaming, Rubinelli added.</p>
<h2>Competing Not With Other Games, But With Daily Entertainment</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In mid-October, WAX’s dedicated gaming studio, <strong>Tyranno Studios</strong>, led by Rubinelli, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-brawlers-enters-fortnites-home-launches-on-epic-games-store-to-230-million-gamers-globally.htm">announced</a> that its blockchain-based, wrestling-themed non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm">NFT</a>) game <strong>Brawlers</strong> launched on the major digital distribution platform <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> — becoming available to more than 230 million PC gamers worldwide.</p>
<p>There are numerous benefits and no drawbacks of blockchain games featuring on traditional platforms, per Rubinelli.</p>
<p>Content acceptance, adoption, and consumption are fueled by distribution. Without omnipresent channels of distribution, none of that matters.</p>
<p>He added that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Achieving widespread adoption in the mass market hinges on effectively communicating the essence of the gaming experience to both our current and potential audience.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Brawlers&#8217;s primary objection is to position itself in a way that resonates with all players. It has to offer familiar elements within a game that&#8217;s “undeniably enjoyable.”</p>
<p>The team behind ‘Brawlers’ never considered itself in direct competition with other Web3 titles, said Rubinelli.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Instead, we see ourselves vying for attention not just against traditional games but also against the various entertainment options people have in their daily lives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This line of thinking made the team’s goal clear. They aim to ensure that players&#8217; time in the game feels like a well-justified choice.</p>
<p>“This, undoubtedly, is our most challenging endeavor,” Rubinelli admitted.</p>

In November, $335,574,150 was lost to hacks across 18 incidents and $7,464,660 to fraud across 23 incidents. Compared to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-defi-can-bridge-the-forex-gap-in-africa-according-to-banking-ceo.htm">DeFi</a>, in terms of funds lost, CeFi became the main target for exploits: it represents 53.8% of the total losses, while DeFi represents 46.2%. The increase was primarily led by the high-profile attacks on <strong>Poloniex</strong>, <strong>HTX Exchange</strong>, and <strong>Kronos Research</strong>. The most targeted chains were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-banxa-and-cardanos-yoroi-wallet-enable-in-app-fiat-on-off-ramping-bybit-reveals-personality-based-trading-nft-usdt-competition.htm"><strong>BNB Chain</strong></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/celo-developer-sets-framework-for-layer-2-decision-by-january.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a>, representing more than half of the total losses across targeted chains at 83%. BNB Chain suffered the most individual attacks, with 22 incidents representing 53.7% of the total losses. Ethereum saw 12 incidents, representing 29.3%. <strong>Arbitrum</strong> followed with three incidents (7.3%), while <strong>Optimism</strong>, <strong>Avalanche</strong>, <strong>Fantom</strong>, and <strong>Heco Chain</strong> witnessed one incident each (2.4%).</li>

<p>Neobank <strong>Canza Finance</strong>&#8216;s decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/de-fi-2-0-revolutionizing-socialfi-antivirus-secures-5-million-in-funding.htm">DeFi</a>) tech provides decentralized foreign exchange (FX) for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-matr1x-gaming-platform-raises-10-million-bybits-portfolio-margin-mode-gets-spot-trading-capabilities-mapmetrics-expands-to-peaq-blockchain.htm">African</a> currencies, its CEO and co-founder Pascal Ntsama IV said.</p>
<p>Canza website <a href="https://canza.io/about-us/">stresses</a> that access to financial services and products is &#8220;a massive challenge&#8221; for many millions of individuals globally.</p>
<p>Therefore, the neobank, which enables decentralized cross-border payments, leverages DeFi and digital assets to bridge the existing financial service gap in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Last year, Canza <a href="https://canza.io/2022/10/25/baki-robust-reliable-and-scalable-forex-service/">revealed</a> an addition to its services: <strong>Baki</strong>. It is a liquidity FX exchange for African currencies, aiming to transform African forex &#8220;with transparent currency swaps and zTokens.&#8221;</p>
<p>It said at the time that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key benefit Baki provides, and central to its architecture, is the ability to offer infinite liquidity at the official conversion rate. This is a significant pain point for any business trying to operate an intra-African trade network.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/africa-foreign-exchange-problems-solved-defi">Talking</a> to <em>Cointelegraph</em>, CEO Ntsama explained that many Africans have trouble accessing forex liquidity and currency swaps. This limits the use of US dollar-based services in the countries dependent on imports &#8211; creating space for DeFi.</p>
<h2>DeFi To The Rescue</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
DeFi &#8211; leveraging cryptocurrencies and blockchain &#8211; can relieve many of the continent&#8217;s pain points.</p>
<p>In the case of Canza, this is where Baki comes in.</p>
<p>When users exchange local fiat currencies, funds exit Africa, which results in dollar value inflation. <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/slippage/#:~:text=Slippage%20occurs%20when%20the%20execution,quick%20turns%20in%20certain%20trends.">Currency slippage</a> leads to increased costs. Baki, the CEO says, allows users to trade at official central bank prices and swap currencies without loss.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the agent assumes local currency risk in FX swaps, Baki reduces risks by swapping similar currencies at the official central bank rate, Ntsama said.</p>
<p>This then enables the agent to swap again with the least slippage when entering US dollar positions.</p>
<p>Ntsama also commented on Nigeria where the use of blockchain &#8211; even though approved &#8211; is yet to become widespread. Per the <em>Cointelegraph</em> report, &#8220;Ntsama said Baki is built to work with the current regulatory climate as it leverages existing user behaviors to tackle problems with blockchain technology.&#8221;</p>

<h2>African Hubs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
African countries are increasingly moving towards crypto and blockchain.</p>
<p>Canza, for example, aims to create a hub for businesses to participate in FX trades at a reduced cost.</p>
<p>Per a recent CNBC report, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-investor-mike-novogratz-expects-bitcoin-gold-and-silver-to-rally-as-fed-pivots.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> is on its way to becoming the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-set-disrupt-africas-85-billion-financial-system-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">currency of choice</a> for moving money between African countries. The report came three months after the inaugural <strong>Africa Bitcoin Conference</strong> in Ghana.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jack-dorseys-block-reports-strong-q3-earnings-profits-from-bitcoin-holdings-surge.htm">Jack Dorsey</a> spoke at the conference about how BTC had made up for money lost during an earlier street protest in Nigeria.</p>

<p>In early February 2023, the <strong>Ministry of Technology and Science</strong> of Zambia <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/zambia-experiments-with-technology-regulate-cryptocurrency-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">announced</a> that it &#8211; through the <strong>Security Exchange Commission</strong> and <strong>Bank of Zambia</strong> &#8211; was testing technology to regulate crypto as the country embarked on its mission to become a regional hub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cryptocurrency will be a driver for financial inclusion and a change maker for Zambia’s economy,&#8221; Minister Felix Mutati said.</p>
<p>In November, crypto payments giant <strong>Ripple</strong> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-collaborates-to-power-payments-corridors-between-africa-and-rest-of-the-world.htm">partnered</a> with fintech <strong>Onafriq</strong> to facilitate crypto-enabled cross-border payments between 27 African countries and markets around the world.</p>

<p>In an interview with <em>Cryptonews</em>, Mark Venables – an expert in crypto wallets and the founder of <a href="https://www.thecryptomerchant.com/"><strong>The Crypto Merchant</strong></a> – discussed the best practices to keep money safe in our crypto wallets, if and how often we should move our funds to another wallet, vulnerabilities of old and ‘aging’ wallets, how newer wallets improve safety, and what awaits us by the end of this decade in the digital pouch realm.</p>
<p>This is what he had to say.</p>
<h2>Be Proactive</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Venables argued that the cryptocurrency ecosystem security is an ongoing concern. He warned that there “are various vulnerabilities that users and developers should be aware of.”</p>
<p>These include, but are not limited to, well-known phishing attacks, malware and key loggers, social engineering attacks, centralized exchange risks, and smart contract vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Not all wallet users are the same, Venables suggested. Instead, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Users should tailor their security practices based on their specific needs and the type of wallet they are using.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, an absolute must in safeguarding one’s cryptoassets, he stressed, is adopting a proactive approach to security.</p>
<p>Users can’t put funds into a wallet and forget about it. Scammers are certainly not forgetting about your money and are constantly developing ways to get to it.</p>
<p>While tailoring safety practices is needed, there are also great general rules to follow.</p>
<p>It is essential that each person regularly updates security practices and makes sure that they are informed about both the current <em>and</em> emerging threats.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Venables says,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Education and awareness around potential risks and scams play a vital role in safeguarding digital assets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t experiment with services either – triple-check that they are reputable.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is always good to follow general cybersecurity principles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>implementing and maintaining strong passwords,</li>
<li>enabling two-factor authentication (2FA),</li>
<li>having secure backup and recovery,</li>
<li>using robust antivirus software,</li>
<li>regularly updating wallet and software versions,</li>
<li>implementing encryption measures,</li>
<li>keep cautious of phishing attempts.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this may feel daunting, especially to newcomers, but it’s all vital in helping you keep your funds.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, veteran users, while more experienced, are not immune to mistakes and/or scams.</p>
<h2>Frequent Transfers to New Wallets Introduce Risk</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Yes, users should occasionally move their money to a different wallet, but how often is not an easy question to answer.</p>
<p>Changing wallets too often may actually be detrimental.</p>
<p>Per the expert,</p>
<blockquote><p>“While occasional wallet migrations for security reasons are sensible, frequent transfers can also introduce risks, such as potential mistakes during the process or increased exposure to transaction fees.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The frequency depends on several factors, Venables says. There is no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
<p>These factors include the security of the current wallet, changes in wallet technology, lost or compromised private keys, inactive or abandoned wallets, and transition to newer tech.</p>
<p>The conclusion seems to be that once the above security steps have been followed, users should “carefully balance the need for security with the practicality and convenience of managing their funds.”</p>
<h2>Older Wallets Are Vulnerable, Newer Ones Are Not Foolproof</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The technology underpinning the wallet industry is evolving.</p>
<p>By the end of this decade, Venables said, we can expect several exciting advancements and trends in the new generation of crypto wallets.</p>
<p>These include enhanced security, improved user experience, cross-chain compatibility, refi integration, mobile dominance, decentralized wallets, improved recovery options, and the integration of new technologies as they emerge.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is the issue of the older wallets.</p>
<p>These digital purses can be at risk due to outdated software, weak encryption and key management, lack of 2FA – and even discontinued support.</p>
<p>All this makes them more susceptible to social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Newer wallets do provide significant improvements in security as they aim to address the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of older wallets. However, “no system can claim to be completely foolproof or immune to all risks,” Venables warned.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are still potential areas that remain unaddressed or pose ongoing challenges. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>user responsibility,</li>
<li>centralized exchanges,</li>
<li>human error,</li>
<li>emerging vulnerabilities,</li>
<li>supply chain attacks,</li>
<li>regulatory changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Crypto Merchant was founded in 2017 in the US by early crypto adopters, coders, miners, and investors who, as the website <a href="https://www.thecryptomerchant.com/pages/about-us-guarantee">states</a>, have “spent an unreasonable amount of time seeking out only the most secure products for your cryptoassets, so that you can buy and invest with confidence.”</p>
<p>The company offers various hardware wallets from several wallet makers, including <strong>Trezor</strong>, <strong>Ledger</strong>, <strong>Blockstream</strong>, <strong>KeepKey</strong>, and more, as well as bundle deals.</p>
<p>Therefore, another good safety measure is to get a hardware wallet, preferably via The Crypto Merchant, Venables concluded.</p>

<h2>NFT news</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toniq</strong>, a company building professional tools and services on the decentralized web, today announced the launch of the first Ordinals-specific marketplace built on a <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Bitcoin</a></strong> Layer 2. The press release describes Bioniq as &#8220;the world’s fastest Bitcoin-based non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm">NFT</a>) marketplace&#8221; on the blockchain and Web3 platform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/internet-computer/"><strong>Internet Computer</strong></a>. Bioniq has two objectives: facilitating a simple means of buying and selling Bitcoin NFTs and helping alleviate Bitcoin congestion, it said. Bitcoin fees have recently exceeded those of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/forbes-latest-under-30-list-data-will-be-listed-on-ethereum.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a> by a large margin, making BTC transactions significantly more expensive. Backed by crypto-focused VC firm <strong>Polychain Capital</strong>, Bioniq was designed to solve these issues, helping users to buy, sell, exchange, and auction their Bitcoin NFTs seamlessly. Bioniq offers a built-in wallet with smart wallet features, and it allows users to manage their private keys by leveraging <strong>Web3Auth</strong>, enabling log-in with <strong>Gmail</strong> accounts in a non-custodial way. In the future, the platform plans to expand its list of available services by introducing &#8216;Launchpad&#8217; that allows the release of reserved Ordinals, or tokens on ICP with the exclusive right to inscribe on BTC; &#8216;Earn&#8217; that allows using Ordinals as collateral to borrow crypto; &#8216;Super offers&#8217; that enable placing offers on any inscription on Bitcoin and notifying the recipient; and &#8216;Collection offers&#8217; to make an offer on any Ordinal in an entire collection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Banking news</h2>

<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/regulation-user-trust-and-tech-constraints-stand-in-the-way-of-mass-crypto-banking-adoption-says-brightys-cto-nikolay-denisenko.htm"><strong>Brighty App</strong></a>, a Swiss neobank powered by Web3, announced its European business-to-business (B2B) platform <strong>Brighty Business</strong>. <a href="https://financefeeds.com/bridging-b2b-digital-transactions-brighty-app-launches-eu-payment-platform-amidst-2-1-trillion-market-growth-forecast/">Per</a> the press release, focused on digital banking and cryptocurrency payments, the platform was designed to streamline how businesses manage their financial operations and support the market’s ongoing evolution. Its key features include virtual and physical company-owned debit cards that employees can utilize; transactional risk-checking; cost-effective exchange, including OTC (over-the-counter) exchange; and a referral program for all B2B customers. The new platform also provides an opportunity to implement its application programming interface (API) system into clients’ platforms. Brighty App’s B2B platform has already seen engagement and positive feedback from different companies in its pilot testing phase. The company also plans a series of user experience (UX) interviews with customers, it said.</li>

<li><strong>Mummolin, Inc.</strong>, a US corporation and a successor to the <strong>Eligius</strong> Bitcoin mining pool that operated from 2011-2017, announced that it raised $6.2million in seed funding, led by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jack-dorseys-block-reports-strong-q3-earnings-profits-from-bitcoin-holdings-surge.htm">Jack Dorsey</a>, <strong>Accomplice</strong>, <strong>Barefoot Bitcoin Fund</strong>, <strong>MoonKite</strong>, <strong>NewLayer Capital</strong>, <strong>the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund</strong>, and other strategic partners. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jack-dorsey-leads-seed-round-in-support-of-oceans-mission-to-decentralize-bitcoin-mining-globally---announces-launch-at-future-of-bitcoin-mining-conference-301999073.html">Per</a> the press release, the seed funding will support the launch of <strong>OCEAN</strong>, described as the first of many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-binance-shows-greater-net-flows-resilience-capital-is-flowing-out-of-us-into-asia-okx-applies-for-hong-kong-vatp-license.htm">mining</a> decentralization projects for <strong>Bitcoin</strong>. Bitcoin Core developer and Mummolin co-founder Luke Dashjr said that &#8220;the role of mining pools must change for Bitcoin to exist as a truly decentralized currency.&#8221; OCEAN, he added, is &#8220;a new type of pool that enables miners to be truly miners again. We are launching as the most transparent pool and also the only non-custodial pool where miners are the recipients of new block rewards directly from Bitcoin.&#8221;</li>
<li>Crypto earning platform <strong>Coinchange</strong> raised $10 million to grow its services. Per the press release, the round was led by <strong>G1.VC</strong>, <strong>Spirit Blockchain</strong>, <strong>Good News Ventures</strong>, <strong>K2.CA</strong>, and <strong>Atoia Ventures</strong>, with additional participation from <strong>Mintfox</strong>. The funds will support the company in expanding its operations and scaling its team and products &#8220;to make a meaningful impact on the financial landscape, leveraging unrivaled Yield farming strategies in decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/de-fi-2-0-revolutionizing-socialfi-antivirus-secures-5-million-in-funding.htm">DeFi</a>) markets.&#8221; Through its integrated Earn API services, Coinchange enables businesses to offer customers the ability to earn yield on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-hong-kong-will-use-all-available-methods-to-fight-crypto-scams-americans-are-much-more-open-to-potential-of-crypto-than-brits.htm">stablecoins</a>. With all its assets managed on the chain, Coinchange doesn’t have to rely on centralized counterparties for custody, trading, or lending and, therefore, potentially introduce counterparty risk to clients, it said. In addition to its Earn API, the firm also operates regulated and compliant brokerage services in the US and Europe.</li>

<p>The United States <strong>Department of Justice</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-records-uptick-following-reports-of-potential-4-billion-settlement-with-the-doj.htm">DOJ</a>) has seized nearly $9 million worth of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gold-smugglers-in-nepal-caught-exchanging-33kg-of-gold-for-tether-usdt-stablecoin.htm">USDT</a> from an organization running pig butchering scams &#8211; with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-and-bitfinex-settle-dispute-will-share-information-under-foil-request-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm"><strong>Tether&#8217;s</strong></a> help.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cyber-scam-organization-disrupted-through-seizure-nearly-9m-crypto">According</a> to the press release, the authorities traced the funds to cryptocurrency addresses allegedly connected to an organization that swindled more than 70 victims via romance scams and crypto confidence scams.</p>
<p>It added that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The department would like to acknowledge Tether for its assistance in effectuating the transfer of these assets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tether <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-assists-the-us-doj-and-us-secret-service-in-criminal-investigations-and-victim-recovery/">confirmed</a> it &#8220;again helped law enforcement thwart the bad actors and aid their victims&#8217; recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tether has already onboarded the <strong>United States Secret Service</strong> (USSS) into its platform.</p>
<p>Now, it says, it will be working with the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI) to do the same.</p>
<p>US Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey commented that the seizure was the result of a collaboration between the DOJ and the USSS.</p>
<p>He said that Silicon Valley is &#8220;one of the world&#8217;s preeminent locations&#8221; for crypto firms. Therefore, the authorities will use &#8220;all tools at our disposal to bring justice to the victims of frauds and scams. Even when money and criminals are abroad, we will work with our partners to seize cyber criminals’ illegal proceeds,&#8221; Ramsey said.</p>
<h2>Pig Butchering and Chain Hopping</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
‘Pig butchering’ consists of scammers ‘fattening up’ their victims, commonly inexperienced investors, before ‘butchering’ them.</p>
<p>In other words, they make false promises, get victims to trust them, take as much money as they can, and then disappear.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, criminals in this case convinced victims to make crypto deposits in what they believed were investments with trusted firms and crypto exchanges.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In reality, the purported firms and cryptocurrency exchanges were non-existent trading platforms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Agents and analysts from the USSS traced the deposits. They found that the scammers laundered the money fast through &#8220;dozens&#8221; of crypto addresses.</p>
<p>Then, they exchanged the funds for &#8220;several&#8221; different cryptocurrencies &#8211; a money laundering technique known as &#8216;chain hopping&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These techniques are used to “layer” the proceeds of criminal activity into new cryptocurrency ecosystems, all to obfuscate the nature, source, control, and ownership of those proceeds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The USSS managed to link the seized funds to victim reports.</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division commented that this was a &#8220;significant seizure&#8221; that helped authorities disrupt &#8220;the financial infrastructure of an organized network of scammers who stole millions from victims across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>These international scammers, said Argentieri, trick ordinary investors through websites that promise investments would make them money. But they just steal victims&#8217; crypto and run.</p>
<p>Even if the current state of the crypto ecosystem &#8220;may seem like an ideal way to launder ill-gotten gains,&#8221; Argentieri warned, law enforcement &#8220;will continue to develop the expertise needed to follow the money and seize it back for victims.&#8221;</p>

<li>Private digital coins &#8220;have miserably failed the test of money because they can’t keep value&#8221; and will eventually exit the monetary scene, according to the <strong>Monetary Authority of Singapore’s</strong> Managing Director Ravi Menon. Therefore, the future monetary system will be comprised of three key components: central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/100000-south-koreans-will-start-using-cbdc-next-year.htm">CBDCs</a>), tokenized bank liabilities, and &#8220;well-regulated&#8221; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-zealands-kiwi-dollar-pegged-stablecoin-nzdd-embarks-with-new-self-custody-wallet.htm">stablecoins</a>, the country&#8217;s central bank chief said, as the South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3243090/singapores-central-bank-chief-ravi-menon-sees-private-cryptocurrencies-failing-they-will-eventually">reported</a>. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/atletico-madrid-sues-exchange-over-44m-unpaid-sponsorship.htm">Singapore&#8217;s</a> regulators are moving toward a system of stablecoins that are fully backed by high-quality government securities or cash, allowing them to be used like narrow money, Menon said.</li>

<li style="text-align: left">Analysts from the global market intelligence agency <strong>Mintel</strong> <a href="https://www.mintel.com/financial-services-market-news/future-of-finance-impact-of-crypto-digital-payments/">found</a> that Americans are &#8220;much more open to the potential of cryptocurrency than Brits.&#8221; Their new report on attitudes towards crypto in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm">US</a> compared to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/48-countries-join-forces-to-combat-crypto-tax-evasion-starting-in-2027.htm">UK</a> says that around a third of surveyed US consumers are interested in using cryptocurrency for purchases, and 4 in 10 Americans are more interested in crypto than a year ago. Meanwhile, almost half of surveyed Brits are skeptical about crypto and do not think it will become a common payment method, while two-thirds say they do not understand it enough to use it. Furthermore, 4 in 5 Brits said they would only trust a financial product from a regulated financial provider. British customers of financial services are also more wary of where they put their money due to the recent cost of living crisis and are therefore avoiding untested industry challengers, the report said. Principal Analyst Adrian Reynolds argued that &#8220;digital and online payments may yet become a more permanent fixture in the world of personal finance, but it looks as if it will take a bit longer for the wider banking community to come around to the idea.&#8221;</li>
