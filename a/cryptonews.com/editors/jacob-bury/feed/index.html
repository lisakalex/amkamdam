This is a technical target the bulls may be able to achieve if the support level of $0.80 can be held.&nbsp;</p><p>If MINA loses structure and the price folds through this particular support level we might see negative price continuity back to the top of the descending channel support trendline at $0.65.&nbsp;</p><p>It is usually advised not to chase green candles (experiences of FOMO) in a bear market where resistances are usually technical targets and experience large selling pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead traders try to pick the oversold positions on the relative strength index and take advantage of extreme fear scenarios.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mina Protocol Continues to Grow</h3><p>Over the last few months MINA expanded further and the MINA ecosystem has 145 monthly active developers.</p><p>According to their latest Tweet this is up 96% over the year and reflects insane growth. Mina Protocol is now among the top 30 projects in terms of total developers.&nbsp;</p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/MinaDevelopers/status/1618673106264141824/photo/1">https://www.twitter.com/MinaDevelopers/status/1618673106264141824/photo/1</a><p>According to Coinmarketcap Mina Protocol now has a market capital of $667 million. This is an ideal bear market valuation as it means whilst volatility will not be insane there is plenty of room left for long term growth.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mina Crypto Video Analysis</h3><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://youtu.be/CxPo-mHo8Uk[/embed]<h3>Meta Masters Guild Stronger Option to MINA Protocol?</h3><p>The crypto markets remain speculative and as outrageously prosperous as ever.</p><p>It is easy to miss coins that have pumped and once a crypto has already done a 2-3x in a bear market such as MINA the upside potential starts to become limited.&nbsp;</p><p>Many investors in the bear markets are turning their heads towards crypto<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"> ICO&#8217;s or presales</a> as they seem to offer greater returns and act as a strong bear market hedge.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows investors to participate by buy tokens before the cryptocurrency gets publicly deployed on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges.</p><p>One presale I have my eyes on is the Meta Masters Guild presale which is a play-to-earn guild comprising games covering the Metaverse, NFTs, Staking and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta Masters Guild (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memag/">Memag.io</a>) is targeting a hard cap raise of $4.97m which makes it a low market cap gem.</p><p>Once this launches a 10x could be realistic as it is not unheard of that a valuation of a trending crypto moves to $50m from $5m in a matter of a few weeks.</p><p>Over the last 3 weeks, Meta Masters Guild has already raised an incredible $2,074,185 during the crypto winter &#8211; this reflects huge investor appetite.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, 1 MEMAG (native token) coin is $0.016 but once <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memag/">Meta Masters Guild</a> raises $2,632,000 the price will rise up to $0.019.</p><p>It is recommended to buy now before the price rises to ensure you have a cost-effective entry point and this will also maximize the upside potential of your investment and protect you against any bearish volatility.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also visit my official Discord channel which explores trading, presales and other crypto insights by clicking <a href="https://discord.gg/jacobcryptobury">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>Synthetix Token has taken a huge hit this week following the recent upheaval in the markets due to news surrounding the FTX exchange.</p>
<p>As a result that price of Synthetix Token (SNX) has plummeted all the way down to $1.63 which could now reflect an undervaluation reaccumulation phase making it a strong addition to a long-term crypto portfolio. </p>
<p>Will Synthetix Token recover and what stronger alternatives are in the market? </p>
<h2>Synthetix Crypto Price Prediction 2022</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Last week Synthetix (SNX) was trading at a healthy $2.78 and then suddenly the abrupt news of the FTX exchange caused deleterious effects for many altcoins and major bluechip cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Now trading at $1.64, Synthetix Token (SNX) has taken a huge hit and has lost almost 42% of its overall valuation. </p>
<p>Clinging on to a key support level of $1.55 where the price rapidly bounced, SNX is now trading in a very promising looking bullish reversal pattern known as a falling wedge.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/94670/236308/snx-price-chart.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/94670/236308/responsive-images/snx-price-chart___media_library_original_631_395.jpg 631w, https://cimg.co/news/94670/236308/responsive-images/snx-price-chart___media_library_original_600_376.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/94670/236308/responsive-images/snx-price-chart___media_library_original_300_188.jpg 300w" alt="" width="631" />
<figcaption><i>SNX/USDT &#8211; Daily Time Frame.</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A successful breakout to the upside could result in a huge pump for the bulls and those accumulating Synthetix Token (SNX) at these lower price levels.</p>
<p>If the resistance trendline of the falling wedge is broken at roughly $1.68, we could see a powerful impulse wave up to the next resistance at $1.86.</p>
<p>Should this particular technical target be broken, we could then see a pump up to roughly $2.15 which would result in a 31% increase in price from current levels. </p>
<p>It is vital that SNX can hold on to the $1.55 support level to avoid negative continuation down to $1.43, although, this could be another very good dollar cost averaging opportunity if holding until the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-crypto-bull-run-coins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next crypto bull run</a>. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/94670/236309/snx-price-zoomed-out.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/94670/236309/responsive-images/snx-price-zoomed-out___media_library_original_641_386.jpg 641w, https://cimg.co/news/94670/236309/responsive-images/snx-price-zoomed-out___media_library_original_600_361.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/94670/236309/responsive-images/snx-price-zoomed-out___media_library_original_300_181.jpg 300w" alt="" width="641" />
<figcaption><i>SNX/USDT &#8211; Weekly Time Frame.</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is no secret that Synthetix Token (SNX) has corrected far beyond 90% from the all time high of $29 set back in February 2021. </p>
<p>Whilst on the macro-side this downtrend looks extremely bearish, the downside potential is now minimised as we delve deeper into crypto winter. </p>
<p>These particular extreme fear conditions are ideal for long-term accumulation and stacking up the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best cryptos in the industry</a> (loading up, for the next bull run). </p>
<p>The chart above reflects that Synthetix Token (SNX) could potentially be rooting</p>
<p> for a very bullish reversal up to $4.40 over the next few months. </p>
<p>We can also see a previous wick from June reflects that there is massive support at around $1.43, this is likely an area where whales and investors would rush back in to accumulate more. </p>
<h3>Synthetix (SNX) Crypto Video Analysis</h3>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>So yes, I definitely think Synthetix Token (SNX) could be a good hold for the next few years, however, if you&#8217;re looking for more upside potential and massive gains this year you might have better odds with the three new flourish presales we&#8217;re reviewing such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dash2Trade</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/calvaria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calvaria</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IMPT</a>. </p>

This particular impulse wave would see a price increase of roughly 74.33%.&nbsp;</p><p>It is hard to determine what could happen for the crypto markets over the next few weeks, but if IOTA is able to consolidate further throughout October there is a good chance of breaking out to the upside.</p><p>$0.249 acts as a key level of support which is vital not to be lost or we could see IOTA potentially drop down to $0.23 or below. This would be a new local low for this particular market cycle and be devastating for long term holders.</p><h3>IOTA Crypto Video Analysis</h3><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://youtu.be/0ogYMh9lW4g"></oembed></figure><h3>IMPT Token Carbon Offsetting Alternative to IOTA?</h3><p>IOTA is one of the more sustainable crypto choices the blockchain markets have to offer but a new contender has arrived known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/">IMPT Token</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The IMPT platform provides an imapctful carbon offset program where you as a potential investor can contribute to an ecosystem that connects socially responsible brands with businesses and individuals who want to reduce their carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst IOTA still has potential to pump beyond 10x and has achieved fantastic milestones, you might have to wait until the next crypto bull run in 2024-2025 to realise such returns.&nbsp;</p><p>IMPT Token is currently in presale and has already raised a tremendous $3,670,217 in just over a week. There is a good chance that it will launch for public sale in Q1 2023 and holders are anticipating huge upside potential of up to 50x returns.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are finding yourself feeling rather bored from the current state of play from the crypto markets, IMPT Token could shed some light on your portfolio and be the next coin to explode this bear market.</p><p>Interested parties can head over to the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/">impt.io</a> website to research the white paper and secure IMPT Tokens today before sell out.&nbsp;</p><p>To stay up to date with the latest crypto news and insights you can join my official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.gg/bN4KswS6kH">Discord</a> group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
