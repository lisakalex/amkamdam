<h3>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Best Presale for BTC Mining</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> is the best crypto presale in the cloud mining industry, offering a unique Stake-to-Mine method. The project’s native crypto, $BTCMTX, is a brand new crypto that recently launched its presale. Soon after its launch it attracted a huge investor interest as it raised more than $4.5 million since launch.</p>
<p>$BTCMTX can currently be bought at a discounted rate of $0.0119 during the presale phase, with the project using a tiered pricing model in its 39-phase presale. The cost of $BTCMTX tokens will increase in upcoming stages, ending at $0.0148 in the final presale stage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1319" height="640" class="aligncenter wp-image-133412" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix crypto presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png 1319w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1024x497.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-768x373.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1319px) 100vw, 1319px" /></p>
<p>Traditionally, cloud mining involved buying cash contracts from mining companies, leaving room for scams. Bitcoin Minetrix introduces &#8216;Stake-to-Mine,&#8217; where users stake $BTCMTX tokens to earn &#8216;mining credits.&#8217; These credits are non-tradable tokens used to obtain Bitcoin mining power. This system provides a secure, scam-free experience, with users able to sell at any time, while cloud mining also minimizes the environmental impact commonly associated with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</a>, the project will have a supply cap of 4 billion tokens, with a 42.5% allocation for mining. The project plans to raise $15 million as its soft cap target, allocating 70% of the token supply for this. The funds will be used for platform development, marketing, and renting cloud mining facilities. </p>
<p>Potential investors can follow the platform on <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinminetrix">X (formerly Twitter)</a> or join the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix">Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram group</a> to get the latest updates.</p>

The Battle Arena is powered by blockchain technology and AI to ensure that results and outcomes are immutable, secure, transparent, and fair, with players able to bet on results and side bets during battles.</p>

<h3>4. TG.Casino Token &#8211; Best Presale for Casino Rewards</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino/en">TG.Casino ($TGC)</a> is a newly launched Telegram-powered casino that is offering incredible staking yields during its presale, which launched in September. Already one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best crypto casinos</a> and available to players globally without a VPN, TG.Casino supports anonymous and instant sign-up, deposits, and withdrawals, with no KYC verification needed.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s done by leveraging a powerful bot on the hugely popular messaging app Telegram, which has almost 800 million active global users. Crypto gambling has become huge business with the likes of Stake and Rollbit enjoying surging prices, and $TGC tokens allow holders to earn profits and rewards from those playing at the casino.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/331064/tg-casino.jpg" alt="TG Casino crypto presale" /></figure>
<p>Over $2.65m has been raised since its presale launched, with tokens available for $0.17. A huge part of its early popularity has been the staking rewards, which are currently an incredible 185% APY. It has also enjoyed a rapid start because of its player rewards and loyalty programs, with players earning $TGC tokens as they play. With all this in mind, $TGC is shaping up to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-gambling-tokens.htm">best gambling tokens</a> of 2023. </p>
<p>The project is also planning a token burn that makes the project deflationary with players also earning a percentage of the daily profits. The casino will use profits to buy back tokens then distribute 60% to stakers as a reward with the remaining 40% sent to a burn address. $TGC has a max supply of 100 million with 40% allocated to the presale, 20% to the liquidity pool, 20% to staking, 10% to the rewards and bonus scheme and 5% each to marketing efforts and affiliates.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/331065/tg-casino-rewards.jpg" alt="TG Casino tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The casino itself will offer an incredible welcome bonus when it launches, with new players able to earn 2,000% up to 10 ETH, while those playing with $TGC can earn 25% weekly cashback on losses. There are thousands of slots, virtual and live dealers, and a sportsbook on offer.

<h3>5. eTukTuk &#8211; Best Crypto Presale for Eco-Friendly Investors</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk (TUK)</a> is creating a network of charging stations, which will help TukTuk drivers from developing nations access electric vehicles (EVs) at reduced costs. The eco-friendly project wants to help drivers make the switch away from combustion engines by incentivizing and rewarding them and is currently offering 750% APY during its presale.</p>
<p>Built on the Binance Smart Chain, eTukTuk incorporates proof-of-stake mechanisms, which lets $TUK token holders earn passive income by staking and maintaining the ecosystem. The platform will set up electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSEs) in urban and rural areas of various developing economies. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/315132/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk crypto presale" /></p>
<p>These EVSEs will be compatible with zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and other EV devices. The EVSEs will be set up locally in different territories, with each territory having a territory partner that helps in operating and installing the stations. By using local help, eTukTuk is helping TukTuk drivers save up to 400% in wages. </p>
<p>The platform will set up a driver app through which TukTuk drivers can charge their EVs at the outlets. The payments will be made with $TUK, the native cryptocurrency &#8211; territory partners will earn rewards in $TUK for each transaction taking place at the different charging stations. Even staked token holders will earn passive income from the total funds generated from the charging stations. eTukTuk will also offer inflationary rewards over 15 years, which will be released from a staking pool. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/315133/etuktuk-power-the-network.jpg" alt="Earn rewards when buying eTukTuk token" /></figure>
<p>The presale has only just launched and from a 2 billion token supply, 12.5% will be allocated for the presale rounds. Around $275k has been raised at the time of writing.

<h3>6. Green Bitcoin &#8211; Best Presale to Earn Rewards by Predicting Bitcoin&#8217;s Price</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin</a> is a crypto presale project focused on rewarding users who accurately predict Bitcoin&#8217;s price. The way it works is you buy $GBTC tokens, stake them and predict Bitcoin&#8217;s price every week. Depending on the duration of your staking as well as the prediction accuracy, you&#8217;ll earn rewards and bonuses.</p>
<p>As of this writing, $GBTC tokens are only available for purchase on a presale while the prediction game isn&#8217;t live yet. This gives early supporters the chance to buy the tokens at potentially low prices and stack up before the game is ready.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-139682 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-768x434.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-150x85.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Similar to other presales, there will be multiple stages where each stage will see a slight increase in the token price. This means that those who buy early get to buy at a lower price.</p>
<p>To participate in the presale, you need ETH, USDT or a card, as well as a crypto wallet to connect to the presale site. Once you complete the purchase, your tokens will remain locked until the presale ends.</p>
<p>During this time, you can stake your tokens. With a 700% APR at the moment, you can quickly add more $GBTC tokens to your portfolio. However, the APR is expected to drop as more tokens get staked.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="651" class="alignnone wp-image-139687 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-768x556.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-150x109.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Due to the project&#8217;s simplicity, it has already raised close to $300,000 in the first day of the presale. Once the presale ends, $GBTC will list on multiple exchanges. After that, the Bitcoin price prediction game is expected to go live, which is where the fun begins.</p>

<h3>7. Scorpion Casino &#8211; Best Presale for Daily Staking </h3>
<p><a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN">Scorpion Casino</a> is one of the best presale projects for 2024, as it allows users to earn up to $10,000 in daily passive staking income. The project is on a mission to build the number one social online gambling platform where users can earn a daily yield based on the casino’s performance.</p>
<p>The casino provides a seamless and fun gaming experience that includes all major casino games. The casino hosts over 210 games, with 160 live games, that include slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. Additionally, Scorpion Casino also hosts a sports betting section, allowing users to bet on the outcome of their favorite sports.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/276942/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino crypto presale" /></p>
<p>SCORP is the native token behind the platform and is the exclusive payment method for the ecosystem. SCORP will be the default currency for betting across all gambling products on the platform. Additionally, holders of SCORP can receive a passive income through the 2% re-distribution tax levied on every transaction. As a result, SCORP holders will see their token balances increase as the casino grows in popularity.</p>
<p>The SCORP token is also deflationary due to the 1% burn tax on each transaction. As a result, the token&#8217;s total supply will decrease over time, making the remaining tokens more scarce. The project is currently hosting a presale for the SCORP token, with $2m raised. </p>

<h2>What is a Crypto Presale?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto presales, often referred to as ICOs (initial coin offerings), are usually the first time retail investors can buy tokens, also allowing them to secure digital assets before the token is listed on crypto exchanges. </p>
<p>A limited number of investors can purchase the token before it is offered to the wider public and during a presale, crypto tokens are likely to be sold at a highly discounted price &#8211; often via the platform&#8217;s website. </p>
<p>This is done not only to raise funds for development but to increase hype and interest around a newly launched project. Once the token is listed on an exchange, its price might go up. The investor can choose to sell the coin immediately for a profit, or they can continue holding the token and hope that the price continues to climb higher. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the strategy will depend on the project and the risk appetite of the investor. In addition to this, some projects reward early investors with premium memberships, additional tokens, and access to exclusive features.  </p>
<p>Crypto presales can be private or public event, depending on the project. Some upcoming platforms require interested investors to register in advance to gain access to a crypto presale. On the other hand, there are also crypto presales that are accessible to the general public.</p>
<h2>How to Find the Best Crypto Presales to Invest in 2024</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrencies no longer struggle in the backwaters of finance. Some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-winter-tokens.htm">best crypto winter tokens</a> have shown resilience amidst the current market volatility. But with the majority of investors sharing a bearish sentiment, many people are looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-during-the-bear-market.htm">best cryptos to buy during the bear market</a>.</p>
<p>Today, digital assets have become part of the mainstream markets, and as such, there are many new digital tokens being launched every month. From an investment perspective, this means more opportunities. However, at the same time, it is crucial to know how to evaluate new crypto projects to determine whether the token is worth buying or not. </p>
<p>Here are some factors that can help investors identify the best crypto presales in 2024: </p>
<h3>Know Where to Look</h3>
<p>The first thing to consider is where to look in order to find the upcoming cryptocurrency presales. While guides like ours can help, investors should also expand their research to other platforms to learn more about new digital tokens. </p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko</li>
<li>Dedicated crypto presale sites like CoinSniper, Pinksale, ICO Drops</li>
<li>Social media websites like Twitter and Facebook</li>
<li>Online forums such as Reddit and Quora</li>
</ul>
<p>Since crypto presales happen before ICO and IDO listings, investors might not be able to find them via exchanges. Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to monitor crypto-related platforms in order to see what new digital tokens are coming online. </p>
<h3>Research the Project</h3>
<p>The absence of quantifiable data makes it challenging to determine if a new crypto project is worth investing in or not. After all, there are plenty of crypto scams out there. </p>
<p>This is why research plays a crucial role in every investment decision. After creating a shortlist of the best crypto presales to invest in, it would be wise to do an analysis of what the project is about. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/312619/ethereum-whitepaper.jpg" alt="Ethereum whitepaper" /></figure>
<p>Start by reading the whitepaper of the project, which reveals information such as the platform&#8217;s objectives, strategies, and plans for the future. </p>
<p>On top of this, it would also be wise to take a look at the roadmap and see when the project aims to execute the different milestones. If a presale crypto project does not have a whitepaper or a roadmap, this is a red flag that investors should not want to overlook. </p>
<p>That being said, not every project with a whitepaper represents a good choice. Instead, investors should consider what the unique value proposition of the project is and why it would make a compelling opportunity. </p>
<h3>Look Into the Development Team </h3>
<p>The team behind a crypto project is one of the important aspects that will determine its longevity. In a nutshell, the best projects have experienced team members who are knowledgeable about the respective industry. </p>
<p>For instance, for play-to-earn projects, it would make sense that the team members are familiar with blockchain technology as well as GameFi concepts. </p>
<p>Meme coins are often founded by anonymous developers, so it is even more important investors look at other parts of the project to ensure they are legitimate &#8211; such as the smart token audit, utility and tokenomics.</p>
<h3>Review the Tokenomics </h3>
<p>A project’s tokenomics informs investors about the total token supply, and how much of the supply is distributed for exchange listings, the presale, project team, etc. When searching for the best crypto presales, the tokenomics of the project should also be paid attention to. </p>
<p>While many crypto presales start with a hard cap of billions of tokens, the majority of projects burn coins after the project launches. This &#8216;deflationary&#8217; system can reduce the supply, thus driving up the token&#8217;s value &#8211; in theory at least. </p>
<p>Ultimately, investors should try to learn everything they can about a new crypto project before risking any money. </p>
<h3>Focus on Social Media</h3>
<p>Today, social media platforms and online forums have the power to make or break a cryptocurrency. The case of Dogecoin is a perfect example of this. The price of this token was boosted by Elon Musk&#8217;s tweets alongside discussions on subreddits. </p>
<p>Given this, social media can easily be considered a valuable source that can help investors spot the next cryptocurrency to explore. However, investors should not blindly follow such forums. It is essential to do background research in order to understand the viability of the project. </p>
<p>Furthermore, social media follower numbers can easily be manipulated &#8211; whether through buying large accounts or using spam bots &#8211; so tracking things like post engagement is also important.</p>
<h3>Spot Developing Trends</h3>
<p>It is vitally important that investors keep up with the latest trends and the news cycle as that can lead to huge returns in the market.</p>
<p>Crypto, like any other asset class, goes through cycles of interest and in the early years it was the capability of blockchains, then DeFi products, then layer 2s. During the last bull run Web3 gaming, metaverse and NFT-related projects made huge gains.</p>
<p>So far in 2023, artificial intelligence has been dominating the news cycle and AI-related coins have been among the top gainers and another emerging trend could see the most hype in the next bull run.</p>
<h2>How We Chose The Best Crypto Presales</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><em>CryptoNews</em> regularly updates the top presales list above and adjusts their order depending on the following rating criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current market trends &#8211; as mentioned above, some of the most trending crypto narratives and asset classes are artificial intelligence, meme coins, crypto mining, GambleFi, and the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF</li>
<li>How early a presale is in its roadmap &#8211; it&#8217;s often advantageous to invest early if there are incremental token price increases that afford the earliest investors a discount and an initial ROI at launch</li>
<li>Staking rewards &#8211; in some cases new projects offer a high annual percentage yield (APY) that allows early buyers to compound their returns</li>
<li>Team information and audit &#8211; having a doxxed founding team and completing a smart contract audit with a reputable company lends credibility to a new crypto presale</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, assets like Bitcoin Minetrix may gain additional traction from the Bitcoin ETF narrative, and Meme Kombat has a public project lead. Both are audited presales with staking rewards, and $MK incorporates AI elements.</p>
<h2>Is it a Good Idea to Invest in Crypto Presales?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As with any other investment, crypto presales come with benefits as well as risks. Below, we have outlined a few reasons why investors might want to consider investing in the best crypto presales of this year:</p>
<h3>High Price Potential</h3>
<p>Since presales are conducted ahead of the ICO, tokens will be sold at a discounted price. This places early investors at an instant advantage &#8211; as they will be able to purchase coins at a lower price and potentially sell them for a profit once the token is listed on an exchange. </p>
<p>And in case the project grows, the token&#8217;s value might appreciate more. On top of this, due to the low price on offer &#8211; the investor will also have the option of purchasing a larger stock of coins at launch. </p>
<h3>Earn Passive Income</h3>
<p>It is also becoming common for crypto projects to reward early investors with passive income. This can come in many forms. For instance, it has become common for crypto projects to offer status rewards to investors &#8211; which distributes tax collected via transactions. </p>
<p>For instance, holders of Avoteo tokens will be offered 3% of every transaction on the platform. Similarly, many crypto projects also have a built-in staking feature that allows investors to earn additional income by simply locking in their tokens. </p>
<p>So, when trying to identify the best crypto presale to invest in, it might be worth it to check out the additional perks offered by the project and the scope to generate passive income. </p>
<h3>Get Early Investor Advantage </h3>
<p>Another advantage is that investors can get in on the ground level of a unique idea before it becomes mainstream. For instance, when Dogecoin was launched, the concept of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coins</a> was still nascent. However, early investors were rewarded with significant gains several years down the line.</p>
<p>Investing in a crypto project during its presale stage allows investors to become a part of the core community, giving them the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals and foster a strong community. </p>
<h3>Risks of Crypto Presales</h3>
<p>While searching for the best crypto presale to invest in, it is imperative to consider the risks involved. If the chosen project fails, investors might find themselves owning worthless tokens. </p>
<p>In addition to this, depending on wider market conditions, the value of the coins might decline rapidly after the ICO presale. This means that investors might not be able to make any profit from their investment. That is a risk that investors must consider when they are looking to reap the benefits of a crypto presale. </p>
<h2>How to Invest in Crypto Presales </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As we mentioned earlier in the guide, it is no easy feat to identify the best cryptocurrency sales. Although extensive lists of new presale coins are available on various websites, it takes time and research to weed out the very best.</p>
<p>However, occasionally, some projects emerge to create a buzz in the market. Projects usually run presales on native websites before going listing on bigger exchanges, where they attract more awareness and liquidity.</p>
<p>As an example, we outline below how to buy Bitcoin ETF Token on presale:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create MetaMask Wallet</strong> &#8211; To take part in the presale a non-custodial wallet is required. Both MetaMask and Trust Wallet are trustworthy providers. </li>
<li><strong>Buy ETH or USDT</strong> &#8211; $BTCETF tokens can be purchased using ETH or USDT. These assets can be acquired from an exchange or directly via MetaMask. It&#8217;s important to remember gas fees during this process, and some ETH will be needed.  </li>
<li><strong>Connect Wallet </strong>&#8211; Visit the Bitcoin ETF Token presale and link the wallet using the &#8216;Connect Wallet&#8217; button.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase $BTCETF Tokens </strong>&#8211; Next, select the relevant &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; option, decide how many tokens to purchase then and confirm the transaction. </li>
<li><strong>Claim $BTCETF Tokens </strong>&#8211; When the presale is concluded, the purchased $BTCETF tokens will be claimable from the website, by connecting the same crypto wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Presales provide investors with the opportunity to get in on the ground level of a promising new crypto project. They will also be able to benefit from discounted token prices, as well as additional incentives via staking and community rewards. </p>
<p>Having said that, it can be challenging to find the best crypto presale to invest in, especially when there are dozens of new projects being launched every month. A degree of risk is involved as well when investing in new projects early in their roadmap.</p>
<p>One of the best crypto presales right now is Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF), which has already raised more than $2 million in just three weeks. This cryptocurrency speculates the upcoming launch of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF &#8211; and will burn 25% of its token supply over time. Presale investors can buy this token for $0.006, and stake $BTCETF to earn annual yields over 125%.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<h3><strong>What is a crypto presale? </strong></h3>
<p>Crypto presales are a popular way for investors to buy digital tokens at a discounted price. New cryptocurrencies might be offered to investors in a presale before they are launched via an ICO or listed on an exchange. New presale tokens may be announced on social media, blockchain news platforms, or crypto-related market aggregators. </p>
<h3><strong>How do I get presale crypto?</strong></h3>
<p>In most cases, the presale crypto can be purchased directly via the project&#8217;s official website. This will involve connecting a digital wallet to the website &#8211; beware of fake sites impersonating a project &#8211; and making a crypto transfer. Some platforms also allow investors to purchase presale crypto using credit/debit cards.</p>
<h3><strong>Are crypto presales ICOs?</strong></h3>
<p>No, a crypto presale is conducted before an ICO. However, the two terms are often used interchangeably, not least because they offer early access to a new crypto project. The ICO bubble of 2017, during the bull run of that year, involved a similar investment process to presales of today.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the best crypto presale to invest in right now? </strong></h3>
<p>The best crypto presale right now is Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF). This crypto offers huge staking yields, and will burn 25% of its token supply after reaching specific milestones that align with the release of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF. </p>
<h3><strong>What are the best alternative presales to research right now?</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token could constitute a good investment, along with Bitcoin Minetrix. All of these presales raised considerable figures in a short timeframe, and have strong social followings.</p>
<h3><strong>How can I tell if a presale is legitimate? </strong></h3>
<p>Most of the time, all of the information is clearly available in the whitepaper, website, and socials. Often, a project might state that it is for entertainment purposes only. If you read all the available information, you can make informed decisions, without falling prey to emotional investment. </p>
<h3><strong>What are the risks of presales?</strong></h3>
<p>One of the risks involved for investors in crypto presales is that you are investing in something new and unproven. Dozens of new cryptocurrencies come on the market every month, but most will never be widely adopted. That means they may, eventually, lose all of their value. Most of these tokens are not widely accepted and there may be a lack of liquidity. </p>

<h2>A Closer Look at the Top New Crypto Projects</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile and speculative assets. As such, it’s important for investors to familiarize themselves with the tokens on this list of new cryptocurrencies to ensure they suit their goals. With this in mind, we have reviewed each of the <a href="https://coincodex.com/new/">new crypto listings</a> we’ve mentioned above:<b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) &#8211; Overall Best New Cryptocurrency Tied to the Fate of Bitcoin Spot ETFs</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is a new cryptocurrency that speculates on the arrival of Bitcoin Spot ETFs. This Ethereum-based cryptocurrency project has recently launched on presale &#8211; and offers huge staking yields. At press time, token holders can buy and stake $BTCETF to earn APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) as high as 140%, while $1.8 million has been raised in just three weeks since it launched.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1440" height="487" class="aligncenter wp-image-127486" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699271372-bitcoin-etf-home-image.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token home" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699271372-bitcoin-etf-home-image.png 1440w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699271372-bitcoin-etf-home-image-300x101.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699271372-bitcoin-etf-home-image-1024x346.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699271372-bitcoin-etf-home-image-768x260.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /></p>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 25% of its token supply, upon reaching various project milestones which reflect on the success of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. For context, the Bitcoin Spot ETF will allow investors to trade Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. While a Bitcoin Futures ETF has been approved by the SEC, investors are now awaiting the approval of the spot ETF. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token whitepaper</a>, the project will conduct five burning events upon reaching five project milestones. After the completion of each milestone, 5% of the Bitcoin ETF Token supply will be burned. </p>
<p><iframe title="New BITCOIN ETF 10X Potential Crypto Presale?! (WHY THIS MIGHT 10X?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NhSSPSzmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Currently, Bitcoin ETF Token also charges a 5% trading tax on $BTCETF. This number will be reduced by 1% on the completion of each milestone. Some of the milestones include : </p>
<ul>
<li> $BTCETF crossing a $100 million market cap</li>
<li> $BTC trading above $100K</li>
<li>The SEC approving the first Bitcoin Spot ETF</li>
<li>The release of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF</li>
<li>Bitcoin Spot ETFs crossing $100 billion in assets under management</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, $BTCETF has a supply of only 2.1 billion. This new crypto has just been launched and is now priced at $0.0058 per token. A total of 840 million tokens have been allocated for the presale. By the final presale round, the price will jump to $0.0068 per token. </p>

<p>525 million tokens will be offered as staking rewards over the next 5 years. This new cryptocurrency aims to raise a hard cap of nearly $5 million from the presale. Join the <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Bitcoin ETF Token Telegram channel</a> for more information. </p>

<h3>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Brand New Crypto Project That is Tokenizing Cloud Mining</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a>  is a revolutionary cryptocurrency platform that is making cloud mining simpler and more efficient for users. Through the Bitcoin Minetrix Ethereum-powered smart contract, $BTCMTX token holders can stake their holdings. </p>
<p>The presale has enjoyed an incredible start and is now closing in on $4.5 million raised, while buyers can also earn 140% staking APY.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Token holders will be able to generate passive income and earn cloud mining credits through the staking contract. While these credits are not tradable, they can be burnt on Bitcoin Minetrix to purchase Bitcoin cloud mining power. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</a> states that users can receive allocated mining times and a percentage-based reward from mining revenues. By tokenizing the cloud mining process, Bitcoin Minetrix has effectively made cloud mining possible without having prior knowledge of cryptos or mining. </p>
<p>Furthermore, since Bitcoin Minetrix is using non-tradable ERC-20 tokens as a payment method to reward mining contributors, users have control over their assets. This is different from the usual cloud mining operations, which can often result in scams due to the use of third-party services. </p>
<p>From a 4 billion token supply, 2.8 billion tokens have been allocated for the presale. </p>

<p>At press time, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0119, with the price to surge to $0.0148 by the 39th and final presale round.</p>
<p>Interested investors can get started by making a $10 minimum purchase on the presale. The $BTCMTX token can be swapped with Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), or BNB (BNB).

<h3>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Brand New Meme Coin with Wide Utility Including Staking and Wagering </h3>
<p>The next crypto on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a>, a presale that has only launched this week but is standing out among a crowd of meme coins.</p>
<p>The project may be a meme coin but has several notable differences that make it unique in the space and has already raised over $2m as excitement continues to build.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/331122/screenshot-2023-09-21-151052.jpg" alt="meme kombat how staking works" /></figure>
<p>First is its wide range of utility &#8211; not only is Meme Kombat a stake-to-earn coin that allows holders to generate an APY, but it also has a play-to-earn element with the Battle Arena.</p>
<p>There, players can wager their staked MK tokens on the outcome of battles between characters that represent popular meme coins, such as Pepe and Wojak.</p>
<p>The project will use blockchain technology and AI to allow player-vs-player and player-vs-game wagering, with provably fair, transparent, and secure results.</p>
<p>As well as the overall outcome of battles, a range of side bets are also on offer, from the first move, specific outcomes, and unique events allowing for nuanced and creative ways to wager and win.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/331123/screenshot-2023-09-21-151109.jpg" alt="meme kombat tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The developers &#8211; who are doxxed and public-facing, another rarity in the meme space &#8211; have adopted a seasonal approach to the game, with the roadmap stating that new seasons will introduce new characters, themes and even game modes.</p>
<p>Staking rewards can be accessed during the presale, with buyers able to instantly stake their MK tokens and begin earning an APY, which currently stands at a huge 415%.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat has a tiny supply, especially for a meme coin, of just 120 million tokens with 50% of those allocated to the presale, 30% to staking and battle rewards, 10% to DEX liquidity and 10% to community rewards &#8211; which includes engagement incentives such as content creation and referrals. Notably there is no team allocation.</p>
<p>MK tokens are available for $0.214 with the presale having a hard cap of $10 million. More info and the latest news on the project is available in the <a href="https://t.me/MemeKombatToken">Telegram</a> group or the <a href="https://memekombattoken.gitbook.io/meme-kombat-whitepaper">whitepaper</a>.</p>

<h3>4. TG.Casino Token &#8211; Newly Launched Telegram Casino Offering with 200% Bonus and Buyback</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino/">TG.Casino Token ($TGC)</a> is another new crypto presale that raced to $3 million since its $TGC token ICO launched.</p>
<p>The token helps power a newly launched <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">crypto casino</a> that utilizes popular messaging app Telegram to enhance the user experience and make it anonymous, secure, and instant. It is now available to players globally.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/331124/tg-casino-rewards.jpg" alt="tg.casino staking mechanism" /></figure>
<p>Telegram, which has 800 million active global users, can be used to instantly sign up with no KYC verification needed, as well as anonymously and securely transfer crypto between the casino and wallets.</p>
<p>The casino is yet to launch but like others in the rapidly-growing space will offer thousands of provably fair slots, traditional table games with virtual and live dealers and a comprehensive sportsbook with pre-game and in-play betting. New TG.Casino players can also get a huge welcome bonus of 200% matched up to 10 ETH, while those who play with $TGC can earn 25% weekly cashback on losses.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons TG.Casino Token has quickly caught the attention of whales is because it is a stake-to-earn token offering incredible APY &#8211; staking rewards are currently sitting at 195%.</p>
<p>Another is its buyback scheme that allows stakers to share in the casino&#8217;s profits. Once the token is live, TG.Casino will periodically and systematically buy pack a portion of tokens using casino profits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="631" class="aligncenter wp-image-122544 size-large" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised-1024x631.png" alt="tg casino 1.5m presale raise" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised-1024x631.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised-300x185.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised-768x473.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised.png 1149w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Of the buy-back, 60% of it will be split among those staking their tokens as a reward, while the other 40% will be instantly burned.</p>
<p>As has been seen with the likes of Shiba Inu and Maker, burning can have a huge impact on the price of a token, making it deflationary and increasing its value.</p>
<p>There are 100 million TGC tokens in the supply with 40% allocated to the presale, 20% each to the liquidity pool and staking, 10% to the rewards and bonus scheme and 5% each to marketing efforts and affiliates.</p>
<p>TGC tokens are currently available for $0.125 and the presale has a $5 million hard cap. More info can be found in the <a href="https://tg-casino.gitbook.io/tg.casino-whitepaper/">TG.Casino whitepaper</a> or the <a href="https://t.me/TG_CasinoCommunity">Telegram</a> channel.</p>

<h3>5. Wall Street Memes (WSM) &#8211; High-Potential Meme Project with New Crypto Casino</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> enjoyed one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> ever, raising over $25 million before launching on exchanges and pumping almost 300%.</p>
<p>$WSM tokens now have a $50 million and could be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next tokens to explode</a> given the project has also just launched the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wsmcasino/">Wall Street Memes Casino</a> and is already one of the largest meme coins in the space, with volume that only trails Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/334496/wsm-casino.jpg" alt="wsm casino welcome bonus" /></figure>
<p>The casino is now live and powered by Telegram, which enables instant and anonymous account creation and deposits/withdrawals with no fees or limits.</p>
<p>The WSM Casino will offer thousands of slots, live dealers and sports betting, and new players can earn a 200% matched first deposit bonus up to $25k &#8211; those who deposit and play with $WSM can also earn 200 free spins.</p>
<p>Backed by a robust community that spans five social media channels and boasts over a million users, Wall Street Memes was first a group of social media accounts but its transition into the crypto domain has made significant ripples in the sector.</p>
<p>Its extensive influence has drawn engagement from renowned individuals, including even Elon Musk. With the increasing community support, the prospects of the token being listed on top-tier exchanges after the presale are high.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/334497/wall-street-memes-memes.jpg" alt="wsm casino wall street memes" /></figure>

<h3>6. eTukTuk (TUK) &#8211; Sustainable Crypto Platform Creating EV Stations for TukTuk Drivers </h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency on our list is $TUK, the native token of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk</a>, a brand-new eco-friendly project that has raised $265k in its presale and offers staking rewards of 770% APY.</p>
<p>For the past five years, eTukTuk has been developing a network of charging stations that will help reduce air pollution and carbon emissions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/315134/etuktuk-cardano.jpg" alt="etuktuk presale homepage" /></figure>
<p>Currently, 270 million TukTuks run on Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs), which leads to more air pollution than cars. As ICEs are becoming obsolete, TukTuk drivers are running out of ways to make a living &#8211; eTukTuk’s role is to set up various electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSEs), which will be compatible with zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). </p>
<p>The EVSEs will be set up primarily in developing countries as the country looks to establish its main base in Colombo, Sri Lanka. To reduce manufacturing and operational costs, eTukTuk will use the help of territory partners. </p>
<p>Each EVSE will be set up in a designated territory, with the territory partner operating and installing the essential equipment and maintaining the EVSEs. Once these sites are up and running, TukTuk drivers can make payments at the charging stations using $TUK tokens. </p>
<p>The territory partners will be rewarded with a commission for each new transaction on the charging stations. Token holders can also engage in power staking &#8211; members can stake $TUK to power nodes to maintain the EVSEs. In return, they can earn a potentially high APY (Annual Percentage Yield). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/315135/etuktuk-features.jpg" alt="etuktuk how it works" /></figure>
<p>The more transactions the charging stations generate, the higher APY a staked member receives. eTukTuk is also based on the Binance Smart Cain, an energy-efficient and scalable network that will help lower the costs for drivers and users. </p>
<p>Go through the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf">eTukTuk whitepaper</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/etuktuk">Telegram channel</a> to keep yourselves updated with this new cryptocurrency platform. </p>

<h3>7. Green Bitcoin &#8211; Predict Bitcoin&#8217;s Price and Earn Rewards in 2023</h3>
<p>Next on our list is a crypto project that aims to gamify Bitcoin price predictions and help users earn passive income at the same time. To get involved in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin</a> project, you need to stake $GBTC tokens and drop a Bitcoin price prediction on their website. Depending how accurate you are and how long you choose to stake your tokens, you&#8217;ll be rewarded.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Green Bitcoin is in a presale stage where you can buy $GBTC tokens at a discounted price before the official launch and listing on exchanges. During the presale, the price will increase with each stage, meaning early birds get to enjoy potentially the lowest token price.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-139682 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-768x434.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-150x85.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Participate in the presale using ETH, USDT or a card. All you have to do is connect your MetaMask wallet, or a similar Ethereum-based wallet, to complete the purchase. Once the presale ends, you&#8217;ll be able to claim your tokens.</p>
<p>While you wait for the presale to end, however, you can maximize your $GBTC tokens by staking them. There&#8217;s a 700% annual percentage rate at the moment of writing. Note, the APR will drop as more tokens get staked during the presale. Regardless when you buy the tokens and stake them, this could be a great opportunity to stack up before the game goes live.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="651" class="alignnone wp-image-139687 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-768x556.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-150x109.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>There will be 21 million tokens in total, 40% of which will be sold during the presale and 27.5% will be used for the staking rewards, according to <a href="https://www.greenbitcoin.xyz/whitepaper.pdf">Green Bitcoin&#8217;s whitepaper</a>. This means that more than half of the total supply will be distributed to early adopters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for what is to come next, Green Bitcoin&#8217;s project has set up four straightforward stages in its development:</p>
<ol>
<li>Token presale launch.</li>
<li>Token listed on exchanges.</li>
<li>Bitcoin price prediction and staking go live.</li>
<li>Improve the game.</li>
</ol>

<h3>8. Scorpion Casino – The Best Social Online Gambling Platform </h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency that can bring attractive returns to investors this year is SCORP – the native cryptocurrency of <a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN"><u>Scorpion Casino</u></a>. It is a first-of-its-kind social online gambling platform where you can earn daily yield based on the casino&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>The project accrues daily passive income worth up to $10,000 for users holding SCORP. This is made possible by the integrated distribution system in the smart contract. Its aim is to offer a seamless and fun gaming experience while empowering participants to make an excellent side income. The approach turns gambling into a safe and secure source of income.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/276931/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="scorpion casino presale live" /></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify">SCORP is a deflationary token. The automatic burning mechanism on the platform will support the value of the token in the long term. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SCORP gives you entry to 30,000 betting opportunities monthly – 210 casino games, 160 live games, and sports events – with a licensed, transparent and provably fair platform. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You can also access major leagues like NBA, MLB, NHL, Champions League, Primera Division, Bundesliga, Football World Cup, UFC, Boxing, etc. via the website. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Despite being a new project, Scorpion Casino has joined forces with reputed platforms like BetRadar and CoinsPaid and secured a tier-1 exchange listing. That speaks for its credibility and growing foothold in the market. The casino platform is regulated and licensed by the Curacao eGaming licensing entity. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/276932/scorpion-extra-rewards.jpg" alt="scorpion casino extra rewards" /></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify">The payment options on Scorpion Casino are now limited to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, ETH, and BNB. Hopefully, it will integrate fiat payments and expand the list of cryptocurrencies in the near future. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The SCORP presale is now live, opening one of the best investment opportunities of 2023. Given that Scorpion is stepping into the fertile global online betting and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">cryptocurrency gambling</a> markets, attractive ROI awaits early investors. <i>(Use the Exclusive Bonus Code Scorpion20 to get 20% extra on your purchase.

<h3>9. Launchpad XYZ (LPX) &#8211; Web3-Powered Crypto Ecosystem with Array of Valuable Features</h3>
<p>Another new cryptocurrency project that investors may wish to keep an eye on is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a>. Launchpad XYZ is a brand-new presale project built on the Ethereum blockchain that aims to become the “central hub” for all things Web3. Until now, the Web3 ecosystem has been separated and disorganized – yet Launchpad intends to change that.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s platform will feature an array of tools and services designed to streamline the process of crypto and NFT investing. For example, Launchpad XYZ users can trade on the built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), purchase pieces of fractionalized assets, and even store their digital assets in Launchpad XYZ Web3 wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/271599/launchpad-3.jpg" alt="launchpad xyz homepage" /></figure>
<p>The project is offering access to an alpha Telegram signals group, which recently returned 7,000% returns on a call for LINQ.</p>
<p>In addition to these features, Launchpad XYZ will also have a metaverse experience library, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game hub, and even a first-of-its-kind NFT DEX.  Since all these features will be contained within one platform, users won&#8217;t need to go anywhere else to maximize their Web3-based activities.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Launchpad XYZ ecosystem is LPX – the project’s native utility token. As noted in the Launchpad XYZ <a href="https://whitepaper.launchpad.xyz/">whitepaper</a>, LPX will be required for many essential tasks, such as paying exchange fees and listing assets on Launchpad XYZ marketplaces. </p>
<p>LPX holders can even stake their tokens to gain exclusive benefits – such as guaranteed access to NFT whitelists and beta P2E game invites.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Launchpad XYZ is early in its lifecycle, so investors must be aware that purchasing tokens comes with an element of risk. This is because presale cryptos require funding to fulfill their ambitions, meaning they are often more volatile than alternative crypto assets. </p>
<p>However, the silver lining to this is that early investors can put themselves in line to make significant gains if all goes to plan. Investors can now <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-launchpad.htm">buy Launchpad XYZ tokens</a> through the presale, priced at $0.0445 with more than $2 million raised so far.</p>
<p>Importantly, Launchpad XYZ presale will feature ten stages with different price points, meaning those who get involved the earliest will receive the lowest price. Investors can keep track of Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s progress by joining the <a href="https://t.me/Launchpad_Official_Channel">official Telegram channel</a>.</p>

<h3>10. yPredict &#8211; Crypto Analytics Platform with Newly Launched Presale </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> is a cryptocurrency ecosystem that aims to help traders make more well-informed trading decisions. Through its crypto analytics and research platform, users can make subscriptions and gain detailed insights on the cryptocurrency space. </p>
<p>The subscriptions can be made with $YPRED &#8211; the native token of this ecosystem. Along with insights, users can access a prediction marketplace where financial quants and analysts create models determining their future predictions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/275525/ypredict-robot.jpg" alt="ypredict ai trading graphic" /></figure>
<p>Each model is verified by the community’s DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), after which it is released to the general public. Through yPredict, users can access sentiment analysis and technical and fundamental insights on various cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>The platform also uses AI tools to offer 25+ chart pattern recognition tools. Holding $YPRED will lead to other benefits in the yPredict ecosystem. Firstly, 10% of all new subscriptions are divided amongst existing token holders. </p>
<p>15% of the swap fees incurred are also distributed to the $YPRED token holders. Users can stake $YPRED to earn a potentially high APY (Annual Percentage Yield) on the ecosystem. Through the Learn 2 Earn feature, traders will be rewarded with tokens for studying new materials and taking online quizzes and assessments. </p>
<p>The platform will also introduce a Play-to-Earn (P2E) feature where users can make directional bets on the future of the markets. The top performers can stand a chance to win $YPRED.  The project has also announced it is developing a new AI-powered content editing tool.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/271801/ypredict-features.jpg" alt="ypredict main features" /></figure>
<p>Currently, $YPRED is in round five of its presale phase and has raised over $5 million. The token can be purchased for just $0.11 but will jump to $0.12 by the final round &#8211; therefore, investors can acquire $YPRED at a discounted price by purchasing the token at current levels. 80 million tokens have been allotted for the presale. </p>

<h3><strong>12. Doge Uprising &#8211; New Story Based ERC20 Crypto Set in 2045, Allows for 50% Early Bird Discount</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising/"><u>Doge Uprising ($DUP)</u></a> is an inventive new Ethereum-based presale with a story that starts in 2045. A global regime of oppression, led by Mark Zuckerberg, has to be fought against by a number of $DUP-powered NFTs. </p>
<p>These machines are known as Doge Mechas, and parallels can be drawn to the “Terminator” movie, though these machines fight in the future as compared to the past. The presale has only just launched with $30,000 raised so far.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/333821/screen-shot-2023-10-16-at.jpg" alt="doge uprising presale homepage" /></p>
<p>NFT owners are known as pilots, and are instrumental in fighting against the regime. This allows investors to take part in a community movement to prevent oppression. At the present time, the price per $DUP token is just $0.000013. This will double to $0.000026 in the next stage.</p>
<p>Elon Musk will lead the rebellion against the dark forces of Mark Zuckerberg (this is part of the story, and not to be taken literally). Zuckerberg is referred to as the “Lizard King” or the “Lizard Boy” within the saga. </p>
<p>There is a total supply of 450 billion tokens with 60% (270 billion $DUP) to be allocated to the presale. The project has also undertaken a <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/SolidProof-Audit.pdf"><u>third-party smart contract audit from SolidProof</u></a>, with excellent results. This was a very detailed smart contract audit. The token is set to list on Uniswap when the presale is over. </p>
<p>This could be a very successful token in 2024. It offers a 100% upside as compared to the price at the next presale stage. It is focused in the meme coin industry and has powerful storytelling capabilities.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/333822/screen-shot-2023-10-16-at.jpg" alt="doge uprising presale graphic" /></figure>
<p>Many people are not happy with global surveillance, and want to take part in an uprising, even fictional ones, and it also provides staking APY to investors. </p>

<h3>14. Worldcoin (WLC) &#8211; A Global Digital Passport On Blockchain With Retina Verification and UBI Potential, led by Sam Altman</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-sam-altman-launches-worldcoin-crypto-project-2023-07-24/">Worldcoin (WLD) was officially released in July 2023</a> by Sam Altman, who is also the head of OpenAI, after three years of testing and experimentation. </p>
<p>The aim is to create a World ID with a digital passport to prove that the holder is human. While there is a lot of hype surrounding many Web3 projects, Worldcoin has the financial backing, working product, and globally applicable use case to see tremendous growth, making it a top new crypto for 2024. </p>
<p>It combines retina verification alongside blockchain technology, which could constitute a viable combination for a universally applicable global identity for world citizens. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/320124/screen-shot-2023-07-26-at.jpg" alt="worldcoin homepage" /></figure>
<p>The project indicates that IDs tied to retina scans are required now that generative AI has become so powerful and can replicate human language. Soon, it might be possible for AI to replicate human bodily actions, as the tech becomes more sophisticated. </p>
<p>Initially, the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/worldcoin-org/">price for Wordcoin was incredibly volatile, hitting highs of $7.50</a>, but, settled into a trading range between $1–2 in the latter part of 2023.</p>
<p>It’s already possible to download the World App to receive the native token. But you will have to visit with an ‘orb’ to take your retina scan, and become a World Citizen. Indeed, many already have, with Worldcoin claiming to have more than 1 million monthly active users and over 4 million downloads of the application to date.</p>
<p>These retina scanning &#8216;orbs&#8217; have been placed in convenient locations around the world to incentivize users to signup. However, many have raised concerns as to whether the World ID will be truly decentralized in nature, and many more have questioned the data collection practices of the company. These data privacy concerns have lead some governments, including those of France, Germany, Argentina, the U.K., and Kenya, to suspend operations of Worldcoin.</p>
<p>Still, Worldcoin could set the framework for an international standard and enhanced identity verification. It might also help with the AI and bot issues that will inevitably arise as such technology is integrated further into the human economy.</p>

<h3>15. Celestira (TIA) &#8211; Rethinking how Layer 1 Blockchains Work to Improve the Layer 2 World</h3>
<p>Blockchains operate with four core functions: execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability, often called layers. On a traditional blockchain, these functions are all combined into one layer. Doing this imposes restrictions on how you can build on these chains; it also limits the amount of work a chain can do and, therefore, how many transactions it can put through at a time.<br /><br />The <a href="https://celestia.org/">Celestia</a> blockchain redefines the way we think about the architecture of blockchains by separating the execution and settlement layers from the consensus and data availability layer. This allows Celestia to optimize the running of a consensus and data availability layer. Which then allows the builders of the execution and settlement layers to optimize them for their specific tasks, increasing the throughput of the system without sacrificing security or decentralization.</p>
<p>Separating these layers and having the Celestia network managing data availability affords builders a lot more design flexibility, allowing them to work with much fewer constraints than current layer 1s give them. These builders can use different programming languages and different virtual machines to build unique dApps that focus on the needs of their users, not the requirements of the underlying blockchain.<br /><br /><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1600" class="wp-image-125217 aligncenter" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857321-celestia-the-first-modular-blockchain-scaled.jpg" alt="Celestia the first Modular blockchain" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857321-celestia-the-first-modular-blockchain-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857321-celestia-the-first-modular-blockchain-300x188.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857321-celestia-the-first-modular-blockchain-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857321-celestia-the-first-modular-blockchain-768x480.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857321-celestia-the-first-modular-blockchain-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857321-celestia-the-first-modular-blockchain-2048x1280.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><br /><br />In addition to all this, Celestia offers light nodes that can be run on devices like your laptop and use a unique data availability sampling technique to validate the whole blockchain by sampling random chunks of each block to verify that all the data is available. This allows many nodes to easily be spun up to verify the proof of each Layer 2 and support the network.<br /><br />The native asset of the Celestia blockchain is TIA, and is used to pay transaction fees—meaning that the layer 2s must use TIA to post their transactions to the network. These layer 2s can also opt to use TIA as their gas token or currency, allowing developers to focus on building rather than the muddy waters of tokenomics.</p>
<p>Celestia uses a proof-of-stake model to secure its consensus, which means TIA holders can stake their tokens to a validator to earn a portion of staking rewards.</p>
<p>As blockchain technology grows in popularity and the transaction count on blockchains continues to climb higher and higher, increasing the time it takes to get a transaction confirmed, developers and users are looking for faster and cheaper solutions that offer flexibility and security. Celestia makes an excellent case for solving all of these, making it a great new crypto in 2023.</p>

<h3>16. CyberConnect (CYBER) &#8211; A Multi-Chain Solution for Web3 Social Networks, Offering a Web2-Style User Experience</h3>
<p><a href="https://cyberconnect.me/">CyberConnect</a> is a web3 social network that uses blockchain technology to empower users with ownership of content, identity, and data. It allows users and developers to experience a range of new social networking primitives that are interoperable, censorship-resistant, and decentralized and allows organizations to reward their most engaged and creative community members.</p>
<p>CyberConnect has recently released V3 of the platform, which embraces the inevitable multi-chain future of web3 social networks and operates across multiple EVM compatible chains.</p>
<p>The tools built by CyberConnect have been used by web3 companies, including CoinMarketCap, to recognize and reward their loyal supporters and content creators through proof-of-participation within their communities.</p>

<p>With V3 came the launch of the CYBER token on multiple chains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Optimism) simultaneously, along with three big upgrades to the CyberConnect protocol.</p>
<p>V3 Introduced the CyberAccount (identity infrastructure) that allows for self-sovereign verifiable, transferable, and editable identity accounts for users—a functionality that was not possible with the previous format. The CyberAccount will be taking over from the old W3ST format.</p>
<p>V3 also brings in CyberGraph, a censorship-resistant database to record users’ content, connections, and interactions, across multiple networks.</p>
<p>All of this is built on top of the CyberNetwork, which has been upgraded since the release of V3 to make social interactions and transactions much much cheaper, making it a more gas efficient and scalable network. The CYBER token is at the center of the CyberConnect ecosystem. It is used as the gas token on the CyberNetwork and is required payment for purchasing a CyberID, i.e., creating a CyberAccount. Each CYBER also represents voting power in governance votes, and users can delegate their voting power to another user if they wish.</p>
<p>CyberConnect is connecting the fractured world of web3 social media together and enhancing the user experience by making it much more web2-esq in the process.</p>

<h3>17. TON Diamonds (GLINT) &#8211; Profit Distribution Earning Utility Token for the Largest NFT Marketplace on Telegram Partnered TON network</h3>
<p><a href="https://ton.diamonds/glint-coin">Glint coin ($GLINT)</a> is the new utility coin of the TON Diamonds NFT marketplace on the Toncoin network. It is designed to enhance the user experience as the network continues to grow and to increase community participation in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The TON network is a decentralized, proof-of-stake layer 1 blockchain that was developed by Telegram in 2018 and then abandoned. The project was then taken over by the TON Foundation, a group of passionate, independent community members who have continued to develop the project. In September 2021, in a competition, it processed a then-world record of 55,000TPS, and in September 2023, a partnership with Telegram was announced.</p>
<p>The TON Diamonds NFT marketplace is the most popular NFT marketplace on the Toncoin blockchain. It aims to connect the global digital art community with users of the TON chain by curating active artists and assisting them in stepping into selling their art in the web3 world.</p>
<p>Glint coin has four different use cases in the TON Diamonds NFT marketplace ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buying NFTs:</strong> Newly minted NFTs on the TON Diamonds marketplace can be accessed early by paying for them with Glint.</li>
<li><strong>Governance Power:</strong> Governance of the platform is to be migrated to a DAO that gives users control over the platform. Specifically, users will be able to decide on the NFTs and artists which can list on the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Profit Sharing:</strong> 22% of the profits from the TON Diamonds marketplace are distributed to Glint holders every quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Staking and Influence:</strong> Holders of Glint can stake their tokens to enhance their influence within the platform, including in the decision-making and governance process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Being a part of the biggest NFT marketplace on a network that just partnered with one of the world’s largest private messaging apps (and one used widely in crypto) could be a big deal. Glint coin allows you to become an early member of this community and reap the rewards from a 22% profit distribution as it grows.</p>

<h3 class="p1">18. Big Time (BIGTIME) &#8211; A Free-to-Play, Award Winning PC Game, Disguising the Game’s Web3 Elements to Increase its Appeal to Web2 Users</h3>
<p class="p1">In the <a href="https://bigtime.gg/"><span class="s1">Big Time</span></a> universe, spacetime is tearing itself apart, history is colliding, and the greatest minds and heroes from throughout history have been summoned to the end of the universe to team up and fight the evil coming through the cracks. With multiple interchangeable character classes, players battle monsters and mystery across time and space to push the powers of evil back into the darkness.</p>
<p class="p1">Big Time is a multiplayer RPG PC game whose graphics, story, and gameplay are enticing to players of existing games of this style in the web2 world. Big Time also won the Game of The Year 2022 award at the premier web3 gaming awards, GAM3 Awards.</p>
<p class="p1">The game’s producers have specifically targeted web2 players by hiding the web3 function of the web3 parts of the game, i.e., NFTs and fungible tokens, from the players, so it functions like a web2 game with the ownership and open marketplace elements that characterizes web3 games. The game’s Big Time Studio is full of industry veterans from some of the world’s biggest web2 game studios</p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1600" class="aligncenter wp-image-125237" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857763-what-is-big-time-token-scaled.jpg" alt="What is Big Time Token" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857763-what-is-big-time-token-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857763-what-is-big-time-token-300x188.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857763-what-is-big-time-token-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857763-what-is-big-time-token-768x480.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857763-what-is-big-time-token-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698857763-what-is-big-time-token-2048x1280.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Big Time offers a player-owned economy where players produce, collect, trade, and even lend in-game items and the skins on them. But, to do much of this, they need the BIGTIME token.</p>
<p class="p1">The BIGTIME token drives the Big Time economy and can only be earned through gameplay, <i>while equipped with an in-game item called an Hourglass</i> <i>that can be crafted and upgraded in a Workshop. </i>Players must build a Workshop in their SPACE (a personal, invite-only metaverse) where they use their BIGTIME token to craft and upgrade in-game items that they can then use or sell on the open marketplace. BIGTIME tokens are also required to access some of the Prestige Portals in the game world.</p>
<p class="p1">While the game is free to play, everything can be bought. As the game’s popularity grows, more players who are happy to pay to race through the up-skilling element of the game will arrive, bringing with them a demand for BIGTIME. Big Time is currently in preseason with a limited number of players, and the BIGTIME token is the driver of the Big Time ecosystem and already on the open market.</p>

<h2>How to Find the Newest Cryptocurrencies </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We’ve discussed some commonly adopted strategies below to give investors an idea of the most effective methods to find new cryptocurrency projects:</p>
<h3>Research Presale Cryptos</h3>
<p>Trying to figure out <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-much-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency.htm">how much to invest in cryptocurrencies</a>? Presales tend to have substantially lower entrance prices which means that you don&#8217;t have to spend a huge sum. That is when compared with what it will cost to purchase the token once it is open to the public on a major exchange.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="671" height="784" class="aligncenter wp-image-122390 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698604232-screenshot_64.jpg" alt="bitcoin minetrix presale 2.6m raised" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698604232-screenshot_64.jpg 671w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698604232-screenshot_64-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /></p>
<p>This is especially the case once the crypto project has increased in popularity. As such, one of the most effective ways to find hot new crypto coins to invest in is by researching up-and-coming launches. In finding new cryptocurrencies on presale, this offers investors the chance to gain exposure to a project while it is still in its infancy. </p>
<h3>Perform Keyword Searches on Social Media</h3>
<p>In a time when social media is the key to discovering new trends, it&#8217;s as good a place as any to search for new cryptocurrency releases for 2024. Platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and such allow users to search for keywords, for instance, ‘#bestnewcrypto or #cryptopresales. Investors could also type in a specific category such as #NFTgames. It’s also possible to set up notifications for these keywords.</p>
<h3>Monitor New Tokens on Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h3>
<p>Users can spot the newest cryptocurrencies is via a reputable platform &#8211; as it will likely vet projects to make sure they are legitimate prior to listing. One can seek out new cryptos by checking large exchanges or online brokers. Many will list a wide range of long-existing tokens. </p>
<p>However, these platforms also frequently add new crypto listings. Simply use the filter on the platform in question to search for specific types of tokens. </p>
<h3>Follow Developing Trends</h3>
<p>To take advantage of the crypto markets, investors need to follow the wider market to ensure they are up on developing trends in the space. For example, artificial intelligence has dominated the news cycle since the end of 2022 amid the emergence of some key AI tools &#8211; and AI-related cryptos have followed, making huge gains. </p>
<p>Read our review of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best AI crypto trading bots</a> to see some of the most exciting trading tools that can be utilized. Previously, Web3 gaming and NFT-related coins enjoyed a huge surge in early 2022 and discovering and acting on the next big trend can be an extremely lucrative method.</p>
<h2>How We Choose New Cryptocurrencies</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As newer tokens don’t show investors much in terms of historical performance, there are other things to consider prior to risking any money. When researching new crypto coins, we look at a range of metrics.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the project have planned for the future?</li>
<li>Is this clearly documented for investors to see?</li>
<li>What can the tokens be used for, if anything?</li>
<li>Is the project likely to be listed by a big exchange?</li>
</ul>
<p>See some of these considerations below in more detail:</p>
<h3>Crypto Use Cases</h3>
<p>Ethereum is built for future growth and scalability. Its blockchain is the foundation for several decentralized finance apps, and many more are still being created. For instance, one of the new cryptocurrency tokens on this network is Love Hate Inu.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, was created only as a means of payment. That said, Bitcoin has evolved into a store of value for some investors who like to speculate. Generally, in this space, the more use cases that tokens have, the higher the likelihood that new crypto projects will survive long enough to see growth increases.</p>
<h3>An Interesting Roadmap</h3>
<p>The best new crypto to buy will have an exciting roadmap and be clear and transparent about this to potential investors. This shows us that the team behind it is enthusiastic about the project, and that makes it more investable to the masses. It also means that the cryptocurrency is more likely to amass a strong community of supporters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="470" class="aligncenter wp-image-121954" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-1024x470.png" alt="Sensei Inu Roadmap" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-1024x470.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-768x352.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-1536x705.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>Liquidity Potential</h3>
<p>New crypto coins should have the potential for significant trading volume so that investors can sell them as and when necessary. A new cryptocurrency coin may not be worth buying just yet if other investors aren&#8217;t trading it in significant quantities.</p>
<p>Examples of the new cryptos to watch for potentially high liquidity include Love Hate Inu and DeeLance. As we said in our earlier reviews, both have had huge interest and investment from the early presale rounds. Also, look for tokens that are preparing to be listed on a large cryptocurrency exchange, as this attracts a much larger number of investors and encourages growth.</p>
<h2>Are New Cryptocurrencies a Good Investment?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When researching new crypto coins to buy, it&#8217;s always important to be mindful that there is a large amount of risk involved. Websites such as <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/new/">CoinMarketCap</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/new-cryptocurrencies">CoinGecko</a>, CoinList, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency">Reddit/CryptoCurrency</a> and Twitter can help you find new crypto projects, but it is vital you always undertake further research.</p>
<p>Red flags to look out for include a poorly written website, incomplete roadmap or white paper and a team that has not been doxxed. Furthermore, big social media followings can point to wide interest in a project &#8211; but be wary the followers are legitimate and not just bots. That said, there are some stand-out reasons that finding the newest crypto coins could be beneficial for investors.</p>
<p>See below:</p>
<h3>Potential to Make Gains as it Becomes More Popular</h3>
<p>As we touched on earlier, new crypto listings often start on presale. This presents an opportunity to join the community of investors early and hopefully make decent gains later on.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAMA sold out its presale in just eight weeks, with investors who bought TAMA in the first phase of its beta sale paying 1 USDT for 100 TAMA ($0.01 each)</li>
<li>However, by the time the presale ended later investors were getting 33.33 TAMA tokens for 1USDT ($0.03 each)</li>
<li>When the coin is listed the price started at $0.03 (1 USDT = 33.33) but the &#8216;listing effect&#8217; and strong use case meant the price surged and continue to see gains as the project grows</li>
<li>TAMA reached an all-time high of $0.194 in the days after listing &#8211; a near-2,000% increase from the original presale price</li>
<li>The price remains above $0.03 and is expected to pump again in the coming weeks and months with new listings and the ecosystem developing</li>
</ul>
<p>When digital currencies that are coming out of presale make their exchange debut, early investors could potentially realize an immediate upside.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/255387/tama-1-month-060223.jpg" alt="tamadoge chart february 2023" /></figure>
<p>Following the conclusion of its presale phase, Battle Infinity was another project created big gains for its investors when it was listed on PancakeSwap. There is still time for investors to buy Dash 2 Trade on presale at a discounted price prior to its CEX listings.</p>
<h3>In-Game Purchases</h3>
<p>Some of the newest cryptos are also used as a currency within a platform’s ecosystem. For instance, some projects have developed, or are developing, a range of P2E games. This will be the case with Tamadoge, which has already released five Tamadoge Arcade Games where players can earn TAMA as a reward, while it has an augmented reality app in development. </p>
<h3>Some of the Newest Cryptos Offer Giveaways</h3>
<p>One of the characteristics seen more frequently with the hottest new crypto to invest in is that they offer prize giveaways to raise awareness of the project. This is usually in the form of the cryptocurrency in question or NFTs. In either situation, the investor could stand to earn free tokens, which can be used for purchases on the platform or to swap for other digital assets.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors are continuously searching high and low for the next big crypto project. As such, today&#8217;s guide has reviewed and ranked the best new crypto coins to invest in. It’s a wise idea to create a diverse portfolio to spread risk and to research individual assets thoroughly. </p>

<h2>A Closer Look at the Top New Crypto Projects</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile and speculative assets. As such, it’s important for investors to familiarize themselves with the tokens on this list of new cryptocurrencies to ensure they suit their goals.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we have reviewed each of the <a href="https://coincodex.com/new/">new crypto listings</a> we’ve mentioned above:</p>
<h3>1. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Brand New Crypto Project That is Tokenizing Cloud Mining</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a>  is a revolutionary cryptocurrency platform that is making cloud mining simpler and more efficient for users. Through the Bitcoin Minetrix Ethereum-powered smart contract, $BTCMTX token holders can stake their holdings. </p>
<p>The presale has enjoyed an incredible start and is now closing in on $3 million raised, while buyers can also earn 215% staking APY.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Token holders will be able to generate passive income and earn cloud mining credits through the staking contract. While these credits are not tradable, they can be burnt on Bitcoin Minetrix to purchase Bitcoin cloud mining power. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</a> states that users can receive allocated mining times and a percentage-based reward from mining revenues. By tokenizing the cloud mining process, Bitcoin Minetrix has effectively made cloud mining possible without having prior knowledge of cryptos or mining. </p>
<p>Furthermore, since Bitcoin Minetrix is using non-tradable ERC-20 tokens as a payment method to reward mining contributors, users have control over their assets. This is different from the usual cloud mining operations, which can often result in scams due to the use of third-party services. </p>
<p>This revolutionary new cryptocurrency has just started its presale and has already made a massive impact, quickly closing in on $3m. From a 4 billion token supply, 2.8 billion tokens have been allocated for the presale. </p>

<p>At press time, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0113 during the first presale round, with the price to surge to $0.0148 by the 39th and final presale round.</p>

<h3>2. TG.Casino Token &#8211; Newly Launched Telegram Casino Offering with 200% Bonus and Buyback</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino/">TG.Casino Token ($TGC)</a> is another new crypto presale that raced to $1.5 million since its $TGC token ICO launched.</p>
<p>The token helps power a newly launched <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">crypto casino</a> that utilizes popular messaging app Telegram to enhance the user experience and make it anonymous, secure and instant. It is now available to players globally.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/331124/tg-casino-rewards.jpg" alt="tg.casino staking mechanism" /></figure>
<p>Telegram, which has 800 million active global users, can be used to instantly sign up with no KYC verification needed, as well as anonymously and securely transfer crypto between the casino and wallets.</p>
<p>The casino is yet to launch but like others in the rapidly-growing space will offer thousands of provably fair slots, traditional table games with virtual and live dealers and a comprehensive sportsbook with pre-game and in-play betting. New TG.Casino players can also get a huge welcome bonus of 200% matched up to 10 ETH, while those who play with $TGC can earn 25% weekly cashback on losses.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons TG.Casino Token has quickly caught the attention of whales is because it is a stake-to-earn token offering incredible APY &#8211; staking rewards are currently sitting at over 325%.</p>
<p>Another is its buyback scheme that allows stakers to share in the casino&#8217;s profits. Once the token is live, TG.Casino will periodically and systematically buy pack a portion of tokens using casino profits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="631" class="aligncenter wp-image-122544 size-large" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised-1024x631.png" alt="tg casino 1.5m presale raise" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised-1024x631.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised-300x185.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised-768x473.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698660784-tg-casino-1-5m-raised.png 1149w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Of the buy-back, 60% of it will be split among those staking their tokens as a reward, while the other 40% will be instantly burned.</p>
<p>As has been seen with the likes of Shiba Inu and Maker, burning can have a huge impact on the price of a token, making it deflationary and increasing its value.</p>
<p>There are 100 million TGC tokens in the supply with 40% allocated to the presale, 20% each to the liquidity pool and staking, 10% to the rewards and bonus scheme and 5% each to marketing efforts and affiliates.</p>
<p>TGC tokens are currently available for $0.125 and the presale has a $5 million hard cap. More info can be found in the <a href="https://tg-casino.gitbook.io/tg.casino-whitepaper/">TG.Casino whitepaper</a> or the <a href="https://t.me/TG_CasinoCommunity">Telegram</a> channel.</p>

<h3>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Brand New Meme Coin with Wide Utility Including Staking and Wagering </h3>
<p>The next crypto on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a>, a presale that has only launched this week but is standing out among a crowd of meme coins.</p>
<p>The project may be a meme coin but has several notable differences that make it unique in the space and has already raised $850k as excitement continues to build.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/331122/screenshot-2023-09-21-151052.jpg" alt="meme kombat how staking works" /></figure>
<p>First is its wide range of utility &#8211; not only is Meme Kombat a stake-to-earn coin that allows holders to generate an APY, but it also has a play-to-earn element with the Battle Arena.</p>
<p>There, players can wager their staked MK tokens on the outcome of battles between characters that represent popular meme coins, such as Pepe and Wojak.</p>
<p>The project will use blockchain technology and AI to allow player-vs-player and player-vs-game wagering, with provably fair, transparent, and secure results.</p>
<p>As well as the overall outcome of battles, a range of side bets are also on offer, from the first move, specific outcomes, and unique events allowing for nuanced and creative ways to wager and win.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/331123/screenshot-2023-09-21-151109.jpg" alt="meme kombat tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The developers &#8211; who are doxxed and public-facing, another rarity in the meme space &#8211; have adopted a seasonal approach to the game, with the roadmap stating that new seasons will introduce new characters, themes and even game modes.</p>
<p>Staking rewards can be accessed during the presale, with buyers able to instantly stake their MK tokens and begin earning an APY, which currently stands at 112%.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat has a tiny supply, especially for a meme coin, of just 120 million tokens with 50% of those allocated to the presale, 30% to staking and battle rewards, 10% to DEX liquidity and 10% to community rewards &#8211; which includes engagement incentives such as content creation and referrals. Notably there is no team allocation.</p>
<p>MK tokens are available for $0.1667 with the presale having a hard cap of $10 million &#8211; the price is set to increase 9% to $0.1883 this week. More info and the latest news on the project is available in the <a href="https://t.me/MemeKombatToken">Telegram</a> group or the <a href="https://memekombattoken.gitbook.io/meme-kombat-whitepaper">whitepaper</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Wall Street Memes (WSM) &#8211; High-Potential Meme Project with New Crypto Casino</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> enjoyed one of the best crypto presales ever, raising over $25 million before launching on exchanges and pumping almost 300%.</p>
<p>$WSM tokens now have a $50 million and could be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next tokens to explode</a> given the project has also just launched the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wsmcasino/">Wall Street Memes Casino</a> and is already one of the largest meme coins in the space, with volume that only trails Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/334496/wsm-casino.jpg" alt="wsm casino welcome bonus" /></figure>

<p>Backed by a robust community that spans five social media channels and boasts over a million users, Wall Street Memes was first a group of social media accounts but its transition into the crypto domain has made significant ripples in the sector.</p>
<p>Its extensive influence has drawn engagement from renowned individuals, including even Elon Musk. With the increasing community support, the prospects of the token being listed on top-tier exchanges after the presale are high.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/334497/wall-street-memes-memes.jpg" alt="wsm casino wall street memes" /></figure>

<h3>5. Launchpad XYZ (LPX) &#8211; Web3-Powered Crypto Ecosystem with Array of Valuable Features</h3>
<p>Another new cryptocurrency project that investors may wish to keep an eye on is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a>. Launchpad XYZ is a brand-new presale project built on the Ethereum blockchain that aims to become the “central hub” for all things Web3. Until now, the Web3 ecosystem has been separated and disorganized – yet Launchpad intends to change that.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s platform will feature an array of tools and services designed to streamline the process of crypto and NFT investing. For example, Launchpad XYZ users can trade on the built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), purchase pieces of fractionalized assets, and even store their digital assets in Launchpad XYZ Web3 wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/271599/launchpad-3.jpg" alt="launchpad xyz homepage" /></figure>
<p>The project is offering access to an alpha Telegram signals group, which recently returned 7,000% returns on a call for LINQ.</p>
<p>In addition to these features, Launchpad XYZ will also have a metaverse experience library, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game hub, and even a first-of-its-kind NFT DEX.  Since all these features will be contained within one platform, users won&#8217;t need to go anywhere else to maximize their Web3-based activities.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Launchpad XYZ ecosystem is LPX – the project’s native utility token. As noted in the Launchpad XYZ <a href="https://whitepaper.launchpad.xyz/">whitepaper</a>, LPX will be required for many essential tasks, such as paying exchange fees and listing assets on Launchpad XYZ marketplaces. </p>
<p>LPX holders can even stake their tokens to gain exclusive benefits – such as guaranteed access to NFT whitelists and beta P2E game invites.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/271600/launchpad-4.jpg" alt="launchpad xyz roadmap" /></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Launchpad XYZ is early in its lifecycle, so investors must be aware that purchasing tokens comes with an element of risk. This is because presale cryptos require funding to fulfill their ambitions, meaning they are often more volatile than alternative crypto assets. </p>
<p>However, the silver lining to this is that early investors can put themselves in line to make significant gains if all goes to plan. Investors can now <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-launchpad.htm">buy Launchpad XYZ tokens</a> through the presale, priced at $0.0445 with more than $1.9 million raised so far.</p>
<p>Importantly, Launchpad XYZ presale will feature ten stages with different price points, meaning those who get involved the earliest will receive the lowest price. Investors can keep track of Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s progress by joining the <a href="https://t.me/Launchpad_Official_Channel">official Telegram channel</a>.</p>

<h3>6. eTukTuk (TUK) &#8211; Sustainable Crypto Platform Creating EV Stations for TukTuk Drivers </h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency on our list is $TUK, the native token of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk</a>, a brand-new eco-friendly project that has raised $150k in its presale and offers staking rewards of 1,400% APY.</p>
<p>For the past five years, eTukTuk has been developing a network of charging stations that will help reduce air pollution and carbon emissions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/315134/etuktuk-cardano.jpg" alt="etuktuk presale homepage" /></figure>
<p>Currently, 270 million TukTuks run on Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs), which leads to more air pollution than cars. As ICEs are becoming obsolete, TukTuk drivers are running out of ways to make a living &#8211; eTukTuk’s role is to set up various electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSEs), which will be compatible with zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). </p>
<p>The EVSEs will be set up primarily in developing countries as the country looks to establish its main base in Colombo, Sri Lanka. To reduce manufacturing and operational costs, eTukTuk will use the help of territory partners. </p>
<p>Each EVSE will be set up in a designated territory, with the territory partner operating and installing the essential equipment and maintaining the EVSEs. Once these sites are up and running, TukTuk drivers can make payments at the charging stations using $TUK tokens. </p>
<p>The territory partners will be rewarded with a commission for each new transaction on the charging stations. Token holders can also engage in power staking &#8211; members can stake $TUK to power nodes to maintain the EVSEs. In return, they can earn a potentially high APY (Annual Percentage Yield). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/315135/etuktuk-features.jpg" alt="etuktuk how it works" /></figure>
<p>The more transactions the charging stations generate, the higher APY a staked member receives. eTukTuk is also based on the Binance Smart Cain, an energy-efficient and scalable network that will help lower the costs for drivers and users. </p>

<h3>7. Chimpzee &#8211; Combining Crypto and Social Investment in 2023</h3>
<p>The blockchain is a great tool for global coordination. It has changed the way people come together for a common cause. So next on our list is a token that is an excellent crypto as well as a social investment, ingrained in wildlife conservation.</p>
<p><a href="/ext/chimpzee/"><u>Chimpzee</u></a> is a first-of-its-kind project that allows users to get involved in wildlife conservation and climate change, while earning attractive passive income. The project stands apart with its vibrant incentivization scheme, high-profile partnerships, and three-pillar ecosystem.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/268086/chimpzee-working-together.jpg" alt="chimpzee charity partners" /></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify">The three key components of Chimpzee are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Chimpzee shop: Buy<strong> unique Chimpzee merchandise </strong>and earn passive income in CHMPZ coins. Each purchase is a display of your support for climate action, as Chimpzee distributes a percentage of profits generated from the platform to charity. </li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Chimpzee NFT Marketplace:<strong> Trade and earn</strong> your way to a better world with the first platform that shares a portion of trading fee profits with users. It will list environment-focused NFTs on the main page. </li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Zero Tolerance Game: A <strong>play-to-earn</strong> game that allows you to earn CHMPZ coins and premium prizes. The gameplay is gripping with the potential to penetrate a young demographic. It raises awareness about climate change and encourages them to be a part of the mission.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">10% of the CHMPZ token supply and a share of the profits are allocated to organizations that align with Chimpzee’s environmental mission, including The Giving Block, One Tree Planted, and the WILD Foundation. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The best way into the project is by buying Chimpzee NFT Passports, which give multiple benefits and rewards to holders, in recognition of their financial support. (Diamond and Gold series NFTs come with the highest staking APYs and earning potential). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/268087/image1.jpg" alt="chimpzee presale stages" /></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify">Since they have yet to go live, you can book them early by participating in the ongoing CHMPZ presale. It is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies of 2023, owing to Chimpzee’s high social relevance and scope for mainstream adoption. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In addition, CHMPZ tokens used to buy the NFT Passport are burned, thus boosting its value in the open market. More than $1.75m has now been raised in the presale.</p>

<h3>8. Scorpion Casino – The Best Social Online Gambling Platform </h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency that can bring attractive returns to investors this year is SCORP – the native cryptocurrency of <a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN"><u>Scorpion Casino</u></a>. It is a first-of-its-kind social online gambling platform where you can earn daily yield based on the casino&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>The project accrues daily passive income worth up to $10,000 for users holding SCORP. This is made possible by the integrated distribution system in the smart contract. Its aim is to offer a seamless and fun gaming experience while empowering participants to make an excellent side income. The approach turns gambling into a safe and secure source of income.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/276931/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="scorpion casino presale live" /></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify">SCORP is a deflationary token. The automatic burning mechanism on the platform will support the value of the token in the long term. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SCORP gives you entry to 30,000 betting opportunities monthly – 210 casino games, 160 live games, and sports events – with a licensed, transparent and provably fair platform. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You can also access major leagues like NBA, MLB, NHL, Champions League, Primera Division, Bundesliga, Football World Cup, UFC, Boxing, etc. via the website. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Despite being a new project, Scorpion Casino has joined forces with reputed platforms like BetRadar and CoinsPaid and secured a tier-1 exchange listing. That speaks for its credibility and growing foothold in the market. The casino platform is regulated and licensed by the Curacao eGaming licensing entity. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/276932/scorpion-extra-rewards.jpg" alt="scorpion casino extra rewards" /></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify">The payment options on Scorpion Casino are now limited to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, ETH, and BNB. Hopefully, it will integrate fiat payments and expand the list of cryptocurrencies in the near future. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The SCORP presale is now live, opening one of the best investment opportunities of 2023. Given that Scorpion is stepping into the fertile global online betting and gambling markets, attractive ROI awaits early investors. <i>(Use the Exclusive Bonus Code Scorpion20 to get 20% extra on your purchase.

<h3>9. yPredict &#8211; Crypto Analytics Platform with Newly Launched Presale </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> is a cryptocurrency ecosystem that aims to help traders make more well-informed trading decisions. Through its crypto analytics and research platform, users can make subscriptions and gain detailed insights on the cryptocurrency space. </p>
<p>The subscriptions can be made with $YPRED &#8211; the native token of this ecosystem. Along with insights, users can access a prediction marketplace where financial quants and analysts create models determining their future predictions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/275525/ypredict-robot.jpg" alt="ypredict ai trading graphic" /></figure>
<p>Each model is verified by the community’s DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), after which it is released to the general public. Through yPredict, users can access sentiment analysis and technical and fundamental insights on various cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>The platform also uses AI tools to offer 25+ chart pattern recognition tools. Holding $YPRED will lead to other benefits in the yPredict ecosystem. Firstly, 10% of all new subscriptions are divided amongst existing token holders. </p>
<p>15% of the swap fees incurred are also distributed to the $YPRED token holders. Users can stake $YPRED to earn a potentially high APY (Annual Percentage Yield) on the ecosystem. Through the Learn 2 Earn feature, traders will be rewarded with tokens for studying new materials and taking online quizzes and assessments. </p>
<p>The platform will also introduce a Play-to-Earn (P2E) feature where users can make directional bets on the future of the markets. The top performers can stand a chance to win $YPRED.  The project has also announced it is developing a new AI-powered content editing tool.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/271801/ypredict-features.jpg" alt="ypredict main features" /></figure>
<p>Currently, $YPRED is in round five of its presale phase and has raised over $4.5 million.</p>
<p>The token can be purchased for just $0.11 but will jump to $0.12 by the final round &#8211; therefore, investors can acquire $YPRED at a discounted price by purchasing the token at current levels. 80 million tokens have been allotted for the presale. </p>

At the center of the ecosystem is $COGW, the utility token, which provides full access to all the AI tools and features on Cogwise. </p>

To help improve a member’s technical analysis, Cogwise also offers an AI trading assistant. The platform can detect trends by studying chart patterns and analyzing historical data. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/323140/screen-shot-2023-08-10-at.jpg" alt="cogwise presale homepage" /></figure>

<h3><strong>11. Doge Uprising &#8211; New Story Based ERC20 Crypto Set in 2045, Allows for 50% Early Bird Discount</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising/"><u>Doge Uprising ($DUP)</u></a> is an inventive new Ethereum-based presale with a story that starts in 2045. A global regime of oppression, led by Mark Zuckerberg, has to be fought against by a number of $DUP-powered NFTs. </p>
<p>These machines are known as Doge Mechas, and parallels can be drawn to the “Terminator” movie, though these machines fight in the future as compared to the past. The presale has only just launched with $20,000 raised so far.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/333821/screen-shot-2023-10-16-at.jpg" alt="doge uprising presale homepage" /></p>
<p>NFT owners are known as pilots, and are instrumental in fighting against the regime. This allows investors to take part in a community movement to prevent oppression. At the present time, the price per $DUP token is just $0.000013. This will double to $0.000026 in the next stage.</p>
<p>Elon Musk will lead the rebellion against the dark forces of Mark Zuckerberg (this is part of the story, and not to be taken literally). Zuckerberg is referred to as the “Lizard King” or the “Lizard Boy” within the saga. </p>
<p>There is a total supply of 450 billion tokens with 60% (270 billion $DUP) to be allocated to the presale. The project has also undertaken a <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/SolidProof-Audit.pdf"><u>third-party smart contract audit from SolidProof</u></a>, with excellent results. This was a very detailed smart contract audit. The token is set to list on Uniswap when the presale is over. </p>
<p>This could be a very successful token in 2023. It offers a 100% upside as compared to the price at the next presale stage. It is focused in the meme coin industry and has powerful storytelling capabilities.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/333822/screen-shot-2023-10-16-at.jpg" alt="doge uprising presale graphic" /></figure>
<p>Many people are not happy with global surveillance, and want to take part in an uprising, even fictional ones, and it also provides staking APY to investors. </p>
<p>More information about this project can be found within the <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Doge Uprising Whitepaper</u></a>. The <a href="https://t.me/+JfnjZpCD9b4wNTlk"><u>Telegram channel</u></a> is another useful source, for alerts and updates. </p>

<h3><strong>12. Sensei Inu &#8211; Brand New Presale With Innovative Proof Of Value </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/senseiinu/"><u>Sensei Inu ($SINU)</u></a> is a new trivia-based platform that offers rewards to users, depending on how much they learn. This is different from the traditional proof of stake ecosystem where users stake coins and receive their rewards automatically. </p>
<p>It brings real-world utility in the sense that people only receive something when they have earned it.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/334334/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="sensei inu presale website" /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://media.senseiinu.com/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Sensei Inu Whitepaper</u></a> states that this new kind of blockchain will help to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. With most PoS blockchains, huge whales can buy all the coins and wait to collect staking rewards. With Sensei Inu, players need to get smarter to earn more.</p>
<p>Each round consists of 10 questions with a countdown timer, and the questions get harder towards the end of each round. The top 10 users in each round are rewarded in $SINU, with more rewards for the #1 spot. If there is a tie, an extra round will ensue between the best candidates.</p>
<p>Players have a user-friendly Sensei Dashboard where they can set targets, view their overall progress, and master specific areas. This includes visual elements of achievements. A number of trivia games are available on desktop and mobile devices, to play on the fly.</p>
<p>There are a total of 5 billion $SINU tokens and 50% (2.5 billion) are up for grabs in this Ethereum-powered presale. Of the remaining tokens, 20% goes to liquidity, 20% to burning, and 10% to CEX listing. </p>

<p>20% is a large burn amount and could result in price appreciation for the native coin. A referral system is also in place for additional rewards.</p>
<p>The price in the current stage is just $0.0007, with more than $400k raised so far. More details can be found on the <a href="https://twitter.com/SenseiInuCoin"><u>Twitter</u></a> account. </p>

<h3>13. Worldcoin (WLC) &#8211; A Global Digital Passport On Blockchain With Retina Verification and UBI Potential, led by Sam Altman</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-sam-altman-launches-worldcoin-crypto-project-2023-07-24/">Worldcoin (WLD) was officially released in July 2023</a> by Sam Altman, who is also the head of OpenAI, after three years of testing and experimentation. </p>
<p>The aim is to create a World ID with a digital passport to prove that the holder is human. While there is a lot of hype surrounding many Web3 projects, Worldcoin has the financial backing, working product, and globally applicable use case to see tremendous growth, making it a top new crypto for 2023. </p>
<p>It combines retina verification alongside blockchain technology, which could constitute a viable combination for a universally applicable global identity for world citizens. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/320124/screen-shot-2023-07-26-at.jpg" alt="worldcoin homepage" /></figure>
<p>The project indicates that IDs tied to retina scans are required now that generative AI has become so powerful and can replicate human language. Soon, it might be possible for AI to replicate human bodily actions, as the tech becomes more sophisticated. </p>
<p>The price for Worldcoin has been incredibly volatile, going from $0.15 to $5 and now settling to around <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/worldcoin-org/">$2.40 on July 24, 2023.</a> Currently, in its beta period, it has over 2 million users, who are rewarded in the native token for project participation. </p>
<p>It’s already possible to download the World App to receive the native token. But you will have to visit with an ‘orb’ to take your retina scan, and become a World Citizen. </p>
<p>Many have raised concerns as to whether the World ID will be truly decentralized in nature. Sam Altman is also a proponent of a Universal Basic Income, a controversial topic for many who argue that this stance promotes centralization instead of decentralization. </p>
<p>Still, Worldcoin could set the framework for an international standard and enhanced identity verification. It might also help with the AI and bot issues that will inevitably arise as such technology is integrated further into the human economy.</p>

<h3><br />14. Theta Network (THETA) &#8211; Redefining Content Delivery For a Web3 Audience</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thetatoken.org/">Theta Network (THETA)</a> was initially released as an ERC-20 token, and it has been operating on the mainnet since March 2019. In 2017, private token sales raised $20M. In late 2022, the Theta &#8220;Metachain&#8221; went live, for higher transaction throughput, customization, and reliability so that existing subscribers of large influencers could be easily onboarded to Web3. </p>
<p>Theta is a user-powered, decentralized video distribution network that utilizes a unique blockchain (Theta Network). Its value proposition is to successfully build a mesh network of shared content in order to lower the costs of content delivery networks. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/320061/screen-shot-2023-07-26-at.jpg" alt="theta network metachin mainnet 4.0 launched " /></figure>
<p>Theta Network uses a modified BFT consensus mechanism that still supports more than 1,000 TPS and enables thousands of nodes to take part in the consensus process. It also utilizes a method known as an &#8220;off-chain pool for micropayments&#8221;. This method keeps the communication overhead minimal. </p>
<p>The two tokens utilized in its crypto-economics are THETA and TFUEL. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta-network/">THETA</a> is the Theta protocol&#8217;s governance token and is used to stake nodes, create blocks, and take part in the protocol&#8217;s governance. </p>
<p>The operational token of the Theta protocol is called TFUEL, and users utilize it to carry out transactions (such as interacting with smart contracts or allowing a relay node to provide a video feed to a third party). Every video stream that nodes rebroadcast to other network users earns them TFUEL.</p>
<p>Theta blockchain tokens are intended to incentivize individual users to offer their unused bandwidth and computing resources as cache or relay nodes for video broadcasts. With this architecture, the &#8220;last-mile&#8221; delivery issue (the fundamental bottleneck for conventional content delivery pipelines) is resolved. This is especially true for high-resolution, high-bitrate 4k, 8k, and next-generation streams.</p>
<p>In recent times, there has been an exodus of people from mainstream platforms that are looking for a decentralized alternative. Theta Token has a good use case here as an all encompassing content delivery network for Web3, making it a great new crypto in 2023. </p>

<h3>15. Immutable (IMX) &#8211; Leading Platform in Ethereum-Based Web3 Games Development With New SSO Passport For Users</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.immutable.com/company">Immutable</a> is a global leader in gaming with a drive to bring digital ownership to every player. Immutable is the same organization responsible for Immutable X, a layer 2 for NFTs on Ethereum, and has many offerings. </p>
<p>The Immutable Group consists of the Immutable Platform, a developer platform for building &amp; scaling web3 games on Ethereum, as well as Immutable Games, a world leader in web3 game development, with leading titles. They have also recently released a new product, the Immutable Passport. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/323756/screen-shot-2023-08-14-at.jpg" alt="immutable web3 gaming homepage" /></figure>
<p>The Immutable Passport is a non-custodial wallet, providing passwordless sign-on and automated wallet creation for users. It’s aimed at the gaming niche. A comparison can be made to Google’s single sign on (SSO) for many of its products. </p>
<p>The Immutable Passport SSO is sorely needed in the Web3 industry, as users have a tendency to lose their wallet keys. If they have more than one private key to store, the chances of it being lost or stolen can increase. The project is aimed not only at users but also at game developers, so a truly interoperable gaming universe is created right from the early stages of development. </p>
<p>The immutable passport project is aiming to create an SSO to onboard the next billion people into Web3. With the Immutable Passport, gamers can maintain control of their assets while signing up with their email and without a password. </p>
<p>Immutable is making it easier than ever for players to engage with web3 gaming without making compromises on security or ownership. It seeks to drastically lower the barrier to entry for new users and become the industry standard for games developers who want their games to be available as easily as possible to new users, with a friction-free onboarding experience. </p>
<p>In partnership with Polygon, Immutable Passport has created a zkEVM for developers to work with in terms of building secure games. </p>
<p>This project is creating a comprehensive ecosystem for Web3 gaming. IMX is the utility token for the Immutable marketplace.</p>

<h3>16. Regen Network &#8211; A Layer 1 Blockchain &amp; Carbon Marketplace Designed to Measure The Ecological Cost of Economic Activities</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> ($REGEN) is a green initiative designed to quantify effects that are not accurately captured in typical commercial ventures. For instance, every purchased product has an obvious market price, but the environmental and social consequences of the manufacturing process might not be accurately measured or advertised. A product such as an iPhone can be produced with components from 40+ countries, making environmental accounting difficult to do. </p>
<p>The three Regen Network founders observed that despite many shareholders and executives expressing a desire to become carbon neutral or eco friendly, no reliable digital infrastructure was in place to help them to do this. So they created a Proof of Stake blockchain built on a Tendermint architecture to account for this, in 2017. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/323994/screen-shot-2023-08-15-at.jpg" alt="regen network homepage" /></figure>
<p>Through the Regen Marketplace, corporations can buy, trade, and retire digital carbon and ecological credits to meet their climate commitments. These nature-based solutions remove carbon, restore biodiversity, and can reverse climate change.</p>
<p>The technology the Regen Network team have built is essentially a tailor-made blockchain to mint ecological assets. Once digitized and on the blockchain, buyers of ecological assets will be able to choose the ones that fit their needs. The Regen Registry also outlines a series of standards for what qualifies as a nature based solution (NBS) and as a biodiversity credit. </p>
<p>Given increasing concerns with regard to climate change, ecological assets could become a multi trillion dollar industry moving forward. Even a small percentage of this is an enormous amount of capital. </p>
<p>The Regen Network with its Regen Registry is in an excellent position as one of very few public, open, blockchain based architectures for accurate environmental assessment of economic activities. </p>
<p>It offers a more accurate model for climate change assessment and a means for corporate executives to reliably reduce their carbon footprint, based on real world data.</p>

<h2>How to Find the Newest Cryptocurrencies </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We’ve discussed some commonly adopted strategies below to give investors an idea of the most effective methods to find new cryptocurrency projects:</p>
<h3>Research Presale Cryptos</h3>
<p>Trying to figure out <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-much-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency.htm">how much to invest in cryptocurrencies</a>? Presales tend to have substantially lower entrance prices which means that you don&#8217;t have to spend a huge sum. </p>
<p>That is when compared with what it will cost to purchase the token once it is open to the public on a major exchange.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="257" height="300" class="aligncenter wp-image-122390 size-medium" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698604232-screenshot_64-257x300.jpg" alt="bitcoin minetrix presale 2.6m raised" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698604232-screenshot_64-257x300.jpg 257w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698604232-screenshot_64.jpg 671w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" /></p>
<p>This is especially the case once the crypto project has increased in popularity. As such, one of the most effective ways to find hot new crypto coins to invest in is by researching up-and-coming launches.  </p>
<p>In finding new cryptocurrencies on presale, this offers investors the chance to gain exposure to a project while it is still in its infancy. </p>
<h3>Perform Keyword Searches on Social Media</h3>
<p>In a time when social media is the key to discovering new trends, it&#8217;s as good a place as any to search for new cryptocurrency releases for 2023.</p>
<p>Platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and such allow users to search for keywords, for instance, ‘#bestnewcrypto or #cryptopresales.</p>
<p>Investors could also type in a specific category such as #NFTgames. It’s also possible to set up notifications for these keywords.</p>
<h3>Monitor New Tokens on Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h3>
<p>Users can spot the newest cryptocurrencies is via a reputable platform &#8211; as it will likely vet projects to make sure they are legitimate prior to listing.</p>
<p>One can seek out new cryptos by checking large exchanges or online brokers. Many will list a wide range of long-existing tokens. </p>
<p>However, these platforms also frequently add new crypto listings. Simply use the filter on the platform in question to search for specific types of tokens. </p>
<h3>Follow Developing Trends</h3>
<p>To take advantage of the crypto markets, investors need to follow the wider market to ensure they are up on developing trends in the space.</p>
<p>For example, artificial intelligence has dominated the news cycle since the end of 2022 amid the emergence of some key AI tools &#8211; and AI-related cryptos have followed, making huge gains. </p>
<p>Read our review of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best AI crypto trading bots</a> to see some of the most exciting trading tools that can be utilized.</p>
<p>Previously, Web3 gaming and NFT-related coins enjoyed a huge surge in early 2022 and discovering and acting on the next big trend can be an extremely lucrative method.</p>
<h2>How We Choose New Cryptocurrencies</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As newer tokens don’t show investors much in terms of historical performance, there are other things to consider prior to risking any money.</p>
<p>When researching new crypto coins, we look at a range of metrics.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the project have planned for the future?</li>
<li>Is this clearly documented for investors to see?</li>
<li>What can the tokens be used for, if anything?</li>
<li>Is the project likely to be listed by a big exchange?</li>
</ul>
<p>See some of these considerations below in more detail:</p>
<h3>Crypto Use Cases</h3>
<p>Ethereum is built for future growth and scalability. Its blockchain is the foundation for several decentralized finance apps, and many more are still being created. For instance, one of the new cryptocurrency tokens on this network is Love Hate Inu.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, was created only as a means of payment. That said, Bitcoin has evolved into a store of value for some investors who like to speculate.</p>
<p>Generally, in this space, the more use cases that tokens have, the higher the likelihood that new crypto projects will survive long enough to see growth increases.</p>
<h3>An Interesting Roadmap</h3>
<p>The best new crypto to buy will have an exciting roadmap and be clear and transparent about this to potential investors. This shows us that the team behind it is enthusiastic about the project, and that makes it more investable to the masses. </p>
<p>It also means that the cryptocurrency is more likely to amass a strong community of supporters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="300" height="138" class="aligncenter wp-image-121954 size-medium" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-300x138.png" alt="Sensei Inu Roadmap" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-1024x470.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-768x352.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap-1536x705.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698412525-sensei-inu-roadmap.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3>Liquidity Potential</h3>
<p>New crypto coins should have the potential for significant trading volume so that investors can sell them as and when necessary.</p>
<p>A new cryptocurrency coin may not be worth buying just yet if other investors aren&#8217;t trading it in significant quantities.</p>
<p>Examples of the new cryptos to watch for potentially high liquidity include Love Hate Inu and DeeLance. As we said in our earlier reviews, both have had huge interest and investment from the early presale rounds.</p>
<p>Also, look for tokens that are preparing to be listed on a large cryptocurrency exchange, as this attracts a much larger number of investors and encourages growth.</p>
<h3>Are New Cryptocurrencies a Good Investment?</h3>
<p>When researching new crypto coins to buy, it&#8217;s always important to be mindful that there is a large amount of risk involved.</p>
<p>Websites such as <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/new/">CoinMarketCap</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/new-cryptocurrencies">CoinGecko</a>, CoinList, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency">Reddit/CryptoCurrency</a> and Twitter can help you find new crypto projects, but it is vital you always undertake further research.</p>
<p>Red flags to look out for include a poorly written website, incomplete roadmap or white paper and a team that has not been doxxed. Furthermore, big social media followings can point to wide interest in a project &#8211; but be wary the followers are legitimate and not just bots.</p>
<p>That said, there are some stand-out reasons that finding the newest crypto coins could be beneficial for investors.</p>
<p>See below:</p>
<h3>Potential to Make Gains as it Becomes More Popular</h3>
<p>As we touched on earlier, new crypto listings often start on presale. This presents an opportunity to join the community of investors early and hopefully make decent gains later on.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAMA sold out its presale in just eight weeks, with investors who bought TAMA in the first phase of its beta sale paying 1 USDT for 100 TAMA ($0.01 each)</li>
<li>However, by the time the presale ended later investors were getting 33.33 TAMA tokens for 1USDT ($0.03 each)</li>
<li>When the coin is listed the price started at $0.03 (1 USDT = 33.33) but the &#8216;listing effect&#8217; and strong use case meant the price surged and continue to see gains as the project grows</li>
<li>TAMA reached an all-time high of $0.194 in the days after listing &#8211; a near-2,000% increase from the original presale price</li>
<li>The price remains above $0.03 and is expected to pump again in the coming weeks and months with new listings and the ecosystem developing</li>
</ul>
<p>When digital currencies that are coming out of presale make their exchange debut, early investors could potentially realize an immediate upside.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/255387/tama-1-month-060223.jpg" alt="tamadoge chart february 2023" /></figure>
<p>Following the conclusion of its presale phase, Battle Infinity was another project created big gains for its investors when it was listed on PancakeSwap. </p>
<p>There is still time for investors to buy Dash 2 Trade on presale at a discounted price prior to its CEX listings.</p>
<h3>In-Game Purchases</h3>
<p>Some of the newest cryptos are also used as a currency within a platform’s ecosystem. For instance, some projects have developed, or are developing, a range of P2E games.</p>
<p>This will be the case with Tamadoge, which has already released five Tamadoge Arcade Games where players can earn TAMA as a reward, while it has an augmented reality app in development. </p>
<h3>Some of the Newest Cryptos Offer Giveaways</h3>
<p>One of the characteristics seen more frequently with the hottest new crypto to invest in is that they offer prize giveaways to raise awareness of the project.</p>
<p>This is usually in the form of the cryptocurrency in question or NFTs. </p>
<p>In either situation, the investor could stand to earn free tokens, which can be used for purchases on the platform or to swap for other digital assets.</p>
<h2>Where to Buy New Coins</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Presales usually have native websites with investors buying directly from the project before they are later listed on big exchanges.</p>
<p>The top platforms in this space offer new cryptos as well as well-established options. It’s also important to check factors like trading fees, asset diversity, and regulation.</p>
<h3>How to Buy $BTCMTX Tokens &#8211; Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
<p>In this section, we detail how to buy Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) tokens during the presale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a Non-Custodial Crypto Wallet &#8211; </strong>First, create a crypto wallet with a reputable provider like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. </li>
<li><strong>Buy Ethereum, USDT or BNB &#8211; </strong>Then, stock up on ETH, BNB or USDT to buy $BTCMTX tokens. At this stage, it&#8217;s important to keep gas fees in mind. Most well-known brokers will offer the asset, as do the crypto wallets themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Connect Wallet and Purchase $BTCMTX Tokens &#8211; </strong>Next, head to the Bitcoin Minetrix presale website, connect the crypto wallet, then choose the relevant &#8216;Buy With&#8217; option, decide how many tokens to buy and confirm the purchase. You can click the ‘Buy and Stake’ option to automatically stake your holdings after making the purchase. </li>
<li><strong>Claim Tokens After Presale &#8211; </strong>Once the presale has concluded, the purchased tokens will be claimable on the Bitcoin Minetrix website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>eToro &#8211; Regulated Online Broker With New Cryptocurrencies at 1% Commission</h3>
<p>eToro was established in 2007 and offers a range of cryptocurrencies. This includes many of the best new crypto coins we’ve reviewed today. At the time of writing, some of the crypto listings on eToro are SHIB, APE, CTSI, BAL, IMX, GALA, and AVAX.</p>
<p>Investors will also have access to a selection of established crypto assets such as BTC, ETH, BNB, and LTC, to name a few. Notably, the commission fee is 1% for each crypto transaction at eToro.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/218057/tama-19.jpg" alt="etoro explore crypto and daily movers" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, the platform lists other assets like stocks and ETFs. Investors may not know that eToro is also a Copy Trading platform. As such, investors can use this passive trading method to allocate $200 or more to copy a seasoned trader with experience in crypto assets.</p>
<p>Each order placed will automatically be mirrored in the investor&#8217;s portfolio after allocating funds to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-social-trading-platforms-for-cryptocurrency-fans.htm">Social Trading</a> and Copy Trading. Alternatively, an investment of $500 or more in a Smart Portfolio like ‘Scalable Crypto’ offers the investor exposure to a number of digital currencies with a single purchase.</p>
<p>Investors can make a deposit with a credit/debit card, e-wallet, ACH, or wire transfer. There is no deposit fee for US-based investors. eToro also offers a free cell phone app and a paper trading account with $100k in practice funds.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors are continuously searching high and low for the next big crypto project. As such, today&#8217;s guide has reviewed and ranked the best new crypto coins to invest in. It’s a wise idea to create a diverse portfolio to spread risk and to research individual assets thoroughly. </p>
<p>One of the top new cryptos right now is Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX). This is a stake-to-mine cryptocurrency that lets token holders stake the native token to generate cloud mining credits. Users can burn the credits and use them for Bitcoin cloud mining power. </p>
