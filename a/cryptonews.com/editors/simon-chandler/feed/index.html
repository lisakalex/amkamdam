<p>Sect Bot (SECT) has gained by more than 50x in 24 hours after listing on Uniswap yesterday, with the token currently standing at a price of $0.1870 according to DEXTools.</p>
<p>Trading against Ethereum (ETH), SECT is the native token of the Sect Bot app, a tracking bot that investors can add to Telegram channels and groups in order to gamify trading.</p>
<p>Given that it has some actual utility, SECT may therefore distinguish itself from most other Uniswap listings and have some longevity as an asset.</p>
<p>Yet it isn&#8217;t the only new token in the market that has the potential to rally big in the coming weeks, with Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) raising $3 million in its presale and creating the kind of momentum that could lead to some big exchange listings.</p>
<h2>SECT Bot Is Up 50x in 24 Hours</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Listing on Uniswap on December 6, SECT reached a &#8216;record&#8217; high of roughly $0.2621 on Thursday evening.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140476" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140476" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140476" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702040164-sect-bot-price-chart.png" alt="Sect Bot price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702040164-sect-bot-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702040164-sect-bot-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702040164-sect-bot-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702040164-sect-bot-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702040164-sect-bot-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702040164-sect-bot-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702040164-sect-bot-price-chart-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140476" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>And while it has declined to $0.1881 since then, it has still risen 50x in 24 hours, with the coin seesawing between recovery and further losses.</p>
<p>While far too many listings on Uniswap this year have been obvious pumps-and-dumps, it seems that SECT has real staying power.</p>
<p>This is largely because it&#8217;s attached to a native platform that has been attracting modest levels of adoption, with the Sect Bot Twitter account revealing that it&#8217;s being used by just over 500 Telegram groups, accounting for around 350,000 users.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The adoption is exploding. Already over 500 groups and 350,000 members have access to our bot.</p>
<p>You can expect this number to increase drastically.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is quite impressive for such a new token, and while the coin&#8217;s low liquidity exposes it to sudden dips and dives, it&#8217;s possible that Sect Bot&#8217;s organic growth will help drive the coin&#8217;s price over the long term.</p>
<p>The bot works simply by tracking the calls and predictions of Telegram users, who highlight certain coins and predict that they may rally.</p>
<p>It therefore provides a good way of keeping tabs on who are the most productive and useful traders on Telegram, with its use likely to spread to other channels, particularly if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matrixport-says-bitcoin-bull-market-already-started-targets-125000-by-december-2024.htm">the expected 2024 bull market</a> materializes.</p>
<h2>This Underestimated Coin Could Be Next to Explode – Here&#8217;s Why</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Yet there are other tokens that also look primed to rally big in the coming weeks, with a number of new alts holding presales that have enabled them to pick up plenty of momentum as they gear up to list on exchanges.</p>
<p>This includes <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has now attracted $3 million in its increasingly popular sale.</span></p>

<p>&mdash; BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token/status/1733059533570773443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What&#8217;s especially interesting about Bitcoin ETF Token, particularly for investors, is that the coin plans to burn 25% of its overall supply over time.</p>
<p>It will hold a series of burn events in which it will destroy 5% of its supply at once, with each of these events linked to developments related to Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">Such developments include an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF reaching a $100 million trading volume, as well as Bitcoin itself attaining a price of $100,000.</span></p>
<p>By aggressively reducing its supply, Bitcoin ETF Token hopes to push its price up.</p>
<p><iframe title="BTC ETF Token Presale Raises $2,500,000 - New 10x Potential Crypto?!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxSvvYbmjHA?start=12&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Also helping attract investors to the token is the fact that they can stake it, thereby earning themselves a passive income, in addition to any price increases the coin experiences.</p>
<p>Given these features, it&#8217;s no wonder the coin&#8217;s presale is doing so well, with buyers able to join in by visiting <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a>.</p>
<p>With a supply of 2.1 billion tokens, users can currently buy BTCETF at a price of $0.0064 per token, with the sale receiving 40% of its overall supply.</p>

<p>Blue-chip cryptocurrencies are having another strong day today, with the top crypto gainers seeing increases of up to 16% in 24 hours and 30% in a week.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s bullish performance comes as the market continues to gain momentum en route to what many are expecting will be a full-on bull market in 2024.</p>
<p>Major causes of this potential bull market are likely to come from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-talks-have-advanced-to-key-details-report.htm">the SEC formally approving Bitcoin ETFs</a>, as well as from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-expected-to-take-dovish-stance-in-2024-with-over-100-basis-points-of-cuts.htm">the Fed cutting rates</a> and the next Bitcoin halving in April.</p>
<p>Bitcoin itself is having a relatively quiet day as far as 24-hour movements are concerned, but with the coin now up to $43,500, it has risen by 12.5% in a week and by 159% in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>And while the industry still faces several regulatory challenges, the completion of Ripple&#8217;s case with the SEC next year is also likely to provide further clarity and optimism, boosting prices further.</p>
<p>It has also been a good day for meme tokens and junk coins trading (mostly) on DEXes, with the following article providing a rundown of the top crypto gainers today on <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/pairs">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<h2>PEPEFace (PPFace)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
New &#8216;deflationary&#8217; meme token PEPEFace (PPFace) has had an interesting few days, having gained by approximately 18,000% on Sunday and then collapsed by 99% on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, as its chart below shows, it has now seemingly come back from the dead, rising by 762% in the past 24 hours and reaching a current value of $0.002216.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140441" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140441" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140441" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036502-top-crypto-gainers-ppface-price-chart.png" alt="Top crypto gainers -- PPFace price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036502-top-crypto-gainers-ppface-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036502-top-crypto-gainers-ppface-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036502-top-crypto-gainers-ppface-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036502-top-crypto-gainers-ppface-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036502-top-crypto-gainers-ppface-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036502-top-crypto-gainers-ppface-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036502-top-crypto-gainers-ppface-price-chart-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140441" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>DEXTools puts its market cap at around $2.2 million, with a total supply of 1 billion tokens and a holder count of only 288 addresses.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s currently trading on Uniswap against Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), and while it has a low project reliability score, its resurgence today may tempt a few traders.</p>
<h2>Gemini (GEMINI)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Also trading on Uniswap against WETH, GEMINI has gained by 19,000% in the past 24 hours, according to DEXTools.</p>
<p>So far, it still appears to be rising, with modestly increasing volume and no signs (as of yet) of any rug pull.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140452" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140452" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140452" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036834-top-crypto-gainers-gemini-price-chart.png" alt="Gemini price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036834-top-crypto-gainers-gemini-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036834-top-crypto-gainers-gemini-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036834-top-crypto-gainers-gemini-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036834-top-crypto-gainers-gemini-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036834-top-crypto-gainers-gemini-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036834-top-crypto-gainers-gemini-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702036834-top-crypto-gainers-gemini-price-chart-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140452" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>As some traders may be aware, this new GEMINI meme token has shamelessly appropriated the name of Gemini, a suite of AI- and machine learning-based tools recently announced by Google.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t the first junk coin to do this, with Gemini AI (GEMINI) pumping and dumping earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Traders should therefore proceed with caution.</p>
<h2>Sect Bot (SECT)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Unlike GEMINI and PPFace, Sect Bot (SECT) is a bonafide cryptocurrency project, with the coin being the native token of a recently launched Telegram bot that incentivizes competition among traders.</p>
<p>It listed on Uniswap on December 6, and is currently trading against Ethereum (ETH), with the token being up by 3,700% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Also in contrast to the two coins above, Sect Bot has a more tangible and significant online presence, with its Twitter account having around 2,700 followers and with the project claiming 500 Telegram groups are now using its bot.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>As such, it may be one to watch for the future.</p>
<h2>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While the above are the top crypto gainers today on DEXTools, they potentially carry risks, so many traders may prefer to look elsewhere for market-beating gains.</p>
<p>There are numerous other new alts that come with more solid fundamentals and use cases, with some of these currently holding their presales and looking to list very soon.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</h3>
<p>One of the strongest of these is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has now raised more than $3 million in its ongoing sale.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Insights from <a href="https://twitter.com/Fidelity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fidelity</a> Jurrien Timmer shed light on a potential <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinETF</a> approval.</p>
<p>Will it trigger a &#39;sell-the-news&#39; reaction or attract a new wave of stakeholders? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4c8.png" alt="📈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>A… <a href="https://t.co/ZrUzEwYW2J">pic.twitter.com/ZrUzEwYW2J</a></p>
<p>&mdash; BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token/status/1733059533570773443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What&#8217;s attracted investors to BTCETF is that the token plans to burn 25% of its total supply over time.</p>
<p>It will execute burns of 5% of its supply whenever Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin itself reaches particular milestones, with the first coming when an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF reaches a trading volume of $100,000.</p>
<p>Its aggressive deflationary tokenomics could potentially boost its price over time, with investors able to join its presale by going to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">its official website</a>.</p>
<h3>Meme Kombat (MK)</h3>
<p>One other highly promising presale coin <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a>, an<span style="font-size: 16px"> ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised $2.6 million to date.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">HUGE buy to push the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MK</a> presale past $2.5 million!!!</p>
<p>Get ready for your NFTs<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f929.png" alt="🤩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/a9BnCNNjsL">pic.twitter.com/a9BnCNNjsL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) <a href="https://twitter.com/Meme_Kombat/status/1732339504512434565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While Meme Kombat is ostensibly another meme token, it is also a decentralized gambling platform, albeit with a difference.</p>
<p>In contrast to online casinos, it will enable its users to place bets on AI-generated battles between memes.</p>
<p>It will randomize these battles and process their events on the Ethereum blockchain, making results transparent and fair.</p>
<p>It will also visualize battles in real-time, providing users with an entertaining focus for their bets against each other (or against the platform).</p>
<p>As with Bitcoin ETF Token, it&#8217;s set to launch in the New Year, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">the coin available now via its website</a>.</p>
<p>Given the fundamentals of both tokens and the novel use cases, both have a very strong chance of rallying big once they list on exchanges, and becoming top crypto gainers in their own right.</p>

<p>Despite this fallback, LUNC remains up by an impressive 74% in the past week and by 200% in the last 30 days, amid rising optimism surrounding Terra Luna Classic and its potential recovery.</p>
<p>Yet LUNC seems to be correcting now after a couple of weeks of strong euphoria, with the altcoin potentially set to fall a bit further before it returns to growth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are other promising alts in the market right now, with stake-to-mine platform Bitcoin Minetrix raising over $5 million in its ongoing presale and accumulating plenty of momentum before it lists.</p>
<h2>Is Terra Luna Classic Going to Zero? LUNC Price Drops 3.5%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The key detail in LUNC&#8217;s chart is that it appears to be going through a correction after a very bullish end to November and start of December, as signalled by its indicators.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) has just dipped below 70 after it rose above 90 earlier in the month, a sign that most traders may be taking profits from the coin at the moment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140397" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140397" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702032120-lunc-price-chart.png" alt="LUNC price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702032120-lunc-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702032120-lunc-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702032120-lunc-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702032120-lunc-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702032120-lunc-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702032120-lunc-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702032120-lunc-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140397" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, LUNC&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) remains comfortably above its 200-day (blue), which it overtook only a couple of weeks ago, meaning that the coin could have several more weeks of growth to look forwards to.</p>
<p>This is a possibility, yet LUNC is something of a special case, in that the spectacular collapse of the Terra Luna ecosystem in May 2022 may still be having negative effects on trader perceptions of the token.</p>
<p>In this respect, it may be somewhat discouraging to note that its trading volume has dropped from around $1.4 billion a week ago to only $250 million today.</p>
<p>This fall suggests that the coin may have to fall further before it begins growing again.</p>
<p>As for the longer term picture, things certainly seem more optimistic than they were a month or so ago, given the recent progress the Terra Luna Classic community has made.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With the successful adoption of LUNC proposal #11868  the minting capability of USTC tokens has been eliminated. Consequently, stable-to-stable swaps have been disabled. It is important to note that swaps between <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LUNC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LUNC</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#USTC</a> through terraswap can still be executed as before. <a href="https://t.co/AubsFDbc0v">pic.twitter.com/AubsFDbc0v</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For instance, it accepted a proposal to halt the minting of USTC a few weeks ago, a move which has boosted the stablecoin&#8217;s price massively.</p>
<p>The passage of such proposals has increased the sense that the LUNC community is improving its ability to reach agreements on important matters, a positive sign for its future.</p>
<p>So while the LUNC price may fall a little further in the coming weeks, its longer term trajectory looks good.</p>
<h2>New Mining Protocol Secures $5 Million</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">Assuming that 2024 sees <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-talks-have-advanced-to-key-details-report.htm">the SEC approving Bitcoin ETFs</a> and triggering a bull market, LUNC will rally big again sooner or later.</span></p>
<p>Yet for now it could struggle, meaning that traders looking for above-average returns may have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>One good area in this respect remains presales, which can be promising in that the biggest presale tokens gain strong momentum before listing on exchanges.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">One coin doing this just now is </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, a stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $5 million to date.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Due to launch in early 2024, Bitcoin Minetrix will enable users to stake its native BTCMTX token in order to mine actual Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>By staking BTCMTX, users receive tokenized mining credits, which they can then spend to purchase hashing power on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>Doing this ultimately earns them newly mined BTC, with Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s launch coming at just the right time, given that Bitcoin will undergo its next halving event in April.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Given that the project has raised $5 million, it seems that there&#8217;s plenty of demand for the simplified mining solution it&#8217;s offering.</p>
<p>On top of this, the fact that users can also earn BTCMTX by staking makes it a potentially highly profitable platform.</p>
<p>To join its presale, investors can go to<span style="font-size: 16px"> </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">the Bitcoin Minetrix official website</a>, where they <span style="font-size: medium">can buy BTCMTX at a price of $0.0121 per token.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD">Solana price</a> has jumped by 14% in the past 24 hours, with its surge to $71.24 coming on a day when the crypto market as a whole has gained by 1%.</p>
<p>This makes SOL one of the best-performing top-100 coins of the day, with the alt also having risen by 17% in a week and by 63% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Solana has made such gains on the basis of consistent growth in usage, with several of its DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces witnessing an uptick in adoption in recent weeks.</p>
<p>And with the wider market heading for a bull phase for next year, SOL could easily make further gains in the next few weeks and months.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Prediction as SOL Surges 14% to $71 – What&#8217;s Driving This Impressive Rally?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After a week or so of see-sawing, it looks like SOL has resumed rising more decisively, with its indicators pointing to increasing buying pressure.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) has just passed 70 once again, a clear sign of rising momentum, as well as a level that allows for further gains before the coin enters overbought territory.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140369" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140369" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702029089-solana-price-chart.png" alt="Solana price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702029089-solana-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702029089-solana-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702029089-solana-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702029089-solana-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702029089-solana-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702029089-solana-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702029089-solana-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140369" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just as encouragingly, SOL&#8217;s 30-day average (SOL) continues to rise substantially beyond its 200-day (blue), which again is another sign that the alt is in the middle of an expansionary phase.</p>
<p>Other signs of this include the coin&#8217;s consistently rising support level (green), as well as still-high trading volumes.</p>
<p>Indeed, SOL&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume currently sits at $4.1 billion, up from $1.2 billion 14 days ago and from $120 million 90 days ago.</p>
<p>This reveals a massive surge of interest in Solana, which has succeeded in attracting investors all over again for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the market had severely oversold and undervalued SOL in recent months, with the coin&#8217;s price well below what many observers would regard as a &#8216;fair&#8217; value for the asset.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Solana has seen lots of organic growth over the current period, with <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">its total value locked in rising</a> and with many of its apps seeing user growth.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">These inflows into the solana eco probably increase by an order of magnitude over the next few months</p>
<p>degens and VCs alike foaming at the mouth after seeing  the JTO airdrop returns</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For instance, Solana-based NFT marketplaces have recorded spikes in trading volumes, with <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/magic-eden">Magic Eden now fourth out of all such marketplaces on all chains</a>.</p>
<p>Given such improvements, demand for SOL is only like to continue increasing, which in turn means a rising Solana price.</p>
<p>It could reach $100 by the start of 2024, with a bull market potentially pushing it to $200 by the middle of the year.</p>
<h2>Newer High-Potential Altcoins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SOL may be one of the market&#8217;s hottest major tokens right now, but it isn&#8217;t the only alt potentially on the cusp of big rallies.</p>
<p>There are also several newer alts in the market right now that have positioned themselves for significant gains, with some of these holding presales at the moment that have helped them gather plenty of momentum.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has now raised just over $3 million in its token offering.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This figure suggests that investors are becoming increasingly confident in Bitcoin ETF Token, which will launch with bullishly deflationary tokenomics.</p>
<p>In particular, it will burn 5% of its overall supply on five separate occasions, with each occasion linked to Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin itself reaching a certain milestone.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">The first 5% will come when an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF reaches a trading volume of $100 million, while the final 5% will come once Bitcoin itself reaches a price of $100,000.</span></p>
<p>By burning 25% of its overall supply over time, Bitcoin ETF Token will increase relative demand for its token, thereby boosting its price.</p>
<p>This setup has clearly won over numerous traders, as has the fact that holders can also stake the token for a passive income.</p>
<p>New investors can join its sale at <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a>.</p>

<p>BTCETF is currently selling at $0.0064 per token, yet this price will rise to $0.0066 in a couple of days.</p>
<p>And once the token lists, it could easily rise much higher, especially when it begins burning its supply.</p>

<p>The price of Grail Inu (iGRAIL) has rocketed by more than 450% in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.000000212 after the new meme crypto listed on the Abritrum-based Camelot DEX a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>iGRAIL is only the latest in a long line of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">new meme tokens</a> to hit the crypto market this year, and while it has so far maintained its price level over the past few hours, its low liquidity could mean that a big drop isn&#8217;t too far away.</p>
<p>However, traders not willing to take on the risk iGRAIL presents could turn to other new tokens, with several promising coins currently holding their presales.</p>
<p>And one of the most promising of these is Bitcoin ETF Token, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised close to $3 million in its sale and that has linked its deflationary tokenomics to Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<h2>iGRAIL Skyrockets 465%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Apparently a Curve Inu fork, iGRAIL opened <a href="https://twitter.com/GrailInu">its Twitter account</a> in September of this year and first listed on Camelot on December 5.</p>
<p>Its opening day was very quiet, yet it began rising fairly aggressively from yesterday, before hitting its current record high earlier this morning.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140162" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140162" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701956239-igrail-crypto-price-chart.png" alt="iGRAIL crypto price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701956239-igrail-crypto-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701956239-igrail-crypto-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701956239-igrail-crypto-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701956239-igrail-crypto-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701956239-igrail-crypto-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701956239-igrail-crypto-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701956239-igrail-crypto-price-chart-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140162" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>While iGRAIL is semi-distinct from other micro-meme tokens in that it has an online presence (including a Telegram account), it still looks risky as a token.</p>
<p>For one, <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/arbitrum/pair-explorer/0xa3c9d20cb101c7776fc7d0edf137c2dde267aa1f">its entry on DEXTools</a> has awarded its a project reliability score of 23 out of 99, with this low ranking based on its opaque holder count and on a modifiable tax rate.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As such, most traders may be too wary of iGRAILs to take the plunge, yet there are other new tokens that not only promise above-average gains, but also come with stronger fundamentals and a more reassuring footprint and roadmap.</p>
<h2>This Modest Crypto Has Gathered $2.9 Million – Next Big Thing?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One of the best examples of this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has now raised in excess of $2.9 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>That is has raised close to $3 million is significant, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, it stands as a big vote of confidence in the project, with investors becoming increasingly confident that the project will be successful.</p>
<p>Secondly, the momentum it has generated over the course of its presale is likely to translate into momentum once the token lists, meaning that it could rally big.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">And the reason why it has attracted so much interest is that it&#8217;s set to do something pretty much no other coin in the market will be doing.</span></p>
<p>Namely, it will be burning 25% of its total max supply, destroying this percentage in 5% instalments.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">It will burn the initial 5% when an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF reaches a volume of $100 million, while the final 5% will come once Bitcoin itself reaches a price of $100,000.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LUNCUSD">Terra Luna Classic price</a> has slipped by 3% today, falling to $0.00020831 as the wider market declines by 0.5% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Such a fall has done little to dent LUNC&#8217;s recent progress, however, with the altcoin having risen by 80% in a week and by 213% in the last month.</p>
<p>This means that its price has more than doubled in the last 30 days, and with the recent cessation of USTC minting raising the bullishness of investors, it&#8217;s likely to continue rising strongly in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h2>Terra Luna Classic Price Prediction as LUNC Doubles in 30 Days – Can it 2x Again?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
LUNC continues to fall after rising aggressively over the past couple of weeks, with some of its indicators suggesting that it may continue to fall for a little longer yet before correcting upwards.</p>
<p>For instance, its RSI has now dropped from 90 to 70 in a matter of days, and its direction currently suggests that it could fall further, bring the Terra Luna Classic price with it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140150" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140150" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140150" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701953726-terra-luna-classic-price-chart.png" alt="Terra Luna Classic price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701953726-terra-luna-classic-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701953726-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701953726-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701953726-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701953726-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701953726-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701953726-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140150" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, LUNC&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) is still rising decisively beyond its 200-day average (blue), a sign that the altcoin remains in a bullish phase.</p>
<p>Its trading volume also reinforces the view that it remains in a period of expansion, with volumes reaching $600 million today, in contrast to less than $20 million a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say when exactly LUNC will return to its recent growth, but with volumes sticking to such higher levels, the wait for more growth isn&#8217;t likely to be long.</p>
<p>Indeed, LUNC has been the best-performing top-100 coin of the past 30 days, with this fact alone likely to continue attracting new buyers.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, it has seen significant progress from the Terra Luna Classic community in recent weeks, with several important proposals and updates gaining assent.</p>
<p>This includes a plan – now implemented – to stop minting USTC, the stablecoin linked to LUNC.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It also includes several important technical upgrades, such as <a href="https://station.terraclassic.community/proposal/columbus-5/11885">one fixing a sequence mismatch issue</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">Because of </span>such<span style="font-size: medium"> developments, the market seems more confident in LUNC&#8217;s overall trajectory, with the Terra Luna Classic price likely to continue rising in the near future.</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">acceptance of Bitcoin ETF applications</a> will help accelerate its progress, with the coin potentially on course to hit $0.0030 in the next few weeks.</p>
<h2>New Bitcoin ETF Project Launch Approaches</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
LUNC may need to fall a little further before rising again, however, so some traders may prefer to investigate newer tokens with more potential for short-term gains.</p>
<p>Identifying such coins can be difficult, yet one solid method for pinpointing possible winners is to look for successful presales, since big raises suggest that the corresponding coin has accumulated a considerable amount of momentum and market interest.</p>
<p>And one presale coin garnering plenty of interest right now is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised $2.8 million in its ongoing sale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What separates Bitcoin ETF Token from the crowd of new coins is that it has emerged with a strong roadmap for future gains.</p>
<p>Specifically, it has adopted an aggressively deflationary set of tokenomics, with the coin set to burn 25% of its total max supply over time.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, it will burn 5% batches whenever Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin itself reaches certain targets, with the first burn set for when an SEC-approved spot-based Bitcoin ETF gains a volume in excess of $100 million.</p>
<p>Such a squeeze of its supply is likely to boost its price over time, with holders also able to stake the token for a passive income.</p>
<p><iframe title="BTC ETF Token Presale Raises $2,500,000 - New 10x Potential Crypto?!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxSvvYbmjHA?start=3&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Such features potentially make BTCETF a lucrative coin, with new buyers able to join its sale by visiting <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a>.</p>
<p>They can buy BTCETF at a price of $0.0064 per token, with this presale price set to rise to $0.0066 in just under three days.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it could rise even higher once it lists.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD">Shiba Inu price</a> has dropped by 5.5% in the past 24 hours, slipping to $0.00000953 as the crypto market as a whole suffers a 1.5% dip.</p>
<p>Even with today&#8217;s losses, SHIB remains up by 16% in a week, with the famous meme token benefiting from market-wide optimism and bullishness this week.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s also likely to benefit from an increasing burn rate, with the growth of layer-two network Shibarium helping to burn 10 million SHIB in 24 hours.</p>
<p>This comes in addition to deliberate burns by the Shiba Inu developer team, who burned 8 billion SHIB earlier in the week.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Prediction as 8 Billion SHIB Burns in 24 Hours – Time to Buy?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Today&#8217;s slide hasn&#8217;t done much to dampen SHIB&#8217;s overall bullishness, with the coin&#8217;s indicators still in positions where they suggest incoming rises.</p>
<p>Most notable is the meme coin&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow), which after crossing its 200-day (blue) in late November continues to rise higher, consistent with an ongoing uptrend.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140128" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140128" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140128" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701951281-shiba-inu-price-chart.png" alt="Shiba Inu price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701951281-shiba-inu-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701951281-shiba-inu-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701951281-shiba-inu-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701951281-shiba-inu-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701951281-shiba-inu-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701951281-shiba-inu-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701951281-shiba-inu-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140128" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>SHIB&#8217;s relative strength index (purple) is also encouraging, in that it remains at just above 65, indicating a maintained level of buying pressure that could help the token recover again soon enough.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth highlighting SHIB&#8217;s support level (green), which has continued to rise over the past few weeks, implying that any dips in the coming days will be minor.</p>
<p>Lastly, the coin&#8217;s trading volume remains distinctly elevated in comparison with the levels witnessed in previous months, at around $400 million today.</p>
<p>This indicates ongoing interest from traders and, in particular, whales, who can help push the Shiba Inu price higher in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Other factors weighing in SHIB&#8217;s favor include its burn rate, which has risen significantly since Shibarium launched in August.</p>
<p>According to Shibburn, <a href="https://www.shibburn.com">Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn rate has increased by 800% in the past 24 hours</a>, with around 10 million SHIB destroyed in the past day.</p>
<p>This is largely because of rising Shibarium transactions, with <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io">the layer-two network now counting around 7.51 million transactions per day</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On top of this, developers processed a standalone burn of 8 billion SHIB earlier this week, a move which will help to reduce the coin&#8217;s supply even further.</p>
<p>So in combination with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-execs-argue-bull-run-could-lead-to-100000-btc-in-2024-more-news.htm">an expected bull market in 2024</a>, the Shiba Inu price could rise substantially, potentially reaching $0.000020 by the end of January.</p>

SHIB isn&#8217;t the only promising meme coin in the market right now, with several newer tokens also showing plenty of potential.</p>
<p>This includes <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a>, an<span style="font-size: 16px"> ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised more than $2.6 million in its popular presale.</span></p>

<p>Such a figure attests to the interest Meme Kombat has been attracting, with the cryptocurrency distinguishing itself from other meme coins by virtue of the fact that it&#8217;s also a platform that will enable users to bet on AI-generated meme battles.</p>
<p>It will use advanced AI algorithms to randomly generate such battles, with its graphics engine rendering these battles in real-time for users to watch.</p>
<p>Users will be able to place bets against each other or the platform itself, which will pay out winnings in the form of its native token MK.</p>
<p>Holders of MK will also be able to use the token for staking, making it potentially even more profitable.</p>

<p>New coin listing EAGLE has surged by over 2,000% after appearing on Uniswap yesterday, with the meme token reaching a record high of $0.0012 earlier today.</p>
<p>However, the coin has already begun dumping fast, sinking to $0.00005215 as of writing.</p>
<p>This would suggest that EAGLE could be yet another pump-and-dump, with the token showing no real signs of recovering after its big fall in the past hour.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some new tokens that actually have a genuine roadmap and real fundamentals, with Bitcoin ETF Token&#8217;s increasingly successful presale suggesting that it could have a big listing in the next few weeks.</p>
<h2>New Coin Listing EAGLE Explodes 2,000% on UniSwap</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If there&#8217;s a sure sign of a risky token, it&#8217;s a chart that exhibits the classic &#8216;Bart Simpson&#8217; rise-and-fall pattern.</p>
<p>As can be seen below, EAGLE&#8217;s price rose suddenly in the early hours of the morning, after a big spike in volume.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139780" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139780" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701863184-new-coin-listing-eagle-price-chart.png" alt="New coin listing EAGLE price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701863184-new-coin-listing-eagle-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701863184-new-coin-listing-eagle-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701863184-new-coin-listing-eagle-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701863184-new-coin-listing-eagle-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701863184-new-coin-listing-eagle-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701863184-new-coin-listing-eagle-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701863184-new-coin-listing-eagle-price-chart-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139780" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s therefore likely that a manipulator (or two) put in a big buy order, aiming to pump the coin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>This rise then seemed to attract a few more smaller buyers, who helped push EAGLE higher over the course of several years.</p>
<p>Yet as is evident from around 10:00am this morning, EAGLE has more or less collapsed.</p>
<p>Worse still, there&#8217;s little new volume coming in to restore the token to its former levels, implying that it may never recover.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also significant that <a href="https://t.co/1Ip12yOgaK">the link to the BNB/EAGLE trading pair on PancakeSwap</a> presents traders with a warning that &#8220;if you purchase a fraudulent token,&#8221; you expose yourself to &#8220;permanent loss of funds.&#8221;</p>
<h2>New Bitcoin ETF Project Launch Approaches</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For this reason, most traders will be much better off giving EAGLE a miss and looking elsewhere for market-beating gains.</p>
<p>Finding such gains can be difficult, yet there are a number of methods for picking out genuinely promising coins from the sea of junk tokens.</p>
<p>One of the most reliable methods is to find successful presales, with coins that raise bigger sums of money generally accumulating the kind of momentum and following that can result in big gains further down the line.</p>
<p>One coin that fits this description is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised $2.6 million in its presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In contrast to most other new cryptocurrencies this year, Bitcoin ETF Token has emerged with a strong design.</p>
<p>It plans to burn 25% of its total supply in instalments, with the coin destroying 5% batches whenever Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs reach particular milestones.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">It will burn its first 5% when an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF reaches a volume of $100 million, a landmark which will probably happen at some point in 2024, given <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">how close Bitcoin ETFs are to gaining approval</a>.</span></p>
<p>On top of this, holders will also be able to use BTCETF for staking, giving them a reason to hold it in addition to its deflationary tokenomics.</p>

<p>Investors can join its presale at <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a>, where they can buy BTCETF at a price of $0.0062 per token.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s only a matter of time before the token&#8217;s deflationary mechanism push this price much, much higher.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LUNCUSDT.P">LUNC price</a> has dropped by 12% in the past 24 hours, with this steep fall coming on a day when the wider market has actually gained by a healthy 4.5%.</p>
<p>LUNC&#8217;s dive comes after several days of strong rising, with its current price of $0.00020828 representing an enviable 73% gain in a week and a 215% rise in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a fear that such overzealous rallying puts LUNC in a position where it may correct downwards, leaving traders having to look elsewhere for profitable options in the shorter term.</p>
<p>Yet there&#8217;s currently no shortage of promising new coins, with stake-to-mine platform Bitcoin Minetrix looking set to rally on the back of a presale that has now raised almost $5 million.</p>
<h2>Is Terra Luna Classic Going to Zero? LUNC Price Falls 10%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
LUNC has had a massive surge over the past week or so, but it now seems that it may have begun a correction of sorts.</p>
<p>From just over 90 a few days ago, the coin&#8217;s relative strength index (purple) has dropped to 70, suggesting that further price declines could be on their way.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139743" style="width: 4310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139743" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701859932-lunc-price-chart.png" alt="LUNC price chart." width="4310" height="2236" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701859932-lunc-price-chart.png 4310w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701859932-lunc-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701859932-lunc-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701859932-lunc-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701859932-lunc-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701859932-lunc-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701859932-lunc-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 4310px) 100vw, 4310px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139743" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, LUNC&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) continues to rise strongly above its 200-day (blue), indicating that today&#8217;s decline may be fairly short-lived.</p>
<p>Possibly the most bullish sign of all is that LUNC&#8217;s trading volume remains close to $600 million, up from as low as $30 million barely two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Such an increase marks a significant shift in LUNC&#8217;s market, with the coin attracting a greater number of traders, including whales.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A big part of the reason why LUNC has rocketed in recent weeks is that the Terra Luna Classic community has implemented a proposal that halts the minting of new USTC, which is LUNC&#8217;s sister stablecoin.</p>
<p>This update has caused the price of USTC to surge, and with investors increasingly hoping that USTC may re-approach its former peg with the US dollar, there&#8217;s also an expectation that LUNC&#8217;s price will benefit as well.</p>
<p>The accepted proposal has also had a galvanizing effect on the LUNC community itself and on perceptions of it, in that previous months had witnessed far too much discord and disagreement.</p>
<p>But now, it seems that the community has started on a cooperative course towards restoring LUNC and USTC.</p>
<p>As such, the LUNC price should gain in the longer term, potentially reaching $0.00030 in the next few weeks.</p>

<span style="font-size: 16px">Given that LUNC may have entered overbought territory, many traders may prefer to look elsewhere at the moment and investigate other alts.</span></p>
<p>Fortunately, there are numerous promising altcoins currently in the market, with several new tokens holding presales that have seen them generate plenty of momentum and hype.</p>

<p>Set to launch in the next few weeks and running on Ethereum, Bitcoin Minetrix will enable its users to mine actual Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native BTCMTX token.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>Such staking provides users with tokenized mining credits, which they can then use to purchase Bitcoin hashing power.</p>
<p>In turn, hashing power earns users newly mined BTC, while staking will also provide them with additional BTCMTX.</p>
<p>Importantly, Bitcoin Minetrix will boast a streamlined and user-friendly dashboard and interface, taking all of the hassle and complexity out of Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>As such, it should open the doors for a democratization of mining, with its increasingly successful presale suggesting that investors believe in it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/PEPEUSD">PEPE price</a> has jumped by 13% in the past 24 hours, with its run to $0.00000156 also marking a very impressive 40% gain in a week.</p>
<p>PEPE&#8217;s move comes as the market enjoys a Bitcoin-led rally, with the meme coin also up by 36% in the last 30 days and by 2,750% since its all-time low of $0.000000055142, recorded in April.</p>
<p>Growing bullishness surrounding potential Bitcoin ETF approvals has driven today&#8217;s surge, yet with PEPE already up by 40% in a week, it may be due a correction in the near future.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of other, newer meme tokens that appear set for rallies in the coming days, with Meme Kombat – which has raised $2.5 million in its presale – one of the most promising.</p>
<h2>Is It Too Late to Buy PEPE? Pepe Price Spikes 40%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
PEPE is actually down by 2% in the past hour, implying that last night&#8217;s rally may have already begun losing momentum.</p>
<p>That said, its indicators continue to look relatively bullish, with its RSI (purple) still at 70, even if it has dipped in the past few hours from 75.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139710" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139710" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701857150-pepe-price-chart.png" alt="Pepe price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701857150-pepe-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701857150-pepe-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701857150-pepe-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701857150-pepe-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701857150-pepe-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701857150-pepe-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701857150-pepe-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139710" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, PEPE&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has just crossed over its 200-day (blue), forming a &#8216;golden cross&#8217; that often indicates a breakout rally.</p>
<p>As such, PEPE may be in for further gains once its current slip resolves itself, especially when its 24-hour trading volume remains high at just over $500 million.</p>
<p>Such a level suggests that whales continue to buy and accumulate the meme token, as attested by transfer data shared over the past month.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The thing is, <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1731584781551538528">whales have also been preparing to sell PEPE</a>, and with the token close to overbought territory, it may be due for a drop very soon.</p>
<p>Indeed, PEPE&#8217;s status as a meme coin with no real fundamentals means that it&#8217;s more exposed than many other tokens to sudden drops and dumps, so traders need to be very mindful of this when buying.</p>
<p>Having said this, the overall trajectory of the market seems to be up, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">the potential acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs</a> likely to send pretty much all cryptocurrencies flying at the start of the year.</p>
<p>This will likely include PEPE, so even if the meme coin may see a few dips over the coming months, the Pepe price will likely be higher by end of Q1 2024 than it is now.</p>
<h2>New Meme Coin Prepares to Launch</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Of course, the uncertainty and riskiness surrounding PEPE may put some traders off, yet there are some new meme tokens in the market that boast actual utility, making them relatively safer bets.</p>
<p>A very good example of this is provided by <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a>, an<span style="font-size: 16px"> ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised just over $2.5 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">HUGE buy to push the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MK</a> presale past $2.5 million!!!</p>
<p>Get ready for your NFTs<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f929.png" alt="🤩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/a9BnCNNjsL">pic.twitter.com/a9BnCNNjsL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) <a href="https://twitter.com/Meme_Kombat/status/1732339504512434565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>This is a highly impressive figure, and the reason why Meme Kombat has been able to raise it so quickly is that it offers something that really no other project in crypto currently offers.</p>
<p>Namely, it&#8217;s set to launch a platform that will enable its users to place bets on AI-generated battles between meme characters.</p>
<p>So in contrast to other betting platforms that offer more traditional games, Meme Kombat will provide a more entertaining and viral hook for bets, with its use of popular meme characters likely to prove popular at a time when meme tokens remain very big.</p>
<p>It will pay out winnings in the form of its native token MK, which holders will be able to stake for a passive income.</p>
<p><iframe title="Top 3 Crypto Presales That MIGHT 10X Your Money?!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_8qqJ_I9xe8?start=18&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This essentially means that Meme Kombat could provide investors with three sources of profits: 1) price rises that result from growing demand for MK; 2) staking income; and 3) winnings.</p>
<p>Such possibilities help account for why the project&#8217;s presale has already been so successful, with new buyers able to join the fray by going to the<span style="font-size: medium"> </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat official website</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, where 1 MK token now costs $0.0225.</span></p>

<p>Yet this loss comes at a time when transactions on Shibarium have reached a record high, topping 32 million only a couple of months after the layer-two network launched.</p>
<p>Shibarium has helped feed demand for SHIB, which is now up by 10% in a week and by 8% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>And with the layer-two network likely to continue driving demand for the meme token, and with the wider market set to have an end-of-year really, it will continue to rally in the coming weeks.</p>

SHIB&#8217;s chart is currently painting a mixed picture, with its two main indicators pointing in opposing directions.</p>
<p>For one, its RSI (purple) has just dropped to 60 and looks like it could fall further, meaning that SHIB may suffer further losses before correcting itself.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139359" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139359" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701774694-shiba-inu-price-chart.png" alt="Shiba Inu price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701774694-shiba-inu-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701774694-shiba-inu-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701774694-shiba-inu-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701774694-shiba-inu-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701774694-shiba-inu-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701774694-shiba-inu-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701774694-shiba-inu-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139359" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, the coin&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) is still rising beyond its 200-day average (blue), and even if its rise isn&#8217;t quite as steep as it was a few days ago, it&#8217;s still pointing upwards.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also encouraging that SHIB&#8217;s support level (green) continues to rise and hold up, indicating that any incoming losses are likely to be slight.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the meme token&#8217;s trading volume now stands at around $400 million, which is much higher than the levels – between $50 million and $100 million – recorded in September and early October.</p>
<p>Much of this extra volume has arisen because larger traders have returned to SHIB, with the past couple of days seeing one whale withdraw around $5.7 million of the token off Binance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A fresh whale wallet withdrew 600B <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SHIB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$SHIB</a>($5.7M) from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> in the past 30 minutes.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of this, Shiba Inu has been prudently improving its fundamentals this year, with August&#8217;s launch of the Shibarium layer-two network being its most notable event.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more notably, Shibarium has now processed close to 34 million transactions since launching, a sign of growing demand for faster and cheaper transactions within the SHIB ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some notes from 32M+ transactions on Shibarium </p>
<p>1. Not spam transactions- Although would love to learn more about SRC-20 and how can Shibarium team support them from the devs.<br />2. Even with gas fees rising 1000% the normal operations were still tenth of a penny and complex…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Such growth is indicative of how Shiba Inu is increasingly becoming more than a mere meme token.</p>
<p>This is also evident in the growth of Shiba Inu-based apps, such as ShibaSwap, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/shibaswap/">a DEX which now has a 24-hour trading volume of around $1.3 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Based on such developments, the Shiba Inu price is likely to continue rising over time, potentially reaching $0.000020 within the first few weeks of 2024.</p>
<h2>Other High-Potential Altcoins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">But SHIB isn&#8217;t the only promising alt in the market right now, with various newer coins also looking to rally big in the next few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">One of the hottest of these right now is </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, a stake-to-mine platform that has raised $4.8 million in its incredibly successful presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is one of the most interesting new projects in crypto, with its platform ready to enable users to mine actual Bitcoin (BTC) simply by staking its native token.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>By staking BTCMTX, users receive tokenized mining credits, which they can use to purchase Bitcoin hashing power.</p>
<p>In turn, buying enough hashing power will earn users newly mined BTC, while staking will also earn them freshly issued BTCMTX.</p>
<p>This means that Bitcoin Minetrix could end up a substantially lucrative platform as far as passive income goes, while demand for BTCMTX could see its price rises considerably.</p>

<p>The presale has received 1.4 billion of the coin&#8217;s max supply (of 4 billion), with investors able to join proceedings by heading over to<span style="font-size: 16px"> </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">the Bitcoin Minetrix official website</a><span style="font-size: 16px">.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD">Ethereum price</a> has dipped by 2% in the past 24 hours, falling down to $2,207 as the wider crypto market slips by 0.5% today.</p>
<p>Yet ETH has had a good week overall, with the altcoin remaining up by 9% in the last seven days and also by 17% in the last 30.</p>
<p>These gains provide it with enough ongoing momentum to produce further rallies in the next few days and weeks, with ETH likely to be one of the main beneficiaries of an expected end-of-year rally.</p>
<p>And when combined with its enviable fundamentals, ETH could potentially reach new highs in 2024.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Prediction as Bull Run Continues Beyond $2,200 – Is a $10,000 ETH Possible in 2024?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Atheneum&#8217;s chart continues to look bullish, even with today&#8217;s little misstep.</p>
<p>Its 30-day average (yellow) is still racing further above its 200-day (blue), implying that the altcoin remains in the middle of a medium-term uptrend.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139340" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139340" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139340" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701772421-ethereum-price-chart.png" alt="Ethereum price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701772421-ethereum-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701772421-ethereum-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701772421-ethereum-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701772421-ethereum-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701772421-ethereum-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701772421-ethereum-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701772421-ethereum-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139340" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, its relative strength index (purple) remains close to 70, a level which indicates ongoing buying pressure that&#8217;s likely to keep pushing up the coin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>Just as bullishly, ETH&#8217;s support level (green) has been climbing steadily ever since the middle of October, meaning that if the coin is to lose ground at any point during the current rally, any dips are likely to be small.</p>
<p>And compared to September and early October, ETH&#8217;s trading volume is extraordinarily healthy, standing at about $30 billion, in contrast to levels as low as $3 billion.</p>
<p>This makes ETH the most-traded non-stablecoin alt in the market, implying that it&#8217;s likely to benefit from an expected end-of-year rally more than most other altcoins.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone has to say it.</p>
<p>ETH price at $2.2k is hilarious.</p>
<p>Everyone out here trading &quot;what ifs&quot; this cycle when Ethereum has fundamentals. </p>
<p>Let my tell you why $2.2k ETH is stooopid.</p>
<p>Ethereum now makes $2.7 billion in annualized profits &#8211; the only profitable chain &#8211; a P/E ratio…</p>
<p>&mdash; RYAN SΞAN ADAMS &#8211; rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1731706803153506338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Indeed, ETH&#8217;s fundamentals remain unparalleled among the vast majority of tokens, with <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum">the Ethereum blockchain accounting for 56% of the entire sector&#8217;s total value locked in</a>.</p>
<p>On top of this, Ethereum has enjoyed some highly significant adoption news this year, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-payment-firm-paypal-launches-crypto-stablecoin-how-does-it-work.htm">PayPal launching its own Ethereum-based stablecoin</a> and with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-steps-into-unchartered-territory-as-its-layer-2-blockchain-base-goes-live.htm">Coinbase releasing its own Ethereum layer-two</a>.</p>
<p>This all points to a steadily rising Ethereum price over time, with the altcoin set to hit $3,000 in the next couple of months.</p>
<h2>Other Altcoins With High Growth Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As reliable as ETH remains as a major token in the market, it isn&#8217;t the only coin with potential right now, with some traders even likely to prefer newer coins set to enjoy early growth spurts.</p>
<p>Such coins include presale tokens, which can often generate enough momentum during their sales to enjoy big listings on exchanges.</p>
<p>One new coin likely to do this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised $2.5 million in its presale.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What&#39;s the aim of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTCETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTCETF</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Token?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Token</a>?</p>
<p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinETF</a> token, operating as an ERC-20 token, commemorates the anticipated introduction of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETFs into the American financial markets. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/nybwFgMwwH">pic.twitter.com/nybwFgMwwH</a></p>
<p>&mdash; BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token/status/1731961681759060196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As the tweet above indicates, Bitcoin ETF Token has distinguished itself with some novel tokenomics, which are linked to the progress of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>In particular, the coin will burn 25% of its total supply over time, with 5% tranches being burned whenever Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs reach certain milestones.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">Accordingly, Bitcoin ETF Token will process its first 5% burn when an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF reaches a volume of $100 million.</span></p>
<p>Its final burn will come when the BTC price reaches $100,000, with the token also featuring a transaction burn tax that will decline over time.</p>
<p><iframe title="BTCETF Token Presale Raises $2,500,000 - New 10x Potential Crypto?!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxSvvYbmjHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>To join the coin&#8217;s presale, investors can simply go to <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a> and connect their software wallets, such as MetaMask.</p>
<p>They can currently buy BTCETF at a price of $0.0062 per token, although the sale will up this price in just under a day.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s likely to rise even higher once the token lists on trading platforms, especially when its deflationary mechanisms kick in.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/PEPEUSD">PEPE price</a> has dropped by 2.6% in the past 24 hours, with its fall to $0.00000137 coming as the market cools down a little after yesterday&#8217;s rally.</p>
<p>Despite the dip, PEPE remains up by 30% in a week and by 21% in the last 30 days, with its market cap surpassing $500 million for the first time since early November.</p>
<p>And with the meme token&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume remaining high at close to $400 million, it&#8217;s likely that PEPE will continue to attract enough interest to mount further rallies in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Pepe Price Prediction as Market Cap Surpasses $500 Million – $1 PEPE Incoming?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
PEPE&#8217;s chart currently looks pretty strong, in that its indicators are pointing towards additional gains.</p>
<p>Most notably, its 30-day moving average (yellow) is very close to crossing above its 200-day average (blue), meaning that it&#8217;s set to form a &#8216;golden cross&#8217; that generally indicates a breakout.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139307" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139307" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701769540-pepe-price-chart.png" alt="Pepe price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701769540-pepe-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701769540-pepe-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701769540-pepe-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701769540-pepe-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701769540-pepe-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701769540-pepe-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701769540-pepe-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139307" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, PEPE&#8217;s RSI (purple) remains close to 70, signalling strong buying pressure that&#8217;s likely to continue pushing the altcoin&#8217;s price up in the next few days.</p>
<p>Supporting such a conclusion is the coin&#8217;s trading volume, which suggests that whales continue to accumulate the token in expectation of more price rises.</p>
<p>Yet what traders should be wary of is that, with &#8216;pure&#8217; meme tokens such as PEPE, whales buy them up only to dump them at a later date.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PEPE</a> just soared more than 20%.</p>
<p>We noticed that a wallet deposited 794B <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PEPE</a> ($1.1M) to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gateio?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gateio</a> when the price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PEPE</a> skyrocketed, making ~$230K.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PEPE</a> began to fall from the peak.<a href="https://t.co/MBLnOSNlSE">https://t.co/MBLnOSNlSE</a> <a href="https://t.co/cLTtCyMpGJ">pic.twitter.com/cLTtCyMpGJ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As such, while PEPE is likely to continue rising in general along with the market, investors should be mindful that relatively large dips are likely to be a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>This means that timing remains key, so anyone genuinely interested in PEPE should regularly monitor reliable sources of transfer data.</p>
<p>As for the longer term picture, it&#8217;s hard to say whether the PEPE price can reach as high as $1.</p>
<p>Such a target would necessitate a 73,000,000% rise from its current level, a gain that would make PEPE one of the most profitable coins in history.</p>
<p>And the thing with meme tokens is that, if they lack fundamentals and utility, they always run the risk of losing place to another, newer meme coin.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">For this reason, the PEPE price may reach $0.0000020 in the next few weeks, but struggle to rise much higher.</span></p>
<h2><strong>New Meme Coins With High Potential</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Because PEPE remains a somewhat risky vehicle for profits, some traders may prefer to look at other alts and meme coins that are tied to some kind of utility.</p>
<p>There are a number of coins in the market that fit this description, with <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a> being one of the most notable.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">Meme Kombat is an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $2.4 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p>Set to launch in the coming weeks, Meme Kombat is difference from run-of-the-mill meme coins in that it&#8217;s also a platform that enables users to bet on AI-generated meme battles.</p>
<p>It renders such battles in real-time using colorful graphics, providing users with an entertaining focus for their bets, which they can place against each other or against the game itself.</p>
<p>As a blockchain-based platform, battles will be processed on-chain, making them transparent and fair.</p>
<p>Users who win bets receive their rewards in the form of MK, which they can also stake in order to earn a passive income.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">This makes Meme Kombat a potentially very profitable platform, which helps to explain why its sale is already doing so well.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LUNCUSD">Terra Luna Classic price</a> has surged by 30% in the past 24 hours, with its race to $0.00023831 also marking a 104% gain in a week.</p>
<p>This means LUNC is the best-performing top-100 coin within these timeframes, with the altcoin gaining momentum in recent weeks as a result of increasing agreement within the Terra Luna Classic community.</p>
<p>And with this community recently providing more than 90% approval for a new upgrade, LUNC could continue rising in the next few days, particularly if the wider market continues its bullish uptrend.</p>
<h2>Terra Luna Classic Price Prediction as LUNC Becomes Best Performer of the Week – $1 LUNC Incoming?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There&#8217;s little doubt that LUNC is very hot coin at the moment, with its indicators all moving into very bullish positions.</p>
<p>Indeed, its RSI (purple) is now touching 90, and while this ordinarily indicates that it has entered &#8216;overbought territory&#8217;, LUNC&#8217;s status as an oversold coin for so long should enable it to sustain gains over the coming weeks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138899" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138899" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138899" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart.png" alt="Terra Luna Classic price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138899" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Encouragingly, the coin&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has only recently climbed over its 200-day (blue), implying that it still has quite a bit of time before it&#8217;s likely to correct downwards again.</p>
<p>Possibly the most bullish aspect of LUNC&#8217;s chart is its 24-hour trading volume, which after being negligible throughout previous months has not jumped to $1.25 billion.</p>
<p>This all-but guarantees that whales have resumed buying and accumulating the token, with many community members becoming increasingly confident that LUNC will reach new highs over the coming weeks.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There are various reasons for LUNC&#8217;s improving fortunes, with the general market-wide rally being the most obvious.</p>
<p>Yet LUNC has also benefitted from the passage of a number of significant governance proposals, including a proposal – which has now been implemented – <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-lunc-gains-56-is-the-rally-to-1-starting.htm">to halt the minting of USTC</a>, LUNC&#8217;s sister stablecoin.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also important that the increasing acceptance of governance proposals points to growing harmony and agreement with the Terra Luna Classic community, something which points towards greater progress over time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Indeed, one recent proposal – <a href="https://station.terraclassic.community/proposal/columbus-5/11885">to introduce an update that fixes a mismatch issue</a> – received 92% approval, making it one of the most widely accepted LUNC proposals in recent weeks.</p>
<p>As such, this highlights a growing shared sense of purpose among community members, and the possibility that LUNC may enjoy more growth in 2024.</p>
<p>The Terra Luna Classic price could therefore reach $0.001 within the first few months of the new year.</p>
<h2>New Alts With Strong Fundamentals and High Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">Because LUNC&#8217;s indicators suggest that its rally may be close to peaking in the short term, some traders may prefer to look elsewhere right now.</span></p>
<p>Luckily, there&#8217;s no shortage of new and promising alts in the market, with several presale tokens currently generating significant amounts of momentum.</p>
<p>Possibly the most promising of all is<span style="font-size: 16px"> </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, a stake-to-mine platform that has raised more than $4.7 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p>Set to go live in the next few weeks, Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s platform provides users with the chance to stake its native token BTCMTX in order to mine actual Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>Staking BTCMTX means that users receive tokenized mining credits in return, which they can then spend to have mining pools mine for them.</p>
<p>By doing this enough, users will receive mined BTC, with Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s system set to widen access to mining at a time when Bitcoin rewards are set to become scarcer.</p>
<p>On top of this, staking also provides users with a steady stream of new BTCMTX tokens, with the altcoin having a max supply of four billion.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD">Shiba Inu price</a> has jumped by 10% in the past 24 hours, with the meme token&#8217;s rise to $0.00000934 coming as the market as a whole gains by 4% today.</p>
<p>This increase puts <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-shiba-inu-coin.htm">SHIB</a> up by 18% in the last 30 days, with the coin also having appreciated by 15% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Such year-to-date growth is relatively disappointing in relation to other major tokens, yet it&#8217;s arguable that SHIB&#8217;s prior underperformance now puts it in a position to grow vigorously over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>And with most analysts expecting a bull market in 2024, SHIB could enjoy several months of sustained rises soon enough.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Meme Coins See Double-Digit Gains – Time to Buy?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SHIB&#8217;s chart suggests that the meme token is definitely on the up right now, with its indicators all signalling increased buying pressure.</p>
<p>Its relative strength index (purple) has surged from 50 a week ago to nearly 70, with more rising possible before the coin enters overbought territory.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138860" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138860" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138860" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701687059-shiba-inu-price-chart.png" alt="Shiba Inu price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701687059-shiba-inu-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701687059-shiba-inu-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701687059-shiba-inu-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701687059-shiba-inu-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701687059-shiba-inu-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701687059-shiba-inu-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701687059-shiba-inu-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138860" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more bullishly, the meme token&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has begun rising more aggressively beyond the 200-day average (blue), having over taken the longer term average just under two weeks ago.</p>
<p>This suggests that SHIB may have entered a period of sustained gains, with more price increases likely to follow in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed, its 24-hour trading volume has now risen to around $600 million, from $100 million only a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>This suggests a big leap in interest in the token, with recent data showing that whales have begun accumulating it once again.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As such, the Shiba Inu price is likely to witness further gains in the very near future, with the coin set to increasingly compensate for underperformance in previous months.</p>
<p>And underperform it really has, given that Shiba Inu has rolled out a number of significant updates and features this year.</p>
<p>This includes layer-two network Shibarium, which is currently racking up more and more transactions with every passing week, providing Shiba Inu users with faster and cheaper transactions.</p>

<p>And with SHIB: The Metaverse likely launching next year, SHIB&#8217;s fundamentals could really help it make the most of the expected 2024 bull market.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Shiba Inu price could reach $0.000020 within the first few months of the year.</p>
<h2><strong>Alternative High-Potential Meme Tokens</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While 2024 looks set to be a year in which SHIB will make amends for past poor performance, it won&#8217;t be the only meme coin rallying hard over the next few months.</p>
<p>There are in fact various newer meme tokens in the market that have not only been attracting plenty of attention, but which also boast good fundamentals.</p>
<p>This includes <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, </span><span style="font-size: 16px">an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised in excess of $2.4 million in its popular presale.</span></p>

<p>What provides Meme Kombat with interesting fundamentals is that it&#8217;s not only a meme coin, but actually a platform that enables users to bet on AI-generated meme battles.</p>
<p>Yes, its platform will use AI to auto-generate battles between meme characters, which will be rendered and visualized in real-time for users to watch.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD">XRP price</a> has risen by 3% in the past 24 hours, moving to $0.639999 on a day when increasing bullishness has pushed the entire crypto market by 4%.</p>
<p>XRP has now gained by 6% in a week and by 4% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin – the fifth-biggest token in the market (by cap) – also having risen by 88% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that today&#8217;s market-wide jump is the start of an end-of-year rally, with the Bitcoin ETF approvals and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-soars-3-5-fed-cuts-stir-usd-zodia-joins-ripples-network.htm">likely rate cuts</a> potentially bringing a full-on bull market next year.</p>
<p>If so, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp.htm">XRP</a> is likely to benefit massively, helped along by Ripple&#8217;s recent victories against the SEC and the company&#8217;s renewed growth.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Prediction as $1.2 Billion Trading Volume Floods In – Bull Market Starting?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Perhaps unsurprisingly, XRP&#8217;s indicators are beginning to show a renewed upwards tendency, pointing to further gains.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) has now steepened its ascent and looks set to retake 60, with its current trajectory suggesting that the coin will post additional gains on its way to 70 or higher.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138833" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138833" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138833" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart.png" alt="XRP price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138833" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>And while XRP&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) had flattened out a little over the past week, it now looks like it will resume rising even higher above the 200-day average, again signalling likely gains.</p>
<p>Other bullish signs include the fact that XRP&#8217;s support level (green) continues to rise steadily, while the altcoin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume has now risen beyond $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>This is up massively from levels witnessed in September and early October, but still actually some way below the $3 billion+ levels recorded at the beginning of November.</p>
<p>In other words, XRP&#8217;s current rally may be only just beginning, with plenty more room for intensification.</p>
<p>Yet the coin may dip a little in the next day or so on the way to medium-term gains, since some whales seem to be preparing to sell.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Regardless, the overall picture for both XRP and the wider market remains very positive, with many analysts expecting a bull market in 2024.</p>
<p>Such a bull market will follow from the SEC potentially approving Bitcoin ETFs, while the Federal Reserve could add fuel to the fire by cutting rates.</p>
<p>As for XRP, it has enjoyed seeing Ripple secure a series of very positive rulings in its long-running case with the SEC, with some legal experts predicting a settlement and complete end to the case by the summer.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Taken together, such factors all point to a rising XRP price, which could reach $1 in the first few weeks of 2024.</p>
<h2>New High-Potential Altcoins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
But XRP isn&#8217;t the only altcoin likely to rally hard in the next few weeks, with a number of newer alts also moving into positions where big returns look increasingly likely.</p>
<p>This is especially the case with several promising presale tokens, which have been generating considerable momentum and interest during their respective sales.</p>
<p>A strong example of such a coin is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $2.4 million in its increasingly successful sale.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As its name suggests, Bitcoin ETF Token has linked its tokenomics to the progress of Bitcoin ETFs, with the altcoin set to burn 25% of its max supply over time.</p>
<p>It will burn its supply in 5% instalments, each of which will be based around milestones reached by either Bitcoin itself or Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>For instance, it will hold its first 5% burn when a Bitcoin ETF reaches a volume of $100 million, while it will execute its final burn when the BTC price equals $100,000.</p>
<p>This deflationary setup is also paired with staking, meaning that holders can earn a passive income while sitting on substantial price gains.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD">Shiba Inu price</a> has risen by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $0.00000834 also representing a 2% gain in a week.</p>
<p>And while SHIB is down by 5% in a fortnight, it&#8217;s also up by 9% in the last 30 days, with data revealing yesterday that a new whale has withdrawn around $2.4 million in the meme token from Binance.</p>
<p>This suggests that an accumulation phase may have begun, and with most analysts expecting a bull run at the end of the year, SHIB could be in more for more rallies very soon.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Whale Withdraws $2.4 Million in SHIB From Binance – Secret Accumulating?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shiba Inu&#8217;s chart and indicators remain somewhat subdued, but the counter to this is that they may be ready for renewed growth.</p>
<p>For instance, SHIB&#8217;s 30-day moving average (yellow) has softened its ascent in the past week or so, a sign of diminishing momentum.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138365" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138365" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart.png" alt="Shiba Inu price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138365" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, the coin&#8217;s relative strength index (purple) has remained stuck at the 50 for just over a week now, suggesting that it&#8217;s having a hard time attracting new buyers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, its support level (green) has held up quite well since the middle of October, implying that the coin remains in a more bullish phase.</p>
<p>On top of this, data suggests that at least some whales have been accumulating SHIB in recent days, a sign that larger traders expect further gains soon enough.</p>

<p>Given that most analysts are expecting the entire market to rally early next year (because of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">potential Bitcoin ETF approvals</a>), SHIB is indeed likely to see gains in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>More importantly, Shiba Inu has witnessed a number of important updates and launches this year, all of which strengthen its fundamentals and put it in a position where SHIB can rise steadily.</p>
<p>This includes the launch of layer-two network Shibarium, which has provided the Ethereum-based Shiba Inu network with cheaper and faster transactions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It also includes the launch of Shiba Inu&#8217;s own name service, which arrives as part of efforts to bring decentralized identity to the coin&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>Such features are all likely to increase adoption of Shiba Inu-based apps (e.g. ShibaSwap), and in turn increase demand for SHIB.</p>
<p>As such, the Shiba Inu price is likely to rise to $0.000010 in the next few weeks, before reaching $0.000020 within the first couple of months of 2024.</p>
<h2><strong>New Meme Tokens for New Rallies</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
But because SHIB continues to underperform (relative to major tokens), traders may be inclined to investigate newer alts and meme coins, with a number of presale tokens looking like they could rally significantly in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>A great example of this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, </span><span style="font-size: 16px">an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised in excess of $2.3 million in its ongoing sale.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD">Cardano price</a> has seen a 2% bounce in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.382175 on a day when the wider crypto market has gained by 2.5%.</p>
<p>ADA is now down by 2% in the past week, yet the coin remains up by 32% in the last 30 days and by 55% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>However, despite such growth, data has revealed that only 35% of all ADA holders are actually in profit, a figure which provides some indication of how oversold the coin has been in recent months.</p>
<p>But with the market looking as though it will enjoy a good end-of-year rally, ADA may begin compensating for lost performance soon enough.</p>
<h2>Cardano Price Prediction as ADA&#8217;s Profitability Lags at 35% – Is $0.40 the Last Critical Resistance Before $1?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cardano&#8217;s chart is in a promising position, in that its indicators appear to be regaining strength again after a week or two of decline.</p>
<p>Its relative strength index (purple) has begun creeping back up to 60, signalling rising momentum while also leaving plenty of more space for further rises.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138317" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138317" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138317" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart.png" alt="Cardano price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138317" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, ADA&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) continues to rise further above its 200-day (blue), a sign that the coin remains in the middle of a largely positive phase.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also welcome to see that the token&#8217;s support level (green) has risen consistently since the middle of October, implying that any incoming dip is likely to be minor and brief.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ADA&#8217;s trading volume remains noticeably lower than where it was in the first half of November.</p>
<p>It currently stands at just over $250 million, in comparison to $750 million a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>This suggests subdued interest in Cardano, with data released today also suggesting that now is not the best time for the altcoin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

On-chain data reveals a key resistance at $0.38, with 7.19B <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ADA</a> acquired here.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As the tweet above shows, only a third of Cardano holders are in profit, with the coin struggling to decisively break the $0.38 resistance level.</p>
<p>Yet the expected bull market – stemming largely from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-nears-38k-bull-run-etf-hopes-up.htm">Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> – should help ADA pass this level in the next few weeks or months, and once it has, the coin&#8217;s fundamentals should kick in.</p>
<p>Indeed, Cardano as a blockchain has been growing steadily in 2023, with its total value locked in rising by over 400%, and with the total number of projects launched on its network passing 140.</p>
<p>As such, demand for ADA is likely to increase over time, pushing the coin to new levels.</p>
<p>The Cardano price should therefore rise to $0.50 in the early weeks of the year.</p>
<h2>Alternative Altcoins for Above-Average Returns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">Because ADA is something of a slow burner, many traders may prefer to look to newer tokens with more potential for posting quicker surges.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD">Litecoin price</a> has risen by 2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $70.94 as the cryptocurrency market gains by 2.5% today.</p>
<p>LTC is now up by 2% in a week and by 4% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also having risen by a very modest 1% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>While most major tokens overshadowing this year-to-date performance by a wide margin, LTC&#8217;s underperformance potentially means that it could rise faster than many other coins in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This is especially the case if 2024 brings a bull market, with LTC aiming to return to its all-time high of $410, set in May 2021.</p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Prediction as LTC Gains 2.16% in 24 Hours – Can This Uptrend Continue?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
What&#8217;s encouraging about LTC at the moment is that it has spent the past couple of weeks falling, meaning that a sustained a rally could be approaching.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) had been struggling to move beyond 50 since the middle of November, yet it has now clear this level and looks to rise to 60 (and beyond) on the way to further price gains.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138297" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138297" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart.png" alt="Litecoin price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138297" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more tellingly, LTC&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has languished below its 200-day (blue) for numerous months, something which suggests that a prolonged rally is now overdue.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s hard to say when exactly this might come, given that the altcoin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume remains relatively subdued, at around $250 million.</p>
<p>This is much lower than the levels it saw earlier in November, when it reached a volume of $1 billion.</p>
<p>And it seems that any whales interested in LTC have been likelier to sell the coin than buy it, judging by available.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Still, today&#8217;s gains suggests that a more bullish phase may be about to begin, with LTC joining the market as the latter enjoys a pre-Christmas push.</p>
<p>Once again, expectations regarding Bitcoin ETF approvals appear to be driving optimism, which have also combined with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-expected-to-take-dovish-stance-in-2024-with-over-100-basis-points-of-cuts.htm">signals that the Fed may actually cut rates next year</a>.</p>
<p>And LTC could potentially benefit more from accepted Bitcoin ETFs than many other alts, given that its relation to BTC may eventually lead to the opening of Litecoin ETFs.</p>
<p>Regardless, a bull market in 2024 is likely to push the Litecoin price higher, with the coin on course to reach $100 in the first couple of months of the new year.</p>
<h2>New Alts With High-Return Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Traders who aren&#8217;t entirely convinced by LTC may prefer to look towards newer alts, particularly those that are primed to rally big in the near future.</p>
<p>Such alts include presale tokens, which can often generate enough momentum during their sales to rally strongly once they list on exchanges.</p>
<p>One coin likely to do this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $2 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token has been generating plenty of buzz over the past few weeks, with its deflationary tokenomics the main reason for excitement.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it will burn 25% of its total max supply over time, with burns happening in 5% batches that will occur whenever Bitcoin reaches certain milestones.</p>
<p>Its first burn will take place when a Bitcoin ETF reaches a volume of $100 million, while its last burn will happen when BTC itself reaches $100,000.</p>
<p>The token will also have a transaction burn tax that will decline to 0% by the time the whole 25% is burned, while holders will also be able to stake the coin for a passive income.</p>

<p>This combination of staking and burning promises to make Bitcoin ETF Token a highly profitable coin for holders, with investors able to join its presale at <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a>.</p>
<p>1 BTCETF token now costs $0.0060, but given its deflationary tokenomics, such a price is likely to rise aggressively once the token launches.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOGEUSD">Dogecoin price</a> has dipped by 1% today, with its fall to $0.081625 coming as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has slipped by 0.5% in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Despite its drop, DOGE has posted a 7% gain in a week, helped along by the news that the &#8216;Doge-1&#8217; satellite mission has received regulatory approval from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.</p>
<p>Funded entirely in dogecoin, the Doge-1 satellite will launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and will broadcast ads back to Earth, with its development helping to boost interest in Dogecoin.</p>
<p>And given that DOGE is now up by 16%, Doge-1&#8217;s progress could help the meme token rise even further in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Prediction as Elon Musk&#8217;s &#8216;Doge-1&#8217; Moon Mission Launch Approaches – Will DOGE Reach $1?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In contrast to some altcoins, DOGE&#8217;s indicators remain in a good position, suggesting that the meme token could make more gains quite soon.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) has risen to 60 today, signalling rising buying pressure and momentum.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137984" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137984" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart.png" alt="Dogecoin price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137984" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, DOGE&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) is still rising further above its 200-day (blue), again signalling that the coin remains in a bullish phase and is capable of rising further before losing momentum.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s particularly encouraging is that DOGE&#8217;s support level has risen consistently over the past month or so, something which indicates that the token isn&#8217;t likely to suffer any major dips on its way to future rallies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also positive that DOGE&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume remains relatively high at $800 million, which contrasts very favorably with the $150 million levels it saw in September and early October.</p>
<p>Such levels would suggest that whales remain interested in the token, with recent transfers showing that some large traders are still accumulating DOGE, sending it <em>off </em>exchanges.</p>

<p>This all creates a positive context for the news regarding the Doge-1 satellite, which has moved closer to launching after receiving approval from the NTIA.</p>
<p>The only thing left in terms of regulations is for it to gain approval from Federal Communications Commission, at which point it will be legally permitted to launch.</p>
<p>And this launch could provide DOGE with some welcome extra publicity, helping to keep it in the public eye and potentially driving more investors towards it.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Either way, the Dogecoin price is likely to rise along with the wider market, which could have a strong end-of-year rally, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-speculation-sustains-bitcoin-price-how-long-will-it-last.htm">investors expecting Bitcoin ETF approvals</a>.</p>
<p>Based on this, DOGE could reach $0.1 in the next few weeks.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Meme Tokens With High-Return Potential</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The thing with DOGE, however, is that it remains too reliant on &#8216;external&#8217; factors to push up its price, and lacks the fundamentals and utility possessed by certain other coins.</p>
<p>Yet there are alts and even a few meme tokens in the market right now that do boast greater utility, with a number of presale coins available that look set to have big rallies when they list.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">This includes </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a>, <span style="font-size: 16px">an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $2.2 million in its increasingly successful presale.</span></p>
