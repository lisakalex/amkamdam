<p>Terraform Labs’ founder, Do Kwon,<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-appeals-extradition.htm"> is set to be extradited to the U.S.</a> following months of speculation, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal released Thursday.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Not excluding that kind of possibility&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Kwon has been imprisoned in Montenegro since authorities caught the international fugitive attempting to fly out of the country last March. Both the U.S. and Kwon’s native country of South Korea have been battling for his extradition to face fraud-related charges in each respective nation since.</p>
<p>Following approval of Kwon’s extradition in a Montenegrin court last month, sources told the Wall Street Journal that Kwon’s fate lies in the hands of Justice Minister Andrej Milovic. While Milovic has yet to disclose his decision on where to extradite <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terraform-and-do-kwons-attempt-to-dismiss-class-action-lawsuit-fails-report.htm">the founder of Terraform Labs</a>, sources allege Milovic told the U.S. ambassador to Montenegro, Judy Rising Reink, that he plans on sending Kwon to her country,</p>
<p>However, Milovic refused to comment on the matter, saying only that “the public will be informed of the decision in a timely manner.”</p>
<p>Goran Rodic, Kwon’s Montenegrin lawyer, refused to confirm the decision but said he was “not excluding that kind of possibility.”</p>
<h2>A fugitive on the run</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If and when Kwon <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jump-crypto-pocketed-over-1-billion-in-secret-do-kwon-deal-dodges-questions-from-sec.htm">arrives in the U.S.</a>, he faces eight criminal counts of fraud, including commodities fraud, securities fraud, and wire fraud.</p>
<p>Kwon is also wanted for numerous securities-law violations in connection with the May 2022 collapse of Terra and Luna. The crash of the Kwon’s digital tokens cost the crypto market an estimated $40 million overall.</p>
<p>By September 2022, South Korea issued a warrant for the sham crypto tycoon’s arrest. Kwon, however, was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Kwon traversed Europe and Asia while on the lam, hiding out in Serbia and Dubai before ultimately landing in Montenegro. During this time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Kwon, citing fraud.</p>
<p>Kwon and his alleged co-conspirator, Terraform Labs’ CFO Han Chang-Joon, were finally caught when the duo attempted to board a jet to Dubai with Belgian and Costa Rican passports.</p>
<h2>What to expect going forward</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last month, Kwon’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/do-kwons-appeal-in-document-forgery-case-rejected-by-montenegro-high-court.htm">attempt to appeal to his document forgery case was rejected</a> by a High Court in Montenegro. </p>
<p>With Kwon deemed a flight risk, the disgraced crypto founder is currently being housed at <a href="https://www.ecoi.net/en/document/1023590.html">Spuž Prison</a> near the capital city of Podgorica.</p>
<p>Milovic is expected to wait to announce his decision pending until it’s solidified that Kwon will not attempt a final appeal.</p>

<p>The House Committee on Energy has voted unanimously to approve a new piece of legislation entitled the “Deploying American Blockchains Act.”</p>
<h2>What the bill entails</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/H_R_Deploying_American_Blockchains_Act_Reps_Bucshon_and_Blunt_Rochester_e4ce972799.pdf">According to the brief</a>, the bill would “direct the Secretary of Commerce to promote the competitiveness of the United States related<a href="http://cryptonews.com/wp-admin/post-new.php"> to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology</a> or other distributed ledger technology, and for other purposes.”</p>
<p>The brief notes that the Secretary of Commerce would “serve as the principal advisor to the President” regarding policy issues related to blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Moreover, the bill would require the Secretary of Commerce to spearhead a “Blockchain Deployment Program” that would “support American leadership in the deployment and<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology.htm"> use of blockchain technology and other distributed ledger technology</a>, applications built on blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology, tokens, and tokenization.”</p>
<h2>Support from industry leaders</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Led by efforts from Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) and Congressman Larry Bucshon (R-IN), the bill has even garnered approval from some of the crypto industry’s biggest voices, including the Blockchain Association and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.</p>
<p>“This bipartisan bill will help preserve U.S. leadership in blockchain development, which is sorely needed,” <a href="https://twitter.com/CodyCarboneDC/status/1732489097501950321">stated Cody Carbone, Vice President of Policy for the Chamber of Digital Commerce</a>. “If you think not, China currently owns 84% of all blockchain patents. It&#8217;s time for the U.S. to step up.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s critical that the United States leads the development and deployment of blockchain technology,” <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1732113473448870239/photo/1">stated Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith</a>. “Blockchain Association thanks Reps. Bucshon (R-IN) and Blunt Rochester (D-DE) for their focus on innovation and applauds the introduction of the “Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2023.&#8221; Blockchain technology has world-changing applications, and this bipartisan bill rightfully advances our nation&#8217;s competitiveness in this nascent space.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Where it goes from here</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Deploying American Blockchains Act is just one of dozens of crypto-related bills brought forward for approval since last year, however, its future is still uncertain.</p>
<p>The bill <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/house-financial-services-subcommittee-on-digital-assets-tackles-hamas-illicit-assets.htm">now must pass a full vote on the House</a> floor, which if approved, would send the bill to the Senate for further approval. President Biden would get the final say on ratifying once it’s through Congress.</p>
<p>“This bipartisan legislation would pave the way for a more efficient and secure U.S. economy by identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating risk,”<a href="https://bucshon.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4510"> said Dr. Buschon</a>. “I hope the bipartisan introduction of these pieces of legislation signal Congress’ steadfast commitment to ensuring U.S. economic strength and global competitiveness.”</p>

<p>Discussions between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and hopeful spot Bitcoin ETF issuers have progressed to “key details,” according to a new report citing industry executives.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Mark your calendars people&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Reuters reported the encouraging news on Thursday morning, which experts suggest would signal greater mainstream adoption of regulated cryptocurrencies throughout the U.S. market.</p>
<p>The report comes shortly after <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1730606890319532389">Bloomberg ETF researcher James Seyffart</a> announced the window for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals should fall between January 5th and January 10th, 2024.</p>
<p>“Really this means that any potential approval orders are going to come on either Monday Jan 8, Tuesday Jan 9, or Wednesday Jan 10,” Seyffart posted on X. “Mark your calendars people.”</p>
<h2>A hard-won fight</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brief-approval-window-opens-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-90-chance-of-approval-by-january.htm">SEC’s long-awaited approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF</a> would put an end to a well-established legal saga that saw the federal regulator originally reject digital currency asset manager Grayscale Investments’ goal of converting an estimated  $17 billion of GBTC into a spot ETF in June 2022.</p>
<p>At the time, the SEC claimed “the proposal did not meet anti-fraud and investor protection standards.”</p>
<p>However, in August 2023, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Neomi Rao reversed the SEC’s original decision.</p>
<p>“Grayscale’s primary argument is straightforward: the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by denying the listing of Grayscale’s proposed bitcoin ETP and approving the listing of materially similar bitcoin futures ETPs,” Rao stated.</p>
<h2>Bull market ahead?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Grayscale Investments was back in the news this week as CEO Michael Sonnenshein pushed back against<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-on-crypto-if-i-was-the-government-id-close-it-down.htm"> anti-crypto statements made by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon</a> at a Senate Banking Committee hearing Thursday.</p>
<p>“I think every executive, particularly in the financial service space, is going to have their own opinions on new technologies and whether that’s crypto or Bitcoin specifically,” Sonneshein said. “But if you take a big step back, there is no question that this asset class is here to stay, that investor interest in this asset class is only growing.”</p>
<p>Having initially filed for spot Bitcoin ETF approval in 2021, a green light from the SEC would signal the end of Grayscale Investments’ years-long campaign.</p>
<p>Currently, 13 other different spot Bitcoin ETF applicants are awaiting alongside Grayscale Investments for potential approval, including VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Invesco Gallery Bitcoin ETF, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, amongst others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-token-tap-1-billion-market-cap-as-btc-moves-past-43500.htm">Bitcoin continues to ride high following a rally</a> that saw the token’s value surpass $44,000, its highest since April 2022.</p>
<p>Fueled by optimism of a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Bitcoin’s dramatic increase in value has stoked suggestions that crypto may be facing a potential bull market in 2024. If so, it would put an end to a nearly year-and-a-half-long crypto winter and spark an expected increase in investor interest in cryptocurrency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon delivered scathing remarks about the crypto industry during testimony at a Senate Banking Hearing Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dimon “deeply opposed” to crypto</p>
<p>“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” Dimon said while fielding questions from Senator Elizabeth Warren. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, and tax avoidance.”</p>
<p>Dimon went on to allege that crypto being “somewhat anonymous” and its overall ability to allow users to “move money instantaneously” served as part of his reasoning, noting the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” Dimon concluded.</p>
<p>Wall Street oversight</p>
<p>Dimon’s testimony <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/annual-oversight-of-wall-street-firms">was part of a larger annual hearing held by The Senate Banking Committee</a> that brings together the CEOs of the nation’s largest banks to discuss oversight of Wall Street.</p>
<p>In attendance alongside Dimon included CEO and Chairman of Goldman Sachs, David M. Solomon, CEO of Citigroup, Ms. Jane Fraser, CEO and President of Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Mr. Charles W. Scharf, Chairman and CEO of Bank of America, Mr. Brian Thomas Moynihan, and Chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley, Mr. James P. Gorman.</p>
<p>Dimon’s comments come shortly after a Bloomberg report alleging JPMorgan’s digital token, JPM Coin, handles over $1 billion in transactions daily. Moreover, the company estimates that its token’s value <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-expects-jpm-coin-to-hit-10-billion-in-daily-transactions.htm">could reach $10 billion within the next year</a>. </p>
<p>Warren and Dimon united</p>
<p>Senator Warren and Dimon had a rare moment of agreeance during today’s hearing when both concluded that the crypto industry should be held to the same anti-money laundering standards.</p>
<p>“When it comes to banking policy, I am not usually holding hands with the CEOs of multi-billion dollar banks, but this is a matter of national security,” said Senator Warren. “Terrorists, drug traffickers, and rogue nations should be barred from using crypto for their dangerous activities. It’s time for Congress to act.”</p>
<p>Wednesday’s hearing comes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/house-financial-services-subcommittee-on-digital-assets-tackles-hamas-illicit-assets.htm">amidst broader discussions in the Senate and House</a> about how to regulate the cryptocurrency industry following news terrorist organization Hamas received over $41 million in crypto wallets between August 2021 and June 2023. </p>
<p>“We know that bad actors prey on vulnerabilities wherever they can find them,” House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/house-financial-services-subcommittee-on-digital-assets-tackles-hamas-illicit-assets.htm">said in a hearing on illicit digital assets</a>. “There’s a bipartisan agreement, though, that we must hold these bad actors to account in every way possible and, specifically, when it comes to digital assets and the digital asset ecosystem.”</p>

<p>The digital world of Web3 physically came to life at the recent launch of New Society’s debut book, “<em>Decentralization, Please Save Culture</em>” at the NFT Factory in Paris.</p>
<h2>An “overview of the ecosystem”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Described as a “mixed-reality journalism platform” that explores “the impact of technology on creative life,” <a href="https://nwscty.xyz">New Society was founded by Dounia Sitayeb</a> as an Instagram page dedicated to demystifying Web3. </p>
<p>Sitayeb, who previously conceptualized creative campaigns in the advertising sector, longed to find a way to further break down the often “too technical” language of Web3.</p>
<p>“People couldn’t grasp it because there was nothing physical or tangible for them to have a connection with,”  Sitayeb says.</p>
<p>By blending both emerging digital media with more traditional physical media, New Society was able to provide an “overview of the ecosystem” <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">in regards to Web3</a> while giving readers a sense of tactile connection to the content through the release of <em>“Decentralization, Please Save Culture.”</em></p>
<h2>150 voices join together</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The book itself encapsulates a sprawling 500-page spread and features contributions from over 150 creatives from around the globe.</p>
<p>“With topics ranging from creator autonomy and cyberfeminism to the debate about AI within art, the book stands as a testament to the belief that creativity is at the core of everything we do, offering a fresh approach in a world overwhelmed by information,” reads a recent press release from New Society. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-to-unravel-lack-of-gender-diversity-web3">With women grossly underrepresented across the Web3 Ecosystem</a>, <em>“Decentralization, Please Save Culture”</em> explores what a more equitable and fair ecosystem would look like.</p>
<p>“The book itself is a testament that it’s possible,” says Sitayeb. “We are a collective of creatives who are passionate about decentralization and also really diverse in gender and identity.”</p>
<h2>Exploring creativity</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In part, the book makes the case for a global shift from the traditional top-down flow of information to a “circular flow” model that places community and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">peer-to-peer interaction</a> above any set hierarchy, an emerging media framework the authors call the “New Society Model.”</p>
<p><em>“Decentralization, Please Save Culture</em> is about looking at the innate feeling that makes us want to create and exploring how it expands with technology,” said Enrique Menendez, co-founder and editor-in-chief of New Society. “Whether it’s art or fashion, the way creativity proliferates has changed exponentially since the rise of the internet.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm">Featuring more than 100 artists</a> and 40 articles,<em> “Decentralization, Please Save Culture”</em> features work from notable creatives including Sasha Stiles, Agoria, Snowfro, Autoglyphs, Gordon Berger, Tyler Hobbs, and more. The launch itself offered an immersive experience for attendees with a quantum art installation by Horomox and a live painting by New Society co-founder, Clara Tournay.</p>
<p>Composed of a collective of innovators and artists, including The Sandbox founder, Sébastien Borget, New Society’s latest event is far from their last.</p>
<p>“We want to continue to provide experiences for our community with physical events,” says Sitayeb. “It’s very important for us to keep exploring and keep this creativity in a very real way.”</p>

<p>The Criminal Investigation Unit of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS:CI) noted an increase in digital asset tax investigations due to cryptocurrencies becoming more mainstream, according to the IRS:CI’s annual report released Monday.</p>
<h2>What the findings show</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3583.pdf">The report states these digital asset investigations</a> “consist of unreported income resulting from failure to report capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrency, income earned from mining cryptocurrency, or income received in the form of cryptocurrency, such as wages, rental income, and gambling winnings.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the Criminal Investigation Unit noted an increase in evasion of payment violations, wherein “the taxpayer fails to disclose ownership of cryptocurrency in an attempt to shield holdings.” </p>
<p>According to the report, the IRS:CI initiated over 1400 tax crime investigations in 2023 alone. Furthermore, they recommended 665 prosecutions, which resulted in 655 of those being sentenced. </p>
<h2>Combating cybercrime</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The report goes on to claim that cryptocurrencies “provide opportunities for responsible financial innovation,” they also continue to “fuel cybercrime.”</p>
<p>“Cybercriminals continue to create more sophisticated hacks and schemes in an attempt to outsmart the law to steal and launder massive amounts of cryptocurrency,” the report reads in part. </p>
<p>In particular, the IRS:CI points out an increase in “pig butchering” scams targeting U.S. taxpayers, wherein scammers deceptively gain trust with a victim in order to exploit and gain control of their digital assets. The IRS:CI alleges the “highest identified loss” in one of these schemes was nearly $2 million, with average losses in “the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”</p>
<h2>Keeping “bad actors” at bay</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Coincidingly, the report claims cryptocurrencies pose a &#8220;risk of facilitating money laundering, cybercrime and ransomware, narcotics and human trafficking, terrorism, and proliferation financing.”</p>
<p>The findings presented by the IRS:CI <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/house-financial-services-subcommittee-on-digital-assets-tackles-hamas-illicit-assets.htm">follow terrorist group Hamas’ October 7th attack</a> which claimed the lives of 1200 Israelis. Israel has since launched counter-military measures in an attempt to combat Hamas, resulting in over 15,000 Palestinians killed.</p>
<p>According to BitOK, a financial audit company based out of Tel Aviv, Hamas received an estimated $41 million in crypto wallets between August 2021 and June 2023.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/irs-holds-hearing-on-digital-asset-reporting-regulations-following-pushback.htm">the U.S. Senate and House each held hearings</a> to address <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/senate-banking-committee-discusses-accountability-oversight-of-financial-regulators-in-tuesday-hearing.htm">regulatory</a><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/senate-banking-committee-discusses-accountability-oversight-of-financial-regulators-in-tuesday-hearing.htm"> issues surrounding the cryptocurrency industry</a>.</p>
<p>“We know that bad actors prey on vulnerabilities wherever they can find them,” said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry. “There’s a bipartisan agreement, though, that we must hold these bad actors to account in every way possible and, specifically, when it comes to digital assets and the digital asset ecosystem.”</p>

<p>The lawyers of disgraced FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, have decided to not file any post-trial motions following his fraud conviction on November 2nd, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.349.0.pdf">according to a letter filed by his attorneys</a> on December 1st.</p>
<h2>SBF’s potential appeal</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“After further consideration, we have decided not to file any post-trial motions,” wrote Bankman-Fried’s attorneys in a letter to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. “We reserve our rights to pursue any claims on appeal.”</p>
<p>Depending on the kind, a granted post-trial motion has the potential to change the result of a trial entirely. The decision by Bankman-Fried’s defense suggests that they will be focusing their efforts on an appeal.</p>
<p>“Mr Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him,” said defense attorney, Mark Cohen, in a statement <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-trial-recap-legal-analysis-and-whats-to-come.htm">shortly following his client’s conviction</a>.</p>
<h2>“One of the biggest financial frauds in American history”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The defense’s decision to not file any post-trial motions follows a nearly month-long trial that saw Bankman-Fried’s former associates and closest friends testify against him. The FTX founder’s co-conspirators alleged they and Bankman-Fried gave FTX&#8217;s sister company, Alameda Research, special privileges on the exchange, including a $65 billion line of credit that was used for real estate purchases, political donations, and venture investments. By the time FTX collapsed in November 2022, the crypto exchange owed $8 billion back to customers.  </p>
<p>“Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history – a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the King of Crypto – but while the cryptocurrency industry might be new and the<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-details-emerge-about-sbfs-life-in-prison.htm"> players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new</a>, this kind of corruption is as old as time,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a press conference shortly following his conviction. “This case has always been about lying, cheating, and stealing, and we have no patience for it.”</p>
<h2>Will SBF face a second trial?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-coins-rally-ahead-of-potential-march-trial-ftx-reboot.htm">Bankman-Fried is facing a potential second trial</a> scheduled to begin on March 11th, 2024 pending agreement from the Bahamian government.</p>
<p>Should the second trial take place, Bankman-Fried will face numerous additional charges, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, securities fraud against FTX investors, and conspiracy to operate as an unlicensed money transmitter business. </p>
<p>However, the FTX founder is already facing a maximum penalty of over a century in prison, with his sentencing set for March 28th, 2024.</p>
<p>Currently, the Department of Justice has until the deadline of February 1st, 2024 to decide whether or not to proceed with Bankman-Fried’s second trial. </p>

<p>A Spanish fugitive wanted by the FBI for his role in providing blockchain services to North Korea has been arrested, according to a statement from the National Police of Spain.</p>
<p>Spanish police alleged Alejandro Cao de Benós, founder of the Korean Friendship Association, has been hiding out in Catalonia and potentially using fake documentation as he had been designated an international flight risk. He was detained upon arrival in Madrid following a journey by train from Barcelona, <a href="https://policia.es/_es/comunicacion_prensa_detalle.php?ID=15982#">according to a press release from the Spanish National Police</a> dated December 1st, 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/alejandro-cao-de-benos/@@download.pdf">According to the FBI</a>, Cao de Benós organized the “Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference” alongside co-conspirator Christopher Emms for North Korea’s benefit in 2018. The following year, Cao de Benós <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-scientist-pleads-guilty-bitcoin-leads-institutional-investments-again-more-news.htm">recruited cryptocurrency expert Virgil Griffith</a> “to illegally provide cryptocurrency and blockchain technology services” to North Korea. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-european-citizens-charged-conspiring-us-citizen-assist-north-korea-evading-us-sanctions">U.S. Department of Justice claims both Emms and Cao de Benós</a> taught top North Korean officials how they “could use blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to launder money and evade sanctions” as part of the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference. Moreover, the duo proposed specialized “smart contracts” tailored to North Korea’s “unique interests” and “mapped out cryptocurrency transactions designed to evade and avoid U.S. sanctions,” the Justice Department stated.</p>
<p>Griffith, who <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum.htm">previously worked as a developer for Ethereum</a>, was arrested in November 2019 and pleaded guilty to violating the International Economic Powers Act by helping North Korea evade sanctions in April 2022.<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/prosecutors-ethereum-foundation-knew-about-virgil-griffiths-north-korea-intentions.htm"> He was sentenced to serve 63 months in prison</a> followed by three years of supervised release. As part of his plea agreement, Griffith must also pay $100,000 </p>
<p>Both Emms and Cao de Bonós were indicted on one count of conspiring to violate and evade U.S. sanctions in violation of the International Economic Powers Act in 2022. While both face a maximum penalty of two decades in prison, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/christopher-douglas-emms/@@download.pdf">Emms, a resident of the United Arab Emirates, is still at large</a>.</p>
<p>In his own sales pitch, Emms allegedly advised North Korean officials that cryptocurrency technology made it ‘possible to transfer money across any country in the world regardless of what sanctions or any penalties that are put on any country,’” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. “The sanctions imposed against North Korea are critical in protecting the security interests of Americans, and we continue to aggressively enforce them with our law enforcement partners both here and abroad.”</p>

<h2>“An antidote to inflation”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“The natural trend of whichever country has the reserve currency is to inflate the money supply and increase deficit spending until it loses that advantage,” <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1731460958298788232?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">Armstrong posted</a>, pointing out that “the U.S. is somewhere on this journey.”</p>
<p>With other currencies such as the Yuan and Euro having their own “issues,” Armstrong argued that “the assumption is the U.S. can continue to inflate, but what I think many haven’t considered is that people have an alternative now with crypto.”</p>
<p>Armstrong continued that people “may start moving fiat into crypto” to serve “as an antidote to inflation.”</p>
<p>“Contrary to what some may assume, I don’t think this be a threat to the dollar and the U.S., I think it will be a natural check and balance that will complement the dollar, and be the best defender of long term American interests (and western civilization more broadly),” Armstrong wrote.</p>
<h2>“More compliments than substitutes” </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Coinbase CEO went on to claim that moving from dollars to crypto is better than moving to another international currency before adding that “fiat and crypto may coexist for a long time.”</p>
<p>“They are more compliments than substitutes,” wrote Armstrong.</p>
<p>Replying to commenters on his post, Armstrong elaborated his belief that “Bitcoin would extend the core tenets of economic freedom (property rights, sound money, etc) in western civilization for a long time, which we&#8217;re at risk of losing periodically.”</p>
<p>“These are part of what made western civilization a success,” Armstrong concluded.</p>
<h2>A spot Bitcoin ETF approval looms on the horizon</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Coinbase CEO’s pro-Bitcoin comments come as<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-microstrategy-shares-surge-as-bitcoin-resumes-rally.htm"> stocks for the first decentralized cryptocurrency surged to over $42,000</a>, marking a year-long high.</p>
<p>Prior to the market’s opening on Monday, Coinbase stocks increased by over 7%.</p>
<p>With bullish expectations of the crypto market on the rise, Bitcoin’s rally coincides with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-spot-bitcoin-etf-market-sees-new-applicant.htm">speculation that a spot Bitcoin ETF approval</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could happen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Bloomberg research analyst, James Seyffart, recently shared on X that the window for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval is anticipated to be January 5th through 10th, with potential approval order dates set for January 8th, 9th, and 10th. </p>
<p>If approved, many believe a spot Bitcoin ETF would serve to mainstream crypto into more traditional financial markets.</p>
<p>“Mark your calendars people,” Seyffart posted.</p>

<p>A number of Binance’s top traders were given exclusive details regarding the crypto exchange’s yet-to-be-announced settlement deal with the U.S. Department of Justice in September, according to a new report.</p>
<h2>An exclusive dinner</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the report published by Bloomberg, a number of Binance’s VIP trades met at a members-only club in Singapore called 1880 for an exclusive dinner. Richard Teng, then head of regional markets for Binance and its current CEO, was among the dinner guests. However, former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>As the conversation unfolded through the night, guests began discussing the future of the crypto exchange, in particular, whether or not the company would be charged and pay off an estimated $4 billion potential penalty from the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>“After conversations with company representatives present at the dinner, some VIP guests were left convinced that the firm would pay that sum — an amount Binance could easily afford,” the report reads.</p>
<p>While the company stated the depictions of the night were “inaccurate,” <a href="https://twitter.com/_RichardTeng/status/1701608106529353811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1701608106529353811%7Ctwgr%5E016da82e09626a031d904dc8808a43bf0eca0b0f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbinance-traders-sneak-peak-settlement">Teng’s own X account appears to confirm his own presence</a> in Singapore at that time for the Token 2049 Conference, with a tweet from the CEO stating he was “glad to be speaking” at the event.</p>
<h2>A legal saga</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The revelation suggesting Binance’s top traders had an understanding of the crypto exchange’s forthcoming deal with the Department of Justice is the latest news regarding Binance’s legal saga.</p>
<p>Last month, Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, failing to register Binance as a money-transmitting business, and violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p>
<p>A Dubai resident<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/czs-lawyers-push-back-against-flight-risk-claims-file-opposing-motion.htm">, Zhao has been ordered to stay in the U.S. until his sentencing</a> on February 24th, 2024. While it’s been widely reported that Zhao may be facing at most 12-18 months in prison, his maximum possible sentence overall is 10 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">Binance was ultimately fined</a> $4.3 billion and has been required to make a “complete exit” from the U.S. market. Moreover, the crypto exchange must follow strict monitoring and reporting guidelines set out by the Department of Justice.</p>
<h2>The future of Binance</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, the company is running full steam ahead under Teng’s guidance. On Thursday, Binance announced t<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-rolls-out-third-party-banking-agreement-to-reduce-counterparty-risk.htm">he world’s first cryptocurrency triparty banking agreement</a> that would allow customers of the exchange the opportunity to hold their collateral in third-party banks.</p>
<p>“This arrangement directly tackles the issue of counterparty risk, the primary concern for institutional investors today,” read a press release from the company. “It replicates a framework common in traditional financial markets, which enables investors to proportion their crypto-asset allocation based on their risk tolerance.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-our-ceo/my-first-blog-as-binances-ceo-2887294642016890803">In a blog post on Binance’s website</a> written by Teng earlier this week, the company’s CEO highlighted what’s next for the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>“As we usher in the next phase of Binance’s responsible growth, I am excited for the opportunity to engage in a meaningful conversation with global policymakers, to ensure crypto investors remain confident in the industry’s future, and to engage and educate the next billion users so that we may work to ensure the long-term sustainability of crypto,” wrote Teng.</p>

<p>A former inmate at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center has revealed details of Bankman-Fried’s life in prison leading up to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-trial-recap-legal-analysis-and-whats-to-come.htm">his landmark fraud trial</a>.</p>
<h2>SBF &#8220;extorted&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1730321326714618180">Talking to crypto content creator, Tiffany Fong</a>, former inmate Gene Borello claimed the FTX founder was at one point on suicide watch and did not eat or shower for several days.</p>
<p>Borello and Bankman-Fried were housed alongside each other at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn as the FTX founder awaited the chance to present his case. </p>
<p>Borello claims a fellow inmate attempted to extort the “timid” Bankman-Fried by suggesting he pay a fellow inmate for “protection,” claiming “they knew he had a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Subsequently, Borello confronted the prisoner in Bankman-Fried’s defense, leading to a physical altercation that caused Borello to spend time in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>“You could tell he didn’t want to be there,” Borello said of Bankman-Fried. “He was just nervous.”</p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s sentence length</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Moreover, Borello claimed Bankman-Fried “just didn’t understand” that he could face a sentence that would amount to life in prison.</p>
<p>According to an alleged conversation Fong had with the FTX founder, Bankman-Fried said he believed his chances of getting off with no jail time were “around 50/50.”</p>
<p>“He believed he was only getting twenty years,” Borello said.</p>
<p>While Bankman-Fried’s sentencing is not scheduled until March 28th, 2024, the former FTX CEO and founder could face a maximum sentence of 115 years in prison, a term length Borello disagrees with.</p>
<p>“You mean to tell me that a guy who stole money is going to get life in prison and never hurt a person in his life?” Borello told Fong. “I don’t agree with that.”</p>
<p>On November 2nd, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven different fraud-related charges following a grueling month-long trial that saw <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gary-wang-concludes-days-long-testimony-sbf-trial.htm">multiple of his former associates and closest friends</a> testify against him.</p>
<p>When asked whether or not Bankman-Fried expected the guilty verdict, Borello said no.</p>
<p>“He was not worried about the case,” claimed Borello.</p>
<h2>&#8220;A very interesting character&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Prior to his trial, Bankman-Fried was released from prison on $250 million bail, one of the largest in U.S. history. However, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan revoked it in August following evidence of Bankman-Fried committing witness tampering. </p>
<p>Borello also warned Bankman-Fried about Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who he says has been called “the most vicious judge in the Southern District of New York.” </p>
<p>Borello, who is currently out of prison, has not spoken to the FTX founder since <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/prosecution-eviscerates-sbf-during-closing-arguments-he-built-a-pyramid-of-deceit.htm">before the trial began</a>.</p>
<p>“He was a very interesting character,” Borello said. “I can tell you that much.”</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is soliciting comments from the public regarding Fidelity’s potential spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<h2>Fidelity&#8217;s argument</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to a notice filed Thursday, Cboe BZK Exchange is looking to list and trade shares of Fidelity’s Ethereum Trust. The SEC published a notice specifically to “solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.”</p>
<p>The notice claims the lack of a spot Ethereum (ETH) fund  “exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek crypto-asset exposure through a Spot ETH ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means.”</p>
<p>The filing continues that U.S. retail investors are forced to either face “the counterparty risk, legal uncertainty, technical risk, and complexity associated with accessing spot ether” or utilize over-the-counter ether funds “with high management fees and potentially volatile premiums and discounts.”</p>
<h2>21 days to comment</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In particular, the SEC is looking for “written data, views and arguments” concerning the proposed rule change. Those wishing to comment have 21 days to do so.</p>
<p>The notice also lists FDAS, a New York State limited liability trust, as the selected custodian.</p>
<p>Fidelity originally filed for a spot Ethereum ETF on November 17th, just one day after multinational investment company, BlackRock filed for their spot ETF, iShares Ethereum Trust.</p>
<h2>The race for a spot ETF</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
News of Fidelity’s latest venture comes a few months after federal Judge Neomi Reo <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brief-approval-window-opens-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-90-chance-of-approval-by-january.htm">rejected the SEC’s decision to deny crypto asset manager Grayscale Investment’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF</a>, claiming “the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.”</p>
<p>The appeal<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-evaporating-and-traders-back-new-bitcoin-etf-token-with-more-than-2m-as-sellout-looms-and-sec-approval-bets-mount.htm"> has since caused a number of applicants </a>to try their hand at a spot Bitcoin ETF, including VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Invesco Gallery Bitcoin ETF, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>If approved, both spot Ethereum ETFs and spot Bitcoin ETFs could give the crypto industry the opportunity to become more mainstream in America’s greater financial system.</p>
<p>Data analytics firm, CryptoQuant, released data last month proposing that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-could-grow-by-1-trillion-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-cryptoquant-report.htm">increase the company’s overall market capitalization by $900 billion</a>, with over $1 trillion pushed into the greater crypto market.</p>
<p>Bloomberg ETF research analyst, James Seyffart,<a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1730257787593056562"> posted on X Thursday that Fidelity’s filing was “just another step in the process”</a> of the company’s application for a spot Ether ETF.</p>
<p>Seyffart concluded that “definitive deadline dates” are expected “in the coming weeks.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance has announced the world’s first cryptocurrency triparty arrangement with a third-party banking partner, according to a press release put out by the crypto exchange Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Off-exchange collateral</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The agreement gives customers the option of keeping their collateral off-exchange with a third-party banking partner.</p>
<p>“Counterparty risk has long been a concern of institutional investors across the industry,” said Catherine Chen, head of VIP and institutional banking at Binance. “Our team of crypto natives and traditional finance professionals has been exploring a banking triparty agreement for more than a year to address their concern.” </p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/binance-pilots-banking-triparty-agreement-to-help-institutional-investors-to-manage-counterparty-exposure-302002179.html">According to the press release</a>, collateral held by the banking partner will take the form of a fiat equivalent, like Treasury Bills, which the company notes “has the added benefit of being a yielding asset.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve developed a solution that ensures our institutional clients can optimize their collateral and cryptocurrency investments, modeled after the traditional markets&#8217; trading conduct,” Chen continued. “We are in close discussions with an array of banking partners and institutional investors who have also expressed strong interest in participating.”</p>
<p>Calling counterparty risk “the primary concern for institutional investors today,” the new agreement allows investors to “proportion their crypto-asset allocation based on their risk tolerance.” The release claims the triparty arrangement frameworks often found in “traditional financial markets.”</p>
<h2>Discussions of an emerging regulatory framework</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
News of Binance’s landmark agreement comes amidst broader discussions in the crypto industry about implementing a more robust regulatory framework.</p>
<p>In early November,<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-trial-recap-legal-analysis-and-whats-to-come.htm"> FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty</a> on seven fraud-related charges for stealing and commingling customer funds, leaving an $8 billion hole in its wake.</p>
<p>John Jay Ray III, an attorney specializing in recovering funds from troubled companies, i<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-the-jury-deliberates-in-sbf-trial-what-happens-next.htm">s responsible for overseeing the FTX bankruptcy estate</a>.</p>
<p>“Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,” wrote Ray in a 2022 court filing.</p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s transition</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The new Binance agreement follows the resignation of former CEO and founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">after he pleaded guilty to violating numerous federal statutes</a>. </p>
<p>“I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,” Zhao wrote in an announcement posted on X as he announced his resignation. “This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.”</p>
<p>Richard Teng, former Head of Regional Markets for Binance, has taken over Zhao’s role as CEO.</p>
<p>“​​He will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth,” wrote Zhao.</p>

<p>Investment platform, Robinhood, has plans to launch in the U.K. as early as the start of 2024, according to CEO Vlad Tenev.</p>
<h2>New features launching</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“The intention is, for the U.K. market, Robinhood to be the best place to invest in U.S. stocks and U.S. dollars, and we believe we can fulfill that need better than anyone else,” Tenev told Bloomberg’s Tom Mackenzie. </p>
<p>In an interview with Bloomberg, Tenev announced the company has plans to launch commission-free share trading of U.S. stocks as well as a 5% ADR on invested cash and its 24-hour trading feature within the U.K.</p>
<p>“I think that’s particularly useful for consumers here because there’s just less overlap between waking hours and U.S. East Coast hours,” Tenev said. “So that’ll just make it a lot more usable and a lot more welcoming for customers to invest here.” </p>
<h2>A global company</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tenev’s announcement marks the third time the investment platform has tried to set up shop in the U.K.</p>
<p>Robinhood was set to launch in the U.K. in 2020, but the company postponed its plans due to the  COVID-19 global pandemic. In 2022, Robinhood purchased the British-based crypto-trading app, Ziglu, before the deal ultimately fell through.</p>
<p>The investment platform’s expansion into the British market is the long-overdue realization of Tenev’s long term vision for the company.</p>
<p>“I aspire for Robinhood to be a global company,” said Tenev. “Baiju and I started this company as immigrants and children of immigrants. And so, the idea of making our services available…to anyone, anywhere in the world with a smartphone is just the vision I’ve had in mind since the very beginning. And it starts with the U.K.”</p>
<h2>A regulatory framework</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
When asked whether the fall of FTX and Binance’s severe regulatory punishment present an opportunity for Robinhood to acquire market share, Tenev stated, “It’s certainly an opportunity.” </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cristiano-ronaldo-mlb-and-mercedes-f1-hit-with-litigation-relating-to-binance-ftx.htm">Referencing Binance and FTX</a>, Tenev continued that overall “it&#8217;s good for the industry to have unscrupulous actors weeded out.”  He also claimed that in order for crypto to be globally accepted, there must be “a foundation of regulatory compliance” that is “integrated more and more into the traditional financial system.”</p>
<p>His statements <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USTREAS/bulletins/37d5d4e">echo those made yesterday by U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary, Wally Adeyemo</a>, at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit in D.C.</p>
<p>“We have built a regulatory framework that traditional financial firms not only adhere to, but help us to implement,” <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/deputy-u-s-treasury-secretary-puts-bad-actors-in-crypto-on-notice-delivers-remarks-at-d-c-policy-summit.htm">Adeyemo remarked</a>. “These firms have invested in tools, personnel, and processes that help us identify and capture criminals, terrorists, and others that seek to move money illegally.”</p>
<p>“We need those in the digital asset industry to do the same,” Adeyemo stated.</p>

<p>U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary, Wally Adeyemo, had choice words for “bad actors” in the crypto space<a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USTREAS/bulletins/37d5d4e"> while delivering remarks at the Blockchain Association’s Policy Summit in D.C. Wednesday</a>.</p>
<h2>&#8220;We will find you and hold you accountable&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“I want to directly address those within the digital asset industry who believe they are above the law, those that willfully turn a blind eye to the law, and those that promote assets and services that aid criminals, terrorists, and rogue states,” Adeyemo said. “My message is simple: We will find you and hold you accountable.”</p>
<p>Adeyemo pointed out that firms part of the American financial system have “invested in tools, personnel, and processes that help us identify and capture criminals, terrorists, and others that seek to move money illegally.”</p>
<p>“We need those in the digital asset industry to do the same,” Adeyemo stated.</p>
<h2>Taking action</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Adeyemo’s remarks echo those provided in a statement Wednesday by the U.S. Treasury Department following their imposed sanctions on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-treasury-sanctions-north-korean-governments-crypto-mixer-sinbad.htm">crypto mixer, Sinbad, a “key money laundering tool” backed by the North Korean government</a>.</p>
<p>“While we encourage responsible innovation in the digital asset ecosystem, we will not hesitate to take action against illicit actors,” Adeyemo said.</p>
<p>Adeyemo then used crypto exchange, Binance, as an example of the U.S. government’s commitment to accountability. Just last week, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">Binance founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, pleaded guilty to violating numerous federal statutes</a>, including the Bank Secrecy Act, and stepped down from his role as CEO of the company.</p>
<p>Binance will have to pay $4.3 billion in penalties and forfeitures while adhering to strict monitoring and reporting guidelines set out by the Department of Justice. Additionally, the crypto exchange must make a “complete exit” from the U.S. market.</p>
<h2>Cracking down on crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/house-financial-services-subcommittee-on-digital-assets-tackles-hamas-illicit-assets.htm">U.S. government has been cracking down on the crypto industry as a whole</a>, with the Senate and House holding numerous hearings on crypto crime and regulations.</p>
<p>“We know that bad actors prey on vulnerabilities wherever they can find them,” said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry in a hearing by the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion. “There’s a bipartisan agreement, though, that we must hold these bad actors to account in every way possible and, specifically, when it comes to digital assets and the digital asset ecosystem.”</p>
<p>The political discussions surrounding crypto coincide with larger events affecting the industry, including reports of Hamas’ illicit use of digital assets and the landmark fraud trial of FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, earlier this month. </p>
<p>“As terrorists and criminals innovate their approach to illicit finance, we need tools to be able to keep up with them,” Adeyemo concluded. “These reforms will not only help us curb illicit finances, but they will also level the playing field for the actors pursuing responsible and beneficial innovation and facilitate sustainable growth for the industry.”</p>

<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1933">According to a statement released Wednesday</a>, the U.S. Treasury Department has placed sanctions on the government of North Korea&#8217;s crypto mixer, Sinbad.</p>
<h2>“A key-money laundering tool”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Sinbad serves as “a key money-laundering tool” for the state-sponsored North Korean cyber-hacking collective Lazarus Group. The U.S. Treasury Department states Sinbad has processed millions of dollars worth of virtual currencies from heists conducted by the cyber-hacking group. </p>
<p>Moreover, Lazarus Group is accused of being utilized by cybercriminals “to obfuscate transactions linked to malign activities such as sanctions evasion, drug trafficking, the purchase of child sexual abuse materials, and additional illicit sales on darknet marketplaces.”</p>
<p>“Mixing services that enable criminal actors, such as the Lazarus Group, to launder stolen assets will face serious consequences,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “The Treasury Department and its U.S. government partners stand ready to deploy all tools at their disposal to prevent virtual currency mixers, like Sinbad, from facilitating illicit activities. While we encourage responsible innovation in the digital asset ecosystem, we will not hesitate to take action against illicit actors.”</p>
<h2>OFAC sanctions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) previously sanctioned Lazarus Group alongside two sub-groups backed by the North Korean government, Bluenoroff and Andariel, in 2019.</p>
<p>In May 2022, OFAC placed sanctions on Blender, a North Korean crypto mixer widely considered to be the precursor to Sinbad. Then, in November 2022, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-association-sues-ofac-over-sanctions-on-tornado-cash.htm">OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash</a> for providing crypto-mixing services to the Lazarus Group. Tornado Cash has since been redesignated by OFAC.</p>
<p>In April 2023, three individuals who provided support to the Lazarus Group and North Korea “through illicit financing and malicious cyber activity” <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1435">were sanctioned by OFAC</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury claims North Korea “launders stolen virtual currency and deploys information technology (I.T.) workers to fraudulently obtain employment to generate revenue in virtual currency to support the regime and its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.” </p>
<h2>A track record of successful heists</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Previously, Sinbad was used to launder a “significant portion” of $620 million stolen during the Axie Infinity heist of March 2022. Sinbad was also responsible for laundering the majority of two different $100 million heists in June 2022 and June 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>“As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the entity described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC,” stated a release from the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Individuals who engage in certain dealings with Sinbad may face the potential to be sanctioned themselves going forward.</p>

<p>London-based crypto trading and custody firm Copper announced plans to launch a new brokerage platform for digital assets in Abu Dhabi as soon as early next year, the company announced on Wednesday. </p>
<h2>Copper&#8217;s latest expansion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
News of the company’s expansion is part of their acquisition of Securrency Capital Limited, which is expected to be renamed to Copper Securities Limited. </p>
<p><a href="https://copper.co/insights/company-news/copper-acquires-digital-asset-brokerage-firm-securrency-capital-limited">According to a press release from Copper</a>, the brokerage platform “provides investors with access to global securities, delivering 24/7 trading with near-real-time settlement.</p>
<p>“In addition, the tokenization of traditional securities enables increased investor access and simpler, more efficient value chain management through automation,” the press release continues.</p>
<h2>The UAE: crypto&#8217;s newest global hub</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The brokerage platform will be run out of Abu Dhabi’s international financial center, ADGM, and the organization will be supervised by the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRSA).</p>
<p>“Through this acquisition, Copper is able to grow its role as a global digital asset infrastructure provider and establish a stronger footprint in the United Arab Emirates,” said CEO and founder of Copper, Dmitry Tokarev. “This is just the beginning of our expansion into the Middle East.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with Dmitry and team as they serve the rapidly growing Abu Dhabi Global Market,” stated Co-founder and COO of Securrency Capital Limited.</p>
<p>The upcoming digital asset brokerage platform is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nine-blocks-relocates-hq-to-dubai-first-crypto-hedge-fund-to-obtain-vasp-license-from-vara.htm">just one of a number of crypto-related businesses finding success</a> in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>In June, Binance acquired an Operation Minimum Viable Product (MVP) under Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA).</p>
<p>“The<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-wallet-backpack-launches-registered-crypto-business-in-dubai.htm"> UAE’s embrace of blockchain technology</a> has created a thriving industry with security and innovation as complementary assets at its core,” stated a press release from the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/paxos-receives-approval-to-issue-stablecoins-in-abu-dhabi.htm">blockchain and tokenization platform Paxos</a> announced it secured two in-principle approvals from FRSA. The move will allow Paxos to provide brokerage and custody services as well as issue stablecoins.</p>
<p>“Our IPAs from the FSRA, on the heels of our IPA from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, solidify our commitment to pursuing international growth through regulated frameworks,” Walter Hessert, head of strategy for Paxos, stated in a press release Wednesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-137375" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701207774-ryan-parker-mqpawaqxrya-unsplash-2-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="969" height="653" />Four recent class action lawsuits were filed against high-profile organizations and individuals for promoting the crypto exchanges, according to court documents filed in Miami on Monday.</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo, Major League Baseball, F1, and Mercedes-Benz and global advertising agency, Dentsu, are among the defendants listed.</p>
<p>The litigations come less than a month after FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty on seven different fraud-related charges in Manhattan federal court and <a href="https://www.binance.us">less than a week after Binance founder</a>, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pleaded guilty to violating numerous federal statutes, including the Bank Secrecy Act.</p>
<h2>Ronaldo accused of “mass solicitation of unregistered securities”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Three of the lawsuits involve numerous organizations accused of &#8220;aiding and abetting and/or actively participating in the massive, multi-billion dollar fraud&#8221; committed by FTX through advertising the company as a safe and reputable exchange. The remaining lawsuit alleges Ronaldo, who partnered with Binance, “engaged in mass solicitation of investments in unregistered securities on behalf of Binance.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Evidence now reveals that Binance’s fraud was only able to reach such heights through the offer and sale of unregistered securities, with the willing help and assistance of some of the wealthiest, powerful and recognized organizations and celebrities across the globe &#8211; just like Defendant Ronaldo,” reads the filing against the soccer superstar. “Binance’s partnership with celebrities like Ronaldo was clearly designed to use the positive reputation associated with specific celebrities to convince consumers that Binance was a safe place to buy and sell cryptocurrency.”</p>
<p>Zhao, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-judge-binance-founder-changpeng-cz-zhao-cannot-leave-the-u-s-for-the-time-being-whats-going-on.htm">a Dubai resident who was recently ordered to not leave the U.S. by a federal judge</a>, has since resigned from his role as CEO of Binance. Moreover, the crypto exchange must pay $4.3 billion in forfeitures and make a “complete exit” from the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Zhao’s sentencing is currently scheduled for late February 2024.</p>
<h2>SBF’s adventures in celebrity-chasing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In Bankman-Fried’s trial, the prosecution alleged the defendant and a number of his associates had undisclosed access to customer funds that they then used to fund their lavish lifestyle, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-executive-continues-testimony-sbf-trial-gives-details-alamedas-8-billion-debt.htm">including a $35 million luxury Bahamian penthouse</a>. By the time the crypto exchange collapsed, FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, had spent $8 billion of customers’ money.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged the former “king of crypto” used customer funds to finance various high-profile sponsorship deals, including a $150 million deal with Major League Baseball and $205 million deal with the stadium formerly known as FTX arena in Miami.</p>
<p>Furthermore, numerous celebrities were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-head-of-engineering-for-ftx-nishad-singh-testifies-against-sam-bankman-fried.htm">paid tens of millions to advertise on behalf of FTX</a>, including Larry David, Steph Curry, Tom Brady, and Kevin O’Leary.</p>
<p>Former head of engineering for FTX, Nishad Singh, testified that he was “ashamed” and “embarrassed” about the amount of spending Bankman-Fried was authorizing, telling jurors it all “reeked of excess and flashiness.”</p>
<p>“He was celebrity chasing, and he liked it,” claimed U.S. Assistant Attorney, Nicolas Roos.</p>
<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bankman-Fried is currently being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center and could face another trial on additional charges, including foreign bribery, in the spring. His sentencing is scheduled for March 28th, 2024.</p>
<p>Zhao is facing a potential 12-18 months in prison, while Bankman-Fried could spend decades in prison.</p>

<p>Binance founder and former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, has stepped down from the company’s board of directors following his guilty plea to several federal charges last week.</p>
<h2>“CZ” steps down</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Zhao “has decided to step down from his role as Chairman of our Board of Directors and transferred his voting rights through a proxy arrangement, whereby his interest in the company is purely economic and he will no longer be involved in our governance,” <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS/status/1729530641526435859">read a statement from Binance.US posted to X Tuesday morning</a>.</p>
<p>“We are exceptionally grateful to CZ for his guidance and counsel over the years,” the post on X continued. “With his support, we have established <a href="https://t.co/HrbX93eYuS">Binance.US</a> as a destination of choice of U.S. customers seeking a superior crypto trading experience.”</p>
<p>News of Zhao’s resignation from Binance.US’s board of directors comes nearly a week after he pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and failing to register Binance as a money transmitting business.</p>
<h2>Binance coughs up billions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As a consequence, Binance must pay $4.3 billion in penalties and forfeitures and make a “complete exit” from the U.S. market while following reporting and monitoring requirements<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm"> set forth by the U.S. Department of Justice</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Zhao resigned from his role as CEO</a> as the Department of Justice announced the charges against him.</p>
<p>On Monday, a federal judge ruled that Zhao, a resident of Dubai, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-judge-binance-founder-changpeng-cz-zhao-cannot-leave-the-u-s-for-the-time-being-whats-going-on.htm">must stay in the United States until his sentencing</a> on February 23rd, 2024.</p>
<p>Previously, his attorneys argued that not being able to return to Dubai would be “punitive” for his family and partner, with whom he welcomed a third child with in recent months. However, prosecutors argued that the move could be risky given the fact that the United Arab Emirates has no extradition treaty with the U.S.</p>
<h2>What to expect next</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Zhao’s guilty plea marks the end of a five-year-long Department of Justice investigation into the crypto exchange. However, the Binance founder’s legal troubles may be far from over.</p>
<p>According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still investigating whether Binance had secret access to customer funds. </p>
<p>At a hearing on Monday in federal court, Binance.US attorneys formally requested that the ongoing SEC investigation be halted, citing a lack of evidence that assets were misused.</p>
<p>A federal judge has ordered both the defense and prosecution to settle their evidentiary differences by December 15th, 2023, at the latest.</p>

<p>Additional regulation may be needed to prevent another FTX-style collapse according to a new report from the Financial Stability Board (FSB) released Tuesday, November 28th.</p>
<h2>The report’s goal</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P281123.pdf">international financial monitoring body’s report</a> particularly focuses on multifunction crypto-asset intermediaries (MCI), which they define as “individual firms, or groups of affiliated firms, that combine a broad range of crypto-asset services, products, and functions typically centered around the operation of a trading platform.” </p>
<p>The goal of the study, in part, was to examine whether or not FSB recommendations went far enough to cover concerns regarding MCIs and whether additional policies may be warranted based on the results.</p>
<h2>Exacerbating vulnerabilities</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“MCI vulnerabilities are not very different from those of traditional finance, including leverage, liquidity mismatch, technology and operational vulnerabilities, and interconnections,” the report reads. “However, certain combinations of functions could exacerbate these vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p>The report used the crypto market crash and collapse of FTX in November 2022 as examples of MCI vulnerabilities, particularly when it comes to leverage and liquidity mismatch. </p>
<p>Disgraced FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was found guilty on seven different fraud charges in Manhattan federal court last month, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/notre-dame-professor-reveals-ftxs-financials-it-mustve-come-from-customer-funds.htm">used over $8 billion of customer funds</a> on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-head-of-engineering-for-ftx-nishad-singh-testifies-against-sam-bankman-fried.htm">various real estate purchases, political contributions, and more.</a></p>
<p>Failure of a major MCI, like FTX, poses a “significant” risk to the crypto-asset ecosystem due to their “centrality and interconnectedness,” the FSB’s report argues.</p>
<p>When the crypto exchange ultimately collapsed, it had wide-reaching effects on the crypto market at large. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockfi-ceo-zac-prince-blames-bankruptcy-ftx-alameda-1.htm">BlockFi CEO, Zac Prince, testified</a> that his company lost “a little over a billion dollars” consisting of both loans to and collateral on the exchange, ultimately forcing the digital asset lender into bankruptcy. </p>
<h2>“Significant contagion effects”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, FSB’s report notes that the potential total damage of these vulnerabilities “depends on the size of the linkages between the crypto-asset sector and the traditional financial system and whether such linkages are concentrated within systemically important financial institutions or multiple regionally significant financial institutions.”</p>
<p>“The collapse of a major MCI could have significant contagion effects for the crypto-asset ecosystem, but limited effects on the financial sector and the real economy,” the report stated, citing a lack of connection between the cryptocurrency industry and “core” financial markets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FSB’s report notes that there are significant “information gaps” that hinder the report’s assessment.</p>
<p>“MCIs typically do not provide accurate and complete public disclosures, unlike traditional firms, due to the lack of or non-compliance with regulatory reporting requirements,” the report reads.</p>
<p>The FSB suggested that additional reporting measures for MCIs may be needed to provide clear and fully adequate data, while further work is needed for “cross-border collaboration” to “effectively regulate” MCIs altogether.</p>
