<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> price has climbed sharply this week, rallying over 50% in a matter of days.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency rose to as much as $46.97 around 2:45 p.m. EST, according to Coinbase data provided by TradingView.</p>
<p>This price compared to the value of roughly $31.26 it fell to on Saturday, additional TradingView figures show.</p>
<p>The chart below depicts these price movements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-125467 " src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698875436-solana-prices-have-surged-recently_2023-11-01_17-31-50-300x180.png" alt="Solana prices have risen lately" width="740" height="444" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698875436-solana-prices-have-surged-recently_2023-11-01_17-31-50-300x180.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698875436-solana-prices-have-surged-recently_2023-11-01_17-31-50-1024x613.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698875436-solana-prices-have-surged-recently_2023-11-01_17-31-50-768x460.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698875436-solana-prices-have-surged-recently_2023-11-01_17-31-50.png 1432w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<p>When explaining these latest price movements, analysts who contributed input for this Solana price article highlighted a range of variables.</p>
<h2><strong>VanEck Report Fuels Upside </strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Several market experts pointed to the recent <a href="https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/">VanEck</a> <a href="https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/digital-assets/matthew-sigel-vanecks-base-bear-bull-case-solana-valuation-by-2030/">report</a> on Solana as helping push the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-house-committee-passes-bill-block-digital-dollar-launch.htm">digital currency</a> higher. The report, titled &#8220;VanEck’s Base, Bear, Bull Case: Solana Valuation by 2030,&#8221; modeled a situation where Solana was the first platform to host an application that brings on &#8220;100M+&#8221; users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume SOL monetizes at only 20% of ETH&#8217;s take rate and achieves less than half of ETH&#8217;s market shares due to a fundamental difference in community philosophy,&#8221; the report added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a credible path to $8B in revenues for SOL token holders by 2030,&#8221; the document also stated.</p>
<p>Armando Aguilar, an independent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-searched-crypto.htm">cryptocurrency</a> analyst, spoke to this situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main driver of price momentum has been VanEck&#8217;s in-depth analysis report on Solana,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>Joseph Nemelka, Head of Growth/Partnerships for Aark Digital, also spoke to the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The VanEck report was definitely a big driver of this move as many traders are following that analysis.&#8221; said Nemelka.</p>
<h2>Revived Interest In Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another key development that analysts cited was a shift in the mindset of investors, one that caused them to pay closer attention to the digital currency space.</p>
<p>Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for <a class="color-link" title="https://gerberkawasaki.com/" href="https://gerberkawasaki.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://gerberkawasaki.com/" aria-label="Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management">Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management</a>, weighed in on this matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Solana has likely benefited from the renewed interest in crypto recently, as Bitcoin kicked off a rally that spilled over to other altcoins like SOL,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>Jacob Joseph, Research Analyst at CCData, also offered his perspective, referring to &#8220;the renewed interest in crypto (partly due to the ETF rumors).&#8221;</p>
<h2>Solana Moves Out Of FTX&#8217;s Shadow</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One analyst highlighted the substantial impact that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftxs-next-move-three-bidders-in-the-running-for-relaunch.htm">FTX</a>&#8216;s failure had on Solana and also spoke to its ability to recover from such a setback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Solana also suffered heavily following the collapse of FTX, considering the connection between the exchange and the token,&#8221; said Joseph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now these concerns have, for the most part, subsided, and market sentiment is picking up, Solana is starting to attract the attention of market participants once again,&#8221; he claimed.</p>

What key developments should traders monitor?&nbsp;</p><h2>Trader Sentiment On The Rise, Says Analyst</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management, focused on market sentiment, claiming that it has been improving after a federal court made a highly visible decision involving Grayscale and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, a federal appeals court ruled that the government agency will have to reconsider its decision to reject Grayscale&#8217;s proposal, which would convert the company&#8217;s bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s starting to feel like speculation and excitement is creeping back into the crypto industry following the positive news developments surrounding the first Bitcoin ETF,&#8221; he stated.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Halving Approaches</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Sifling also spoke to the so-called halving, which is scheduled to take place in April.&nbsp;</p><p>When this event happens, the so-called mining incentive will be cut in half, reducing the rate of new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dips-3-minutes-as-dtcc-removes-blackrocks-ishares-bitcoin-trust-ticker-from-list-are-spot-btc-etf-approvals-at-risk.htm">bitcoin</a> supply by 50%.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;This limiting of Bitcoin supply from the halving, combined with an increase of demand from new Bitcoin ETF flows, paints a favorable backdrop going forward,&#8221; he stated.&nbsp;</p><h2>Many Variables Could Impact Bitcoin Price&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><br>In addition to highlighting the recent Grayscale court ruling and the halving, Sifling identified several other developments that could affect the value of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btcs-bullish-dance-aiming-for-36500-amid-overbought-alerts.htm">bitcoin</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;There are still many macro factors that can influence this outcome, such as interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events like the wars happening internationally,&#8221; he noted.&nbsp;</p><p>The Federal Reserve has hiked its benchmark rates several times in the last few years, placing upward pressure on broader interest rates.&nbsp;</p><p>This development could potentially provide headwinds for bitcoin if investors decide to chase financial instruments that offer a high yield, focusing on these opportunities instead of putting their money into the world&#8217;s most valuable digital currency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BTCUSDT price movements within the last 24 hours. Source: TradingView </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/who-controls-bitcoin.htm">Bitcoin</a> logged these impressive gains after markets responded to news that a U.S. federal appeals court had confirmed an August court decision that required the SEC to reconsider its decision to reject an application submitted by Grayscale Investments that aimed to turn its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. </p>
<p><strong>All Eyes On The SEC</strong><br />Going forward, the major question is whether the SEC will decide to approve this proposed conversion or deny it. </p>
<p>Tim Enneking, managing director of <a href="https://www.digital-capital-management.com/">Digital Capital Management</a>, provided an optimistic take on the matter. </p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, it seems inevitable that the SEC will approve the conversion, although I expect the SEC to drag its feet as much as possible on actually issuing an affirmative approval,&#8221; said Enneking, a crypto analyst who has has an advanced law degree. </p>
<p>David Schwartz, Director of Projects and Strategic Partnerships for the <a href="https://litecoin-foundation.org/">Litecoin Foundation</a>, also weighed in on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/is-bitcoin-a-bubble.htm">bitcoin</a> ETF application. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think if Grayscale applied using the same type of template application others have recently used like Blackrock, then the chances of it being approved could be favorable,&#8221; he stated. </p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a part of me that thinks the Grayscale product may not get through on the first try, even if all the others were approved simultaneously,&#8221; Schwartz stated. </p>
<p>&#8220;Those products have now had the opportunity to go through a scrutiny that Grayscale hadn&#8217;t had the opportunity to even smell prior to the ruling,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p><strong>Federal Court System Steps In</strong><br />Enneking spoke to the key role that the U.S. court system has been playing in the crypto space lately, emphasizing the challenges that federal lawmakers have been encountering in their efforts to regulate the industry. </p>
<p>&#8220;The executive branch is borderline off the rails trying to apply 80-year-old tradfi legislation to bleeding edge, internet-based, terribly innovative financial technology, the legislative branch is paralyzed by the inability of Republicans in the House of Representatives to decide what and whom they stand for, so the judicial branch is stepping in to act as the sole adult in the room,&#8221; he stated. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126470/334777/btcusd-2023-10-24-09-27-33.jpg" alt="BtcUSD price chart" width="3308" /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin price</a> rallied today, breaking through the $28,000 level as the cryptocurrency experienced notable gains, but fake news helped drive the pump. </p>
<p>The world&#8217;s most prominent digital currency climbed to an intraday high of nearly $28,600 around 6 p.m. EST yesterday. </p>
<p>Following this upward movement, bitcoin pulled back, trading below $28,300 at the time of this report. </p>
<p>When explaining these latest price movements, several analysts emphasized the key role played by a <a href="https://www.forexlive.com/Cryptocurrency/bitcoin-surges-more-than-8-20231016/">fake news report</a>, in which Cointelegraph&#8217;s Twitter account stated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved an application for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-could-grow-by-1-trillion-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-cryptoquant-report.htm">spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> submitted by global asset manager BlackRock. </p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>However, the market observers also highlighted other factors, as well as their impact on bitcoin&#8217;s recent price movements. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin was up roughly 4% on the day before the fake news was reported by Cointelegraph,&#8221; said Scott Melker, a crypto investor and analyst who is the host of <a href="https://www.thewolfofallstreets.io/podcast/">The Wolf Of All Streets Podcast</a>. </p>
<p><i>For information on </i><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoins.htm"><i>how to buy bitcoin</i></a><i>, read our BTC guide.</i></p>
<h2>Short squeeze magnifies the bitcoin price upside move</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that the irresponsible fake news report was responsible for the move up and subsequent retrace, but not necessarily for the prior move,&#8221; he stated. </p>
<p>&#8220;That was likely a result of insiders who knew that the move was coming, unfortunately. Or it was a result of a short squeeze,&#8221; Melker clarified. </p>
<p>Tim Enneking, managing director of <a href="https://www.digital-capital-management.com/">Digital Capital Management</a>, also weighed in on the situation. </p>
<p>&#8220;While the report you refer to certainly drove the initial move, the timing coincided with the expiration of the SEC’s deadline to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-decision-not-appeal-boosts-odds-for-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-gbtc-etf-conversion.htm">appeal the Grayscale decision</a> of earlier this year (and that timing may have been deliberate),&#8221; he stated. </p>
<p>&#8220;Then the short squeeze took over and drove the classic spike  and, in the usual way for short squeezes, almost immediately fell back.&#8221; </p>
<h2>Bloomberg analyst citing a 90% chance of spot bitcoin ETF approval is genuinely bullish</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Armando Aguilar, an independent cryptocurrency analyst, also commented on these latest developments, emphasizing that several variables helped drive bitcoin prices higher. </p>
<p>He highlighted a prediction made by James Seyffart, an ETF research analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, who <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20231016219/bitcoin-etfs-are-not-approved-yet-but-analysts-think-they-could-become-a-reality-in-january">wrote in a note</a> that &#8220;We believe there&#8217;s a 90% chance of approval by Ark&#8217;s Jan.10 deadline,&#8221; referring to the deadline provided for a spot ETF application submitted by investment manager <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ark-invests-cathie-wood-blames-gary-gensler-for-obstructing-proposed-spot-bitcoin-etfs-not-sec.htm">ARK Invest</a>. </p>
<p>Aguilar claimed that the high likelihood that an application for a spot bitcoin ETF will receive approval, &#8220;coupled with new institutional products and investments has made BTC slowly climb in price.&#8221; </p>
<p>Going forward, the cryptocurrency could benefit significantly if the SEC approves an application for a spot bitcoin ETF, according to Andrew Rossow, attorney and founder of <a href="https://armediaconsult.com/">AR Media Consulting</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve seen over the past few years the difficulty in getting the “greenlight” from the SEC, so a report indicating that it has approved a new spot bitcoin application is likely to have a significant effect upon the overall crypto market and whether we are one step closer to mainstream adoption,&#8221; Rossow stated. </p>
