<p>In a remarkable show of resilience, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/">Ripple&#8217;s XRP</a> coin continues its upward trajectory, consistently maintaining a robust position around $0.6479.</p>
<p>The coin&#8217;s substantial growth throughout the year can largely be attributed to the growing optimism surrounding the possible resolution of its high-profile lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is XRP price up today?</p>
<p>The price of XRP is up today, rising nearly 4.5% in the last 24 hours to a three-week high of $0.65. In result, it has outperformed the broader crypto market, whose returns in the last 24 hours came to be about 1%.</p>

<p>&mdash; Bitcoin Traders Club (@btctraderclub) <a href="https://twitter.com/btctraderclub/status/1732752614180413624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This buoyant market sentiment has significantly bolstered Ripple&#8217;s market capitalization, pushing it tantalizingly close to overtaking Binance Coin. XRP now stands just $1 billion shy of this significant financial milestone, marking a potentially historic moment in its market journey.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive into the data and technical indicators to uncover the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-analyst-foresees-major-breakout-soon-is-100-a-realistic-xrp-target-in-2024.htm">XRP price prediction</a>.</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s Positive Legal Outcome and Market Dynamics Propel XRP Towards Surpassing Binance Coin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/11/ripple-ceo-says-sec-has-lost-sight-of-mission-to-protect-investors.html#:~:text=In%20July%2C%20Ripple%20was%20handed,and%20Ripple%20executive%20Chris%20Larsen.">legal victory of Ripple over the SEC</a> has significantly boosted its standing, with XRP retaining most of its gains despite a recent dip. Conversely, Binance Coin has encountered challenges, including the resignation of its CEO and a substantial fine, leading to a decline in its value.</p>
<p>As a result, Ripple is now on the brink of overtaking Binance Coin in terms of market capitalization.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />BREAKING: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XRP</a> is close to overtaking Binance Coin in terms of market capitalization, standing only $1 billion away! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4c8.png" alt="📈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/OysEBeRDl2">pic.twitter.com/OysEBeRDl2</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> is merely $1 billion shy of becoming the world&#8217;s fourth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of approximately $34 billion. This close gap suggests that Ripple might soon surpass Binance Coin, a scenario that underscores the volatile and ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Consequently, Ripple&#8217;s favorable legal resolution and the prospect of surpassing Binance Coin have significantly bolstered XRP&#8217;s position. This turn of events is perceived positively by investors, reinforcing market confidence and potentially paving the way for further gains in Ripple&#8217;s future.</p>
<h2>XRP Gains Momentum Amidst US Blockchain Focus and Whales&#8217; Moves</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The spotlight on Ripple&#8217;s XRP intensified significantly on December 8, coinciding with the U.S. government&#8217;s increased focus on blockchain technology. This surge in attention was marked by substantial whale transactions and optimistic predictions from market analysts.</p>
<p>According to Whale Alert, a notable transaction involved the transfer of 44.8 million XRP, equivalent to $29.6 million, to the exchanges Bitstamp and Bitso.</p>
<p>This movement aligns with the growing U.S. commitment to blockchain technology, as emphasized by the recent &#8216;Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2023.&#8217;</p>
<p>Ripple, with its ambition to establish a global payments network, is well-positioned to benefit from this legislative development. The significant whale activities are indicative of the burgeoning interest and advancements in U.S. blockchain initiatives.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">XRP Whale Moves 45 Mln XRP As Price Plunges, What&#39;s Happening? <a href="https://t.co/WZEMCv5AM2">https://t.co/WZEMCv5AM2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; protea008.crypto (@protea008) <a href="https://twitter.com/protea008/status/1733039713345237466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Consequently, these developments likely fueled increased interest and confidence in XRP, with the potential to positively influence its price. Investors are responding to these evolving dynamics within the cryptocurrency landscape, which bodes well for Ripple&#8217;s future prospects.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><strong>XRP Price Prediction </strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="http://XRP/USD">XRP/USD</a> pair has displayed a remarkable performance, currently trading at $0.6530, marking a 1.40% increase. Ranking #4 in market capitalization, XRP&#8217;s live market cap stands impressively at $30 billion, with a circulating supply of 46 billion coins.</p>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, the pivot point at $0.6297 serves as a key juncture for the currency&#8217;s short-term trajectory. XRP faces immediate resistance at $0.6697, with subsequent challenges at $0.7000 and $0.7332, marking potential targets for bullish advances.</p>
<p>Conversely, support levels at $0.5881, $0.5671, and $0.5401 could provide a cushion against any pullbacks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140523" style="width: 1756px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140523 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702045948-image-89.png" alt="XRP Price Chart " width="1756" height="956" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702045948-image-89.png 1756w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702045948-image-89-300x163.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702045948-image-89-1024x557.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702045948-image-89-768x418.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702045948-image-89-1536x836.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702045948-image-89-150x82.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1756px) 100vw, 1756px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140523" class="wp-caption-text">XRP Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63 indicates a bullish sentiment, though not yet overbought. The MACD shows a positive value of 0.0014 against a signal line of 0.0075, suggesting potential upward momentum.</p>
<p>This is further confirmed as the price hovers above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.6275, supporting a bullish trend.</p>
<p>A symmetrical triangle pattern on the chart suggests that XRP is currently in a phase of consolidation. This pattern indicates that a breakout, either upward or downward, could be imminent.</p>
<p>Overall, the trend for XRP/USD appears bullish above the pivot point of $0.6295. In the short term, the market is poised to test the resistance levels if current support holds firm.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The current <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-doge-hits-8-month-highs-on-elon-musks-plans-to-raise-1-billion-for-x-ai-can-doge-hit-1.htm">price of Dogecoin</a> stands at $0.0920, marking a 4% increase over the last 24 hours. This rise is supported by a substantial trading volume of approximately $935.8 million. Dogecoin currently holds the 9th rank in the market with a significant live market cap of about $13.08 billion.</p>
<p>The circulating supply of Dogecoin is a staggering 142.11 billion DOGE coins, contributing to its widespread presence in the crypto market.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, Dogecoin is trading near a pivotal point at $0.0925. The immediate resistance levels are set at $0.0984, $0.1051, and $0.1101, which could challenge the upward momentum.</p>
<p>Conversely, support levels are established at $0.0877, $0.0814, and $0.0744, providing potential floors for any downward retracement.</p>

<p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also shows a positive value of 0.0069, suggesting the beginning of a bullish momentum as it crosses above the signal line at -0.0493.</p>
<p>A crucial observation is the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $0.0925, which Dogecoin is hovering around. This EMA level often acts as a barometer for short-term market sentiment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the chart patterns reveal a &#8216;Three White Soldiers&#8217; candlestick pattern, which is a bullish signal, indicating a potential continuation of the buying trend.</p>
<p>Moreover, on the daily chart, DOGE/USD seems to be approaching the Fibonacci extension level of 161.8%, a technical indicator that often marks significant resistance or support levels. In summary, the overall trend for Dogecoin appears bullish above the $0.0925 mark.</p>
<h2><strong>Meme Kombat: The Latest Web3 Gaming Platform That Raised Nearly $2.7 Million in Presale</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme Kombat, a pioneering Web3 gaming platform blending meme culture with combat gaming, has achieved significant success, raising nearly $2.7 million in its presale, nearing its $3.5 million goal. With the next price increase to $0.246 scheduled in just over 6 days, the platform continues to attract attention in the crypto community.</p>
<p>Central to Meme Kombat’s financial structure is its native token, Meme Kombat Token ($MK), which currently offers an impressive <a href="https://memekombat.io/tr/staking">staking Annual Percentage Yield (APY)</a> of 112%. This high yield presents both active and residual earning opportunities for players and investors alike, as detailed in the project’s <a href="https://memekombattoken.gitbook.io/meme-kombat-whitepaper/">whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140502 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702043887-screenshot_88.jpg" alt="" width="762" height="613" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702043887-screenshot_88.jpg 762w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702043887-screenshot_88-300x241.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702043887-screenshot_88-150x121.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></p>
<p>The platform allows users to connect their  <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-decentralized-crypto-wallets.htm">crypto wallets</a> seamlessly and stake their $MK tokens. Significantly, 30% of the token supply is earmarked for staking and in-game player rewards, fostering a stable token economy.</p>
<p>The initial 14-day staking period offers flexibility, allowing participants to either withdraw their tokens or continue staking to benefit from the lucrative APY.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat is not just about earning; it’s set to introduce several exciting features between October and November 2023.</p>
<p>This includes the launch of Meme Kombat Season 1, promising to keep the gaming experience fresh and engaging. Moreover, the end of 2023 will see the release of Meme Kombat 2, anticipated to bring enhanced gameplay features.</p>
<p>With the price of 1 $MK currently at $0.235 and poised for an imminent increase, Meme Kombat is making waves as a compelling blend of gaming excitement and financial opportunity.</p>

<p>On Friday, the leading cryptocurrency <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a>, recently witnessed a minor retreat, touching the $43,500 mark, down by over 1% on Friday. The dip comes amidst a backdrop of significant developments, including the closure of an $18 million fundraising round by Babylon Chain aimed at bolstering Bitcoin staking initiatives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hive Digital&#8217;s analysis suggests that early December Bitcoin purchasers are now seeing a return on investment.</p>
<p>Amidst these market movements, financial pundit <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-says-bitcoin-is-the-best-protection-against-hyperinflation-heres-why.htm">Robert Kiyosaki</a> has sounded a note of caution, forewarning that the next market downturn could spiral into a depression, casting a shadow on future price trajectories.</p>
<h2>Babylon Chain Secures $18M for Bitcoin Staking</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Babylon Chain has triumphantly <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-project-babylon-raises-18m-to-bolster-development-of-staking-protocol-1032882198">closed an $18 million Series-A funding round</a>, spearheaded by Polychain Capital and Hack VC. Announced on December 7, this influx of capital is earmarked for the advancement of Babylon&#8217;s trailblazing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-staking-platforms.htm">Bitcoin Staking protocol</a>.</p>
<p>This innovative protocol is set to revolutionize the DeFi landscape by enabling proof-of-stake networks to leverage Bitcoin, bolstering security and liquidity for burgeoning chains.</p>
<p>Babylon&#8217;s pioneering approach marries the robustness of proof-of-work with the efficiency of proof-of-stake systems, potentially easing inflationary pressures on PoS networks.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BITCOIN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BITCOIN</a> STAKING PROTOCOL, BABYLON, RAISES $18 MILLION</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This significant leap forward promises to augment Bitcoin&#8217;s allure by channeling investments and talent into its network and addressing long-standing constraints of the original blockchain.</p>
<p>Garnering support from prominent investors like Castle Island Ventures, Framework Ventures, and Polygon Ventures, Babylon&#8217;s latest stride underscores the burgeoning appetite for solutions that bridge dynamic blockchain platforms with Bitcoin&#8217;s stability. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding this venture, Bitcoin is witnessing a temporary dip in today’s trading activity.</p>
<h2>December Bitcoin Buyers See Investments Mature</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hive Digital Technologies&#8217; <a href="https://algoine.com/news/Hive-Digital-Reaps-Benefits-from-Strategic-Bitmain-Mining-Rigs-Investment-Amid-Bitcoin-Surge/3009">strategic acquisition of 3,750 Bitmain S19J mining rigs</a> in December 2022 is reaping rewards, following the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. Capitalizing on the November 2022 FTX collapse, Hive Digital secured 29,000 ASICs at a cost-efficient average of $13.70/TH.</p>
<p>This strategic move positions the company advantageously for the anticipated Bitcoin halving in April 2024. By December 2023, Hive Digital&#8217;s operational hash rate is expected to reach an impressive 4.8 EH/s, enhancing its global fleet efficiency to 28.9 J/TH.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In November 2023 alone, Hive Digital reported the production of 276.3 Bitcoins, averaging 66.7 Bitcoins per Exahash. Since the start of 2023, Bitcoin has witnessed a remarkable 160% increase in value, hinting at a favorable trend for miners amidst the cryptocurrency&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>However, despite these encouraging developments, Bitcoin is currently experiencing a downturn due to prevailing market selling pressures.</p>
<h2>Kiyosaki&#8217;s Grim Forecast: A Crash Becoming Depression</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki, best known for his book &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad,&#8221; has expressed worries once again on the state of the American economy. He rejects the idea of a soft landing and emphasizes the likelihood of a crash landing that might result in a depression.</p>
<p>In his 2012 book &#8220;Rich Dad&#8217;s Prophecy,&#8221; Kiyosaki issued a warning about a major crash. Now, he indicates that the impending decline might turn into a depression. He reaffirmed his advice to buy gold, silver, and bitcoin as a hedge during difficult times, citing the Israel-Hamas conflict as encouragement to buy an electric car owing to worries about rising oil costs negatively damaging the economy.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ISRAEL HAMAS war motivated me to buy an EV. The war is about Oil. Higher gas prices is what Biden &amp; Marxists want. Higher gas prices will make the poor poorer &amp; liberal woke Greenies happier. Don’t be a pawn of Biden and woke greenies. Fight back. Buy gold, silver, Bitcoin. Don’t…</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1731495482583810425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This updated economic caution may help explain why more people are beginning to view bitcoin favorably as a safe investment in the face of economic uncertainty. However, this warning from Kiyosaki was also not enough to spark positive trend in Bitcoin prices today as profit taking is at its peak.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 78, bordering on overbought territory, hinting at a possible brief consolidation or downturn before the price climbs again.</p>

He explains that these leading cryptocurrencies respond to a myriad of influences both within and outside the crypto market.</p>
<p>This includes the growing demand from various investor groups and the fluctuating risk sentiment and monetary policies, underscoring the inherently risky and sensitive nature of these digital assets.</p>
<p>A significant driver for both <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum is the increasing involvement of institutional investors. Major financial institutions are actively engaging with Bitcoin through ETFs and custody services, lending greater legitimacy to the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Regulatory decisions also play a crucial role, as evidenced by Grayscale’s legal victories against the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-spot-bitcoin-etf-market-sees-new-applicant.htm">SEC over its crypto ETF applications</a>, which have markedly bolstered market confidence.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the anticipated 2024 halving event for Bitcoin, set to slash the production of new coins by 50%, is expected to lend substantial support to its value.</p>
<p>Moreover, a shift in risk sentiment, fueled by the expectation that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of its interest rate hikes, and the potential for reduced borrowing costs next year, could further bolster the appeal of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar risk-prone assets.</p>
<p>Makarem’s insights highlight the intricate web of factors that investors must navigate in the dynamic and complex world of cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<h3>2. Outlook on Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>Wael Makarem provides an insightful <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-total-crypto-market-cap-reaches-1-5-trillion-is-40000-the-next-target-for-btc.htm">outlook on the cryptocurrency market</a>, noting its significant rally in recent weeks. This surge has seen a broad increase in prices across various cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin continuing to lead as the dominant force. Its market capitalization, exceeding an impressive 730 billion dollars, underscores its substantial influence in the crypto sphere.</p>
<p>Makarem points out that while current trends indicate a positive outlook, buoyed by a risk-on sentiment among investors, potential challenges lie ahead. He emphasizes that the cryptocurrency market could face risks stemming from regulatory and economic changes.</p>
<p>Notably, shifts in monetary policy and projections for economic growth are critical factors that could alter the market&#8217;s risk appetite. These aspects are poised to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market, reflecting the interconnectedness of global financial policies and digital asset valuations.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Reflections on Binance&#8217;s Recent Developments</strong></h3>
<p>In his analysis of the latest developments with Binance, Wael Makarem, underscores the complexities and risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in terms of regulation and operations. The recent settlement between <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-from-binance-us-board-of-directors.htm">Binance and U.S. authorities</a> has thrown a spotlight on these challenges, demonstrating the precarious nature of the regulatory landscape in the crypto industry.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Binance Executives Preemptively Disclosed $4.3 Billion Settlement</p>
<p>Executives from Binance, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, are reported to have informed their top market makers about a potential $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities before it was made public,… <a href="https://t.co/AfAg9CR0Sg">pic.twitter.com/AfAg9CR0Sg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; YAMI (@yami10101092) <a href="https://twitter.com/yami10101092/status/1731164850175594975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Makarem points out that the ever-evolving regulatory environment poses significant risks not only for companies operating within the crypto sphere but also for investors whose assets might be impacted by legal actions.</p>
<p>This scenario is further complicated by the presence of illegal activities and operations within some of the largest market players, potentially leading to disruptions and uncertainties for investors.</p>
<p>However, Makarem also suggests a silver lining in this situation. The increased oversight and regulatory actions, while initially posing challenges, could eventually lead to a safer trading environment.</p>
<p>As more companies in the crypto industry begin to comply with rules and regulations, the overall market stability and investor confidence could improve. This shift towards a regulated environment, according to Makarem, might be essential for the long-term health and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Market Dynamics and Investor Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>Wael Makarem discusses how current market dynamics are influencing investor behavior and decision-making in the cryptocurrency market. He observes that recent legal and regulatory developments are prompting caution among investors, significantly affecting the market&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>This cautious approach is further compounded by global economic conditions, including high inflation, stringent monetary policies, and slowing economic growth in major economies.</p>
<p>Despite the general risk-on sentiment that has benefitted cryptocurrencies, Makarem warns that the market might continue to experience risks and volatility.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Investment Advice and Risk Management</strong></h3>
<p>Regarding advice for investors and traders, Makarem emphasizes the importance of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-regulator-sets-it-sights-crypto-risks-potential-risk-management-rules.htm">risk management</a> in the current cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>He advises investors to prioritize diversification as a strategy to spread and mitigate risk, focusing on long-term potential rather than short-term gains. Keeping abreast of market trends and regulatory changes is crucial in this rapidly evolving sector.</p>
<p>Makarem also stresses the importance of assessing personal risk tolerance and investing within those limits. Active risk and loss management are key to navigating the cryptocurrency market successfully.</p>
<p>He particularly cautions against leveraged trading, highlighting its potential to amplify losses. His advice underscores the need for a measured and well-informed approach to investing in cryptocurrencies, balancing the prospects of high returns with the inherent risks of this volatile market.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In conclusion, Wael Makarem&#8217;s analysis provides a multi-dimensional view of the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the influence of institutional interests, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors.</p>
<p>His insights into Binance&#8217;s recent developments highlight the complex interplay between regulatory risks and market stability.</p>
<p>Makarem advises investors to focus on risk management and informed decision-making in this dynamic financial landscape. His expert perspective not only captures the current state of cryptocurrencies but also offers a roadmap for navigating future market trends.</p>

<h2>Deciphering Crypto Market Swings</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
yPredict is poised to tackle the crypto market&#8217;s notorious volatility. Its AI system scrutinizes market data to detect emerging trends, behaviors, and recurrent patterns. This analysis fuels the platform&#8217;s tools for trade insights and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-surges-to-18-month-high-is-48000-the-next-stop.htm">price predictions</a> offered to its users.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies often diverge from the broader equity market trends, necessitating advanced analytics to navigate through the sector&#8217;s complexities.</p>
<p>While traditional markets primarily rely on price action for historical data analysis, blockchain networks generate a plethora of additional, publicly accessible on-chain data. This includes metrics like transaction volumes, the number of active wallet addresses, and coin transfers between wallets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/research/on-chain-analysis-guide">On-chain analysis</a> has grown into a critical component of cryptocurrency investment strategy. yPredict&#8217;s approach capitalizes on this field, employing on-chain metrics to measure genuine network activity. According to the yPredict team, their AI models are designed to maximize the insights gleaned from this wealth of information.</p>
<h2>Navigating Crypto Investment with AI</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For investors drawn to the potential of AI in cryptocurrency, the $YPRED token stands as a gateway. This token not only facilitates platform access but also operates as the foundational currency within the yPredict ecosystem.</p>
<p>The investment appeal of $YPRED lies in its staking incentives, practical trading applications, and an equitable allocation approach. An impressive 80% of the total token supply was earmarked for the public presale phase.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">ongoing presale</a> has successfully amassed over $5 million, with aims to extend the fundraising into the first quarter of 2024, targeting a $6.5 million cap.</p>
<p>Amid the crypto market&#8217;s fluctuations, AI-driven analysis heralds a novel way to leverage market movements. yPredict is on a mission to harness AI for forecasting crypto trajectories and revealing profitable insights. For those open to innovative investment avenues, yPredict and the $YPRED token present a compelling proposition.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140305 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702009966-screenshot_85.jpg" alt="ypredict" width="526" height="784" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702009966-screenshot_85.jpg 526w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702009966-screenshot_85-201x300.jpg 201w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702009966-screenshot_85-150x224.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p>Currently, the presale is in its eighth stage, open until the token price increases to $0.12, indicating a 10% rise. To date, $5.19 million has been collected, progressing toward a target of $6.51 million.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Additionally, the bullish trend in Bitcoin is being fueled by the growing anticipation of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Bloomberg analysts estimate a high probability, around 90%, of this approval occurring before January 10th, 2024. Concurrently, an innovative ETF-derivative project is garnering significant interest as it nears the crucial $3 million benchmark.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) is increasingly popular, offering investors direct exposure to the potential approval of the Bitcoin ETF, further bolstering Bitcoin&#8217;s price prospects.</p>
<h2>Rising Bitcoin Prices Linked to SEC ETF Approval Hopes and $BTCETF Token</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Traders are currently optimistic about the upcoming <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-bitcoin-etf-issuer-talks-with-sec-have-advanced-key-details-sources-2023-12-07/">SEC approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF</a>. With the deadline just 34 days away, Bloomberg analysts forecast a 90% chance of approval. This optimism is fueled by ongoing discussions between the SEC and various ETF applicants, including Grayscale&#8217;s recent filing update, contributing to positive market sentiment.</p>
<p>Moreover, Binance&#8217;s compliance efforts with US regulators have bolstered trader confidence, heightening expectations for approval.</p>

Its presale success, with $3 million already raised, reflects a growing interest and momentum in the market.</p>
<p>Consequently, the bullish sentiment surrounding the SEC&#8217;s potential approval and the rising interest in the Bitcoin ETF token are poised to further boost BTC prices as investors increasingly seek exposure to this pivotal event.</p>
<h2>BlackRock&#8217;s SEC Concerns: Potential Ripple Effects on Bitcoin&#8217;s Value</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-44000-hike-etf-buzz-and-blackrock-update.htm">recently raised concerns</a> in its filing about the possibility of Bitcoin being classified as a security by the SEC or state regulators.</p>
<p>Such a designation could significantly impact Bitcoin&#8217;s trading, clearance, and custody within the US market.</p>
<p>Being labeled as a security would pose challenges for Bitcoin to operate in the same channels as other non-security digital assets.</p>

<p>BlackRock referenced the SEC&#8217;s legal action against Ripple as a precedent that could foreshadow similar outcomes for Bitcoin. This sentiment is echoed by former SEC official John Reed Stark, who remains skeptical about the SEC&#8217;s approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.</p>
<p>Thus, BlackRock&#8217;s apprehensions regarding the potential security classification of Bitcoin inject a degree of uncertainty into the market, potentially influencing the sentiment and pricing dynamics of BTC.</p>

<p class="p-rich_text_section">The anticipation surrounding a new core release for Bitcoin (BTC) further fuels investor interest. Additionally, the fervor around Bitcoin price halving and the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs, as discussed at NBX Berlin, suggests a bullish trajectory for the cryptocurrency through 2024.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">Adding to this intrigue is Blackrock&#8217;s recent update on its Spot Bitcoin ETF filing, which delves into the possible SEC classification of Bitcoin as a security.

This represents a significant milestone for the digital currency. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-core-v26-0-released-v27-could-terminate-bitcoin-ordinals.htm">release notes highlight</a> various enhancements, including bug fixes, performance improvements, and the introduction of new features.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">Key modifications include nodes actively seeking outgoing connections to bolster defense against eclipse and partition attacks, and the experimental support for the v2 transport protocol (BIP324).

<p>In a move reflecting broader acceptance, the Swiss city of Lugano, aligning with other Swiss government agencies, has begun accepting Bitcoin and Tether for payments related to taxes, fines, and municipal invoices.

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Next Block Expo conference, held in Berlin, provided insights into the factors driving the growing interest in Bitcoin and their effects on wider markets. Industry leaders discussed crucial topics such as potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) licenses, the upcoming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin mining incentive halving</a>, and key regulatory moves as Bitcoin broke $42,000 for the first time in over a year.</p>

<p>Market behavior is psychologically influenced by the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle, which Miko Matsumura of gumi Cryptos Capital likened to a medieval battering ram. One of the main drivers behind Bitcoin&#8217;s recent surge is the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, expected to attract $10–$12 billion in investments.</p>

<h2 class="p-rich_text_section">Blackrock&#8217;s ETF Update: SEC&#8217;s Bitcoin Security Classification</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, has expressed concerns in its recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">registration update for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a>. The update addresses the potential risk of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or other regulatory bodies classifying Bitcoin as a security. BlackRock warns that such a designation could negatively impact Bitcoin&#8217;s trading value and complicate its trading, clearing, and maintenance in the United States.</p>

<p class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">The asset manager cites the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple and the resulting decline in XRP&#8217;s market capitalization as a precedent. Joe Carlasare, a commercial litigator, noted the unexpected inclusion in BlackRock&#8217;s filing and suggested that the SEC might have requested this information. Amidst the market&#8217;s ongoing volatility and regulatory uncertainties, this development could significantly influence Bitcoin&#8217;s current pricing.</p>

<p>In the fluid and ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-total-crypto-market-cap-reaches-1-5-trillion-is-40000-the-next-target-for-btc.htm">Bitcoin </a>remains a beacon for investors looking for a semblance of stability amidst digital assets. As of the latest glance, Bitcoin hovers around the $44,000 mark, displaying a modest uptick of approximately 0.15%. The 4-hour chart showcases a promising uptrend within an ascending channel, a classical pattern often associated with bullish sentiments. While the pivot point stands at $44,000, the digital currency faces immediate resistance near the $45,000 threshold, a psychological barrier that, if crossed, could signal stronger buying momentum.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a measure of asset momentum, suggests a heated market with a reading near 78, bordering overbought territory. Investors often view such conditions with caution, as they may precede a corrective pullback. However, should the bulls persist, the next resistance poised at $46,000 could be within reach, marking a critical juncture for short-term forecasts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139993" style="width: 1402px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-139993 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701928179-image-10.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart - Source: Tradingview" width="1402" height="861" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701928179-image-10.png 1402w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701928179-image-10-300x184.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701928179-image-10-1024x629.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701928179-image-10-768x472.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701928179-image-10-150x92.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1402px) 100vw, 1402px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139993" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>Conversely, Bitcoin&#8217;s support levels at $42,000 and $41,000 serve as potential safety nets, ready to absorb any retracement and offer opportunities for market entry. The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $40,500, reinforces this bullish outlook, as Bitcoin trades above this trend-following indicator.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall trend remains bullish above the $44,000 fulcrum. Short-term projections anticipate a challenge to the upper boundaries of the channel, with the resilience of the $45,000 resistance level under scrutiny. Market participants should brace for volatility, as Bitcoin tests these waters in the days ahead.</p>

<p>In the constantly evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> has recently hit a notable milestone, surging past $44,000 and marking a staggering 160% increase this year.</p>
<p>This surge is primarily fueled by two pivotal factors: the growing optimism over the anticipated <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/sec-meets-with-grayscale-blackrock-about-potential-bitcoin-etfs.html">US approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)</a> and the expectations of an impending interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>These elements have significantly bolstered the BTC&#8217;s value, highlighting the cryptocurrency&#8217;s sensitivity to both market speculation and macroeconomic policies.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Adding to this bullish momentum is the news of MicroStrategy, led by billionaire Michael Saylor, reaping over $2 billion in profits from its Bitcoin holdings, which has further cemented institutional confidence and positively influenced market sentiment.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin breaks through the $44,000 barrier for the first time in 2023, the market is abuzz, pondering if now is the opportune moment to invest.</p>
<h2>MicroStrategy&#8217;s $2 Billion in Bitcoin Profits Bolsters Market Confidence</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
MicroStrategy, a prominent business intelligence firm, has <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/michael-saylors-bitcoin-bet-profit-tops-2b-1032871610">garnered over $2 billion in profits</a> from its Bitcoin investments, following the cryptocurrency&#8217;s notable ascent above $42,000. Initiating its Bitcoin venture in August 2020, MicroStrategy&#8217;s holdings have grown to 174,530 Bitcoins as of November 30, now worth $7.3 billion due to the recent price increase.</p>
<p>Despite the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy’s strategy of retaining its holdings, bar a minor sale for tax purposes, has proven successful.</p>
<p>CEO Michael Saylor remains committed to Bitcoin for the foreseeable future. The company has financed its Bitcoin acquisitions through stock issuances, recently raising $600 million from such a sale to invest further in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Key support levels are identified at $42,429 and $41,190, providing potential stabilization during downturns and opportunities for buyers.</p>

<p>Should the positive trend persist, Bitcoin is likely to challenge the channel&#8217;s upper limit, targeting the resistance mark of $45,926.</p>
<p>Investors are advised to monitor for any signs of RSI divergence, which may indicate an impending price adjustment, and to stay attuned to overall market trends, especially those driven by regulatory developments and economic indicators.</p>

The momentum is further bolstered by the anticipation of regulatory green lights, with investment giants Bitwise and Blackrock updating their filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF, hinting at possible SEC approval that has the market buzzing.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">El Salvador&#8217;s President, Nayib Bukele, has praised the performance of the nation&#8217;s Bitcoin investments, stating that media skepticism has been proven unfounded. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-04/bukele-says-el-salvador-s-bitcoin-investments-turned-profitable">According to Bukele</a>, the country has not only recouped its investment in BTC but also stands to gain $3,620,277.13 at the cryptocurrency&#8217;s current price.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">Three years ago, Bukele spearheaded the initiative to adopt Bitcoin as El Salvador&#8217;s official currency and has now highlighted the financial benefits of this move, countering earlier criticism. He clarified that El Salvador has no intention of selling its Bitcoin holdings, despite the cryptocurrency reaching a price of $41,900, signaling a firm commitment to their long-term strategy amidst the market&#8217;s volatility.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">Bukele has called for retractions, apologies, or acknowledgments from those who previously predicted losses for El Salvador, as the nation now showcases a profitable outcome from its Bitcoin venture. The positive developments from El Salvador contribute to the overall market optimism, propelling Bitcoin prices to highs not observed since April of the previous year.</p>

<h2 class="p-rich_text_section"><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s Meteoric Rise: BTC </strong>Surpasses $44,000</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The recent uptick in Bitcoin, marking its longest winning streak since May, has propelled the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-pulls-back-from-42000-when-is-the-next-leg-up.htm">cryptocurrency past the $44,000 threshold</a>, fueling expectations of a forthcoming shift in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary stance towards a more accommodating policy. Bitcoin&#8217;s 16% gain over the past six days signifies a remarkable 165% rebound from last year&#8217;s downturn. The anticipated approval of the first U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is largely attributed to spurring this rally.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin’s longest winning run since May lifted the token past $44,000, sparking questions about whether the breakout increasingly reflects a conviction that looser Federal Reserve monetary policy lies ahead <a href="https://t.co/UYVtNL9m4W">https://t.co/UYVtNL9m4W</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, some analysts speculate whether anticipations of Federal Reserve rate cuts next year are increasingly influencing Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent. Currently, Bitcoin maintains its robust momentum, rallying beyond skepticisms and consolidating gains despite some concerns of potential overextension. The broader cryptocurrency market shares this positive sentiment, with altcoins like Ether, Avalanche, and Dogecoin also charting gains.</p>
<p>The resurgence of the &#8220;kimchi premium&#8221; in South Korea exemplifies Bitcoin&#8217;s global allure. Meanwhile, other international factors, including the anticipated Bitcoin halving event, continue to cast a favorable light on the crypto landscape. Bitcoin is currently trading at $43,858, maintaining its bullish trajectory.</p>

<p class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">BlackRock, the world&#8217;s preeminent asset manager, alongside Bitwise, has revised their spot Bitcoin ETF proposals and resubmitted them to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Anticipation of SEC approval has spurred predictions of a significant marketing drive by major firms, eyeing a slice of the substantial AUM potential.

<p>The RSI indicator is in the upper region, around 78, flirting with overbought conditions, which may signal a short-term consolidation or pullback before further upward movement.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-total-crypto-market-cap-reaches-1-5-trillion-is-40000-the-next-target-for-btc.htm">Bitcoin</a> has once again taken center stage, showcasing a modest but steady gain within the latest 24-hour trading window. Currently trading around $42,105, Bitcoin reflects a resilience that continues to intrigue investors and enthusiasts alike. The meticulous analysis of the 4-hour chart time frame provides valuable insights into the pivotal price levels that could dictate the short-term trajectory of this premier cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The immediate pivot point for Bitcoin stands at $40,190, a critical support zone that has proven to be a springboard for recent bullish activity. Should the upward momentum persist, traders are looking at an immediate resistance level at $43,464, with subsequent barriers potentially at $45,005. However, if the bears gain the upper hand, Bitcoin could see support levels tested at $38,440 and further down at $36,492.</p>

<p>The technical indicators offer a mixed sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 77, signals an overbought market condition that traditionally precedes a potential price retracement or consolidation. Despite this, the fact that Bitcoin&#8217;s price remains buoyed above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $35,004, suggests an underlying bullish sentiment in the market.</p>

<p>The observed chart pattern reveals an upward channel that has been the playground for Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency has just broken above this channel, which, under normal circumstances, would indicate a strong bullish momentum. However, the overbought RSI adds a layer of caution to this outlook, as it could presage a short-term pullback before any further ascension.</p>
<p>As the crypto market heads into a new trading day, all eyes are on Bitcoin to see if it can sustain its current levels or if the market will witness a correction. The overarching trend for Bitcoin remains firmly bullish, bolstered by its steadfast position above key moving averages and chart support levels.</p>
<p>In the short term, market participants could expect Bitcoin to test the resistance at $43,464. Yet, they should also be prepared for a potential consolidation or slight downturn, in line with the RSI&#8217;s indication of an overbought condition. Traders will be watching closely for any signs of price stabilization or a continuation of the trend, which could provide opportunities for strategic entries or exits in the market.</p>
<p>In the grander scheme of things, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent movements are not just numbers on a chart; they are a reflection of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s resilience and the market&#8217;s ongoing confidence in its value proposition. Whether this confidence will propel Bitcoin to new heights or if the market will take a breather remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the upcoming days are poised to be critical for Bitcoin, as it navigates through the complex interplay of technical indicators and market sentiment.</p>

<p>In a remarkable milestone, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> has surged to a trading value of $41,740, marking a 2.75% increase on Tuesday. This notable upswing sees the cryptocurrency breaching the $42,000 threshold for the first time since April 2022, a significant moment that underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and resilience of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In an unexpected twist, the US Defense Department has expressed interest in integrating Bitcoin to maintain the nation&#8217;s superpower status, reflecting the strategic importance of digital assets in global economics and security. Meanwhile, El Salvador, a pioneer in adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, reports a significant increase in its investment returns, as stated by the country&#8217;s President, further highlighting Bitcoin&#8217;s impact on national economies.</p>
<h2>US Defense Eyes Bitcoin for National Superpower Stability</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In an open letter advocating for strategic innovation to the Defense Innovation Board, US Space Force Major Jason Lowery recommended the Department of Defense integrate Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Major Lowery emphasized Bitcoin&#8217;s potential to revolutionize national defense strategies in cyberspace, extending beyond mere financial security.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">US Space Force Major urges Defense Department to adopt Bitcoin as an &#39;offset strategy&#39; Lowery suggested that Bitcoin and its underlying PoW technology could serve as contemporary tools in an offset strategy, potentially redefining the landscape of cyber warfare and defense.7…</p>
<p>&mdash; Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) <a href="https://twitter.com/CathieDWood/status/1731526135194714188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>He argued that proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin represent a 21st-century offset strategy that exploits advances in cybersecurity technology. While some in the cryptocurrency community have praised Major Lowery&#8217;s initiative, others, including Bitcoin proponent Jameson Lopp, have criticized it for perceived analytical flaws.</p>
<p>Despite these differing viewpoints, Major Lowery&#8217;s call for an investigation into Bitcoin&#8217;s strategic national significance could influence the debate on its role in cybersecurity and defense.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Triumphs, Crossing $42,000 First Time Since April</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With renewed vigor amid prospects of US interest rate cuts, Bitcoin has surged to a 20-month high, crossing the $42,000 mark. This resurgence, unseen since April 2022, has buoyed related ETFs and stocks as investors eagerly await the approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds by American regulators.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ET NOW Alert | Bitcoin rises above $42,000 for the first time since April 2022<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#crypto</a> <a href="https://t.co/PNVO0oHyYd">pic.twitter.com/PNVO0oHyYd</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Notable gains were recorded by Coinbase and Microstrategy, with bitcoin miners Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, and CleanSpark witnessing increases between 7% to 13%. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which mirrors bitcoin futures, saw a 7.5% hike, signaling a shift toward a more bullish market outlook.</p>
<p>Factors such as anticipated approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, a slowdown in rate hikes by central banks, and increasing institutional interest all contribute to the positive climate. Bitcoin&#8217;s remarkable ascent in 2023 reflects a burgeoning, optimistic market sentiment.</p>
<h2>El Salvador Reports Surge in Bitcoin Investment Gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador recently <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-investment-returns-of-el-salvador-skyrocket-president-claims-3248969">announced</a> on Twitter a significant milestone for the country&#8217;s Bitcoin investment. According to his tweet, not only has El Salvador recovered its initial investment in Bitcoin, but it has also profited by $3,620,277.13, given the cryptocurrency&#8217;s current value.</p>
<p>Bukele emphasized El Salvador&#8217;s commitment to a long-term strategy, asserting that there are no plans to sell off their Bitcoin assets, despite the market&#8217;s volatility.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">El Salvador&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> investments are in the black!</p>
<p>After literally thousands of articles and hit pieces that ridiculed our supposed losses, all of which were calculated based on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>’s market price at the time&#8230;</p>
<p>With the current <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> market price, if we were to sell… <a href="https://t.co/gvl2GfQMfb">pic.twitter.com/gvl2GfQMfb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1731653743668572498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In his statement, President Bukele also addressed the skeptics and media entities that had previously criticized El Salvador&#8217;s pioneering decision to adopt Bitcoin as a national currency three years ago. He called for retractions and apologies, highlighting the recent surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value as a vindication of the country&#8217;s bold move into the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>This latest development in the value of Bitcoin underscores the benefits of El Salvador&#8217;s embrace of digital currencies.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-breaches-40000-level-for-the-first-time-in-18-months.htm">Bitcoin</a> continues its upward movement, currently priced around $41,820. The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin on an upward path, indicating a continued bullish trend. Significant levels to watch are the pivot point at $40,085, acting as a strong support, and an immediate resistance near $41,940.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin advances, it may encounter resistance at $43,500 and $45,100, while key supports at $38,900 and $36,710 will be crucial in mitigating any substantial declines.</p>

<p>The technical analysis presents a positive outlook, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 80, suggesting the asset might be overbought. Nonetheless, Bitcoin&#8217;s price remains well above the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $38,900, reinforcing the ongoing bullish pattern. Additionally, chart patterns indicate an upward channel breakout, hinting at a potential extension of the bullish trend.</p>
<p>Overall, Bitcoin&#8217;s current trajectory appears to be upward, with the likelihood of testing the resistance at $43,500 shortly.</p>

<p>Amidst this surging price, Bitcoin, along with the broader crypto market, is witnessing a resurgence in confidence. This renewed vigor is expected to catalyze sustained upward momentum in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>A crucial factor in this optimistic forecast is the regulatory landscape, particularly the upcoming December 8 hearing on digital assets by the US Committee on Financial Services. This event is pivotal, signaling the possible establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework, with a focus on bolstering investor protection.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin captures institutional interest, especially with the milestone of 50 million wallets and growing anticipation for ETF approvals, the market outlook appears increasingly positive.</p>
<p>This institutional focus, coupled with regulatory advancements, is setting the stage for a robust and secure growth trajectory for Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicating a promising future for these leading cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Rising Institutional Interest Boosts Bitcoin and Ethereum Markets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It is worth noting that the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a shift in institutional investment trends, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) taking the spotlight, according to a recent report by Bybit.</p>
<p>The report highlights a significant increase in institutional investors turning to Bitcoin, especially in September 2023, driven by positive regulatory developments and growing confidence in BTC-related financial products.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Surprisingly, big investors are changing their approach by selling some stablecoins and putting more money into BTC and ETH to get better profits.</p>
<p>Importantly, as the year ends, big investors are not as interested in other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) and are choosing BTC and ETH because they think these are safer bets.&#8221; Suggestion: &#8220;As the year concludes, major investors show less interest in altcoins, favoring BTC and ETH as they perceive them as more secure investments.</p>
<p>Consequently, this shift suggests a bullish outlook for BTC, with institutional interest and regulatory support potentially leading to higher prices and greater market stability.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Growth: Celebrating 50 Million Wallets and ETF Hopes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The value of Bitcoin recently rose above $40,000, leading to significant changes in the Bitcoin ecosystem, particularly in the number of individuals holding the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Data from IntoTheBlock shows that over 50 million Bitcoin wallets now have a positive balance, a notable increase of 17% since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm about Bitcoin&#8217;s future is high, especially with expectations of government approval for a &#8216;spot Bitcoin ETF&#8217; in early January. Such an approval could further boost Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, the surge in the number of Bitcoin wallets, combined with increased holdings in larger wallets and positive sentiment about the SEC&#8217;s potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs, is contributing to a heightened optimism, likely spurring additional upward momentum in BTC prices.</p>

This performance continues to unfold on the 4-hour chart, with Bitcoin navigating a bullish trajectory.</p>
<p>Key price levels to monitor include an immediate pivot point at $40,082, where support has solidified. Immediate resistance is observed at approximately $41,941, with further ceilings expected at $43,504 and $45,104. Should the price retreat, supports at $38,903 and $36,711 will be critical to prevent deeper pullbacks.</p>
<p>Technical indicators reflect a bullish sentiment, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) positioned around 75.49, signifying a potential overbought scenario. However, the price sustains above the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) valued at $38,543, underpinning the current bullish trend.</p>

<p>Chart patterns have shown an upward channel formation, with Bitcoin&#8217;s price recently breaking above this channel, which may signal continuing bullish momentum.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall trend for Bitcoin remains bullish, with the market potentially testing further resistance levels. Investors should anticipate the possibility of Bitcoin challenging the $43,504 resistance in the near term, albeit remaining vigilant for any signs of reversal due to the elevated RSI levels.</p>

<p>In a striking display of market dynamics, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin&#8217;s price</a> surged to $40,630, marking a notable 3.50% increase on Monday. This uptrend in Bitcoin’s value coincides with a weakening US Dollar, as market speculation intensifies around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.</p>
<p>Adding to the cryptocurrency sphere&#8217;s vibrancy, Zodia Custody, supported by banking giant Standard Chartered, has made a strategic move to join Metaco&#8217;s Global Crypto Storage Network, a platform owned by Ripple. This integration highlights the growing interconnectedness and sophistication of the global cryptocurrency infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Fed Rate-Cut Speculation Weakens Dollar</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In anticipation of a critical employment <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/dollar-shaky-ground-fed-rate-cut-bets-strengthen-2023-12-04/?taid=656d33ce690d80000169c3fa&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">report set to influence U.S. interest rates</a>, the markets responded cautiously to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments, sparking early-week volatility in the dollar. Amidst this backdrop, Bitcoin surged in the Asian market, breaking the $40,000 barrier for the first time in over a year.</p>
<p>The dollar&#8217;s decline was fueled by Powell&#8217;s acknowledgment of a slowing economy and the possibility of policy tightening, alongside reduced expectations for further rate hikes. Market indicators pointed to a 60% chance of a rate cut by March.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Concurrently, Bitcoin&#8217;s value ascended as the dollar weakened, reaching new heights. The pressure exerted on the dollar by Powell&#8217;s remarks led investors to anticipate US regulatory approval for stock-market traded Bitcoin funds, further driving Bitcoin&#8217;s upward trajectory.</p>
<h2>Zodia Custody and Standard Chartered Enter Ripple&#8217;s Metaco Crypto Network</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/standard-chartered-backed-zodia-custody-joins-ripple-owned-metacos-global-crypto-storage-network-1032868757">integration of Zodia Custody</a> into Metaco&#8217;s cryptocurrency network, powered by Ripple, is expected to have a positive impact on Bitcoin (BTC) prices. This development is part of a broader movement towards reducing counterparty risk and providing secure custody solutions, thereby enhancing institutional engagement with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>This partnership paves the way for global institutions to access more secure and efficient cryptocurrency storage solutions, potentially leading to increased investment and interest in the Bitcoin market.</p>

<p>Such advancements in Bitcoin storage infrastructure are likely to bolster investor confidence and contribute to the overall positive sentiment in the sector.

<p>The pivot point for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-total-crypto-market-cap-reaches-1-5-trillion-is-40000-the-next-target-for-btc.htm">BTC/USD</a> is established at $39,027. Key resistance levels are identified at $41,267, $42,523, and $44,832, which are crucial markers for potential upward movements. Conversely, immediate support is found at $37,703, followed by stronger levels at $35,462 and $34,206, pivotal in the event of a price retreat.</p>
<p>The technical indicators paint a telling picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at an elevated 84, indicating overbought conditions and suggesting a possible price adjustment or consolidation in the near term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) further corroborates this view, with the MACD line at 138.41 and the signal line at 631.73, hinting at the continuation of the current trend.</p>

<p>Moreover, BTC/USD trades above its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $38,543, reinforcing the short-term bullish trend. However, traders should remain vigilant for any potential trend reversals or corrections.</p>
<p>The observed chart pattern suggests a bullish sentiment for BTC/USD, particularly if it maintains above the $40,000 threshold. This positioning indicates a potential continuation of the upward trajectory, as long as the key support levels hold.</p>
<p><b>I</b>n summary, the overall trend for BTC/USD appears bullish, especially if it sustains above the $40,000 mark. The short-term outlook suggests testing of resistance levels, particularly at $41,267 and beyond. Investors and traders should closely monitor these technical indicators and chart patterns to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">As the crypto community buzzes with anticipation, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TIAUSD/">Celestia token (TIA)</a> nudges the $10 mark, currently trading at $8.31 amidst a bustling 24-hour trading volume of $387,150,841.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Despite a slight downtrend of around 2.50% in the last day, Celestia maintains a robust position, ranked #50 on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celestia/">CoinMarketCap</a>, boasting a live market capitalization of $1,230,899,610.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">With 148,057,226 TIA coins in circulation and an undisclosed maximum supply, investors and enthusiasts alike are poised on the edge, speculating whether TIA is poised to become the next big name in the blockchain arena, much like Solana&#8217;s meteoric rise.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Celestia Price Prediction</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
In today&#8217;s dynamic cryptocurrency market, Celestia&#8217;s token (TIA) captures attention as it hovers around $8.33, reflecting a modest uptick in the 24-hour trading window.

The 4-hour chart analysis suggests that TIA is maintaining its footing within an upward channel, a bullish pattern that has been a beacon for buyers, signaling a consistent uptrend.

Key technical levels are in sharp focus, with an immediate resistance observed at $8.50. Should this level succumb to the current buying pressure, the doors may open towards the next resistances at $8.81 and $9.30, respectively.

On the flip side, supports are established at $8.10, $7.91, and $7.61, which could act as cushions should TIA encounter selling pressures.

<figure id="attachment_138687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138687" style="width: 1733px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-138687 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701613091-cel.jpg" alt="Celestia Price Chart" width="1733" height="955" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701613091-cel.jpg 1733w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701613091-cel-300x165.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701613091-cel-1024x564.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701613091-cel-768x423.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701613091-cel-1536x846.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1733px) 100vw, 1733px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138687" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Celestia Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</strong></figcaption></figure>

The Relative Strength Index, clocking in at approximately 76.80, is teetering on the edge of the overbought territory. This high RSI reading is a double-edged sword; it could either precede a price correction or, conversely, indicate a strong bullish momentum if the market sentiment continues to rally behind TIA.

Furthermore, TIA&#8217;s price is trading comfortably above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, currently at around $7.911, reinforcing the bullish outlook in the short-term narrative.

Market participants are closely monitoring these indicators as TIA&#8217;s price action challenges the immediate resistance. The current technical posture suggests an optimistic short-term forecast, with the anticipation that TIA could test and potentially break through the $8.50 resistance level.

A successful breach would likely encourage a bullish charge towards the $9 threshold and beyond, possibly reaching towards the psychologically significant $10 mark.

Given the strong technical indicators and market interest, the prognosis for Celestia leans towards a continuation of the bullish trend, with a close eye on the response at critical resistance junctures.

<p>As <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> soars to a striking $39,390, up by a significant 1.50% in the last day, the crypto community is abuzz with anticipation. This remarkable surge forms a crucial part of the broader escalation in the total cryptocurrency market cap, which has now eclipsed the $1.5 trillion milestone.</p>
<p>The spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin&#8217;s next potential feat: breaking the formidable $40,000 resistance. Speculations are rife, with some market enthusiasts, like Arthur Hayes, optimistically expecting December to bring further highs.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, financial experts like Jenny Johnson from Franklin Templeton are delving deep into cryptocurrency investing and exploring the integration of blockchain technology, keeping a close eye on the evolution of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>The question on everyone&#8217;s mind now is whether Bitcoin can sustain this momentum and catapult past $50,000 this week.</p>
<h2>Arthur Hayes Forecasts a December Bull Run for Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMex, is expressing excitement over potentially market-moving developments, jokingly referring to them as &#8216;gifts&#8217; from &#8216;an old white man.&#8217; This is a reference to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s imminent address.</p>
<p>Hayes is expecting a significant move—a rate reduction that could send Bitcoin to all-time highs. Historically, December has been a strong month for Bitcoin, particularly following successful closures in October and November.</p>
<p>Based on a review of Bitcoin&#8217;s quarterly results, Hayes anticipates Powell will soften policy and cut interest rates, fueling hope for a possible change in monetary policy.</p>
<p>According to Hayes, when the &#8216;money printer&#8217; is metaphorically engaged, asset values rise, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Hayes&#8217; audacious forecasts set the stage for an exciting December, with the potential for Bitcoin to skyrocket, creating anticipation and a buzz within the crypto space as the community awaits Powell&#8217;s address.</p>
<p>Investors are closely monitoring whether Powell&#8217;s efforts will indeed push Bitcoin prices up this month.</p>
<h2>Franklin Templeton&#8217;s Jenny Johnson Talks Crypto Investment and ETFs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Jenny Johnson, President and CEO of Franklin Templeton, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/franklin-templeton-jenny-johnson-bitcoin-120000624.html">discussed the company&#8217;s exploration of blockchain technology</a> at the Fortune Global Forum in Abu Dhabi. Following their application for a Bitcoin ETF, Johnson highlighted the significance of blockchain to the company&#8217;s long-term strategies.</p>
<p>She pointed out how blockchain technology could enable fractional ownership of traditionally inaccessible assets and reduce transaction friction, thereby democratizing access to private markets.</p>

<p>Johnson cited tokenized money market funds and smart contracts for real-time value in pooled vehicles as examples of blockchain enhancing efficiency.</p>
<p>She also acknowledged the growing demand for Bitcoin and its potential as an accessible investment option. The discussion included the topic of regulatory approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF.</p>
<p>With increasing institutional interest and acceptance of Bitcoin, this development could impact prices and positively influence market sentiment.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 68, flirting with the overbought territory, yet not conclusively signaling a reversal.</p>
<p>The price positioning above the 50-day EMA reinforces the short-term bullish trend. Observing these indicators, the overall trend leans bullish, and short-term forecasts suggest Bitcoin may test the resistance at $40,082 in the forthcoming sessions.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-138614 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701515080-xrp-cn.jpg" alt="XRP " width="1200" height="678" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701515080-xrp-cn.jpg 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701515080-xrp-cn-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701515080-xrp-cn-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701515080-xrp-cn-768x434.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />

In the dynamic tapestry of the cryptocurrency market, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/">Ripple&#8217;s XRP</a> has painted a streak of resilience, climbing 2% in value amid a broader slump in trading volumes. This modest yet significant rise positions XRP at $0.61399, as of December 2, portraying a market that is cautiously optimistic about its trajectory.

With its technical indicators signaling a potential for continued growth, stakeholders are keenly observing if XRP will sustain its upward trend. The current landscape for XRP suggests a market at a crossroads, watching for signals that could either reinforce the digital asset&#8217;s ascent or herald a shift in momentum.

Let&#8217;s dive into the data and technical indicators to uncover the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-analyst-foresees-major-breakout-soon-is-100-a-realistic-xrp-target-in-2024.htm">XRP price prediction</a>.
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><strong>XRP Price Prediction </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
On the 4-hour chart, XRP is just shy of its pivot point of $0.61971, which serves as the immediate threshold for any bullish endeavor. The asset faces a series of resistance levels at $0.64090, $0.67045, and a more substantial barrier at $0.70182.

Should the market sentiment turn, XRP finds its first line of support at $0.57068, with additional backstops at $0.54209 and $0.52093.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI), hovering around 56.72, leans towards a cautiously optimistic outlook but remains below the overbought threshold, suggesting there is potential for upward movement without immediate saturation.

The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), mapped at $0.59337, lies just below the current trading price, reinforcing a mild bullish inclination.

<figure id="attachment_138622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138622" style="width: 1745px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-138622 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701522685-xrp-december-2.jpg" alt="XRP Price Chart " width="1745" height="957" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701522685-xrp-december-2.jpg 1745w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701522685-xrp-december-2-300x165.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701522685-xrp-december-2-1024x562.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701522685-xrp-december-2-768x421.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701522685-xrp-december-2-1536x842.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1745px) 100vw, 1745px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138622" class="wp-caption-text">XRP Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure>

XRP&#8217;s chart reveals a symmetrical triangle, a pattern known for its continuation characteristic, which indicates a consolidation phase that could precede a significant move in the direction of the prior trend.

The price&#8217;s current proximity to the pivot point, aligned with the RSI and 50 EMA readings, hints at a potential breakout to the upside.

In conclusion, XRP&#8217;s short-term trend appears mildly bullish, assuming it can maintain its position above the 50 EMA and pivot point. In the coming days, market watchers will be keen to see if XRP can muster the momentum to challenge the immediate resistance level at $0.64090.

However, given the often unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets, coupled with the unique legal circumstances surrounding Ripple, investors would be wise to stay attuned to any sudden shifts in market sentiment or regulatory news that could impact this forecast.

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> showcases a bullish stride, currently trading at $38,765 with a commendable increase of nearly 2% on Saturday. As December unfolds, the cryptocurrency market radiates optimism, with Bitcoin edging towards a 19-month peak, reflecting a robust commencement for crypto stocks.</p>
<p>In a significant geopolitical shift, President Petro of Colombia receives Bitcoin amidst the nation&#8217;s exploratory moves to embrace the cryptocurrency. Adding to the fervor, Mike Novogratz&#8217;s bullish stance on Bitcoin amplifies the sentiment, as the total crypto market cap touches a staggering $1.5 trillion.</p>
<p>Investors are now keenly eyeing the $40,000 mark, speculating whether it&#8217;s the next milestone for Bitcoin&#8217;s upward journey.</p>
<h2>December&#8217;s Dynamic Debut: Crypto Stocks Soar as Bitcoin Nears 19-Month High</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As the world’s largest cryptocurrency hits a nearly 19-month high at $38,765, shares of cryptocurrency miners and related companies have surged, reflecting a buoyant market sentiment.</p>
<p>The current uptick, boasting a 1.6% increase for the day, is fueled by the anticipation of a potential approval for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move seen as a catalyst for further capital inflows into the digital asset sector.</p>
<p>Notably, Bitcoin miners Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, and TeraWulf have enjoyed gains between 1.7% and 4%. J.P. Morgan has raised price targets for several mining firms, acknowledging the boost from Bitcoin’s surge.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The rise in cryptocurrency prices, expected to drive transaction volumes and revenue, has propelled Coinbase shares up by 2.5%. Caution remains prudent amidst potential regulatory challenges and new legislation that could impact the industry.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the resignation of the founder of the largest cryptocurrency exchange has not dampened the optimism for ETF approval. The overall positive mood in the market offers some explanation for Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price escalation.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Diplomacy: Colombia&#8217;s President Petro Explores Crypto Adoption</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Colombia&#8217;s foray into the cryptocurrency sphere takes a symbolic leap as <a href="https://bnn.network/finance-nav/cryptocurrency/colombian-president-positive-on-bitcoin-a-step-towards-economic-prosperity/">President Gustavo Petro now holds Bitcoin</a>, underscoring the country&#8217;s exploratory steps towards integrating digital currencies into its economic landscape.</p>
<p>The discussions on leveraging blockchain for public good were enriched by insights from IOVLabs&#8217; Diego Gutierrez-Zaldivar and JAN3&#8217;s Samson Mow, with the latter presenting Bitcoin to President Petro, signaling Colombia&#8217;s openness to the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Deliberations on Bitcoin&#8217;s applications for worker cooperatives and blockchain&#8217;s role in enhancing public services like land restitution and health billing have been at the forefront. While regulatory frameworks evolve, the Financial Superintendency of Colombia probes into policy adjustments.</p>
<p>Amidst these developments, Bitcoin&#8217;s price stands at $38,765, mirroring the market&#8217;s inherent fluctuations.</p>
<p>Colombia positions itself as a proactive player among Latin American nations eyeing digital currencies to bolster national development, possibly influencing Bitcoin&#8217;s current uptick amidst the nation&#8217;s active involvement and the anticipation of regulatory clarity.</p>
<h2>Novogratz&#8217;s Optimism: A Bullish Bitcoin Forecast</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, has cast a highly bullish forecast for Bitcoin, tying its potential price surge to the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-29/galaxy-s-novogratz-sees-bitcoin-btc-reaching-old-highs-with-etf-approval#xj4y7vzkg">Speaking with Bloomberg TV</a>, Novogratz highlighted the market&#8217;s anticipation of this event as a pivotal momentum booster. He pointed to the robust push for Bitcoin adoption by heavyweight financial institutions, including Blackrock, Ark, Fidelity, and his own Galaxy Digital, suggesting that such expectations are already baked into Bitcoin’s current price.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>With a keen eye on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s expected rate cuts and the scarcity of Bitcoin sellers, coupled with the approaching Bitcoin halving event, Novogratz painted a thriving future for Bitcoin amidst global economic uncertainties.</p>
<p>His projection is that a positive shift in market sentiment is on the horizon, potentially catalyzing a substantial rise in BTC prices, especially following the green light for a spot Bitcoin ETF, which is anticipated to usher in a fresh wave of capital into the market.</p>

<p>In the realm of cryptocurrency, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-new-coinshares-report-says-btc-could-hit-140000-if-this-one-thing-happens-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s price action on December 1st offers a textbook case of bullish persistence. The digital currency is currently priced at $38,444, marking a moderate 24-hour movement upwards by 0.14%. This 4-hour chart timeframe places Bitcoin just below a significant pivot point of $38,502, as it navigates through layers of resistance and support.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance stands at $38,832, with further hurdles at $39,259 and a more distant challenge at $39,610. Should the bullish momentum wane, Bitcoin may find support at $38,025, followed by additional safety nets at $37,544 and $37,006.</p>
<p>The technical indicators present a nuanced narrative; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads at 64, suggesting bullish sentiment that is neither overextended into overbought territory nor retreating into bearish realms.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_138609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138609" style="width: 1726px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-138609 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701513389-btc.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart" width="1726" height="956" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701513389-btc.jpg 1726w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701513389-btc-300x166.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701513389-btc-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701513389-btc-768x425.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701513389-btc-1536x851.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1726px) 100vw, 1726px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138609" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In parallel, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) traces at $38,777, with Bitcoin&#8217;s price action hovering just beneath it, potentially indicating a bullish trend on the cusp of confirmation.</p>
<p>Chart patterns reveal an upward channel, indicative of a steadfast buying trend, reinforced by the current RSI level and proximity to the 50 EMA. The emergence of an ascending triangle pattern breakout at the $38,400 level further bolsters the bullish case, signaling an accumulation phase that could foreshadow a rally.</p>
<p>The synthesis of these factors leads to a conclusion that Bitcoin, while currently in a phase of consolidation, maintains a bullish outlook overall. The market appears primed for a test of the immediate resistance at $38,835 in the short term.</p>
<p>Should this level be convincingly breached, the path towards $39,000 appears increasingly likely, with traders and investors alike keenly attuned to the prospect of Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent as the year draws to a close.</p>

As the cryptocurrency world closely watches, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> stands on the brink of a potential breakthrough, with its current price hovering around $38,150. With a substantial 24-hour trading volume of $19.4 billion, Bitcoin has shown a modest but noteworthy increase of nearly 0.50% in the last day.</p>
<p>Dominating the charts as the top-ranked cryptocurrency on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, it boasts a formidable market capitalization of $746 billion. With 19,557,587 BTC coins in circulation against a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins, the stage is set for the so-called &#8216;whales&#8217; to possibly drive the price above the $40,000 threshold.</p>
<p>The question on everyone&#8217;s mind is: Will they succeed?</p>

<p>As the market opens on December 1, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-new-coinshares-report-says-btc-could-hit-140000-if-this-one-thing-happens-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s current position reflects a market in contemplation. Trading at $38,150, the foremost cryptocurrency registers a slight uptick of 0.50%. This minor gain occurs within a broader context, where Bitcoin, while well off its historic highs, still navigates the complexities of market sentiment and regulatory landscapes. The 2-hour chart reveals an upward trend, with Bitcoin recently breaking through the $38,400 resistance level. The pivot point for the session stands firm at $38,402, indicating a battleground where bulls and bears are testing their strength.</p>
<p>The next layers of resistance are poised at $38,464, $39,090, and a more challenging $39,801, which, if breached, could signal a substantial bullish momentum. On the flip side, immediate support levels are identified at $37,620, with further cushions at $36,950 and $36,399. These levels serve as potential springboards for Bitcoin&#8217;s price should it face downward pressure.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI), at a moderate 60.42, leans towards a bullish sentiment but does not venture into overbought territory, suggesting there is room for upward movement without immediate concern for a pullback.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_138378" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138378" style="width: 1732px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-138378 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701435062-image-29.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart - Source: Tradingview" width="1732" height="951" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701435062-image-29.png 1732w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701435062-image-29-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701435062-image-29-1024x562.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701435062-image-29-768x422.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701435062-image-29-1536x843.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1732px) 100vw, 1732px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138378" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Crucially, the price floats above the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $37,576, reinforcing the short-term bullish trend. This metric often serves as a litmus test for the asset&#8217;s momentum, and remaining above this line bolsters the case for continued gains. The observed ascending triangle pattern, particularly the breakout at the $38,400 level, adds credence to the bullish case. This pattern typically indicates accumulation and could presage a testing of higher resistance levels.</p>
<p>Externally, Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory is not solely at the mercy of chart patterns and technical indicators. The cryptocurrency market is finely attuned to regulatory announcements, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic factors. Today, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve, with Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s speech potentially swaying the market. Statements on interest rate policy can have profound implications for risk assets like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall trend for Bitcoin is cautiously bullish, particularly above the $38,400 breakout level. Should the bulls maintain their advantage, the asset is likely to test further resistance at the $39,090 level in the coming days. However, investors should remain vigilant, as the market&#8217;s sentiment can be as volatile as the asset itself, and external economic indicators will play a significant role in shaping the near-term outlook.</p>

This spike is partially fueled by MicroStrategy&#8217;s strategic move to bolster its Bitcoin reserves, involving a substantial $750 million stock offering and a notable $593 million acquisition of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In parallel, the crypto sphere is buzzing with activity as Majority Whip Tom Emmer champions cryptocurrency, calling for enhanced stablecoin monitoring while criticizing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as potential tools for surveillance. Adding to this momentum, Blackrock has proposed a &#8220;Revised In-Kind Model&#8221; for the Spot Bitcoin ETF, a move aimed at addressing the SEC&#8217;s concerns and potentially paving the way for its approval.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s recent actions have injected a renewed sense of optimism in the market, heightening anticipations for the launch of a Spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<h2><strong>MicroStrategy&#8217;s $750 Million Stock Offering and Bitcoin Investment</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-drive-stock-to-two-year-high-heres-the-latest.htm">MicroStrategy</a>, a software analytics firm, has strategically increased its Bitcoin holdings. The company purchased an additional 16,130 bitcoins for $593.3 million, raising its total to 174,530 – a more than 10% increase. Starting in August 2020, under CEO Michael Saylor&#8217;s direction, the company began accumulating Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset. As of November 29, their Bitcoin assets were valued at approximately $6.6 billion. This recent acquisition raised their average purchase price to $30,252. Concurrently, MicroStrategy initiated a $750 million Class A common stock offering with Cowen and Company, aiming to further boost their Bitcoin stakes.</p>

<p>Following this announcement, MicroStrategy&#8217;s shares (NASDAQ:MSTR) experienced a modest decrease of 0.82%. However, the company has already realized a substantial profit of around $900 million on its Bitcoin investments, particularly when prices exceeded the $35K mark. This development positively impacts Bitcoin&#8217;s price today, signaling ongoing institutional interest and investment in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Tom Emmer Advocates for Stablecoin Oversight and Criticizes CBDCs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tom Emmer, the House Majority Whip, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/18/rep-tom-emmer-wants-stablecoins-over-cbdcs-interview/cr">recently spoke at a Blockchain Association policy event</a>, where he voiced his strong opposition to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). As a notable member of the House Financial Services Committee, Emmer has been a vocal advocate for the cryptocurrency industry.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Emmer has been instrumental in pushing forward legislation that prohibits the government from issuing a CBDC. He has also been active in supporting bills that oversee market structures and stablecoins. These efforts culminated in a bill&#8217;s passage by his committee in September. Despite this progress, Emmer&#8217;s resistance to stricter Treasury regulations over stablecoins introduces a level of uncertainty. He perceives such regulations as a potential step towards a &#8220;surveillance security state,&#8221; which might adversely impact the cryptocurrency realm.</p>
<p>The implications of Emmer&#8217;s stance are significant for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market. As they closely monitor regulatory developments, his actions could potentially influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price positively in the current climate.</p>
<h2><strong>Blackrock&#8217;s New Strategy for Spot Bitcoin ETF to Address SEC Concerns</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The world&#8217;s largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently reconvened with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to discuss their application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. To address the SEC&#8217;s concerns, BlackRock proposed a &#8220;revised in-kind&#8221; model, also known as a &#8220;prepay model,&#8221; which aims to mitigate risks and manage balance sheet implications during redemption flows.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blackrock Proposes ‘Revised In-Kind Model’ for Spot Bitcoin ETF to Resolve SEC’s Concerns<a href="https://t.co/wUbmnZ38qR">https://t.co/wUbmnZ38qR</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Morgan (@johnmorganFL) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmorganFL/status/1730415485127139533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The SEC reportedly favors the cash model and has advised exchanges to employ cash-creation strategies for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Despite this, BlackRock continues to advocate for the in-kind creation model, citing benefits such as lower transaction costs and increased resistance to market manipulation.</p>
<p>This move adds to the uncertainty in the regulatory landscape, yet it positively influences today&#8217;s Bitcoin price as market participants closely monitor the SEC&#8217;s stance on various spot Bitcoin ETF applications, anticipating the approval of multiple ETFs in the first half of next year.</p>
<h2><strong>Renewed Optimism for Spot Bitcoin ETF Following SEC Action</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To streamline the licensing process, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated public comment periods for the spot <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/spot-bitcoin-etf-race-some-pioneers-stick-sidelines-2023-11-28/">Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> applications submitted by Franklin Templeton and Hashdex. Franklin Templeton, boasting assets worth $1.5 trillion, filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in October and subsequently revised its application on November 29 to address queries from the SEC. Analyst James Seyffart notes that this move by the SEC sets the stage for potential approvals by the deadline of January 10, 2024.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Historically, the SEC&#8217;s concerns about market manipulation and investor protection have led to the rejection or postponement of ETF proposals. However, a shift in approach post-litigation has resulted in greater collaboration with applicant firms. This evolving strategy has sparked expectations that several applications might be approved concurrently. This anticipation is currently contributing to an uptick in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, as the market looks forward to potential regulatory approvals.</p>

The 4-hour chart demonstrates a stable progression with key resistance and support levels in focus. The pivotal price point for Bitcoin is currently at $37,572, with immediate resistance observed at $38,249. Should the momentum continue, further resistance levels await at $39,070 and $39,801.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at a moderately bullish 59.24, suggesting potential for growth without signaling an overbought scenario. The upward channel pattern visible on the chart supports this bullish sentiment, indicating persistent buying pressure at the lower trend line.</p>
<p>As long as Bitcoin remains above the pivot point, the near-term outlook remains optimistic, with the currency likely to challenge immediate resistance levels. Traders may anticipate a test of the $38,249 resistance, and a consolidation above this could pave the way for an approach towards the $39,070 mark.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> oscillates around the $37,872 mark, down by a marginal 0.20% on Thursday, investors and traders alike are closely monitoring its performance against a backdrop of evolving market dynamics.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the entry of the 13th contender in the Bitcoin ETF race, alongside significant updates from BlackRock in their ETF model.</p>
<p>Amidst these developments, optimism is brewing in the investor community, with many setting their sights on a $40,000 milestone, as indicated by the CME Bitcoin futures. However, looming regulatory concerns, particularly those related to illicit financial activities, pose a potential threat to this ascent.</p>
<p>In this climate, notable voices like Robert Kiyosaki are advocating for investments in Bitcoin ETFs, pointing towards a diversifying landscape in crypto investment strategies.</p>
<h2>Expansion in Bitcoin ETF Arena: 13th Entrant and BlackRock&#8217;s Model Revamp</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Unexpectedly, Swiss asset manager Pando Asset has joined the race for the 13th slot in the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market, competing with notable entities like BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Grayscale. Analysts are scrutinizing Pando&#8217;s late entry, which aims to establish the Pando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust, tracking the price of Bitcoin with Coinbase as the custodian.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s decision date for ARK Invest&#8217;s proposal is set for January 10, aligning with a potential approval wave for spot Bitcoin ETFs, as noted by Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In response to SEC concerns, BlackRock has proposed revising its redemption model to include foreign companies paying U.S. broker-dealers in advance in cash, aiming to mitigate balance sheet impacts.</p>
<p>This unexpected competition and BlackRock&#8217;s initiatives indicate growing momentum and regulatory advancements in the Bitcoin sector, bolstering confidence in the industry.</p>
<h2>Investor Optimism Peaks: $40K Bitcoin Price Target in CME Futures</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The recent developments in the Bitcoin market, as of November 28, present an intriguing scenario. The CME Bitcoin futures have seen a remarkable annualized premium increase to 34%, showcasing institutional investors&#8217; growing optimism about Bitcoin surpassing the $40,000 threshold.</p>
<p>This confidence is underpinned by a significant 125% surge in open interest in CME&#8217;s Bitcoin futures since mid-October, now valued at $1.93 billion. This aligns with speculations about the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite some skepticism regarding asset managers engaging in high-risk derivatives in anticipation of the SEC&#8217;s January decision, the uptick in CME Bitcoin futures open interest is a clear sign of growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Moreover, the annualized premium rising to 23% signals that buyers are prepared to pay a premium for leveraged long positions, a factor that could influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory. As Bitcoin maintains its position around $38,000, the escalating institutional trust hints at favorable prospects ahead.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Warning: US May Tighten Crypto Rules Amid Illicit Money Concerns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of the US Treasury, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-will-be-forced-curtail-crypto-if-industry-fails-act-illicit-finance-threats-2023-11-29/?taid=6567cf56db16620001153793&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">issued a stern warning to cryptocurrency firms</a>, emphasizing the urgency to curb and report illicit financial activities. Speaking at a Blockchain Association event, Adeyemo stressed the importance of combating illegal financing in the crypto space, citing national security concerns.</p>
<p>This statement aligns with the Biden administration&#8217;s call to Congress for enhanced legislative authority to monitor crypto exchanges involved in activities deemed illegal by the U.S. government.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">US will be forced to curtail crypto if industry fails to act on illicit finance threats- official <a href="https://t.co/hjIX3N9E54">https://t.co/hjIX3N9E54</a> <a href="https://t.co/yayc53JH3A">pic.twitter.com/yayc53JH3A</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Reuters (@Reuters) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1730012639638536652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The urgency of this regulatory push was evident in October&#8217;s sanctions targeting a Gaza-based crypto exchange. The resignation of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, following an apology for violating US anti-money laundering laws, further underscores the government&#8217;s resolve in regulating the sector.</p>
<p>This increased regulatory focus, while seeking clarity, could positively impact Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation by bolstering investor confidence in a more controlled and secure cryptocurrency environment.</p>
<h2>Kiyosaki&#8217;s Crypto Strategy: Endorsing Investment in Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-says-bitcoin-is-the-best-protection-against-hyperinflation-heres-why.htm">Robert Kiyosaki</a>, the acclaimed author of &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad,&#8221; is steering investors towards Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid looming concerns of a global economic downturn.</p>
<p>Highlighting the faltering Cardboard Box Index as an indicator of declining consumer goods production, Kiyosaki foresees a significant slump.</p>
<p>He critiques the expected strategy of the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury, involving massive printing of &#8220;fake dollars,&#8221; and advocates for traditional safe havens such as silver and gold.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CARDBOARD BOX INDEX crashing. Shoppers stopped shopping. That means global economy slowing to possible Depression. Treasury wnd Fed to print trillions in fake dollars to replace shoppers. Buy gold, silver, Bitcoin. Gold price rising. Silver still cheap approx $35 an ounce. Or Buy…</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1729656922843095331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, Kiyosaki also positions Bitcoin as a pivotal asset, recommending Bitcoin ETFs for those seeking indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>His endorsement of Bitcoin and its ETFs marks a growing acceptance in the investment landscape and could potentially bolster confidence in Bitcoin, influencing its market value.</p>

<p>In the swiftly evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-new-coinshares-report-says-btc-could-hit-140000-if-this-one-thing-happens-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Bitcoin</a> registers a subtle 0.51% uptick in its valuation, currently positioned at $37,911. This recent increment comes as the digital currency navigates key technical thresholds, with a pivotal point at $37,975, suggesting a potential turning point for its short-term direction.</p>
<p>Resistance levels loom overhead at $38,610, $39,250, and $39,800, serving as critical barriers that could either reinforce the current momentum or halt further advances. Supportive buffers, meanwhile, are established at $36,935, $36,375, and $35,740, ready to underpin and potentially reverse any bearish descent.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.98, floating in the neutral zone but leaning towards a bullish sentiment, as it has not breached the overbought threshold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) exhibits a positive crossover, a harbinger of potential upward movement, adding credence to the current bullish bias.</p>
<p>Observing the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Bitcoin&#8217;s price trades above this level at $37,911, endorsing the short-term bullish trend observed in the market. The chart reveals an ascending channel pattern, suggesting a steady climb, with the price now testing the upper bounds of this trend.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Bitcoin&#8217;s current market behavior is cautiously bullish, with the potential to test higher resistance if the upward channel pattern holds. Traders and investors alike should closely monitor these key technical levels for signs of whether the November ceiling will capitulate to December&#8217;s pressures.</p>
