Yet, one crypto leading the pack in creativity, hype, and long-term potential is Pikamoon.</p>
<p>The project is a deflationary P2E coin with built-in utility and a promising use case. <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/pikamoon/en">Pikamoon</a> is jam-packed with NFT avatars, an open world ready to explore, side quests, tradable in-game assets, and much more.</p>
<p>It is currently undergoing a massively successful presale, having already raised over $4 million, and is now in its final presale stage. This means investors have one last opportunity to buy it at a fixed price before it reaches the open market.</p>
<h2><b>Is Pikamoon the Next Pepe? Here Is What Analysts Think</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pepe experienced an unprecedented bear market run last summer, transforming from an unknown meme coin to a $1.8 billion market cap giant in one month. Yet, Pikamoon delivers a similarly fresh feel and significantly more utility, so could it be the next Pepe?</p>
<p>Analyst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dUaRiotfJb4">WallStreetKing</a> released a video speculating whether Pikamoon is “the next big thing in meme coins.” The analysis noted that Pepe whales are migrating profits into the Pikamoon presale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WjIdGbGrds">The Daily Grind Trader</a> recently called $PIKA a 1000x token, explaining that it is an exciting project with a compelling use case and a strong team.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT6IUPaW5qY&amp;pp=ygUIcGlrYW1vb24%3D">Jacob Bury</a> is also bullish on Pikamoon, initially creating a video at the beginning of its presale stating that it is “packed with potential.” So, while it remains to be seen if Pikamoon will render gains like Pepe and other explosive meme coins, analysts are in consensus that it is undoubtedly a high-potential project.</p>
<h2><b>Anti-Rug Mechanisms Hint at Long-Term Growth</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One of the reasons for Pikamoon’s presale success is the trust and reliability it has established through various “anti-rug” efforts. Essentially, the project aims to eradicate the risk of a rug pull by providing the highest standard of security and transparency.<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-130839 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951247-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-42-pm-1.png" alt="Pikamoon's team" width="1200" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951247-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-42-pm-1.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951247-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-42-pm-1-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951247-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-42-pm-1-1024x410.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951247-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-42-pm-1-768x307.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>It first features a “doxxed” team with a <a href="http://pikamooncoin">YouTube channel</a> showcasing the project&#8217;s behind the scenes. Moreover, Pikamoon was audited by blockchain security firm <a href="https://coinsult.net/projects/pikamoon/">Coin Sniper KYC</a>. According to the audit, the project completed a KYC process, indicating it should be protected from a rug pull.</p>
<p>This is because Coin Sniper KYC states that they have the team’s identities and would file a criminal complaint against them if it carried out a rug pull or scam.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a project that planned a rug pull would not file with a security firm like Coin Sniper KYC, illustrating Pikamoon’s legitimacy and long-term potential.</p>
<h2><b>What is Pikamoon?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With such a successful start to its presale and the backing of numerous prominent analysts, it is evident that the Pikamoon project is doing something new and unique.<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-130851 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951560-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-44-04-pm-1.png" alt="Pikamoon P2E presale" width="1200" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951560-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-44-04-pm-1.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951560-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-44-04-pm-1-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951560-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-44-04-pm-1-1024x410.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951560-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-44-04-pm-1-768x307.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Simply put, it lets users build their own empires, collect NFT-based characters, and use them to rank up. Users can get paid for completing missions, battling their NFTs against others, and more.</p>
<p>Yet, Pikamoon stands out among other P2E projects by focusing on quality gameplay, enticing real gamers rather than P2E reward farmers. Per its whitepaper, Pikamoon should “make the player feel like they’ve picked up a video game for the first time.”</p>
<p>It will feature a single-player and multiplayer mode, with the single-player mode being developed first. It is an open-world game where users can freely explore, battle, buy, upgrade items, and interact with NPC characters. The overarching goal is to defeat the 13th God, an evil entity seeking to reshape the world.</p>
<p>Users can improve their in-game abilities by purchasing items from the marketplace. These purchases require $PIKA tokens, creating steady and predictable demand.</p>
<h2><b>Pikamoon Tokenomics and Presale Information</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As well as being used to interact with the in-game economy, holders can also stake $PIKA for a three, six, or twelve-month lockup period. This will earn them passive rewards while reducing sell pressure on the token.<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-130837 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951242-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-21-pm-1.png" alt="Pikamoon's tokenomics" width="1200" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951242-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-21-pm-1.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951242-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-21-pm-1-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951242-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-21-pm-1-1024x410.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699951242-screenshot-2023-11-14-5-37-21-pm-1-768x307.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>30% of $PIKA tokens have been allocated to the presale, with 32% to the ecosystem development fund, 12.5% to the team and advisors, 10% to staking rewards, 8% to marketing, and 7.5% to liquidity.</p>
<p>There will be a 2.5% transaction tax on sell and transfer orders, with 1% of the transfer going toward marketing, 1% toward the ecosystem development fund, and 0.5% will be burned. However, there is no tax on buy orders.</p>
<p>This incentivizes long-term holding while enabling the sustainable development and growth of the Pikamoon ecosystem. The project’s presale is in its last round, priced at $0.0006. After this round, it will launch on the open market with a launch price of $0.0007.</p>
<p>$PIKA is an ERC-20 token, and users can buy it on the Pikamoon website and using an Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask. The presale accepts payments in ETH. However, with the last round quickly selling out, investors have little time to buy the $PIKA at a discounted price.</p>

A decentralized sphere of like-minded individuals challenging oppressive control through immutable and versatile ERC-20 technology.</p><h2><strong>Presale 50% Discount Ends Soon</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The Doge Uprising project is undergoing a presale, which is great news for early birds because it offers a significant discount. Its current price is $0.000013, but will rise drastically in the next round.</p><p>There are 28.82 billion tokens left until the next stage begins, but with such a low price, these will only last a short time. Following this round, the presale price will increase by 100% to $0.000026.</p><p>With this in mind, it is no surprise that the presale is gathering significant hype, with numerous high-profile media bodies picking up on its potential.</p><p>Doge Uprising&rsquo;s team, led by CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/akira_ethx"><u>Akira</u></a>, has allocated 60% of $DUP tokens to the presale, 20% to exchanges, 5% to marketing, 5% to development, and 10% to airdrops.</p><p>According to its <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>whitepaper</u></a>, tokens allocated to marketing and development will be vested and unlocked over a year-long schedule, ensuring long-term price stability for the project.</p><p>The whitepaper also notes that the meme coin market is showing significant strength, forging perfect timing for an extraordinary uprising.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Doge Uprising Presale</a></div></div><h2><strong>Jam-Packed Ecosystem and Real-World Utility Hints at Massive Growth Potential</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Doge Uprising is more than another Dogecoin copycat, although they generally tend to perform well. The project incorporates a vast ecosystem comprising exclusive fun-filled manga e-comics, NFTs, staking, and has many more developments in the pipeline.</p><p>Its most prized feature is its &ldquo;Doge Mecha&rdquo; NFTs, which act as a key to the Doge Uprising ecosystem. Doge Mecha NFTs show allegiance to the revolutionary conquest inspired by pioneering meme coin figures like Elon Musk. Holders also benefit from special perks and privileges.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126386/333996/doge-uprising.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126386/333996/responsive-images/doge-uprising___media_library_original_1720_850.jpg 1720w, https://cimg.co/news/126386/333996/responsive-images/doge-uprising___media_library_original_1200_593.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/126386/333996/responsive-images/doge-uprising___media_library_original_900_445.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/126386/333996/responsive-images/doge-uprising___media_library_original_720_356.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/126386/333996/responsive-images/doge-uprising___media_library_original_600_297.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/126386/333996/responsive-images/doge-uprising___media_library_original_300_148.jpg 300w" width="1720" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>Additionally, the Doge Uprising manga series provides a perfect entry point into the project&#8217;s compelling story, conveying its mission in a fun and engaging way.</p><p>Doge Uprising also harnesses the power of decentralized finance to provide passive rewards through its staking mechanism. This will encourage active community engagement and increase the demand for $DUP while locking up a significant portion of the available supply.</p><p>Ultimately, these utility efforts are likely a significant driver in its early presale success. While a fun message and stylish artwork get investors in the door, utility and innovation keep the community engaged long-term. Doge Uprising ticks both of these boxes.</p><h2><strong>Future-Centric Roadmap and Community Initiatives For Long-Term Success&nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>With its focus on forging a decentralized resistance against looming threats against humanity, it is only fitting that Doge Uprising has a carefully engineered strategy that serves its community&rsquo;s long-term interest.</p><p>The project will do this through regular Ask Me Anything (AMA) events, airdrops, and competitions to gather an impenetrable alliance of like-minded meme coin degens.</p><p>Furthermore, it aims to foster partnerships with prominent industry players like other cryptocurrencies and NFT projects, influencers, and well-known platforms in a bid to expand its reach and spread the word.</p><p>Its roadmap is split over four stages, each placing a focus on marketing and awareness. This is crucial for the project&rsquo;s long-term success since an expanding community ultimately brings in new demand and will increase the $DUP price.</p><h2><strong>Could Doge Uprising Be the Next Shiba Inu?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Doge Uprising features glaring similarities to Shiba Inu in that it aims to become more than just a meme coin. Both projects feature compelling utility while boasting significant viral potential. However, Shiba Inu has lost momentum recently as its message no longer resonates with the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, Doge Uprising features a relevant and timely message, addressing the crypto community&rsquo;s concerns of socioeconomic tyranny in a jovial manner, which is easy to resonate with.</p><p>With this in mind, the project certainly holds the potential to rival Shiba Inu following its exchange launch. Yet, with its presale price set to 2x shortly, potential investors should not wait around.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://twitter.com/Doge_Uprising"><u>Doge Uprising Twitter</u></a> or <a href="https://t.me/+JfnjZpCD9b4wNTlk"><u>Telegram</u></a> to stay updated on its latest developments.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Doge Uprising Presale</a></div></div><p><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is a new cryptocurrency based on an ingenious Stake-to-Mine mechanism, enabling users to mine Bitcoin simply by staking the $BTCMTX crypto from their Ethereum-compatible wallet. This novel concept provides a no-fuss, zero-cost way to earn Bitcoin and requires no technical knowledge to get started, making it ideal for beginners.</p>
<p>The project has just launched as a presale and has already gotten off to an explosive start, raising over $4.2 million in only a few months. Therefore, it could be looking at a quick sellout as word spreads, hinting at solid upside potential. This <strong>Bitcoin Minetrix price prediction</strong> considers how far this trailblazer could go based on its use case, market trends, tokenomics, and investor sentiment.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Price Prediction Summary</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023: </strong>With a novel use case and scarcity-focused tokenomics, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> could finish strong in 2023. Adding to this, the early presale success could generate a massive buzz around the year&#8217;s end. As such, we predict a price of $0.045 by the end of 2023.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025: </strong>The allure of passive Bitcoin rewards from an Ethereum wallet with zero technical expertise could attract many new investors. If so, BTCMTX could reach $0.11 by the end of 2025.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2030: </strong>Considering the expected growth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Minetrix’s long-term approach to marketing, tokenomics, and strategy, the project could reach highs of $0.17 by the end of 2030.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is a new ERC-20 token that provides users with “mining credits,” non-transferable ERC-20 tokens that they can burn and earn Bitcoin mining power with. This mining power can then be used to mine Bitcoin in the cloud, enabling investors to essentially mine BTC with an ERC-20 token, and there is no technical expertise, upfront cost, or equipment required. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125746/332092/bitcoin-minetrix-platform.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix mining hash power purchase" /></figure>
<p>The $BTCMTX token launched on 26 September 2023. It has a maximum supply of 4 billion tokens, and 42.5% have been allocated to Bitcoin mining, 35% to marketing, 15% to community rewards, and 7.5% to staking rewards. </p>
<p>Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0118 per token in its presale. The presale will consist of 39 stages, going to $0.0148 per token by the final round. According to its <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>, the presale has a soft cap of $15.6 million.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s goal is simple &#8211; provide users with an effortless way to earn Bitcoin mining rewards without technical know-how or upfront cost. Speed and convenience are key to success in the informational and technological age. The Bitcoin Minetrix team understands this and aims to apply it to the over-complicated Bitcoin mining process.</p>
<p>Its future price will tie closely to that of Bitcoin. However, its one-of-a-kind utility and significantly lower market cap provide far more upside potential.</p>
<p>Ultimately, how high Bitcoin Minetrix can go depends on investor sentiment, how many tokens are staked, broader market conditions, and several other factors we will explore soon.</p>
<p>While all investors must conduct their own research, its robust use case means speed is needed for those looking to secure the best possible presale price.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s a quick summary of the Bitcoin Minetrix price history:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bitcoin Mintetrix presale launched on 26 September 2023.</li>
<li>It has a maximum supply of 4 billion tokens.</li>
<li>The current presale price is $0.0118.</li>
<li>Its cutting-edge Stake-to-Mine mechanism enables investors to earn Bitcoin rewards on the Ethereum network.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With presale funds flooding in, Bitcoin Minetrix is already proving to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm"><u>top cryptos to watch </u></a>in 2023.</p>
<p>The project’s main draw is its cutting-edge Stake-to-Mine mechanism, luring investors with passive Bitcoin rewards. Adding to this, market participants understand the value the project provides, which equates to notable upside potential. This is furthered by Bitcoin Minetrix’s current low price.</p>
<p>Since rewards are paid out in mining credits rather than the Bitcoin Minetrix token $BTCMTX, staking will play an important role in reducing the available supply. So, while its supply is limited, it is also important to consider demand drivers. </p>
<p>Considering its compelling use case, Bitcoin Minetrix will likely attract significant demand. This is exemplified by the hype circulating the project, with top analysts like Jacob Bury calling Bitcoin Minetrix the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy now</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>While not without risk, all signs indicate a successful year-end for the Bitcoin Minetrix token. With this in mind, our Bitcoin Minetrix price prediction estimates a price of <strong>$0.045</strong> by the end of 2023. This is a 309% increase from its presale stage one price.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With its groundbreaking use case, we could see new and experienced investors flock to Bitcoin Minetrix in 2025, both as a means of speculation on its future price and as its utility draws them. </p>
<p>This makes Bitcoin Minetrix one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm"><u>best staking coins</u></a> and is cemented by it providing a greener way to mine Bitcoin than traditional mining. This factor could also attract more eco-conscious investors, considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/26/bitcoin-mining-climate-crisis-environmental-impact"><u>Bitcoin&#8217;s pervasive environmental concerns</u></a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, with experts predicting the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/12/22/crypto-bull-market-will-probably-return-by-early-2025-ballet-ceo.html"><u>crypto bull run to return in 2025</u></a>, we will likely see a much more optimistic approach to investing, with investors looking for higher upside potential coins as Bitcoin dominance falls.</p>
<p>In other words, 2025 may see the next altcoin season, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm"><u>emerging cryptos</u></a> like Bitcoin Minetrix enjoying massive liquidity inflows.</p>
<p>Another factor is that traditional Bitcoin cloud mining pools face considerable centralization and security issues. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Minetrix’s decentralized Ethereum-based protocol provides a transparent, secure, and decentralized alternative.</p>
<p>These factors display the impactful value proposition that Bitcoin Minetrix provides, indicating it may see notable new highs. As such, our Bitcoin Minetrix price prediction forecasts a price of <strong>$0.11</strong> by the end of 2025. If correct, this would equal a 900% increase from its current price.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Considering the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1319369/global-blockchain-technology-market-size/"><u>blockchain industry’s predicted growth by 2030</u></a>, projects with a robust use case and strong tokenomics are in an advantageous position to thrive and capture much of the growth.</p>
<p>Considering the security, simplicity, and convenience that Bitcoin Mintetrix adds to Bitcoin mining, we could see it soar in value by 2030. A project with a similar value proposition on Ethereum is Lido DAO, which offers a staking pool that requires little effort to get started.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lido-dao/"><u>LDO token holds a $1.3 billion market cap</u></a>, illustrating the growth potential Bitcoin Minetrix potentially holds.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has allocated 35% of tokens to marketing. When it comes to long-term success, combining a promising use case and marketing is key. Considering such a hefty portion of tokens are earmarked for marketing, this could help attract new users and foster a loyal community.</p>
<p>With this in mind, our Bitcoin Minetrix price prediction estimates a price of <strong>$0.17</strong> by the end of 2030. This would equate to a 1,445% increase from today’s presale price.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Bitcoin Minetrix</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is a Stake-to-Mine cryptocurrency, enabling holders to earn Bitcoin by staking the ERC-20 token in the project’s smart contract. Users have complete control over how long they stake their $BTCMTX for providing a fair and transparent way to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-earn-bitcoin.htm"><u>earn free Bitcoin</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125746/332094/btcmtx-tokenomics.jpg" alt="BTCMTX tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>Since the project is in its presale, its platform is yet to launch. Nevertheless, presale investors can still earn rewards by staking their tokens. However, instead of earning BTC, they can earn $BTCMTX, which they can use to grow their portfolio or sell once the presale ends.</p>
<p>Regarding the project’s future, the team has already issued a roadmap split into three stages. Let’s take a look at them below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presale: </strong>Aims to raise funds for the platform development, secure exchange listings, and run a multimedia marketing campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Development: </strong>The Bitcoin Minetrix app and software will launch, the team will expand, and its product will be developed.</li>
<li><strong>Launch: </strong>The product will go live, enabling holders to earn free Bitcoin seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate goal of the Bitcoin Minetrix platform is to simplify Bitcoin mining while helping secure the Bitcoin network by contributing to its hashing power. Due to the complexity of Bitcoin mining, the Bitcoin Minetrix project has been well received by the crypto community, receiving significant investment and media interest since its recent launch.</p>
<h2><strong>What Influences the Bitcoin Minetrix Price?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are numerous factors affecting the $BTCMTX price. We have explained the most impactful ones below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supply and Demand: </strong>The staking mechanism limiting its supply and a potential significant demand could push the $BTCMTX price. </li>
<li><strong>Popularity and Adoption of Bitcoin: </strong>Due to the advantages that Bitcoin Minetrix provides to Bitcoin mining, growth in popularity or adoption of Bitcoin will trickle down to $BTCMTX, bolstering its price.</li>
<li><strong>Speculation: </strong>Investor sentiment regarding the Bitcoin Minetrix price potential will affect its price. For example, positive sentiment will equate to more demand, helping increase its price.</li>
<li><strong>Broader Market Conditions: </strong>Bitcoin Minetrix will usually follow the general directions of other cryptocurrencies. </li>
<li><strong>Hype and Presale Success: </strong>The presale’s outcome concerning the total raise and hype it generates will influence its price directly after launch. For instance, the Stake-to-Earn Bitcoin alternative <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0xd50c5b8f04587d67298915e099e170af3cd6909a"><u>BTC20</u></a> recently did a 7x following a massively hyped presale.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Buy Bitcoin Minetrix</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Since it is in its presale, the only place to buy $BTCMTX is from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix website</a>. We explain how to do it in ten minutes in the steps below.</p>
<h3><strong>Step One: Create a Software Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Create an Ethereum-compatible software wallet. Most users prefer MetaMask for desktop and Trust Wallet for mobile. We will use MetaMask for desktop during this guide.</p>
<p>Visit the MetaMask website and download the browser extension. After this, create a MetaMask wallet, ensuring you store your seed phrase privately and securely.<img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125746/331993/screenshot-2023-09-29-12-.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step Two: Buy Crypto to Fund Your Investment</strong></h3>
<p>Buy either ETH, USDT, or BNB directly from the MetaMask app with a bank card. Alternatively, buy one of those cryptos on a centralized exchange and transfer it to your wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Three: Visit the Bitcoin Minetrix Website</strong></h3>
<p>Next, visit the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix website</a> and select the Connect Wallet button in the presale box. Then, follow the prompts provided by MetaMask to finish connecting your wallet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135762" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700742115-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-45-33-pm.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix presale" width="900" height="438" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700742115-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-45-33-pm.png 1313w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700742115-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-45-33-pm-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700742115-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-45-33-pm-1024x498.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700742115-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-45-33-pm-768x374.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700742115-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-45-33-pm-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700742115-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-45-33-pm-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700742115-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-45-33-pm-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step Four: Buy $BTCMTX</strong></h3>
<p>Choose the crypto you want to pay with and the amount of $BTCMTX. Then, complete the purchase, authorizing the payment with MetaMask when prompted. You can also stake your tokens at this step to earn a $BTCMTX yield.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Five: Claim Your Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>Your tokens will be stored on the platform until the presale ends. Following the presale, you can visit the Bitcoin Minetrix website and claim them. </p>
<h2><strong>Best Place to Buy Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is still in its presale phase and you can&#8217;t buy it on exchanges at the moment. But if you&#8217;re looking for listed cryptocurrencies, consider Binance. This is the largest crypto exchange in terms of spot and derivatives trading volume, and it has over 160 million users.</p>
<p>Via its launchpad, you can get access to more presale tokens which you can typically earn buy staking other coins like BNB. Over 70 coins have raised more than $100 million on Binance so far, showing huge investor interest.</p>

<p>Binance is also a good option for crypto onboarding. If you don&#8217;t have ETH or USDT to use for the Bitcoin Minetrix presale, you can buy them here. Your payment options include bank transfers and credit cards, but you can also buy crypto via peer-to-peer exchange via Wise, Skrill and Neteller, which come with some of the lowest fees, or you can even use Apple Pay.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to move all your purchased ETH and USDT to buy the Bitcoin Minetrix presale, though. With Binance Earn, you can get up to 8.34% APR on locked USDT and 3% on staked ETH. This may not sound like a lot, but if you plan to hold long term, you&#8217;ll just increase your holdings.</p>
<p>Overall, Binance is the best place to buy cryptocurrencies and it&#8217;s worth checking out.</p>

<p><em>Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Considering its low price, strong use case, and robust tokenomics, Bitcoin Minetrix is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies at the moment. With this in mind, our Bitcoin Minetrix price prediction estimates the price could reach highs of $0.17 by the end of 2030. </p>
<p>However, with the presale price incrementally increasing, investors looking to secure the lowest price must act quickly.</p>

<p>TG.Casino ($TGC) is a new crypto casino offering a convenient and anonymous gambling experience directly from the Telegram social media application. Telegram has over one billion users, and the crypto casino industry is booming. These factors point to significant potential for the project.</p>
<p>So far, the presale has raised over $2.8 million after launching just A few months ago. As such, we expect a quick sell-out, leaving many investors sidelined. This <strong>TG.Casino price prediction</strong> provides our forecasts between 2023 &#8211; 2030, considering tokenomics, utility, trends, and more.</p>
<h2><strong>TG.Casino Price Prediction Summary</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>End of 2023: </strong>With the presale already over 25% sold out, many investors will miss out, leading to significant demand following the exchange launch. Moreover, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino/en">TG.Casino</a> buyback mechanism could further bolster demand while limiting supply, leading to a substantial pump. Therefore, we estimate a price of $0.6 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>End of 2025: </strong>With the Bitcoin halving looming and TG.Casino’s current low market cap, the project holds significant upside potential for 2025. As such, the price of TG.Casino could reach $1 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p><strong>End of 2030: </strong>The anticipated growth of crypto casinos coupled with TG.Casino’s robust tokenomic design, could poise massive long-term growth potential. With this in mind, our TG.Casino price prediction forecasts highs of $1.65 by the end of 2030.</p>
<h2><strong>TG.Casino Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>TG.Casino is a newly launched platform offering an anonymous and convenient way for gamblers to wager bets on hundreds of games and sportsbook events. Its early presale success has made it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-casinos.htm"><u>best Telegram casinos</u></a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136066" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803696-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-10-56-49-am.png" alt="TG.Casino presale" width="900" height="482" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803696-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-10-56-49-am.png 1253w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803696-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-10-56-49-am-300x161.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803696-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-10-56-49-am-1024x548.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803696-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-10-56-49-am-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The presale will take place at a single price of $0.165, with a hard cap of just $1 million. This puts it in a massively short supply, especially considering its strong use case.</p>
<p>Its robust tokenomics and lucrative staking mechanism also hint that $TGC is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm"><u>best cryptos to watch</u></a> in 2023.</p>
<p>40% of $TGC tokens have been allocated to the presale. A further 20% has been earmarked to staking rewards, 20% to exchange liquidity, 10% to player rewards, 5% to affiliates, and 5% to marketing. </p>
<p>The exciting thing about the TG.Casino crypto is that, as well as its robust tokenomics, the platform generates real revenue. This puts the token in an advantageous position against other projects that rely solely on tokenomics to support future development.</p>
<p>TG.Casino boasts several advantages over other online casinos, presenting massive potential once it launches. For example, the platform does not require users to create an account or verify their identity.</p>
<p>The project places a considerable focus on long-term marketing strategy and community participation rewards, attracting more users and bolstering its network effect.</p>
<p>$TGC’s future price will rely on how popular TG.Casino becomes and its supply and demand dynamics, which we will explore shortly.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a brief overview of TG.Casino’s price history:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TG.Casino is a new presale crypto with a $10 million hard cap.</li>
<li>The presale price is $0.165, with 40% of the total supply available.</li>
<li>It implements robust tokenomics on a revenue-generating platform, providing notable growth potential.</li>
<li>The team has allocated a significant portion of tokens to community rewards, promoting active engagement and participation within the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>TG.Casino Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With the presale already in tall order, hype is brewing around the novel concept of an anonymous, KYC-free Telegram casino. The presale allows investors to cash in on this new technology while enjoying substantial rewards.</p>
<p>According to its website, presale investors get exclusive rewards, and those who spend more than $5K on $TGC will be classed as “high rollers,” earning an exclusive NFT and further post-launch rewards.</p>
<p>Adding to this is that it has sold more than 20% of tokens in a couple of days, and it seems inevitable that the TG Casino presale will be over extremely fast. As such, many investors will miss out and have to buy TG.Casino on exchanges after the presale, increasing its price.</p>
<p>Also, we expect the platform’s lucrative staking rewards to drive lots of demand after its exchange launch. Currently, TG.Casino staking offers a 200% annual percentage yield (APY).</p>
<p>Considering this, our TG.Casino price prediction forecasts a price of $0.6 by the end of 2023. If correct, this equates to a 380% increase from its current price.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>TG.Casino Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking ahead to 2025, one of the main price drivers for TG.Casino will be the upcoming Bitcoin halving. This is expected to result in the <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/next-bitcoin-bull-run-not-before-2024-says-top-crypto-exchange-co-founder-12586242.htm"><u>next crypto bull run beginning in 2024</u></a> and continuing through 2025.</p>
<p><br />We can expect considerable new liquidity to enter the crypto markets. TG.Casino’s clear use case and advantages over competition puts it in a favorable position to pump.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its relatively low fully-diluted market cap at launch of just $2.5 million means significant room for growth. To put it into perspective, the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/gambling/"><u>top gambling token by market cap</u></a>, Rollbit, currently sits at a whopping $339 million market cap. This indicates the potential for massive gains, particularly considering the crypto market has struggled significantly in recent months. </p>
<p>Adding to that, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/high-stakes-the-cryptocurrency-casino-king-who-bought-the-most-expensive-house-in-victoria"><u>owner of the popular crypto casino, Stake, recently purchased a mansion</u></a> in Australia for $80 million. While this is an extravagant purchase, it illustrates the profit involved with online casinos, which TG.Casino could use to support the price of the $TGC token and reward its community. </p>
<p>With this in mind, our TG.Casino price prediction forecasts a price of $1 by the end of 2025. This represents a 700% increase from its presale price.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>TG.Casino Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Long-term price predictions can be challenging to make. However, TG.Casino’s robust tokenomics and capitalization on an emerging industry provide a solid insight into where it could be headed in 2030.</p>
<p>Firstly, MarketsandMarkets reports that the <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/blockchain-gaming-market-167926225.html"><u>crypto casino industry will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 70.3%</u></a> between 2023 and 2027.</p>
<p>As such, we can expect the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm"><u>best crypto casinos</u></a>, like TG.Casino, to surge in value.</p>
<p>Adding to this is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/telegram-signal-apps-big-tech.html"><u>users flocking to Telegram</u></a> and other similar sites, choosing encrypted social media services due to their added privacy. This could help TG.Casino capture a significant user base, since it is native to the increasingly popular Telegram app. </p>
<p>Another factor to consider is that TG.Casino’s tokenomics significantly focus on community participation and long-term growth. Moreover, its staking mechanism will reduce the amount of sellable $TGC tokens. It also features a buyback mechanism, repurchasing $TGC using a portion of the platform&#8217;s revenue. 40% will be burned, and 60% will be provided as staking rewards.</p>
<p>Ultimately, TG.Casino’s fundamentals create an environment for stable and long-term price action, making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm"><u>best cryptos to buy</u></a>.</p>
<p>With this in mind, our 2030 TG.Casino price prediction estimates a price of $1.6. If accurate, this would equate to a 1,180% increase from today’s price.</p>

<h2><strong>What is TG.Casino?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>TG.Casino is a new crypto casino built on the Telegram app. It offers encrypted, KYC-free gambling that is anonymous, ensuring users&#8217; privacy and boosting accessibility. </p>
<p>The platform has launched the $TGC token via a presale, enabling investors to get in at a low price. $TGC provides several benefits, including exclusive access to games and rooms, free rewards, and massive staking APY.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125629/331696/screenshot-2023-09-26-11-.jpg" alt="TG Casino token burn mechanics" /></p>
<p>TG.Casino aims to capitalize on the emerging crypto casino trend. Crypto casinos are popular because they are more efficient than traditional online casinos and enhance users&#8217; privacy. However, TG.Casino takes this one step further by launching on Telegram, making it accessible to one billion users worldwide.</p>
<p>Another benefit to Telegram is that since the app is text-based, it uses much less data than web-based crypto casinos.</p>
<p>The platform will enable users to gamble on hundreds of games and sporting events from the simplistic Telegram interface.</p>
<p>However, TG.Casino provides more than just an innovative use case. It features a set of carefully designed tokenomics and a highly anticipated buyback mechanism.</p>
<p>The buyback mechanism will use a portion of the TG.Casino revenue to buy back $TGC tokens. Buying back tokens will increase demand for $TGC, and then 40% will be burned, reducing the total supply. Ultimately, this could greatly benefit its price over time.</p>
<h2><strong>What Influences the TG.Casino Price?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Numerous factors impact the $TGC price. Let’s examine the most prominent ones below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto Casino Industry Growth: </strong>Providing that the crypto casino industry grows as expected, there will be more liquidity within the market, helping to boost the prices of gambling tokens. TG.Casino’s solid fundamentals could see it become one of the best performers. </li>
<li><strong>Tokenomics: </strong>Supply and demand are the core of price movement. One of the most important factors affecting them is tokenomics. TG.Casino’s tokenomics have been designed to minimize supply while bolstering token utility and demand.</li>
<li><strong>Speculation: </strong>Investors&#8217; sentiment will also affect the price of TG.Casino. If the community believes in the project, they may buy more $TGC, increasing its price.</li>
<li><strong>Buyback Mechanism: </strong>The project’s buyback mechanism adds buying pressure and reduces supply by burning tokens, potentially leading to a higher price.</li>
<li><strong>Broader Market Conditions: </strong>TG.Casino will likely align with the rest of the market. This means that it will rise throughout the bull market but also slow down in the next bear market.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation: </strong>A stricter regulatory climate or a regulatory crackdown could push down the $TGC price. However, the project is regulatory compliant and licensed, reducing the likelihood of that occurring.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Buy TG.Casino</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we have provided our predictions and reasoning on where the TG.Casino price could be headed and why, here is a quick guide that explains how to buy TG.Casino in five easy steps.</p>

<p><em>Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>At the cutting edge of crypto casino innovation, TG.Casino’s use of robust tokenomics and the accessibility and privacy of Telegram provide massive potential. Our TG.Casino price prediction estimates it could reach highs of $1.6 by the end of 2030. </p>
<p>Although it could climb higher, our forecast aims to predict sustainable price targets. However, its vast potential has led to an explosive presale, which has already raised more than $2.8 million. Therefore, investors should act fast to secure their $TGC at the best possible price.</p>

<p>The self-proclaimed &#8220;more versatile version of Bitcoin,” BTC20, has hit the crypto scene and made a huge mark. </p>
<p>Its $6 million presale sold out in just two weeks after witnessing a massive investor response, before it launched on Uniswap and made nearly 600% gains.</p>
<p>With millions of tokens locked in its staking pool and high investor confidence, BTC20 could be set for a breakout performance in the next bull run.</p>
<p>This <strong>BTC20 price prediction</strong> looks at what the new project offers and whether it can live up to its potential as a hybrid version of both BTC and ETH. Let&#8217;s begin.</p>
<h2><strong>BTC20 Price Prediction Summarized</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023: </strong>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/btc20/">BTC20 presale</a> took place at $1 per token and sold out in two weeks, before pumping by nearly 600% after it launched on Uniswap. With tokenomics that mirror Bitcoin and improved features such as staking, and higher efficiency, investor confidence remains high. Therefore, our BTC20 price prediction estimates a price of <strong>$3</strong> by the end of 2023.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025: </strong>According to its whitepaper, BTC20 aims to add utility within dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem and explore governance rights. Considering its limited supply and robust staking feature, these future developments could greatly benefit its price. With this in mind, our BTC20 price prediction forecasts a price of <strong>$7.50</strong> by the end of 2025.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2030: </strong>How far BTC20 can go remains to be seen. Still, the project will be 100% community-owned and decentralized, so it has plenty of long-term potential. As such, we forecast the price of BTC20 could reach <strong>$12.50</strong> by the end of 2030. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>BTC20&#8217;s Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>BTC20 launched as a presale on July 17, 2023. For those who have wondered if they <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/should-i-buy-bitcoin.htm">should buy Bitcoin</a>, the BTC20 presale quickly sold out its $6 million hard cap within just two weeks before it was listed for its IEO on Uniswap.</p>
<p>BTC20, which was available at $1, then exploded after launch, reaching a peak price of almost $6 &#8211; a near-600% price increase from the presale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120122/318880/screenshot-2023-07-19-11-.jpg" alt="BTC20 coin stylized" /></p>
<p>Although the price has since settled, investor confidence remains high, as does the potential for huge gains in the next bull run. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btc20.com/en/dashboard">staking dashboard</a>, more than 4 million tokens are locked in the staking pool at the time of writing, around 70% of the circulating supply, indicating that BTC20 holders are viewing the project as a long term hold &#8211; the staking pool is currently offering an estimated annualized yield percentage of 60%.</p>
<p>It aims to build upon the foundations of Bitcoin, making it more accessible, functional and environmentally friendly. BTC20 is an Ethereum ERC-20 token, making it compatible with all other Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin, BTC20 comprises of 21 million tokens. However, just 6.05 million were available in its presale, with the remainder allocated to staking rewards. According to its whitepaper, the staking unlock schedule spans 120 years, making BTC20 a highly scarce asset. </p>
<p>The BTC20 staking feature &#8211; Stake to Earn, enables investors to deposit tokens in the project’s smart contract and receive staking rewards proportional to their share in the staking pool. In other words, the more holders stake, the more they earn.</p>
<p><strong>BTC20 price history key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BTC20 is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token and a BTC clone.</li>
<li>The project&#8217;s $6 million presale launched on 17 July and sold out in just two weeks.</li>
<li>The price reached an all-time high of $5.80 &#8211; nearly 600% gains.</li>
<li>70% of the circulating supply is locked in the staking pool.</li>
<li>The estimated APY is currently 60%.</li>
<li>The remaining tokens are allocated to staking rewards, with a 120-year incremental unlock schedule.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>BTC20 Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>At the time of writing this, BTC20 has a fully diluted market cap of around $26 million and the price is currently $1.20, with the wider crypto market also struggling and September typically an awful month for crypto prices.</p>
<p>However, investor confidence in the long term clearly remains high, with 70% of the circulating supply currently locked in the staking pool.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120122/318883/screenshot-2023-07-19-11-.jpg" alt="BTC20 explained" /></p>
<p>This is a promising sign for BTC20&#8217;s future, showing that investors and media value the project. BTC20 aims to build on the foundations of Bitcoin, solving its most prominent criticisms.</p>
<p>Since BTC20 is built on Ethereum, it is compatible with all of Ethereum’s decentralized applications. This includes DeFi, metaverse, and Play-2-Earn applications. </p>
<p>Moreover, users can buy and manage BTC20 using their MetaMask or other Ethereum wallet.  These two factors make BTC20 much more accessible and versatile for the average crypto user, presenting an easy-to-understand value proposition.</p>
<p>With attractive staking rewards and a long-term lifecycle, BTC20 is a long-term hold available at a discount price. Our BTC20 price prediction forecasts a price of <strong>$3</strong> by the end of 2023, with an uptick in the market expected by the end of the year.</p>
<h2><strong>BTC20 Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>BTC20 has already introduced its stake-to-earn feature and, as outlined above, it is proving to be hugely popular with 70% of the circulating supply locked in it and generating rewards. </p>
<p>Staking is a direct juxtaposition to “mining” rewards on the original Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120122/318882/screenshot-2023-07-19-11-.jpg" alt="BTC20 staking" /><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/"><u>Bitcoin mining has been criticized for its significant energy consumption</u></a>, but staking presents a far more environmentally-friendly solution. Moreover, mining is complex to get started with, and users generally have to pay high upfront costs for expensive mining hardware. </p>
<p>Furthermore, electricity costs associated with mining Bitcoin often make it unprofitable, leading many <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-nordics-energy-idUSKBN1HH13L"><u>miners to move country seeking cheaper energy</u></a>. </p>
<p>On the other hand, BTC20’s stake-to-earn mechanism means users can deposit their BTC20 tokens into the project’s smart contract and receive passive staking rewards &#8211; all without lifting a finger.</p>
<p>This means BTC20 boasts a much simpler rewards process while benefiting from sustainability and Ethereum’s esteemed network security. Although BTC20 builds on top of Bitcoin’s foundations in some ways, it remains true to them in others. </p>
<p>As mentioned, BTC20 features the same 21 million capped token supply as Bitcoin. All tokens are available to the public via staking rewards, making the project will be 100% community-owned and decentralised.</p>
<p>Moreover, holders will likely lock up most of the circulating supply to earn staking rewards. Essentially, BTC20 uses the same scarcity model as Bitcoin. It is well-known that Bitcoin&#8217;s scarcity is one of its primary price drivers, so this could massively boost the BTC20 price.</p>
<p>The next Bitcoin halving, when mining rewards are cut in half, is expected in mid-2024 and is likely to bring with it a bull run and explosion in prices &#8211; some analysts belive BTC will reach six figures.</p>
<p>Considering its advantages over Bitcoin and its similar scarcity-based tokenomics, as well as an expected bull run, our BTC20 price prediction estimates a price of<strong> $7.50</strong> by the end of 2025.</p>
<h2><strong>BTC20 Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Since BTC20 is a newly launched project, how far it can go remains to be seen. However, its ability to generate hype, strong value proposition, staking rewards, and sustainable tokenomics could make it one of the top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm"><u>long-term cryptos</u></a>.</p>
<p>Its large staking pool is already a big indication that those who have invested already consider it a long-term hold.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120122/318884/screenshot-2023-07-19-11-.jpg" alt="BTC20 features" /></p>
<p>According to the project’s whitepaper, the team aims to secure strategic partnerships, add utility with dApps and create governance rights within the BTC20 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Being an Ethereum-based, proof-of-stake token it has significant advantages over the Bitcoin network as it is cheaper, more scalable and more energy efficient &#8211; the possibilities and potential future use cases are endless. </p>
<p>One of the main advantages of BTC20 is that it is native to Ethereum. Currently, investors and Ethereum-based protocols looking for exposure to Bitcoin must utilize wrapped Bitcoin tokens.</p>
<p>This presents a substantial risk, as most wrapped cryptos feature counterparty risk by relying on blockchain bridges. This is the Achilles heel of crypto, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/crypto-bridge-hacks-reach-over-1-billion-in-little-over-a-year"><u>bridges being hacked for $1 billion</u></a> in 2021-2022 alone.</p>
<p>Since BTC20 does not rely on blockchain bridges, investors and dApps may prefer to utilise the token over wrapped Bitcoin for added security. If so, the liquidity entering the project would explode.</p>
<p>Also, with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/embargo-jpmorgan-launches-sustainable-data-solutions-simplify-esg-investments-2023-06-13/"><u>environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) a key priority amongst institutional investors</u></a> in recent years, BTC20’s use of Stake to Earn could make it a preferred “greener” alternative for whales.</p>
<p>The crypto market is currently worth only $1 trillion &#8211; less than Apple&#8217;s market cap ($3 trillion) alone &#8211; and is expected to explode in price by the end of the decade. Many projects will see price increases by many magnitudes of their current standing. With this in mind, our BTC20 price prediction estimates a price of <strong>$12.50</strong> by the end of 2030.</p>

<h2><strong>Potential Lows and Highs of BTC20 Price</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>After a quick presale sell-out and Uniswap Listing, BTC20 has already proved to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm"><u>best staking coins</u></a>. Therefore, the question becomes, how far can it go? We have listed our expected lows and highs below.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is BTC20?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>BTC20 is a Stake to Earn cryptocurrency which aims to be the greener and more versatile of Bitcoin. The project is currently listed on Uniswap after quickly achieving its hard cap goal of $6.05 million. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It features the same 21 million capped supply as Bitcoin. However, some tokens will only see the market in over a century thanks to its 120-year staking rewards unlock schedule.</p>
<p>To earn passive BTC20 rewards, users can stake their BTC20 tokens in the project’s smart contract. This is far more simplistic than Bitcoin’s mining and uses much less energy.</p>
<figure class="media">
<p><iframe title="BTC20 New Stake to Earn Presale - Next 10x Potential Bitcoin Alternative?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xy26n_e2pus?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<br />
<p>Yet in true Bitcoin fashion, all the BTC20 tokens are allocated to the public via staking rewards, making the project 100% community owned and decentralised.</p>
<p>Also, BTC20 is an Ethereum ERC-20 token. Therefore, users can buy and manage it from their Ethereum wallet, like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Moreover, other Ethereum-based dApps can integrate it, providing further utility to BTC20.</p>
<h2><strong>What Factors Influence the BTC20 Price?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>BTC20 has got off to an immense start and became one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm"><u>top ICO projects</u></a> of 2023 after it sold out its $6 million presale in two weeks.</p>
<p>It then went on to make nearly 600% gains after launch and still remains in profit over its presale price, despite the whole market currently struggling. Looking ahead, there are numerous factors which could affect its price. Let’s take a look at them below.</p>
<h3><strong>Hype</strong></h3>
<p>As with all new projects, hype will significantly affect the BTC20 price. However, BTC20 differs from other new projects since it builds on the disadvantages of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin clone, with several significant advantages, more hype will reach the project, especially when the wider market improves.</p>
<h3><strong>Media Interest</strong></h3>
<p>Media interest has been huge since launch and is expected to continue with every pump in price, especially with its generous staking rewards.</p>
<p>Therefore, BTC20 could become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-low-cap-crypto.htm"><u>top low-cap cryptos</u></a> if it continues to gain traction.</p>
<h3><strong>Scarcity and Staking Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>BTC20 has utilized similar tokenomics and scarcity tactics to Bitcoin. These measures often lead to fear of missing out (FOMO).</p>
<p>Staking is now live and around 70% of the circulating supply is currently locked in the staking pool, which is generating an estimated APY of 60%.</p>
<p>Those figures are huge and shows there is huge investor confidence in the long-term viability of the project, as well as rewarding any new stakers way above what other PoS tokens can offer.</p>
<p>Ethereum, Cardano and Solana typically offer staking rewards of between 5% and 10%.</p>
<h3><strong>Integrations and Added Utilities</strong></h3>
<p>Since BTC20 is built on the Ethereum blockchain, there are many possibilities for future developments and integrations for the project. The further utility will inevitably boost the BTC20 demand, causing its price to increase too.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Buy BTC20</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>This section explains <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-btc20.htm">how to buy BTC20</a> on DEXTools in four simple steps.</p>
<h3><strong>Step One &#8211; Set up a Software Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Start by creating a software wallet. We will use MetaMask for this tutorial, but you can use any Ethereum-compatible software wallet.</p>
<p>Visit the wallet provider&#8217;s website or search for it on the App Store, then download it to your device. Follow the wallet set-up instructions to get started, ensuring you store your seed phrase securely.</p>

<h3><strong>Step Two &#8211; Load the Wallet to Fund Your Investment &amp; Go to DEXTools</strong></h3>
<p>Send ETH or USDT from your centralised exchange account to the software wallet, or pay for USDT or ETH on MetaMask directly with your bank card. Then <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd50c5b8f04587d67298915e099e170af3cd6909a">go to DEXTools.io</a> and search for BTC20.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Three &#8211; Connect the Wallet to the BTC20 on DEXTools</strong></h3>
<p>Then, go to the DEXTSWAP tab website and click “Connect Wallet.” Next, follow the prompts provided by MetaMask to finish connecting to the presale.</p>

<h3><strong>Step Four &#8211; Buy and Stake $BTC20 Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>Once your wallet is connected, choose the number of tokens you want to buy and complete the purchase. Tokens can immediately be added to the staking pool to generate rewards, which is currently an estimated 60% APY.</p>

<h3><b>Another Bitcoin Clone Takes the Market by Storm &#8211; Bitcoin ETF Token </b></h3>
<p>If you are looking for an alternative to BTC20, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is a new ERC-20 token that speculates on the imminent release of a Bitcoin Spot ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). A Bitcoin ETF has been pushed by global investment companies such as BlackRock &#8211; in hopes of giving institutional investors simpler access to trade Bitcoin. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1321" height="615" class="aligncenter wp-image-127808" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am.png 1321w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-1024x477.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-768x358.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699338928-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-11-07-09-am-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1321px) 100vw, 1321px" /></p>
<p>Through a Bitcoin ETF, traders can buy and sell BTC without holding the underlying asset. However, a Bitcoin Spot ETF is awaiting the approval of the SEC. Bitcoin ETF Token offers the latest news and updates on this matter. Moreover, this deflationary cryptocurrency will host burning events after achieving 5 milestones &#8211; each linked to real-life Bitcoin events. </p>
<p>For instance, one of Bitcoin ETF Token’s milestones is the approval of the Spot ETF by the SEC. Another is when $BTCETF, the native cryptocurrency, surpasses $100 million in trading volume. Each of the 5 milestones will be followed by a 5% token burning event. Thus, 25% of the total 2.1 billion Bitcoin ETF Token supply will eventually be burned. </p>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin ETF Token charges a 5% burn tax, which will reduce by 1% as each milestone is crossed. Boasting huge growth potential, Bitcoin ETF Token also offers staking benefits through its verified smart contract. </p>

<p>Investors can stake $BTCETF and earn annual yields in excess of 5,800%. Thus giving investors great returns for simply holding the token. Interested investors can buy $BTCETF for just $0.005 on the first presale round, before the price increases. By the tenth and final presale round, $BTCETF will be priced at $0.0068 &#8211; a 36% jump. </p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token presale has set a hard cap target of $4.956 million. In just over 24 hours, the presale has raised over $32K.

<h2><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>BTC20 got off to an extremely strong start, selling out its $6 million presale in just two weeks before pumping by almost 600% once it reached exchanges.</p>
<p>While the price has settled, with the crypto markets historically suffering in Septemebr, it is still in profit from its presale price of $1 and investor confidence remains high.</p>
<p>More than 4 million tokens are currently locked in the staking pool &#8211; 70% of the circulating supply &#8211; and generating an estimated APY of 60%.</p>
<p>BTC20 has a fully diluted market cap of $25 million and looks like it could explode in price when market conditions improve.</p>

As such, several projects have made significant progress in creating faster and more functional layer 2 networks.</p><p>This article looks at the <strong>best layer 2 blockchain tokens</strong> with the most potential in 2023. We consider factors like tokenomics, network activity, market cap, technology and more.</p><h2><strong>The Best Layer 2 Coins to Buy Now</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>If you are stretched on time, here is the TL;DR of the best layer 2 blockchain tokens.</p><ol><li><strong>Arbitrum </strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong>A prevalent chain generating over $100K in revenue daily with over 120K daily active users. Its native token (ARB) was released in March 2023 and is the governance token for the network. Currently, the project sits at a $1.2 billion market cap.</li><li><strong>Polygon </strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong>The most prominent Ethereum layer two scaling solution, benefiting from the network effect with over $1.17 billion total value locked (TVL) and 350K daily active users. Polygon has recently launched a second chain, Polygon zkEVM, boasting cutting-edge security. Its native token (MATIC) has a $5.3 billion market cap.</li><li><strong>Immutable X </strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong>Designed to provide infrastructure for &ldquo;the future of gaming&rdquo;. Currently, the project has a $28.9 million TVL with a $662.05 million market cap. One of its newest features is a seamless and automated wallet creation tool, aiming onboard the masses to crypto gaming.</li><li><strong>dYdX </strong>&#8211; A perpetual exchange with its own Ethereum layer 2 blockchain to bolster scalability and facilitate endless new use cases. StarkWare powers the platform to ensure quick withdrawals, decentralisation and cryptographic guarantees thanks to its STARK proofs.</li><li><strong>Loopring </strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong>A well-established blockchain leveraging zkRollup technology to ensure greater security and decentralization. It currently has $75 million TVL and a $229 million market cap. According to its website, its newest iteration can compute up to 2,025 transactions per second (TPS).</li><li><strong>Shiba Inu&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; Meme coin turned DeFi ecosystem Shiba Inu has recently launched its Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, Shibarium. Shiba Inu has a vast community comprising 10 million holders. As a result, its new L2 may fare in high demand, bolstering the SHIB price.</li><li><strong>Optimism</strong> &#8211;<strong> </strong>With over 100K daily active users and $200K in daily revenue, Optimism has been a top performer lately. The project has attracted some of the industry&rsquo;s most prominent protocols, such as ChatGTP Co-Founder Sam Altman&rsquo;s Worldcoin and Coinbase&rsquo;s newly launched layer 2 Base Protocol.</li><li><strong>Mantle </strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong>A highly decentralized layer 2 that uses $MNT as its governance token. It cuts transaction costs by up to 80% by batching transactions and separating its data availability layer from Ethereum roll-ups. As a result, Mantle describes itself as &ldquo;hyper scalable&rdquo;, hypothetically capable of processing 600 TPS.</li></ol><p>The first six of these coins are all available to buy on the popular crypto broker <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro">eToro</a>.</p><h2><strong>Analyzing the Best Layer 2 Tokens</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Now that we have provided our layer 2 tokens list, let&rsquo;s dive deeper into each token, what makes them unique and what gives them such potential.</p><h3><strong>1. Arbitrum &#8211; Popular Chain Generating Over $100K in Daily Revenue With 120K Daily Users and $1.2 Billion Market Cap</strong></h3><p>Abrtirum is a top-rated layer-two scaling solution, currently second only to Polygon by market cap. However, Arbitrum sits top of our list of best layer 2 blockchain tokens due to its network activity to market cap ratio.<img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/122826/325016/arb-1.jpg" alt="best layer 2 blockchain tokens" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122826/325016/responsive-images/arb-1___media_library_original_877_480.jpg 877w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325016/responsive-images/arb-1___media_library_original_720_394.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325016/responsive-images/arb-1___media_library_original_600_328.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325016/responsive-images/arb-1___media_library_original_300_164.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="877" class="content-img"></p><p>Since its launch in March 2021, Arbitrum has become one of the most used Ethereum layer two rollups. There are 435 <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Arbitrum"><u>protocols active on the Arbtirum chain</u></a>, 120K daily active users, a $2.8 billion TVL and a whopping $1.5 billion in locked stablecoins.&nbsp;</p><p>This is significant, considering the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arbitrum/"><u>Arbitrum token&rsquo;s market cap</u></a> is just $1.29 billion. Furthermore, the platform has generated over $120K in revenue in the last 24 hours.</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/analysis/bitcoin-bull-run-coming-macro-on-chain-conditions-line-up/"><u>crypto bull run expected to occur soon</u></a>, much of the stablecoin value on the network may trickle into $ARB as investors gain confidence in the market&#8217;s direction.</p><p>On top of the deep liquidity, low transaction fees, and a vast ecosystem comprising hundreds of dApps, one of Arbitrum&rsquo;s main draws is its trailblazing GMX protocol. This is one of the first decentralised perpetual exchanges enabling users to trade with leverage using a non-custodial exchange.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/122826/325030/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-.jpg" alt="best layer 2 blockchain tokens" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122826/325030/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_1122_480.jpg 1122w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325030/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_900_385.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325030/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_720_308.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325030/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_600_257.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325030/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_300_128.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1122" class="content-img">GMX exploded in popularity amid the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darreonnadavis/2023/06/02/what-happened-to-ftx-the-crypto-exchange-funds-collapse-explained/"><u>collapse of FTX</u></a>, where significant amounts of retail and institutional funds were lost due to irresponsible fund custodians.</p><p>To process transactions, Arbitrum utilises optimistic rollup technology for reporting to the Ethereum mainnet. This facilitates transactions for minimal fees and increases transparency but comes at a trade-off of delayed transaction finality and increased centralisation compared to zkRollups.</p><p>Looking at Arbitrum&#8217;s tokenomics, one thing to be aware of is that only 12.5% of its tokens are circulating. The token will follow a monthly unlock beginning in March 2024 and ending in 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>This could impact the price of Arbitrum, but it is also worth noting that 43% of tokens are in the Arbtrum treasury, which the Arbitrum DAO controls. Essentially, these tokens will only be sold if the community feels it will benefit the ecosystem in the long term.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy ARB on eToro</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Polygon &#8211; The Most Prominent Layer 2 With Over 350K daily active users and Polygon zkEVM, a Cutting-edge zkRollup</strong></h3><p>Polygon is the number one Ethereum layer two blockchains by many metrics. It has 350K daily active users &#8211; even higher than Ethereum&rsquo;s with just over 300K. On top of that, it has 465 protocols and a $1.19 billion TVL with $1.2 billion in stablecoins. <img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/122826/325017/polygon-1.jpg" alt="best layer 2 blockchain tokens" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122826/325017/responsive-images/polygon-1___media_library_original_877_480.jpg 877w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325017/responsive-images/polygon-1___media_library_original_720_394.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325017/responsive-images/polygon-1___media_library_original_600_328.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325017/responsive-images/polygon-1___media_library_original_300_164.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="877" class="content-img"></p><p>As such, Polygon benefits from a network effect, where the amount of users, liquidity, and protocols helps further benefit the network, enabling low-term growth. This is because the factors mentioned above will generally attract more investments and developers, which help advance the ecosystem even more.</p><p>One of the exciting things about Polygon is that it has attracted significant enterprise adoption from the likes of Starbucks, Nike and Reddit.</p><p>In recent months, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/27/polygon-zkevm-mainnet-beta-goes-live-ethereums-buterin-to-process-first-transaction/"><u>Polygon launched its Polygon zkEVM</u></a>, the first Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) compatible zkRollup to integrate smart contracts and developer tools.</p><p>zkRollups are a novel technology providing near-instant finality, more decentralisation and use less data on the layer 1 chain than optimistic rollups.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/122826/325029/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-.jpg" alt="best layer 2 blockchain tokens" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122826/325029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_1070_480.jpg 1070w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_900_404.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_720_323.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_600_269.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122826/325029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-19-12-___media_library_original_300_135.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1070" class="content-img"></p><p>However, they are more challenging to implement than optimistic rollups. Polygon&rsquo;s zkEVM is currently running and functional, with many dApps already deployed on the network, like Quickswap and Balancer.&nbsp;</p><p>This shows that the Polygon ecosystem is at the forefront of crypto innovation, and its native token, $MATIC, could have a bright future.</p><p>Polygon has a $5.4 billion market cap, with 93.1% of tokens circulating. As a result, Polygon is less likely to experience strong sell pressure compared to newer layer two projects.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy MATIC on eToro</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.

This provides the project with a significant runway to fund future ecosystem development, and it has already launched a grant program to stimulate its growth.</p><h2><strong>What is Blockchain Layer 2?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Simply put, a layer 2 blockchain is a network which processes transactions off a layer 1 chain to help improve scalability.</p><p>There are numerous types of layer twos, such as rollups, sidechains, state/payment channels, plasma chains and validiums. However, the most common types of layer 2s on Ethereum are rollups and sidechains.</p><p>Regarding Bitcoin, the main layer two is Lightning Network, a payment channel that enables users to set up two-way paper-to-peer microchannels.</p><p>However, we will stick to Ethereum layer 2&rsquo;s for now, as this is where the most opportunities lie regarding layer two coins to buy.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at the most common types of Ethereum layer 2s and how they work.</p><h3><strong>Rollup Layer 2s</strong></h3><p>There are two types of rollups, optimistic rollups and zero knowledge rollups (zkRollups). While they have differences in centralisation, finality and data storage, their basic principle works similarly.</p><p>The rollups bundle hundreds of separate transactions and report them to the layer 1 in a single transaction. As such, the fees accrued only amount to one transaction, making transacting on a rollup a fraction of the cost of on a layer 1.</p><p>While rollup transactions are computed on a separate blockchain, they are reported to and stored on the main chain for finality. As a result, rollups are guaranteed the same security as the main chain because altering a final transaction on the rollup chain would also mean changing the transaction on the main chain.</p><p>Many new rollup layer 2s have emerged recently, with some of the most popular being Arbitrum, Optimism and StarkWare. However, legacy layer 2s like Polygon and Loopring have also transitioned to rollups.</p><h3><strong>Sidechains</strong></h3><p>Sidechains work differently from rollups in that they maintain their own network state using their own consensus mechanism. As such, they do not benefit from layer one security the same way rollups do, but this comes with the advantage of not storing data on the layer 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of reporting transactions to the layer 1, sidechains run in parallel with the layer one, using bridges to transfer assets between the chains. Sidechains are becoming less used as the emergence of rollups grows.</p><p>The most well-known sidechain is Polygon, although, as we discussed earlier, it has recently launched a zkRollup chain, zkEVM.</p><h2><strong>Blockchain Layer 1 vs Layer 2</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Blockchain layer 1 vs layer 2 is a broad topic with much to discuss. However, we will keep it simple by focusing on the benefits of an alternative layer 1 (an Ethereum competitor) compared to the benefits of launching as a layer 2 blockchain.</p><p>The first consideration is the network effect. A project which launches as a layer 2 already has access to a thriving ecosystem with an established network effect. As a result, there are already dApps, users and liquidity, which the layer 2 can tap into. On the other hand, layer 1s generally have to build from the ground up.</p><p>On top of that, layer 1 blockchains are eager to attract new layer 2s to help with scalability and strengthen the ecosystem. As a result, layer 2s can often receive grants and expert assistance developing, testing and launching their blockchain.</p><p>However, one of the main issues for layer 2s is the lack of flexibility compared to launching a layer 1 chain. With a layer 1 chain (such as Cardano), the developers can be as innovative and experimental as they like.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Cardano has taken years and billions of dollars to build and has yet to reach its expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, layer 2 chains are often more straightforward to create, offering an established network effect comprising developers, users and liquidity. Therefore, layer 2 token prices could potentially explode much faster.</p><h2><strong>Why Invest in Layer 2 Blockchain Coins?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As we saw with the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/"><u>Polygon MATIC price</u></a> in the last bull run, helping solve the scalability issue in crypto can be a very lucrative use case. With that in mind, here are the reasons to buy layer 2 coins.</p><h3><strong>Upcoming Bull Market</strong></h3><p>With the Bitcoin halving set to occur in April 2024, many analysts forecast that the next crypto bull run is set to commence soon. Gas fees on Ethereum often reach exorbitant prices during the peak of the bull run, forcing many users to seek cheaper means of transacting.</p><p>As a result, layer 2s are in an advantageous position to capture much of the upcoming bull run liquidity, potentially leading to higher layer 2 blockchain coins&rsquo; prices.</p><h3><strong>Ethereum Has Long-term Layer 2 Plans</strong></h3><p>According to the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/"><u>Ethereum website, Danksharding</u></a>, a planned upgrade, seeks to facilitate even cheaper rollup transactions by reducing the data they need to store on the main Ethereum chain.</p><p>In turn, this will provide much more potential to the capabilities and use cases of layer 2s and help increase their prices.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&ldquo;Pick-and-Shovel&rdquo; Strategy</strong></h3><p>Pick-and-Shovel investing refers to buying an asset that provides tools or infrastructure rather than investing in a product itself. The benefit is that it offers a more diverse approach since it inadvertently includes exposure to all the products (or, in this case, dApps) that use it.</p><p>By buying a layer 2, investors gain exposure to all the dApps built upon the network, presenting a great way to diversify further. Furthermore, projects like Immutable X, designed specifically for NFTs and gaming, could prove an efficient way to diversify into those sectors.</p><h3><strong>High Upside Potential</strong></h3><p>While Bitcoin and Ethereum sit at market caps well over $100 billion, the largest layer 2 by market cap is Polygon, which is at just over $5 billion. Furthermore, many layer 2&rsquo;s on our list have less than $1 billion market caps.&nbsp;</p><p>Although they could present a higher risk, low market cap layer 2s could provide vastly more upside potential than well-established coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p><h2><strong>How to Decide Which Layer 2 Blockchain Tokens to Invest in</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Deciding which layer 2 to invest in can be overwhelming. However, we have broken down the main things worth considering below.</p><h3><strong>Market Cap</strong></h3><p>As with any asset class, market cap plays an impactful role in the potential of a crypto. Each project has a ceiling based on the market&#8217;s liquidity and the individual project&#8217;s importance.</p><p>Therefore, understanding a project&#8217;s significance and comparing it to its market cap is a great way to decide which tokens are best to buy.</p><h3><strong>Network Effect</strong></h3><p>The best way to determine a project&rsquo;s significance is to understand its network effect. This comes down to considering factors like its daily active users, daily revenue, number of protocols (and success of protocols), number of developers and total value locked on the chain.</p><p>A chain that scores high for each but has a relatively low market cap may fare a better investment.</p><h3><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3><p>It is also essential to consider tokenomics. Factors like the level of utility that the token provides, the circulating supply and the vesting schedule all play a significant role in the success of a project.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Layer 2s are some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm"><u>most high-potential cryptos</u></a> on the market today. However, after thoroughly examining the eight best layer 2 blockchain tokens, we found that Arbitrum could be the best layer 2 on the market today.</p><p>It benefits from a strong network effect with 435 dApps and over 120K daily active users. Furthermore, its market cap is around $1 billion, significantly less than our next top pick, Polygon. With that in mind, visit eToro to purchase Arbitrum today before the next bull run.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy ARB on eToro</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://www.ccn.com/analysis/bitcoin-bull-run-coming-macro-on-chain-conditions-line-up/">https://www.ccn.com/analysis/bitcoin-bull-run-coming-macro-on-chain-conditions-line-up/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darreonnadavis/2023/06/02/what-happened-to-ftx-the-crypto-exchange-funds-collapse-explained/"><u>https://www.forbes.com/sites/darreonnadavis/2023/06/02/what-happened-to-ftx-the-crypto-exchange-funds-collapse-explained/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/27/polygon-zkevm-mainnet-beta-goes-live-ethereums-buterin-to-process-first-transaction/"><u>https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/27/polygon-zkevm-mainnet-beta-goes-live-ethereums-buterin-to-process-first-transaction/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/blockchain-gaming-market-167926225.html"><u>https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/blockchain-gaming-market-167926225.html</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/16/shiba-inus-ethereum-layer-2-blockchain-shibarium-goes-live-amid-push-for-defi-growth/"><u>https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/16/shiba-inus-ethereum-layer-2-blockchain-shibarium-goes-live-amid-push-for-defi-growth/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-sam-altman-launches-worldcoin-crypto-project-2023-07-24/"><u>https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-sam-altman-launches-worldcoin-crypto-project-2023-07-24/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-only-big-tech-firm-102733879.html"><u>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-only-big-tech-firm-102733879.html</u></a></p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>What are the layer 2 blockchains?</strong></p><p>There are countless layer 2 blockchains spanning multiple blockchains, including Ethereum and Bitcoin.

<h2><strong>Pepe 2.0 Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Pepe 2.0 launched on 27 June with an opening price of $0.00000000001394. The project was one of the first to kickstart the infamous 2.0 copycat trend, where developers would create unaffiliated “2.0” versions of coins, aiming to fix the shortfalls of the original project.</p>
<p>Investors could easily resonate with these coins, often causing their prices to explode quickly.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x076a3e1500f3110d8f4445d396a3d7ca6d0ca269">Pepe 2.0 price</a> exploded after its launch, reaching $0.0000001076 on 29 June. Subsequently, the price pulled back to $0.00000001946 on 2 July, followed by an explosive bounce to its $0.0000002219 ATH on 7 July.</p>
<p>However, the price has continued trending downward since, currently priced at $0.00000003907, down 81% from its ATH, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>The Pepe 2.0 price chart below shows that the price is currently trending towards its 2 July support level of $0.00000001946.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120243/319215/screenshot-2023-07-20-2-3.jpg" alt="PEPE2.0 to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Currently, the project holds a $16.6 million market cap, with a $7.8 million 24-hour trading volume and 12.68K holders.</p>
<h2><strong>Pepe 2.0 Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>After a sustained sell-off starting on 9 July, Pepe 2.0 has only seen one green daily candle. This illustrates lots of bearish momentum, which may be challenging to recover from, considering the project’s lack of price history.<img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120243/319218/screenshot-2023-07-21-11-.jpg" alt="Pepe 2.0 crypto project" /></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Pepe 2.0 still boasts a community of over 12K holders, with <a href="https://twitter.com/pepe2coineth"><u>26K Twitter</u></a> followers and <a href="https://t.me/Pepe2Portal"><u>12K Telegram subscribers</u></a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, Pepe 2.0&#8217;s Twitter is thriving, with its team regularly posting memes receiving hundreds of likes and retweets.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In my zone <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PEPE2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PEPE2</a> <a href="https://t.co/ifcMjhFG0C">pic.twitter.com/ifcMjhFG0C</a></p>&mdash; Pepe 2.0 #PEPE2 (@pepe2coineth) <a href="https://twitter.com/pepe2coineth/status/1681811762859974657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>One of the reasons for Pepe 2.0’s early success was that tier-one exchanges like KuCoin near-instantly picked it up following its launch. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/new-york-sues-kucoin-expands-cryptocurrency-crackdown-2023-03-09/"><u>KuCoin was recently sued by New York</u></a> amid the crypto crackdown, so listing in Pepe 2.0 under those challenging circumstances shows significant confidence and support.</p>
<p>The KuCoin and other exchange listings of Pepe 2.0 added legitimacy to the project, evident in its 24-hour trading volume of $7.8 million. This is a whopping 47.54% of its market cap, displaying that interest in the project remains high.</p>
<p>With this in mind, our Pepe 2.0 price prediction estimates the price will pull back to the 2 July support before bouncing. As such, we expect possible lows of $0.00000002, highs of $0.00000008, and an average price of <strong>$0.00000005</strong> by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>That said, it is crucial to consider that the $0.00000002118 support level must not be broken. If it is, it becomes improbable that the price will recover.</p>

<h2><strong>Pepe 2.0 Price Prediction 2024</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>According to its website, Pepe 2.0 is taking everything investors loved about Pepe and “catapulting it into a new dimension of excitement”.<img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120243/319217/screenshot-2023-07-21-11-.jpg" alt="Pepe 2.0 meme coin project" /></p>
<p>It remains to be seen what the team means by this since there is no formal roadmap. However, they have announced a “profile pic” NFT collection. Although <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/nft-prices-slump-as-popular-collection-tumbles-following-debut"><u>NFT prices have collapsed recently</u></a>, this development at least shows that the Pepe 2.0 team aims to add extra value to the project.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/standard-chartered-bumps-up-bitcoin-forecast-120000-2023-07-10/"><u>Standard Charted recently upped its Bitcoin price prediction to $120K</u></a> by the end of 2024. If this occurs, it would inevitably cause altcoins to rally too.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Pepe 2.0 must retain its community to benefit from the pump.</p>
<p>Further exchange listings would be one of the best ways to retain and grow its community through 2024. The KuCoin listing was one of the leading price drivers, but as we saw when <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepe-coin-price-explodes-binance-212503385.html"><u>Pepe pumped to its ATH</u></a>, listings from Binance or possibly Coinbase can draw billions in liquidity.</p>
<p>Pepe 2.0’s future is highly speculative since it is still new. However, its community’s continued support tells us it has the potential to succeed in 2024.</p>
<p>With that in mind, our Pepe 2.0 price prediction forecasts possible lows of $0.00000005, highs of $0.00000001, and an average price of <strong>$0.000000075</strong> by the end of 2024.</p>
<h2><strong>Pepe 2.0 Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Despite its catchy slogan of adding &#8220;cutting-edge advancements and awe-inspiring innovations&#8221;, Pepe 2.0’s primary focus, like Pepe’s, is on memes and humour. While not necessarily bad, it reduces the project’s chances of long-term success.</p>
<p>Since its launch, the team has remained very quiet on the project’s future, instead simply releasing cryptic social media posts to build anticipation and excitement. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the price has continued to decline. </p>
<p>While Pepe 2.0 could make a short-term recovery between 2023-2024, it is unlikely to succeed long term based on the current data available.</p>
<p>That said, long-term success is not impossible for Pepe 2.0. Its community is still strong, and a bullish event could ignite a considerable bull run. This is exemplified in the project being ranked ten across all meme coins by 24-hour trading volume on CoinMarketCap.<img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120243/319216/screenshot-2023-07-20-4-2.jpg" alt="List of crypto coins on coinmarketcap" /></p>
<p>Its volume is just $1.6 million less than Shiba Inu’s BONE, which has a market cap of $297 million.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the likelihood remains that Pepe 2.0 will not maintain its community&#8217;s interest in 2025.</p>
<p>Therefore, our 2025 Pepe 2.0 price prediction forecasts lows of $0.00000003, highs of $0.00000006, and an average price of <strong>$0.000000045</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Pepe 2.0 Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55939854"><u>Dogecoin’s epic 2021 bull run</u></a> proved that meme coins can have long-term potential, this is usually only the case in exceptional circumstances. </p>
<p>To attain success long-term, Pepe 2.0 would need to develop a robust ecosystem, secure partnerships, or receive support from high-profile meme coin fans like Elon Musk.</p>
<p>It seems like Pepe 2.0 may be aiming to build an ecosystem. However, with an already struggling price, it is unlikely to be able to fund this endeavour long-term.</p>
<p>That said, as Shiba Inu has generally performed well alongside Dogecoin, the same may occur for Pepe 2.0 with Pepe. This ultimately depends on whether Pepe 2.0 can grow and establish itself enough that people associate one with the other.</p>
<p>Considering this, our Pepe 2.0 price prediction estimates lows of $0.00000001, highs of $0.00000005, and an average price of <strong>$0.00000003</strong> by the end of 2030. </p>
<h2><strong>Potential Lows and Highs of Pepe 2.0</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Despite community interest and impressive trading volume, it seems unlikely that Pepe 2.0 can become a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm"><u>long-term crypto</u></a>. That said, there is still some upside potential in the near term. We have summarised our predictions below.</p>

The question is, can it make a recovery? We have compiled predictions from other analysts below to answer the question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pepe 2.0 is a meme coin inspired by the popular Pepe coin. It aims to build where Pepe left off and has already been listed on the tier-one exchange KuCoin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, since its ATH, the project has yet to progress. There have not been any announcements regarding ecosystem developments, and no more high-profile exchanges have listed the project.</p>
<p>The project is currently following a similar path to Pepe, building community via Twitter and Telegram by posting memes and running “social media raids”.</p>

<h2><strong>What Factors Affect the Pepe 2.0 Price</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Meme coins are often the most volatile category of cryptocurrencies. The community-driven nature combined with broader market fear of missing out often leads to drastic increases in price in short periods.</p>
<p>However, on the flip side, the lack of utility and reliance on hype to drive prices can mean that price increases are brief, sometimes resulting in strong and fast sell-offs.</p>
<p>Looking at Pepe 2.0 specifically, its relation to the original Pepe coin could cause it to rise and fall as Pepe’s price does.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Pepe 2.0 has an NFT collection in the making. The lead-up to its release could cause the price to rise, but such developments often turn out to be “sell the news events”.</p>
<p>Finally, while unlikely due to its falling price, new tier-one exchange listings on Binance or Coinbase would inevitably cause the Pepe 2.0 price to surge.</p>
<h2><strong>Is Pepe 2.0 Worth Buying?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although our Pepe 2.0 price forecast has identified upside potential for the crypto, there is also lots of downside risk. As mentioned, Pepe 2.0s price is based on hype rather than utility or intrinsic value. </p>
<p>Consequently, many of these coins become less attractive over time as meme coin degens seek the next pump. Furthermore, as Pepe 2.0 already has a $16 million market cap, the realistic upside potential is limited compared to a newer, more exciting project &#8211; such as Evil Pepe.</p>
<h2><strong>Evil Pepe Coin &#8211; A Better Alternative to Pepe 2.0?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While Pepe 2.0 may have already reached its price potential, a new meme coin is rising and taking the market by storm. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/evilpepe/">Evil Pepe Coin</a> is the “evil twin” to Pepe, based on humor and “shitcoins”.<img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/120243/319214/screenshot-2023-07-21-11-.jpg" alt="Evil Pepe token presale page" /></p>
<p>Having only launched two days ago, the presale has gotten off to a fiery start, raising $159K.</p>
<p>The project is in its presale, priced at $0.000333 and accepts payments in ETH, BNB, USDT, and cards. Evil Pepe Coin will have a $1,996,002 starting market cap following its presale. As such, there is room for an 8x just to get to Pepe 2.0&#8217;s current market cap.</p>
<p>90% of the $EVILPEPE tokens are available at presale, making it a community-centric project. Moreover, the remaining 10% will be locked for liquidity for one month, ensuring the seamless trading of the token.</p>
<p>Evil Pepe Coin encourages investors to embrace their risk-taking side to succeed in the meme coin game. This aligns with the meme coin degen philosophy and is why Evil Pepe Coin has exploded in popularity despite only launching recently.</p>
<figure class="media">All new meme coin projects carry risk. However, the Evil Pepe Coin community acknowledge this, accepting it as part of the process. As such, the project is an exciting glimmer of hope for those down but not out on meme coins.
<p>With less than $200K raised and a $1.9 million starting market cap, the project is new, creative and presents lots of upside potential.</p>

<h2><strong>Best Place To Buy Cryptos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although Pepe 2.0 is not yet listed on Binance, its reputation among investors makes it a potential contender for a Binance listing.</p>
<p>Binance&#8217;s low transaction fees are a significant draw. The exchange charges a standard 0.1% fee for both maker and taker transactions, which is competitively low in the industry. This fee structure especially appeals to frequent traders who prioritize cost efficiency in their operations.</p>
<p>Another critical feature of Binance is its support for P2P (peer-to-peer) transactions. This feature allows users to trade cryptos directly with one another without the need for an intermediary, offering greater control and potentially lower costs. The P2P platform supports multiple payment methods, improving its accessibility and convenience for a global user base.</p>

<p>Binance also offers staking services, allowing users to earn rewards by holding specific cryptos. The APY (Annual Percentage Yield) for staking varies depending on the specific crypto, market conditions, and Binance&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>Staking on Binance can be an attractive option for users looking to earn passive income on their crypto holdings, as it typically provides higher returns than traditional savings accounts.</p>
<p>Also, the platform&#8217;s robust security measures contribute to its credibility. Binance uses strong security protocols to protect users&#8217; funds and personal information.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Binance</a>
<p><em>Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While Pepe 2.0’s price has declined recently, its community has remained strong. However, its upside is limited due to its $16 million market cap,  </p>
<p>On the other hand, Evil Pepe Coin is a budding new micro-cap project with a growing community and better upside potential. Click below to check it out.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Is Pepe 2.0 worth buying?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How much will Pepe 2.0 be in 2025?</strong></p>
<p>Our Pepe 2.0 price forecast predicts a possible low of $0.00000003, a high of $0.00000006 and an average price of $0.000000045 by the end of 2025.</p>

Immediately after its launch, buyers flocked to purchase the token as analysts named it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>top presale coins</u></a>.</p><p>Investors and analysts were excited about Thug Life because it launched amid the recent meme coin mania, where new meme coins made 100-1000X gains within days of launching.</p><p>The token is now launching on its first exchange today, with hopes of a pump very high.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/119227/317143/screenshot-2023-07-10-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="1007" class="content-img"></figure><p>Thug Life&rsquo;s total supply is 4,200,000,000, with 70% was sold in its presale. A token price of $0.0007 puts the presale hard cap at $2,058,000 and its market cap at launch at $2,940,000.</p><p>According to the Thug Life roadmap, there will also be airdrops, token burning and giveaways to come in the future.</p><h3><strong>Thug Life Price History Key Points</strong></h3><p>With such a low market cap, Thug Life could undoubtedly become one of the cryptos with the highest upside potential. We have summarised the key price history points below.</p><ul><li>The Thug Life presale launched at the end of June at $0.0007.</li><li>So far, the presale has raised $829K.</li><li>$THUG&rsquo;s price will remain the same throughout the presale, providing all investors with an equal opportunity to buy it.</li><li>The project has a total supply of 4,200,000,000, with 70% available in its presale.</li><li>Its market cap at launch will be $2,940,000.</li></ul><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Presale Started</strong></td><td>June 2023</td></tr><tr><td><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Purchase Methods</strong></p></td><td>ETH, USDT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chain</strong></td><td>Ethereum</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hard Cap</strong></td><td>$2,058,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Min Investment</strong></td><td>N/a</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Investment</strong></td><td>N/a</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2><strong>Thug Life Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While large-cap meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have stagnated recently, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/23/the-price-of-this-new-crypto-meme-coin-rose-21000-as-bitcoin-and-ethereum-stalled-but-theres-a-nasty-catch/"><u>rise of Pepe</u></a> caused a mass frenzy for newer meme coins. This means new meme coins are surging immediately after launching.</p><p>Since Pepe, new meme coins like 4Chan, Pepe2.0, Jim and Spongebob have caused a huge spike in interest in emerging meme coins. This creates a massive opportunity for Thug Life following its exchange launch.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/119227/317147/screenshot-2023-07-10-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="885" class="content-img"></figure><p>The coins mentioned above have all exploded at least 10X following their launches. Many are still performing strongly today. For example, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-2-0/"><u>Pepe2.0 is currently up 1,947%</u></a> from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap.&nbsp;</p><p>Gains of this magnitude on relatively unknown coins with give us high hopes for the Thug Life token price, considering it has already amassed significant hype.</p><p>Moreover, the Thug Life token was created behind the Spongebob token team. Following its launch, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sponge/"><u>$SPONGE did a 100X</u></a>, signalling big things could be ahead for Thug Life.</p><p>Another factor to consider regarding the price of Thug Life is its market cap at launch will be just $2,940,000. Compared to other new meme coins, this is a very small and gives rise to significant gains.</p><p>Currently, Pepe2.0 holds a $36 million market cap, while the original <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/">Pepe token market cap</a> is over $600 million despite launching just a couple of months ago. Therefore, it is easy to see why many analysts are saying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR9Tt9Q_Kgk&amp;pp=ygUPdGh1ZyBsaWZlIHRva2Vu">Thug Life is the next 100X token</a>.</p><p>With this in mind, and considering Thug Life is already generating a sizeable community, our Thug Life price prediction estimates $THUG could reach <strong>$0.008</strong> by the end of 2023. This would equate to a 1,042% gain from its current price.</p><h2><strong>Thug Life Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>With the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/546925"><u>crypto bull run expected to commence at the end of 2024</u></a>, many cryptos could create new ATHs by the end of 2025. Still, projects must retain their community&#8217;s attention until then to benefit from the next bull run gains. However, Thug Life holds a major advantage in this regard.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/119227/317144/screenshot-2023-07-10-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="1007" class="content-img"></figure><p>Thug Life is community-centric in several ways. First, its whole presale is priced at $0.0007; this should prevent dumping once it launches, leading to more sustainable growth and giving the community an equal opportunity to buy $THUG.</p><p>Moreover, as mentioned, the team plan to run airdrops giveaways and token burns to reward holders and boost the Thug Life price.</p><p>Despite launching just a few weeks ago, the project has already amassed <a href="https://twitter.com/thug_life_token"><u>3.6K Twitter</u></a> followers and <a href="https://t.me/thuglifetoken"><u>1.7K Telegram group members</u></a>.</p><p>The project also boasts complete originality, ranging from its unique name and ticker symbol to the memes it posts on social media and the characters it&#8217;s based on. This makes Thug Life distinguishable from other meme coins, making it easier for the project to be remembered and build a long-lasting community.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is important to consider that all cryptos carry risk. Still, we think that Thug Life&rsquo;s low market cap, focus on community, and complete originality could drive it to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-crypto-bull-run-coins.htm"><u>best cryptos to buy ahead of the next bull run</u></a>.</p><p>Considering this, our Thug Life price prediction forecasts a price of<strong> $0.014 </strong>by the end of 2025. If it reaches our target, this would result in a 1,900% gain from its current price.</p><h2><strong>Thug Life Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Although we predict Thug Life could be one of the best <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm"><u>high-upside potential cryptos</u></a> in the short term, meme coins are highly volatile, and anything can happen long term.</p><p>However, as we have seen with Dogecoin, the community aspect of meme coins can prove invaluable, causing them to outperform the crypto markets.</p><p>Countless high-profile crypto influencers and analysts have already celebrated the Thug Life crypto. Recently, YouTuber Clinix Crypto covered the token, calling it &ldquo;special&rdquo; and highlighting that it differs entirely from other meme coins.</p><iframe title="THIS MEMECOIN PRESALE IS SPECIAL!&#x1f525; | (Thug Life Memecoin Presale Review)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaEcMnrTPzQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Still, for the project to succeed long-term, it must begin to add utility that provides holders with extra benefits. We see this with more mature meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, and Thug Life must follow suit for long-term success.</p><p>Thus far, factors ranging from Thug Life&rsquo;s tokenomics to its roadmap indicate that the team is here for the long run. If this is the case, we will likely see the project add future developments and utility over time, cementing it as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm"><u>long-term crypto</u></a>.</p><p>With this in mind, our Thug Life price prediction estates a price of <strong>$0.017</strong> by the end of 2030. This would equate to a 2,328% increase from its current price.</p><p>Although it could climb higher, the project&rsquo;s next steps are not guaranteed. Consequently, our prediction primarily focuses on the information currently available.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/thuglife/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Thug Life Presale</a></div></div><h2><strong>Thug Life Possible Highs and Lows</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>It is important to consider that all new crypto projects carry risk. Still, our $THUG price prediction has found that Thug Life presents significant upside potential. We have listed our estimated highs and lows for Thug Life below.</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Possible High</strong></td><td><strong>Possible Low</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>$0.008</td><td>$0.005</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>$0.014</td><td>$0.01</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>$0.017</td><td>$0.015</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2><strong>What is Thug Life</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><blockquote><p>Thug Life is a presale meme coin aimed at meme coin degens looking to &ldquo;turn screw-ups into profits&rdquo;. Essentially, the project takes a light-hearted approach, making fun of the &ldquo;could haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;should haves&rdquo; that meme coin investors often find themselves contemplating.</p></blockquote><p>That said, Thug Life also presents a fresh and innovative design featuring the likes of Snoop Dogg, Hasbulla and the Dogecoin dog.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/119227/317149/screenshot-2023-07-10-8-0.jpg" alt="" width="854" class="content-img"></figure><p>The project uses playful &ldquo;street&rdquo; language, with its slogan being &ldquo;The baller&rsquo;s meme coin. Get gangsta in this market and pimp out your money game.&rdquo; Also, instead of a roadmap, the Thug Life whitepaper calls it a &ldquo;Streetmap&rdquo;.</p><p>This creates a unique feel to the Thug Life community, resulting in its social media accounts performing tremendously. With <a href="https://twitter.com/thug_life_token"><u>3K followers</u></a>, the Thug Life Twitter regularly posts tweets that amass hundreds of retweets and likes.</p><h2><strong>What Factors Affect the Thug Life Price</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Like all cryptos, the Thug Life price is a product of supply and demand. However, the demand-based factors may differ slightly since it is a meme coin.</p><h3><strong>Hype</strong></h3><p>As we saw with Pepe, 4Chan and Pepe 2.0, the ability to garner hype can cause crypto prices to skyrocket.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Thug Life is created by the Spongebob token team, who have a solid approach to marketing and broad industry outreach, we expect Thug Life to amass substantial hype looking ahead.</p><h3><strong>Community</strong></h3><p>Communities are the primary driver in meme coin prices climbing so quickly. Large communities make it easy for the project to reach the masses once hype starts to build, leading to a rapid increase in price.</p><h3><strong>Exchange Listings</strong></h3><p>As we saw with Pepe when it exploded following its Binance listing, securing centralised exchange listings can have a significant impact on a meme coin&#8217;s price. According to the Thug Life &#8220;Streetmap&#8221;, the project aims to secure CEX listings, potentially helping attract new investors and boost its price.</p><h3><strong>Supply</strong></h3><p>Thug Life has a capped supply of 2,940,000,000 tokens. However, the team will burn tokens, reducing the supply and making $THUG deflationary. As a result, the demand will be concentrated to a lesser amount of circulating tokens, causing the $THUG price to rise.</p><h2><strong>How to Buy Thug Life Presale</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Since Thug Life is currently in its presale, the only place to buy $THUG is on its website. Find out how to buy Thug Life in five simple steps below.</p><h3><strong>Step One: Create a Software Wallet</strong></h3><p>Firstly, create an Ethereum-compatible software wallet. We recommend using either Metamask or Trust Wallet. To get started, visit the wallet provider&#8217;s website (for desktop), or search for it on your mobile app store, then download it.</p><p>Next, follow the set-up instructions, ensuring you store your seed phrase securely.<img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/119227/317148/screenshot-2023-07-10-6-5.jpg" alt="" width="1015" class="content-img"></p><h3><strong>Step Two: Fund Your Wallet</strong></h3><p>Add USDT or ETH to your wallet by sending it from your centralised exchange account or purchasing it with a card inside the wallet app.</p><h3><strong>Step Three: Visit the Thug Life Website</strong></h3><p>Visit the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/thuglife/">Thug Life website</a> and select the amount of $THUG you want to buy, then hit &ldquo;Buy Now&rdquo;.<img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/119227/317142/screenshot-2023-07-10-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="930" class="content-img"></p><h3><strong>Step Four: Buy $THUG</strong></h3><p>Follow the onscreen prompts provided by Metamask or Trust Wallet to connect your wallet to the site and authorise the transaction.</p><h3><strong>Step Five: Claim Your Tokens</strong></h3><p>At the end of the presale, visit the Thug Life website to claim the tokens you purchased. After claiming them, you can find them in your wallet by clicking &ldquo;add token&rdquo; on Metamask and importing the Thug Life token&rsquo;s smart contract address.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>With its distinctive style, strong community and low market cap, Thug Life is one of the most celebrated new meme coins and has considerable upside potential.</p><p>However, investors looking to purchase this low-cap gem must be quick, as its price could skyrocket once it goes live on exchanges in six days.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/thuglife/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Thug Life Presale</a></div></div><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>Will Thug Life go up in price?</strong></p><p>According to our Thug Life price prediction, the $THUG price could rise by 1,042% in 2023.

<h2><strong>A Closer Look at the Possible Next Dogecoin Cryptos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Next, we will dig into each of the top nine possible Dogecoin cryptos to see what makes them unique and give them the potential to explode in price.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Trending Meme Token Which Raised $25M, Now Live With Its Own Crypto Casino Platform</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes’</a> has an established community of over a million people and a developing team with a proven track record of success in the space. The presale raised over $25M in about 3 months before going on to list on multiple Tier 1 exchanges. </p>
<p><iframe title="Wall Street Memes Next 10x Crypto (BIG NEWS) - $WSM Ready to Explode!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMFoYignziY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Launched back in 2019 amid the GameStop-Wall Street Bets pump, Wall Street Memes has been a fixture in the space with its social media takes that has built a loyal community across its various pages.</p>
<p>In 2021, the creators of Wall Street Memes then launched their own NFT project on Ethereum, Wall St Bulls, which sold out in just 32 minutes. </p>
<p>On May 26th, the platform decided to launch its own meme token &#8211; $WSM &#8211; on presale. Through this cryptocurrency, Wall Street Memes aims to generate revenue and wealth for its entire community. </p>
<p>One billion tokens, which consists of 50% of the total token supply, has been allocated to the presale with no vesting period, no team allocation and open to all, ensuring its a fair launch. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/277549/wsm-token-home.jpg" alt="WSM token" /></figure>
<p>30% of the total supply will be offered to members as community rewards, while the remaining 20% will be used for CEX and DEX liquidity. </p>
<p>By entering the token presale, investors can also participate in the $WSM airdrop, which will let you win from a $50,000 prize pool of $WSM tokens.</p>
<p>The native $WSM token can be used to play on the new Wall Street Memes crypto casino. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Tamadoge &#8211; Play-To-Earn Meme Coin that can be used to buy NFTs</strong></h3>
<p>What comes to mind when you think of what&#8217;s next after Dogecoin? Do you envision a fun project with a strong community but more utility than Dogecoin? </p>
<p>If so, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/">Tamadoge</a> could be the next Dogecoin. If you have been keeping an eye on the crypto news, this will come as no surprise since many experts expect Tamadoge to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">best upcoming cryptos</a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107768/311946/tama-blast-off.jpg" alt="Tamadoge crypto game" /></figure>
<p>While Tamadoge is inspired by Dogecoin, it is a Play-to-Earn and metaverse project with a significant focus on building and rewarding its community. With that said, community is vital to the crucial component of Dogecoin&#8217;s success, so we have high hopes for TAMA to be <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">the next crypto to explode</a>.</p>
<p>Tamadoge has already released five P2E games in its Tamadoge Arcade and in May attracted more players than Decentraland and The Sandbox combined. </p>
<p>The project is also developing its own augmented reality mobile app, where players grow Pets and then battle them against other players. The project has recently applied for the app to be listed on iOS and Android stores.</p>
<p>The games also help with the supply of TAMA &#8211; purchasing items in the Pet store to upgrade their pets comes with a 5% burn, causing the supply to be deflationary.</p>
<p>TAMA was one of the best performing coins of 2022.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Doge Uprising &#8211; Doge Inspired Coin With 10% Referral Program and Automatic 200% ROI in T</strong><strong>he Next Stage</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising/">Doge Uprising ($DUP)</a> is a new style of meme presale that integrates a manga storytelling style. It is yet another evolution of the famous Doge meme token, but this tale incorporates Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg for even more appeal to the public.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="415" class="alignnone wp-image-119909 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1698244756-screen-shot-2023-10-25-at-10-11-47-1.png" alt="Doge Uprising token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1698244756-screen-shot-2023-10-25-at-10-11-47-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1698244756-screen-shot-2023-10-25-at-10-11-47-1-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1698244756-screen-shot-2023-10-25-at-10-11-47-1-768x354.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> </p>
<p>The story starts in 2045, where Mark Zuckerberg has the world in a state of total surveillance. Only Elon Musk, leading an elite group of Doge Mecha NFTs, can defeat him in an epic battle. This means that investment in an NFT is another soldier in the way against world tyranny.</p>
<p>The $DUP token is what supports the Doge Mecha NFTs. But this is more than an ordinary token, and presale commitment indicates the support of a much wider movement. The Doge Uprising roadmap mentions that it will liaise with many influencers and hold frequent AMAs. Community is at the heart of all successful meme movements, and Doge Uprising aims to support the community in its early stages, as much as possible.</p>
<p>Investment in $DUP yields an automatic 200% ROI. Currently priced at $0.000013, this will 2x in the next stage (to $0.000026). There is a total supply of 450 billion tokens, of which 270 billion are available in the presale. The presale also offers a 10% affiliate program &#8211; affiliates automatically get 10% of the investor&#8217;s financial commitment, paid to the crypto wallet. The program is open to everybody.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="397" class="alignnone wp-image-119910 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1698244759-screen-shot-2023-10-25-at-10-11-57-1.png" alt="Doge Uprising token rewards" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1698244759-screen-shot-2023-10-25-at-10-11-57-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1698244759-screen-shot-2023-10-25-at-10-11-57-1-300x132.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1698244759-screen-shot-2023-10-25-at-10-11-57-1-768x339.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This could well be the next Dogecoin. Not only is it Doge-inspired, the story features Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, two of the biggest celebrities on the planet. It offers a neat 2x in presale pricing and an inventive affiliate program.</p>
<p>Like all presales, early bird investment will yield far more returns, if the coin turns out to be successful. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>4. Floki &#8211; High Utility DeFi and Metaverse Meme Coin</strong></h3>
<p>Next on our list of what will be the next Dogecoin is Floki. The most exciting thing about this coin is that it already has a massive ecosystem and an impressive online presence.</p>
<p>This means for the less risk-averse investors, Floki would be a safer option to invest in as it has its own NFT metaverse and marketplace and a decentralized exchange &#8211; giving the token utility for now and the future.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107768/311979/floki.jpg" alt="Floki crypto project" /></figure>
<p>However, the caveat is that there is less upside as the coin already has a market cap of $250 million.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is still massive room for growth. With Dogecoin&#8217;s current market cap being $9 billion, FLOKI has room to do a 35x to match DOGE.</p>
<p>The FLOKI token is used to power the Floki ecosystem, which consists of a metaverse, DeFi protocol, NFT marketplace and more.</p>
<p>Due to the coin&#8217;s 25% burn mechanism on transaction fees, the token supply will decrease over time, which could naturally increase demand.</p>
<p>FLOKI has been performing exceptionally well in 2023, where it is up nearly 200%.</p>
<h3><strong>5. LeverageInu &#8211; Meme-Fi Coin Providing Passive Income to Holders</strong></h3>
<p>The LeverageInu crypto is the first meme coin to be launched on the Artibtrum blockchain, but it comes with a twist. As well as being a meme coin, the LEVI token creates passive income for its holders using advanced DeFi strategies.</p>
<p>The coin has a tiny market cap of just $400,000, which means even if you invest in the token today, you are still very early and could make massive profits.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107768/311980/leverageinu.jpg" alt="LeverageInu crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Leverage Inu&#8217;s protocol works by taking staked LEVI and using it to yield farm on other protocols. Leverage Inu has a team of expert traders that use the yield farming profits to leverage trade before redistributing the crypto back to the stakers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this provides a real yield strategy so that LEVI holders can be rewarded without the project having to resort to inflationary tokens.</p>
<p>Because Leverage Inu provides utility to holders, there will be much less sell pressure long-term. Additionally, the project has soared in popularity recently, so that it could explode in price in the months ahead.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Baby Doge Coin &#8211; Dogecoin Spin-off With Deflationary Burn Mechanism</strong></h3>
<p>While some &#8216;Doge killers&#8217; bring new utility, others follow the meme-first Dogecoin philosophy. Baby Doge Coin follows this latter while building on Dogecoin&#8217;s tokenomics for a more sustainable project.</p>
<p>Baby Doge Coin has a 10% transaction tax used to reward holders and punish &#8220;paper hands&#8221;. The fee is redistributed between holders, a &#8220;dead wallet&#8221; (to burn) and liquidity pools.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107768/311981/babydoge.jpg" alt="baby Doge coin crypto project" /></figure>
<p>One of the exciting things about Baby Doge Coin is that it is a BNB chain coin. This means many crypto users already have wallets set up to buy the coin, and they can purchase it for low fees. On the other hand, Dogecoin requires users to set up a new wallet, which can sometimes be off-putting.</p>
<p>The project has a current market cap of $255 million, and the BABYDOGE price has begun to shift upwards. This suggests a long-term reversal is likely and considering its innovative tokenomics, it could even lead to BABY Doge Coin surpassing Dogecoin eventually.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Dogelon Mars &#8211; Elon Musk Inspired Dogecoin Spin-off</strong></h3>
<p>Surprisingly, Elon Musk became one of the most influential individuals in the meme coin industry in 2021. </p>
<p>This led to many cryptos with Elon as the primary focus emerging, with the most promising being Dogelon Mars.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107768/311982/dogelon-mars.jpg" alt="Dogelon Mars crypto project" /></figure>
<p>ELON has a market cap of $108 million, so it&#8217;s an excellent option for a mid-cap coin that could surpass Dogecoin. But in a typical Dogecoin-like fashion, Dogelon Mars does not offer much utility. </p>
<p>Instead, its main selling points are its &#8220;memeable&#8221; characteristics, such as its affiliation with Elon, dogs and reaching Mars (achieving a high price).</p>
<p>Although this may not seem like a project necessarily set to become a leader in crypto, its fun and light-hearted nature follows a similar model to Dogecoin and has already led to the project gaining over 300K Twitter followers. Also, the coin has recently been showing signs of breaking its recent downtrend in price.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Shiba Inu &#8211; Biggest Dogecoin Competitor With Massive Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>Shiba Inu is the most likely crypto to overtake Dogecoin. In fact, back in November, its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/shiba-inu-passes-dogecoin-as-top-dog-in-cryptocurrency?leadSource=uverify%20wall">market cap briefly overtook Dogecoins</a>. </p>
<p>Although the coin started as a direct competitor to Dogecoin, it has now expanded into a massive blockchain ecosystem, with its own DEX, P2E protocol and even a new Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107768/311983/shiba-inu.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu coin stack" /></figure>
<p>Shiba Inu is the most popular meme coin apart from Dogecoin, with a social media following of 3.6 million on Twitter and one of the most well-known hashtags of crypto Twitter, #shibarmy.</p>
<p>Considering community is the bread and butter of meme coins, it&#8217;s no surprise that Shiba Inu has made our list.</p>
<p>However, the main issue for investors regarding Shiba Inu is that there is less room for growth compared to Love Hate Inu or Tamadoge. Shiba Inu already has a market cap of $6 billion. In comparison, Dogecoin has a market cap of $9.7 billion. This means there is only room for around a 50% increase to overtake Dogecoin.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Safemoon Inu &#8211; Coin with Largest Community to Smallest Market Cap</strong></h3>
<p>Safemoon Inu&#8217;s market cap suffered one of the most significant falls from its all-time high in 2021 until today, with its price down 99.95%. The Safemoon Inu fully diluted market cap currently sits at $234 million, and the project has 1.3 million Twitter followers. </p>
<p>To put that into perspective, it has over 30% of Shiba Inu&#8217;s followers, with a market cap of 2.4% of Shiba Inu&#8217;s.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/107768/311984/safemoon-inu.jpg" alt="Safemoon Inu crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Considering its community that builds meme coins, this puts Safemoon Inu in an exciting position for explosive growth. However, the Safemoon Inu team has not executed as well as other teams, particularly over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the crypto has some excellent tokenomics and an expansive ecosystem, so coupled with its growing community, the coin has the potential to make vast gains in the coming bull market.</p>
<p>Safemoon Inu also has a 10% tax on each transaction. This fee is redistributed to holders and back into the project to develop the ecosystem. Ultimately, this incentivises people to hold the SFM long-term as sellers are punished, and holders are rewarded.</p>
<h2><strong>Why do People Look for the Next Dogecoin?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While crypto is a volatile industry that can lead to lucrative gains, Dogecoin is renowned for making many investors millionaires seemingly overnight. But to understand why this happened, you first need to understand Dogecoin.</p>
<p>First conceptualized in 2013, Dogecoin was founded by software engineers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus as a satirical payment system based on a popular online meme. So while Dogecoin has existed for almost a decade, it only noticeably rose to prominence in 2020.</p>
<p>Before 2020, the meme coins price remained primarily flat with the occasional surge, but it mainly followed the rest of the market.</p>
<p>However, in 2020 was when Dogecoin began to stand out regarding making huge gains. Following a TikTok trend aimed at getting Dogecoin to $1, the price started to surge. The DOGE price opened on January 1, 2020, at $0.002028 but closed on December 31, 2020, at 0.004682.</p>
<p>This is around over a 100% increase in price but was nothing compared to what was to come.</p>
<p>The following year, in 2021, Elon Musk and SpaceX showed massive interest in the cryptocurrency and even preferred it to Bitcoin. This led to the DOGE price surging, eventually reaching an all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021 and increasing 157X in price in five months.</p>
<p>Investing $6000 in DOGE in December 2020 and selling in May 2021 would have made investors $1 million. With that said, the main reason people are looking for the next Doge is that the fun and community-driven nature of these types of tokens can lead to enormous profits quickly.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Find the Next Dogecoin</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When identifying the next Dogecoin, there are some essential elements to remember. Cross-check the points below against each of the coins on our list to maximize profits.</p>
<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you are looking for the new Dogecoin, or something else, the key to successful long-term profits is minimizing opportunity cost. But what is opportunity cost, and how can it help you make money in crypto?</p>
<p>Opportunity cost means choosing the option with the highest growth potential. This is important because while all the coins on the list might grow in the next bull market, some will grow much more than others. All coins on the list present excellent use cases and have teams capable of producing excellence, so the most important thing to look at for maximizing opportunity cost is price, or in this case, market cap.</p>
<p>Finding a coin with a low market cap with high growth potential, such as Wall Street Memes, means you will minimize your opportunity cost and make the highest potential returns.</p>
<h3><strong>High Potential Presales</strong></h3>
<p>As you know from Dogecoin&#8217;s history, getting into a meme coin project early can result in massive profits, and the best way to get into a new project early today is through presales. This is because presale projects are brand new, so many users have yet to hear of them; therefore, their value is often underestimated.</p>
<p>The best way to identify a high-potential presale is by looking for ones that start strongly and continue generating demand moving forward. A great example is Wall Street Memes, which raised over $4 million in its first 10 days of presale.</p>
<h3><strong>Genuine Utility</strong></h3>
<p>Although Dogecoin exploded without creating utility, coins aiming to be the next Dogecoin need to offer something new or different. The best way to do this is by providing real utility.</p>
<p>Solving real problems through decentralized blockchain technology is crypto&#8217;s fundamental principle, so projects that do this have the highest chance of success. Tamadoge is an excellent example of a project which does this. It solves many of the issues faced in the traditional gaming sector by rewarding players for their time and effort.</p>
<h3><strong>Community</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, a strong focus on community is crucial to a project following Dogecoin&#8217;s success. Look out for projects with an active presence on social media and those that reward their community for interacting with their crypto. A great example is Love Hate Inu, which distributes tokens to holders when they vote on polls in the cryptos ecosystem.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Considering the history of Dogecoin, it only takes a couple of months for a community-driven meme coin project to go from average to one of the world&#8217;s most popular coins. But going forward, the next Dogecoin needs a low market cap and a strong community.</p>
<p>One of the top cryptos that can become the next Dogecoin is Wall Street Memes. This is a meme crypto platform, which has a social media following of over a million. It launched its own casino and raised over $25M in its massively successful presale, with a token live on large T1 exchanges. </p>

The presale equated to a value of $363,999, giving the coin roughly a $1 million fully-diluted market cap at launch.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/114289/276216/copium.jpg" alt="Copium" width="1029" class="content-img"></figure><p>The private sale aimed to involve 200 famous crypto community members who could serve as project ambassadors and holders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Each private sale member could purchase a maximum of 1 ETH worth of $COPIUM making for a fair launch, which was further enhanced by only 10% of their tokens being unlocked at launch.&nbsp;</p><p>One such figure was prominent YouTuber and crypto investor FaZe Banks, one of the founders of FaZe Clan, who revealed to his 3 million Instagram followers that having sold made his 1 ETH back he is now holding $COPIUM for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><p>The remaining 90% will be unlocked linearly over a three-week schedule, mean new investors will be HODLing alongside some renowned community figures, rather than being immediately dumped on by presale buyers.</p><p>Despite being brand new, the <a href="https://twitter.com/COPIUMDROP"><u>Copium Twitter</u></a> account has already gained over 16.5k followers, while its Telegram account is also heading towards 5k. Moreover, many of the project&#8217;s Tweets have received 5k or more engagements, signaling the excitement over the launch and the future of the project.</p><p>Besides the presale, 25% of tokens will be sent to exchanges for liquidity, 33.31% to marketing, 1% to an airdrop, 0.69% to the team and 10% for future development.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/copium-site/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit $COPIUM Site</a></div></div><h2><strong>Could Huge Profits Be Due for Early Investors?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As we have seen with Pepe ($PEPE) &nbsp;or slightly lesser-known coins like Turbo ($TURBO) or <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sponge/">Sponge ($SPONGE)</a>, investors can generate considerable gains quickly by investing in meme coins early.</p><p>But can Copium repeat history?</p><p>At its all-time high, Pepe reached a market cap of over $1.7 billion high despite providing no utility &#8211; this highlights the power and excitement of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> in that their price is not closely tied to a use case like other cryptos.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/114289/276328/copium-3.jpg" alt="" width="1858" class="content-img"></figure><p>Therefore, meme coins have the potential to pump much higher earlier on in their journey.

<p><i><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>Big Eyes is a new presale meme coin that has raised $35 million after piquing the interest of investors and the media.</p>
<p>This Big Eyes price prediction breaks down our price estimates for the $BIG crypto. We consider its short and long-term price potential based on its fundamentals, roadmap, safety and level of interest from the community.</p>
<h2><strong>Big Eyes Price Prediction 2023-2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023: </strong>With its presale set to end in June, investors who miss out on the presale will look to purchase $BIG on exchanges. Moreover, its IEO will bring new hype from the media; if successful, we could see a post-IEO price of <strong>$0.0009</strong> by the end of 2023.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2024:</strong> Providing the Big Eyes team executes on their roadmap, the token will rise with the rest of the market in 2024 following the Bitcoin halving. Therefore, our Big Eyes price prediction estimates a price of <strong>$0.0015</strong> by the end of 2024.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025: </strong>Having already amassed a huge online community, Big Eyes has the foundations to become a successful long-term meme coin. Based on its fast-growing community, our Big Eyes price prediction forecasts a price of <strong>$0.0022</strong> by the end of 2025.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2030:</strong> Long-term price predictions are difficult, particularly for volatile meme coins. Nonetheless, if our Big Eyes price prediction bull case plays out, the $BIG price could hit <strong>$0.00375</strong> by the end of 2030.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Big Eyes Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Big Eyes presale officially launched in August 2022 and quickly gained a reputation as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best presales</a> as the community took an interest.</p>
<p>The presale got off to a quick start since stage one, where its price was $0.0001. Currently, the Big Eyes presale is in round 13, with a price of $0.00052. The project has raised over $35 million so far, making it one of the most significant presale raises of the year.</p>
<p>The crypto community has shown a massive interest in Big Eyes, with the project gaining 35K <a href="https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin">Twitter</a> followers and over 2000 <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4jyTjhgYJN">Discord</a> members since its launch.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/112843/273122/big-eyes1.jpg" alt="Big Eyes" width="1909" /><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3>
<p>There are 200,000,000,000 $BIG tokens available altogether. During the Big Eyes presale, 80% of the coins will be sold. This puts the coins in the hands of the community rather than the project’s team, leading to more organic and sustainable price action.</p>
<p>Another 5% of tokens are allocated to a charity wallet, and the rest will be split between exchange liquidity and the team’s marketing budget. Additionally, the exchange liquidity is locked for two years, and Big Eyes has had its smart contract audited by Solidity Finance to confirm this.</p>
<p>The coin features no buy or sell transaction fees, making it free to trade except for gas fees.<img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/112843/273123/big-eyes-2.jpg" alt="" width="1438" /></p>
<p>Similarly to some of the top meme coins like Dogecoin, the $BIG token will not offer much utility. Instead, the team aims to increase the token’s price by growing its community and popularity among investors.</p>
<p>While this strategy is risky, it works for other coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and newer cryptos like Pepe. The question is, will it work for Big Eyes?</p>
<h3><strong>Presale</strong></h3>
<p>The Big Eyes presale is set to end on June 3rd, 2023, following which it will have its IEO. There are 15 presale rounds, with the IEO price at $0.0006. The launch price signifies a 600% price increase for round one investors and a 15% increase for investors who buy today.</p>
<p>The presale hard cap is $51.2 million. While it is unclear whether this will be reached, the team have already stated they have hit their soft cap, so they have the funds to roll out its roadmap.</p>
<h3><strong>Big Eyes Price History &#8211; Key Points</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Big Eyes presale started in August 2022 at an initial price of $0.0001.</li>
<li>There are 200,000,000,000 $BIG tokens.</li>
<li>The Big Eyes team have allocated 80% of $BIG to presale.</li>
<li>There will be 15 presale rounds, with an IEO price of $0.0006.</li>
<li>Having raised $35 million, the project has reached its soft cap.</li>
<li>The presale hard cap is set at $51.2 million.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Big Eyes Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While Big Eyes have experienced an immensely successful presale, it is still being determined whether it could become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm#:~:text=Top%20Altcoins%20to%20Invest%20in%20Reviewed%201%201.,Promising%20P2E%20RPG%20Game%20Altcoin%20...%20More%20items">best altcoins</a>. </p>
<p>One of the most critical factors in our short-term Big Eyes price forecast is understanding how tokenomics and demand could affect the coin’s price. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, 80% of all coins will be available at presale, and stage one investors will net a 600% gain based on the Big Eyes IEO price.</p>
<p>This signifies a massive profit for early investors and could lead to some high sell pressure following the launch. <img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/112843/273124/big-eyes3.jpg" alt="Big Eyes" width="1438" /></p>
<p>High sell pressure post-launch could potentially hold the price down. Nonetheless, exchange launches often generate a lot of hype and new demand, as we saw during the Tamadoge presale. The Tamadoge coin was one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-launches.htm">best crypto launches</a>, where the price surged once it went live on exchanges, pocketing an 18X return for early investors.</p>
<p>Moreover, based on the potential for meme coins to climb to unprecedented levels quickly, many investors will be happy to hold the coin in hopes of greater long-term profits.</p>
<p>Therefore, we expect the demand to outpace the supply. With this in mind, our Big Eyes price prediction forecasts a $BIG token price of <strong>$0.0009</strong> by the end of 2023. This will equate to a 73% gain for investors who purchase the token at its current price.</p>
<h2><strong>Big Eyes Price Prediction 2024</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With the Bitcoin halving in 2024, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/9e22d4d0-e2cc-11ed-92e1-c61d17e3691f?shareToken=4d5b1eee35a19f9454ce1c603856006f">Standard Charted expects Bitcoin to reach $100,000</a>. Historically, as the Bitcoin price rises, the rest of the crypto market does too. Therefore, provided the team executes on its roadmap; we could continue to see the Big Eyes price grow in 2024.</p>
<p>Another factor affecting the Big Eyes crypto price in 2024 is its tokenomics. As mentioned, 80% of the tokens are available at presale, with the rest allocated to exchanges, charity and just 5% to marketing. This means the community holds the lion&#8217;s share of the tokens, all of which will be circulating immediately after the IEO.</p>
<p>In contrast, many presale projects distribute far fewer tokens to the presale, with the rest allocated to the team on an 18-month vesting schedule. Since Big Eyes tokens will be mostly unlocked from the get-go, this could lead to reduced sell pressure in 2024.<img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/112843/273125/big-eyes4.jpg" alt="Big Eyes" width="1438" /></p>
<p>With the Big Eyes project already gaining a substantial following on social media, the team is evidently doing a fantastic job of marketing. Therefore, it is probable that this growth will continue into 2024.</p>
<p>Considering the growing community and that the broader market will be in a bull market, we expect demand to far outweigh supply for Big Eyes coin in 2024.</p>
<p>However, some experts like <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=jacob+bury+big+eyes&amp;docid=603501041794290029&amp;mid=ED7F2F477AEFD12C59E5ED7F2F477AEFD12C59E5&amp;view=detail&amp;FORM=VIRE">Jacob Bury</a> have highlighted that there is a chance Big Eyes could be a rug pull. Although the project has already addressed these concerns through smart contract audits, KYC and locked exchange liquidity, it is still important to remain aware of the potential risks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a rug pull?</p>
<p>A rug pull refers to when a crypto project raises hype and funds for a crypto coin, then abruptly exits without executing on its roadmap, taking the funds with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since these concerns have been addressed, and the factors affecting supply and demand looking promising, our Big Eyes price prediction estimates $BIG to reach <strong>$0.0015</strong> by the end of 2024. This would result in a 188% increase from its current presale price.</p>
<h2><strong>Big Eyes Price Forecast 2025 </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking ahead to 2025, so long as the team executes on its roadmap, the main consideration for our Big Eyes coin price prediction is how it differentiates itself from other meme coins.</p>
<p>Over 100 new cryptocurrencies are created daily, so beyond solid tokenomics and fundamentals, new projects need a unique selling point to succeed long-term.</p>
<p>In a Big Eyes analysis, crypto analyst Jacob Bury states that the project features eye-catching and unique artwork. Big Eyes plans to release an NFT collection, where its well-designed artwork could give it a significant advantage.<img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/112843/273127/big-eyes-6.jpg" alt="Big Eyes" width="1371" /></p>
<p>Another factor to consider is the Big Eyes roadmap. Two main trends on the roadmap are the project’s focus on marketing and rewarding the community.</p>
<p>Being a meme coin project, Big Eyes must remain in the media’s eye to generate demand. This is because, unlike other cryptos, meme coins do not provide any inherent value. The main purpose is for holders to be a part of a community.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Big Eyes team’s focus on marketing, community, and engaging artwork gives us high hopes that Big Eyes could throughout in 2025.<img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/112843/273128/screenshot-2023-05-03-4-4.jpg" alt="Big Eyes" width="1371" /></p>
<p>Nonetheless, this does not come without risk. Despite having a successful presale and a promising roadmap, all meme coins are highly speculative and volatile. This can be seen with <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, currently down 89% from its all-time high, compared to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, down just 58%.</p>
<p>However, although meme coins are a highly volatile category, they also provide higher upside returns if they are successful. Considering the factors mentioned above, our Big Eyes price prediction expects Big Eyes to hit <strong>$0.0022</strong> by 2025. This would result in a 323% price increase from its current presale price.</p>
<h2><strong>Big Eyes Price Prediction 2025-2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Predicting a long-term price estimate for presale coins can be difficult, especially for meme coins. That said, Dogecoin is an example of how a meme coin can perform well long-term.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55939854">Elon Musk changed the Twitter logo to the Dogecoin dog</a>; this caught the media’s attention and could be part of why the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/">PEPE</a> coin has rallied recently.</p>
<p>That said, Dogecoin has been around since 2014, and it was only in 2021 that things really took off for the coin. This shows that meme coins still have long-term potential, despite lacking real utility.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/112843/273126/big-eyes5.jpg" alt="Big Eyes" width="1059" /></figure>
<p>When it comes to Big Eyes, the project’s roadmap has set a target of $1 per $BIG token. However, since there are 200 billion $BIG tokens, this would put their market cap near <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">Ethereum’s</a>. We suspect this could be their long-term target, but we also believe this is highly unrealistic and should be taken light-heartedly.</p>
<p>Considering there are no plans for utility or growing the ecosystem beyond being a meme coin, a $200 billion market cap is difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>However, its incorporation of NFTs, its fast-growing community, and solid tokenomics tell us that a market cap closer to $750 million is likely by 2030. <img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/112843/273129/big-eyes-7.jpg" alt="" width="1371" /></p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://coinranking.com/coins/meme">meme coin rankings by market cap</a>, we can see that this would put Big Eyes below the current Baby Doge Coin market cap. Considering that <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/baby-doge-coin/">BABYDOGE</a> is less than two years old, Big Eyes could easily reach a similar market cap in seven years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the project did rug pull or failed to execute on its roadmap, we could see the price fall as low as its IEO price.</p>
<p>If our bull case for Big Eyes proves correct, our Big Eyes price prediction estimates a price of <strong>$0.00375</strong> by the end of 2030. This would result in a 621% increase from its current presale price.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that considering the explosive and unpredictable nature of meme coins, the project also has the potential to climb much higher. However, we aim to remain objective and avoid over speculation in our price predictions.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Big Eyes Token Used For?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While meme coins traditionally do not provide utility, they can often still offer holders additional benefits like exclusive access to events and digital badges.</p>
<h3><strong>Big Eyes E-Stickers</strong></h3>
<p>The project will reward $BIG holders with e-stickers. While it is unclear what this may pertain to, we expect it to be a verifiable and displayable digital asset as a way for holders to prove they own $BIG tokens. </p>
<p>This is a fantastic way to build community bonds and allow holders to recognize each other on different social media platforms.</p>
<h3><strong>Community Events</strong></h3>
<p>Community events are one of the best ways to build a long-term community. They enable holders to connect and are a fantastic way for communities to learn and innovate by sharing ideas and experiences. </p>
<p>Big Eyes have stated that they will run community events. Therefore, the token will likely grant users access to the meet-ups. As of yet, it is unclear whether these events will be in-person or online.</p>
<h2><strong>What Factors Drive the Big Eyes Coin Price?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Whether Big Eyes can be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptos</a> to buy remains to be seen. However, understanding the factors affecting its price can help to predict its short and long-term potential more accurately.</p>
<h3><strong>Exchange Listings</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is an exchange listing?</strong></p>
<p>An exchange listing is where a cryptocurrency exchange enables the trading of a new coin on its platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the only confirmed exchange listing for Big Eyes crypto is Uniswap. While this is a huge platform with lots of liquidity, centralized exchange listings such as OKX often have a bigger impact on newly listed coin prices.</p>
<p>Exchange listings often build hype and increased speculation, and also provide access to the coin for investors who do not use self-custody wallets. Therefore, the more exchanges Big Eyes is listed on, the higher the price could go.</p>
<h3><strong>Marketing and Media Spotlight</strong></h3>
<p>Meme coins mainly focus on increasing their community’s size. Doing so can increase their token price and raise awareness around the project. Therefore, Big Eyes must concentrate on marketing and remain in the media spotlight to attract new members to its community. </p>
<h3><strong>Meme Coin Narrative</strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever noticed how many meme coins use the names of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-trending-cryptos.htm#:~:text=The%20Best%20Trending%20Crypto%20Coins%20to%20Buy%20Now,Trending%20Meme%20Cryptocurrency%20to%20Buy%20...%20More%20items">trending coins</a> like “doge” or “inu” within their names? The reason for this is to gain traction when the original coin is performing well.</p>
<p>When the top meme coins explode, investors who take profits often look to purchase lesser-known meme <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm#:~:text=A%20Closer%20Look%20at%20the%20Cryptocurrencies%20with%20the,Meme%20Coin%20Pumping%20since%20IEO%20...%20More%20items">coins with high upside potential</a>. Therefore, the meme coin narrative remaining popular could dramatically increases the chances of Big Eyes reaching its potential.</p>
<h3><strong>Broader Cryptocurrency Market</strong></h3>
<p>The broader market’s performance is crucial to the Big Eyes coin&#8217;s success. If the markets are performing well, most coins will increase in price. On the other hand, poorly performing markets make it difficult for individual coins to grow.</p>
<p>Despite the Bitcoin halving, two factors are looming over the crypto industry which could halt its growth in the short term: global macroeconomics and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/global-crypto-regulation-body-likely-next-year-top-official-says-2022-05-12/">growing crypto regulation</a>.</p>
<p>That said, we remain long-term bullish on crypto, and historically speaking, crypto has always entered a bull market following the Bitcoin halving.</p>
<h2><strong>What do Other Analysts Forecast for Big Eyes?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While we have based our Big Eyes price prediction on fundamentals, tokenomics and comparing the project to similar ones, it can also be helpful to take note of other analysts’ predictions too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Techopedia, the Big Eyes coin could reach as high as $0.0015 by the end of 2023, with potential lows of $0.0001.</p>
<p><strong>Techopedia</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OvenAdd expects the Big Eyes crypto to reach a maximum price of $0.0008, with a minimum expected price of $0.0006 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>OvenAdd</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Cryptomode, Big Eyes could reach $1 in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>Cryptomode</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Newswatchtv claims that the Big Eyes price could be 10X in current months. This would equate to a token price of $0.0052 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Newswatchtv</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Codecodex claims Big Eyes could do a 50X from its presale stage one price by the end of 2023. This would result in a price of $0.005.</p>
<p><strong>Codecodex</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the exact price predictions vary greatly, all the analysts above agree that the Big Eyes coin has plenty of room for growth. That said, is it the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">best ICO</a> to buy for 2023?</p>
<h2><strong>Is Big Eyes the Best Crypto to Buy in 2023?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Big Eyes is one of the best high-risk coins in 2023. However, many pundits have displayed concern about the project, stating that it could be a rug pull or lack of utility. </p>
<p>Although the Big Eyes team have addressed these concerns, there are two other presale <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/which-crypto-10x-potential-april.htm">cryptos with 10X potential</a> that analysts regard as safer than Big Eyes. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Offers High Staking Yields And Dynamic Token Burns For Long Term Growth<br /></strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is rapidly gaining momentum among investors, particularly for its association with the highly anticipated approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>$BTCETF’s presale is structured in ten stages, with a tiered pricing strategy for early investors. Starting at $0.005 per token, the cost is set to increase to $0.0068 by the final presale stage incrementally.</p>
<p>The early stages of the presale have already shown impressive traction and investor confidence, with the project nearing the $2 million milestone in just over three weeks.</p>
<p>At press time, buyers can get the $BTCETF tokens for $0.006 each. </p>
<h3><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></h3>
<p>One of the key features of the Bitcoin ETF Token is the high staking APY, offering over 130% at the time of writing. </p>
<p>However, investors should note that this rate is expected to decrease as more tokens are staked, underscoring the benefits of early staking.</p>
<p>In addition to the staking options, $BTCETF implements a dynamic token burn mechanism. This approach plans to permanently remove up to 25% of the total token supply through several milestone-based burns, which are tied to the development and rollout of the spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Key milestones include the approval and launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF, $BTCETF reaching $100 million in trading volume, and further burns as additional milestones are met, adding a deflationary aspect to the token&#8217;s economics.</p>
<h3><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></h3>
<p>Per the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token whitepaper</a>, BTCETF’s total supply is capped at 2.1 billion, with 840 million set aside for the presale. This supply cap is crucial in maintaining the token’s scarcity and perceived value. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the project has undergone a smart contract audit by Coinsult, assuring reliability and security for potential investors.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Platform With A Unique Stake-To-Mine Model For Bitcoin Mining And Passive Income</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX) is an emerging with an innovative approach to Bitcoin cloud mining. Within a short span since its launch, Bitcoin Minetrix has caught investor attention, raising over $4.4 million in just a few weeks. </p>
<p>The platform’s unique &#8216;Stake-to-Mine&#8217; model is an eco-friendly alternative to traditional Bitcoin mining practices.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Minetrix presale is currently live, featuring a tiered pricing strategy with the token currently available at $0.0119. This price will increase to $0.0148 in the final round of the presale.</p>
<p>Out of a total supply of 4 billion $BTCMTX tokens, a significant 70% (2.8 billion tokens) is allocated for the presale, targeting a hard cap of over $33 million. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/333341/bitcoin-minetrix-img.jpg" alt="bitcoin minetrix stake-to-mine project" /></p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</a>, the core feature of the platform is its &#8216;Stake-to-Mine&#8217; mechanism. Users stake $BTCMTX tokens to earn non-tradable mining credits, which can be burned to acquire Bitcoin mining power on the platform. </p>
<p>This unique approach offers users a simpler, more secure alternative to traditional cloud mining, free from common risks such as fraud and rigid contractual obligations. </p>
<p>The staking APY currently stands at an impressive rate of over 130%, although this is subject to change as more tokens are staked.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix prioritizes user convenience and control. The platform provides an integrated dashboard, accessible on both desktop and mobile, offering users comprehensive insights into their mining activities, including expected returns and real-time mining statistics.</p>
<p>Also, the platform&#8217;s smart contract has undergone a thorough audit by Coinsult, ensuring transparency and security for its users. Users can enter the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix">Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram channel</a> to get the latest updates.</p>

<h2><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although meme coins are currently performing well, they come with a lot more risk than utility coins. However, Bitcoin ETF Token is the perfect crossover, leveraging the buzz around the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs while also providing utility. Since the token is in its presale phase, investors can purchase $BTCETF at a discounted price, but they must act fast as the price is set to increase soon.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What is the Big Eyes coin?</strong></p>
<p>Big Eyes is a new presale meme coin that features high-quality artwork, a large community and a lengthy roadmap that includes NFTs and building its community further. While the Big Eyes coin does not present any immediate utility to holders, the roadmap indicates they will issue Big Eyes e-stickers and run community events. We expect holders to get exclusive access to these roadmap developments.</p>
<p><strong>What is the future of Big Eyes?</strong></p>
<p>Many analysts have disputing opinions on the future of Big Eyes. Some expect the coin to reach $1 by the end of 2023, whereas others see potential lows of $0.0001. Our Big Eyes price prediction lies somewhere in between, estimating a price between $0.0009 and $0.0005 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>What will the Big Eyes price be in 2025?</strong></p>
<p>Our Big Eyes coin price prediction estimates a potential price between $0.0022 and $0.001 by the end of 2025. The Big Eyes team is focused on marketing and rewarding their community. These are the two key ingredients for a meme coin to succeed long-term, which is why we are bullish on the Big Eyes price in 2025.</p>

<p><i><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>Having raised $140K in its first two days of the presale, the Launchpad XYZ token could be poised to become one of the best presales of 2023. Since the presale is just beginning, this could present the perfect opportunity for investors looking for considerable returns. Nonetheless, this comes with risks, which we assess in this article.</p>
<p>This Launchpad XYZ price prediction provides price estimates for the crypto-based on various factors, including its use cases, tokenomics and competition. </p>
<h2><strong>Launchpad XYZ Presale &#8211; Quick Overview</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before we break down the Launchpad XYZ coin, we have summarised the key points below.</p>
<p><strong>End of 2023: </strong>With the presale set to end in mid-2023, we expect the coin to receive considerable hype throughout the year. This leads us to expect a price of <strong>$0.135</strong> by the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>End of 2024: </strong>The team will have implemented most of the project’s core features, providing the platform runs smoothly; the price could hit <strong>$0.19 </strong>by the end of 2024.</p>
<p><strong>End of 2025: </strong>With the app maturing and the broader crypto market expected to hit new all-time highs, $LPX looks set to hit <strong>$0.32 </strong>by the end of 2025.</p>
<p><strong>End of 2030: </strong>If Launchpad XYZ achieves its aim to become the hub for all blockchain dApps, and onboard 10M users, we expect the price to hit <strong>$0.48 </strong>by the end of 2030.</p>

<h2><strong>Launchpad XYZ Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Launchpad XYZ is a user-friendly portal aggregating data, services and markets from across the blockchain into one easy-to-use application. The project aims to become the go-to all-in-one dApp that delivers seamless, non-custodial crypto activity to the masses.</p>
<p>The platform offers a vast range of applications and services, which we will explore later; but for now, it’s worth mentioning that the core component of Launchpad XYZ is the $LPX token. The token will grant holders access to the platform and all its features. </p>
<h3><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3>
<p>Launchpad XYZ has a total supply of one billion tokens, with the team allocating 25% to the presale. </p>
<p>The team has allocated the remaining 75% to the project’s treasury. While this could be considered a large number of coins in the hands of the treasury, the team has already addressed the matter.</p>
<p>The treasury funds are locked until Bitcoin’s bull market is confirmed at $35K. From there, 1% of funds will be unlocked each day that Bitcoin closes $1,000 higher until $85K, when all funds will be available. </p>
<p>This vesting strategy ensures the market can handle the extra volume and prevents any detriment to the $LPX price.</p>
<p>As mentioned, platform users require the coin to access the Launchpad XYZ services. Moreover, the platform allows users to stake their coins and earn passive rewards, which will reduce its available supply. These factors could make Launchpad XYZ one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the highest potential</a>, but that all depends on its presale.</p>
<h3><strong>Presale</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A presale is an event where investors can purchase a cryptocurrency at a fixed price before it launches on exchanges. Presales provide early access to new coins, which can prove particularly lucrative. However, newer coins have increased risk since they usually do not have a long price history or fully functioning product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Launchpad XYZ coin presale has a $5 million soft cap and a $12.5 million hard cap. The $LPX presale price puts the fully-diluted market cap at the launch at $50 million, but the circulating market cap will be $12.5 million.</p>
<p>The presale is currently in stage one, with nine more rounds to follow before its IEO. The current price is $0.035, with the IEO price set at $0.070. The price difference between the stage one presale and its IEO could net investors a 100% gain.</p>

<h2><strong>Launchpad XYZ Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While long-term price predictions rely on utility and tokenomics, short-term price is often dictated by hype, trends and narratives.</p>
<p>The fact that the coin has raised $140K in two days shows investors’ interest in the project. We expect this trend to continue, particularly as more media outlets and influencers begin to pick up on the coin as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best presales</a>.<img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112343/271555/launchpad3.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ features" /></p>
<p>As mentioned, narratives play a crucial role in cryptocurrency’s short-term price action; this can be seen in the meteoric rise in the price of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/">PEPE</a> following <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/business/dogecoin-surges-after-elon-musk-changes-twitter-icon-b1072124.html">Dogecoin’s surge</a> just a week earlier.</p>
<p>With massive organisations like Centralbanking.com taking note of the <a href="https://www.centralbanking.com/fintech/crypto-assets/7949216/crypto-market-faces-growing-fragmentation-bis-paper">cryptocurrency industry’s fragmentation issue</a>, it becomes clear that it requires more user-friendly solutions to experience mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>Adding to that the fact Launchpad XYZ is in its beginning presales stages and has confirmed in its <a href="https://whitepaper.launchpad.xyz/">whitepaper</a> that it will partner with leading brands and marketing agencies to onboard 10 million new users, means the coin could gain massive traction in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Therefore, our Launchpad XYZ price prediction estimates a price of <strong>$0.135</strong> by the end of 2023. If our forecast is accurate, it would equal a $LPX price increase of 248% from its stage one presale price.</p>
<h2><strong>Launchpad XYZ Price Prediction 2024</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While the $LPX price will mainly be based on hype and narratives in 2023, additional factors will come into play in 2024. </p>
<p>Firstly, looking at the roadmap, the team aims to roll out all its planned developments by the end of 2024. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that newer crypto projects have low market caps is that investors can be apprehensive in case the road map does not come to fruition. However, investors often flock to purchase the coin once the roadmap is achieved.</p>
<p>This is evident in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">Ethereum’s price</a>, as it has risen over time to a $200 billion market cap, as its network has become more secure and is slowly becoming more scalable. However, at first, the Ethereum market cap was as low as $40 million since the blockchain was little more than a concept.</p>
<p>Therefore, we expect the Launchpad XYZ coin’s demand to drastically increase throughout 2024 as its road map rolls out.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112343/271556/launchpad4.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ roadmap" /></figure>
<p>While we scoured dApps across all blockchains, we could not find a competitor that provides a similar service to Launchpad XYZ . With Launchpad XYZ combining the services typically offered by five to ten different applications into one app, it seems there is no competition. With that in mind, we expect crypto users to flock to the application for its convenience and unique selling point.</p>
<p>That said, when considering the Launchpad XYZ price in 2024, it is also important to consider the coin’s vesting schedule. As mentioned, the Launchpad XYZ treasury&#8217;s coins will be unlocked as Bitcoin climbs above $35K.</p>
<p>With many expert analysts like <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/bitcoin-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered-says/ar-AA1agkr3">Standard Charted predicting Bitcoin will hit $100K in 2024</a>, we expect the year to be successful for Bitcoin. With that in mind, there could be some excess sell pressure impacting the $LPX price.</p>
<p>However, we expect the implementation of staking plus the token’s utility to easily offset this sell pressure. Moreover, considering 2024 should be the peak bull market, many new investors will flock to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-profitable-cryptocurrency.htm">most profitable altcoins</a> to capitalise on the rising prices, pushing prices even higher.</p>
<p>Therefore, our Launchpad XYZ price prediction forecasts that the coin will hit <strong>$0.19</strong> by the end of 2024. Providing our estimate is accurate, the 2024 price will result in a 442% profit for first-round presale investors.</p>
<h2><strong>Launchpad XYZ Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking ahead to 2025, Launchpad XYZ will be two years old. With its roadmap developed and the initial hype behind it, the $LPX price will be mainly utility and supply driven.</p>
<p>While it is unclear whether Launchpad XYZ will achieve mass adoption, the coin’s whitepaper explains it is the project’s primary focus and strategy. This is an important factor to consider &#8211; the team has a clear goal of providing a user-friendly crypto experience, which increases the chances of mass adoption.<img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112343/271549/launchpad5.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ team" /></p>
<p>A literature review by a team of American and British blockchain researchers found <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/16/1/23#B23-jrfm-16-00023">usability is a primary barrier to adoption</a> among would-be crypto users. Therefore, Launchpad XYZ use case of onboarding users to crypto through a more seamless user experience gives it the potential to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term cryptos</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider regarding the Launchpad XYZ price is its supply. If the Standard Charted price prediction mentioned earlier is correct, all the coins will be unlocked by 2024. As such, no more coins will be released in 2025 or beyond since its total supply will already be circulating.</p>
<p>Moreover, because the coin has real utility and the platform has a built-in staking mechanism, there is a strong argument that demand could massively outweigh supply by this point. </p>
<p>However, it is important to remember that this theory relies on Bitcoin price hitting $85K before 2025 and the project achieving its goal of mass adoption. Nonetheless, the team has delivered on its roadmap and performed excellently so far.</p>
<p>Therefore, our Launchpad XYZ price prediction sees the $LPX price hitting <strong>$0.32</strong> by the end of 2025. If the price reaches our estimate, this would equal an 814% profit for round one presale investors.</p>
<h2><strong>Launchpad XYZ Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Estimating a coin’s long-term price can be challenging, mainly because crypto markets are volatile, and black swan events can be frequent. It is important to consider this when looking at long-term investments, particularly for presale coins with little track record.</p>
<p>That said, a cryptocurrency is more likely to sustain itself long-term when it has a way to generate revenue, as it can continue to build and develop without relying on coins prices rising. Launchpad XYZ generates revenue through transaction fees on many different products and services it provides, like its DEX.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Launchpad XYZ could become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptocurrencies</a> to buy long-term, providing it achieves its goal of mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>Another consideration for the $LPX price is that, unlike many other new coins, it is not boxed into one particular product or service. In other words, the platform is not reliant on one crypto narrative, such as NFTs or metaverse performing well for it to succeed.</p>
<p>This could make it a safer long-term alternative to presale coins operating in just one category.</p>
<p>Therefore, considering its ability to generate revenue and diversify, Launchpad XYZ offers a long-term strategy that could prove profitable. </p>
<p>As such, our Launchpad XYZ price prediction estimates a price of <strong>$0.48</strong> by the end of 2030, resulting in a 1271% increase for first-round presale investors.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the Launchpad XYZ Coin?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provides current web3 users with a more integrated experience where they can now manage all their crypto activity from one application.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Easy-to-use interface and a beginner-friendly wallet where users can sign up with just a email address and phone number.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Offers access to all aspects of cryptocurrency and blockchain, including education and trading signals.</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Launchpad XYZ whitepaper states that it aims to onboard 10 million users to web3. It aims to do this by partnering with world-leading brands and marketing agencies to integrate web3 processes into their systems. </p>
<p>That said, the platform is also a user-friendly option for both beginner and advanced crypto users to access a wide range of data from a single dashboard.</p>
<p>One of the platform&#8217;s main features is being able to browse through a wide range of markets or dApps to find the most suitable for you. For example, users can browse NFTs from any marketplace or sift through every Play-to-Earn or metaverse project, all from the Launchpad dashboard.</p>
<p>On top of that, users can browse new presales, create a crypto wallet with a phone number and email address, use AI to find the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">best new crypto coins</a>, and make swaps on the DEX and NFT DEX.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ offers everything users need to get started in crypto without having to manage dozens of different applications. Instead, it provides a more ‘web2-like’ user experience while offering the advantages of web3, such as the revenue share model, fractionalization of real-world assets and self-custody.</p>
<h2><strong>What Factors Affect the Launchpad XYZ Crypto Price?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are various factors that determine whether our Launchpad XYZ price forecast proves accurate. We have listed some of the most impactful ones below.</p>
<h3><strong>Revenue</strong></h3>
[Su-note] Some projects rely on inflationary tokens with no supply cap to fund their future development. However, it is important that crypto has a capped supply and alternative ways of raising funds to increase in price long-term.</p>
<p>If Launchpad XYZ generates mass adoption into web3, this will enable it to capture different types of transaction fees for users interacting with its platform. This means the project will have the financial capacity to continue building long-term. In turn, this will attract new investors and the media&#8217;s attention as the platform progresses.</p>
<h3><strong>Hype and Awareness</strong></h3>
<p>Presales can sometimes be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">coins with the highest upside</a>. This was evident in the recent <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tamadoge/">Tamadoge surge</a>, which saw first-round presale investors quickly gain an 18X profit. That said, the coin corrected shortly after, showing that much of the initial price surge was down to hype.</p>
<p>Therefore, the hype that Launchpad XYZ generates during its presale could significantly affect its short-term price in 2023. One of the driving factors in developing hype is media and influencer attention. </p>
<p>Considering its use case and ability to raise a massive amount of funds in two days, we expect the media to catch wind and focus on the coin much more in the coming months.</p>
<h3><strong>Utility</strong></h3>
<p>In contrast to hype, utility will drive Launchpad XYZ long-term price. To climb into the mid-large market cap range, we would expect to see the project follow through on its goals and being to gain adoption, providing real value to its users.</p>
<p>Considering it is tackling one of crypto’s main issues, we believe the coin could quickly capture a large user base. However, Launchpad&#8217;s roadmap is ambitious, and the issue it aims to solve is complex, so it must perform exceptionally well to suceed.</p>
<h2><strong>Is Launchpad XYZ the Best Coin to Buy In 2023?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Despite being two days old, the $LPX presale has already raised $140K. It could hit its presale hard cap in record time if this momentum continues. Although investing in presale coins is not risk-free, some projects have provided vast returns for early investors. With that in mind, there are a couple of reasons we have high hopes for the Launchpad XYZ presale.</p>
<p>With the team already lining up its exchange listings, we could see the price explode following its IEO.</p>
<p>Moreover, as we discussed earlier, roadmap developments will be ongoing throughout 2023 and 2024. These developments for 2023 include the launch of the DEX, NFT Directory, Presale Directory, and Gaming Hub.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ is a crypto presale token, so it offers investors the opportunity to invest at a discounted rate prior to listing on a public exchange. Some presales in the past have generated big returns for investors which is why some crypto enthusiasts add new projects to their portfolios. All investments come with risks and Launchpad XYZ presale is no exception so most investors conduct their own research before participating in the presale. </p>
<p>This will give potential investors the confidence to buy the coin as they see the team executing their plans. These new investors boost the $LPX price, benefitting presale investors.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we will likely see the price steadily increase throughout 2023, beginning in its presale. Therefore, since it is in its infancy, the Launchpad XYZ presale could provide investors with a lucrative opportunity to purchase the coin at a massive discount.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Buy Launchpad XYZ </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Since Launchpad XYZ presale is ongoing, investors can only purchase $LPX tokens through the project’s website. We have explained the process in five simple steps below so that you can buy $LPX coins in less than ten minutes.</p>
<h3><strong>Step One: Create a Software Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Since buying $LPX involves interacting with a decentralised application, you must create a software wallet. We recommend getting started with MetaMask. </p>
<p>To create a MetaMask wallet, visit their website (or search MetaMask on the App Store if you are using mobile), then download the wallet to your device. Finally, follow the instructions to create a wallet, ensuring you keep your seed phrase secure and private.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112343/271550/buylaunchpad1.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet" /><strong>Step Two: Buy Crypto to Fund Your Investment</strong></h3>
<p>You can connect your card to your software wallet (if your wallet provider supports it) and buy ETH or USDT with your card. </p>
<p>Alternatively, visit a crypto exchange like Binance, send fiat to your account, and then swap the fiat for Ethereum or USDT. </p>
<p>Next, send the crypto to your wallet, ensuring you have extra ETH for gas fees. To send the crypto to your wallet, visit your wallet dashboard, copy your wallet address, then visit the exchange, click on your crypto balance, then ‘send’, then paste your wallet address in the text box.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Three: Connect Your Wallet to Launchpad XYZ </strong></h3>
<p>Visit the Launchpad XYZ website, and click the ‘Connect Wallet’ button. Then sign the transaction when prompted by your software wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112343/271558/buylaunchpad2.jpg" alt="Connect crypto wallet" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step Four: Purchase $LPX</strong></h3>
<p>Choose the amount of crypto you want to buy and follow the checkout instructions to complete your purchase.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/112343/271551/buylaunchpad3.jpg" alt="LPX token presale purchase" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step Five: Claim Your Crypto</strong></h3>
<p>At the end of the presale, visit the Launchpad XYZ website again and connect your wallet. From there, you can claim your crypto. To view it in your wallet, copy the $LPX smart contract address, and click import token inside your software wallet, pasting the address into the text box.</p>

<h2><strong>Best Place To Buy Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Binance is renowned for its comprehensive services, ranging from spot trading to futures, P2P transactions, and more. Its user-friendly interface makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced traders.</p>
<p>The platform supports Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactions, allowing users to buy and sell cryptos directly with each other. This feature enables a more personalized trading experience and often provides more flexible payment options, enhancing the platform&#8217;s accessibility to a global audience.</p>
<p>One of Binance’s key features is its competitive fee structure. The platform charges a standard 0.1% trading fee for both makers and takers, among the lowest in the industry. This fee can be further reduced by using Binance Coin (BNB), the exchange&#8217;s native crypto, to pay for transaction fees.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="462" class="alignnone wp-image-136746 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="Binance buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto-768x394.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Binance also offers staking services, where users can earn rewards by holding certain cryptos. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for staking varies depending on the asset and market conditions. This feature provides an additional income stream for users and contributes to the network stability of the staked cryptos.</p>
<p>Security is a top priority for Binance. The exchange uses strong security measures, including two-factor authentication (2FA), to protect user accounts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Binance</a>
<p><em>Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>One of the main issues the crypto industry faces is its poor user experience. Even the most advanced crypto users occasionally struggle with managing multiple dApps, blockchains or wallets. </p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ provides an innovative solution and looks to take a giant leap forward in improving cryptos usability, thus generating mass adoption. With exchange listings coming shortly, the presale could be the perfect opportunity to obtain a significant discount on one of the top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">cryptos that could explode</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Fight Out Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Fight Out erupted into the mainstream crypto news in late 2022. Its innovative approach to solving pressing fitness industry issues using blockchain technology quickly made it a favourite of investors and the media.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this led to considerable demand for the Fight Out coin leading to almost $3 million in presale funding. The project is still in its stage one presale, priced at $0.0166 per FGHT token. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250621/fght-1-1.jpg" alt="Fight Out presale homepage" /></figure>
<p>Because the Fight Out crypto is still in its stage one presale, this is the lowest price the token has ever been. Not only that, but in 8 days, the next phase of the presale will start, and the token price will increase. It&#8217;s no doubt that most investors are flocking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-fightout-token.htm">buy Fight Out tokens</a> right now.</p>
<p>The project aims to raise $5 million during the first phase of presale funding to help launch its app and first Fight Out gyms. Implementing these developments will secure Fight Out as one of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm" rel="nofollow">the best cryptocurrencies of 2023.</a></p>
<p>Early investors of Fight Out are rewarded with extra tokens, receiving up to 25% rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250604/fght2-1.jpg" alt="Fight Out presale bonuses" /></figure>
<p>Also, presale investors can earn further rewards on their tokens through vesting. All presale tokens are automatically vested for three months, but users can make up to 25% on top of their investment by choosing to vest for longer. </p>
<p>Overall, investors could earn 50% more Fight Out coins through the presale and vesting, lowering the initial investment cost to $0.0083 per token!</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250605/fght3-1.jpg" alt="Fight Out vesting bonuses" /></figure>
<p>Fight Out has a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with up to 3 billion reserved for presale and an additional 15% dedicated for rewards to early investors. Another 5% of tokens will be used for exchange liquidity, and the remaining 50% will be vested and unlocked over five years to enable sustained growth for the project.</p>
<p>Fight Out is a crypto solving real-world issues with blockchain innovations. It has a proven team and a solid approach to tokenomics and sustainable development. Therefore, it is in pole position to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm" rel="nofollow">best cryptos to watch</a> this year.</p>

<h2><strong>Fight Out Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>This year is expected to be huge for Fight Out in terms of its roadmap. Firstly, Q1 will see its initial exchange listing (IEO).</p>
<p>The confirmed starting price for the IEO is $0.0333 per token. This is double its current presale price. </p>
<p>Where the price goes from there ultimately depends on the demand for the token. However, the price could explode from here due to the three-month vesting schedule and many tokens being locked for up to five years. Could this be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm" rel="nofollow">next crypto to explode</a>?</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250606/fght1-1.jpg" alt="Fight Out Q1 roadmap" /></figure>
<p>Q1 will also see the first Fight Out gym launched along with the official website and staking. So for the first quarter of 2023, demand will be driven more by investors and speculation than users. But we could see a surge in new investors based on the project&#8217;s popularity so far. It could also spur the FGHT token to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm" rel="nofollow">best staking coins</a> on the market.</p>
<p>Q2 will see the Fight Out app go live. Also, the first pro-fighter workouts will be posted. In the second quarter, real demand for the coin will grow.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250609/fght1-2.jpg" alt="Fight Out Q2 roadmap" /></figure>
<p>The partnerships with multiple high-profile fighters and the crypto&#8217;s problem-solving approach could result in a massive growth of platform users during this quarter. And due to the token vesting schedule, there will be very little supply to fill the growing demand.</p>
<p>The third quarter of 2023 is when the app will begin to lock in or nurture its existing user base. It will start to provide new ways users can earn, social features and a beginner&#8217;s boxing course. This is where the app will secure its place as a<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm" rel="nofollow"> long-term crypto </a>player in the fitness industry.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250610/fght1-3.jpg" alt="Fight Out Q3 roadmap" /></figure>
<p>2022 was a challenging year for the cryptocurrency industry. Despite this, the team have achieved everything they have set out to so far. If this continues and the markets shift upwards, the FGHT token could see a much higher price by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>But even if markets remain flat, the long vesting schedule of the Fight Out token means there will not be a lot of sell pressure. Therefore, its real-world utility should cause the demand to outweigh the supply. So we could expect a price between $0.05 and $0.08 by the end of 2023.</p>
<h2><strong>Fight Out Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>By 2025, the Fight Out ecosystem will have fully developed. This means workout programs, personalized workouts, in-real-life gyms, and its in-app marketplace will have all been launched.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250613/fght1-4.jpg" alt="Fight Out Q4 and beyond roadmap" /></figure>
<p>The project will have had ample time to acquire users. Its incentivizing model, which creates a positive feedback loop to people who exercise, will likely have transcended beyond the crypto community and penetrated the fitness industry. </p>
<p>Fight Out offers an accessible bridge between web2 and web3, allowing users to sign up with just an email. This should make the onboarding process easier for users outside the cryptocurrency community. </p>
<p>The global virtual fitness industry is worth around $21 billion and experienced a compound annual growth rate of 39.4% from the previous year. If this trend continues, the industry will be worth approximately $40 billion by 2025. </p>
<p>Fight Out is the first project to incentivize consumers from the industry. Although there are other <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-move-to-earn-crypto.htm" rel="nofollow">Move-to-Earn crypto</a> projects, Fight Out is the first with a sustainable business strategy and tokenomics &#8211; and it tracks more than just steps! This gives Fight Out a first-mover advantage in the market. </p>
<p>Even if Fight Out were to capture just 4% of the total market share by the end of 2025, this would put the token at a $1.6 billion market cap or a $0.16 per FGHT coin valuation.</p>
<p>However, this only considers the fitness industry and not the crypto community. But with the crypto industry&#8217;s support, it could easily double to a $3.2 billion market cap (or $0.32 per coin).</p>
<h2><strong>Fight Out Price Prediction 2030</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>It is difficult to say where the project will be moving into 2030.</p>
<p>But with its focus on collaborating with top industry sports people and continuous innovation, it could significantly impact the global fitness industry. With this, investors will likely continue to join the project with expectations of further growth.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250614/fght1-5.jpg" alt="Fight Out spending allocations" /></figure>
<p>By 2030, the vesting schedule will be complete, meaning the FGHT tokens will have been used to develop the project further. We have yet to determine precisely what this will look like, but we could expect to see more gym openings, collaborations, and app development. </p>
<p>If all goes to plan, the end of 2030 could see a token price as high as $0.6! This would put the total market cap at $6 billion. Even in today&#8217;s market, this would only put Fight Out as the 20th-highest coin by fully diluted market cap.</p>
<p>With the expected continued growth of the cryptocurrency industry, this is a conservative estimation, and there is even potential to see much higher.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is the Fight Out Crypto?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Historically, cryptocurrencies which solve real-world issues have performed very well. For example, Bitcoin solved the problem of the centralized flow and control of money, and Ethereum solved the trust and permission issues for applications and systems.</p>
<p>Fight Out is the next generation of cryptocurrency, built on the Ethereum network to solve the number one issue in the fitness industry: people quitting exercise.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how busy gyms are in January? Many newcomers make positive life choices and begin to focus on their fitness. But new members steadily decrease until around late February when numbers return to normal. Why is this?</p>
<p>The Fight Out white paper explains there are three main reasons for this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional gyms lack guidance.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personal trainers are too expensive for most people.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gyms often lack social and community aspects.</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All these findings result in many newcomers to the gym being unable to stick with it. This is where Fight Out comes in. A blockchain-powered fitness solution which incentivizes users to exercise.</p>
<p>It provides users with structured workout programs from high-profile personal trainers and martial artists. Every workout earns attributes for the users&#8217; avatar in the form of a soulbound token (a non-transferable NFT). These avatars can compete with others and give the app a competitive and social element.</p>
<p>Finally, users gain the REPS token, which can be used to purchase items from the Fight Out marketplace. The REPS token can be used to buy things such as supplements, apparel, in-game wearables or workout programs. Users can also swap REPS for the FGHT token and then exchange them for any other cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2><strong>What Affects the Value of Fight Out</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Supply and Demand &#8211; The first thing which affects the token value is supply and demand. The price will increase if more buyers are in the market than sellers. The same goes for the other way around. Due to the token&#8217;s long vesting schedule, there will likely be little supply. And due to its problem-solving approach, affiliation with influential figures and media coverage, there could be a lot of demand.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency Adoption &#8211; If the cryptocurrency market grows, it usually brings all good projects with it. Fight Out is in a tremendous position to capture the broader market&#8217;s liquidity if cryptocurrency adoption increases.</p>
<p>Fight Out Presale &#8211; The Fight Out token is currently in its presale. These presale price points will lead to strong buy walls from investors who missed the presale but want to get in at a low price, forcing the price to bounce upwards if it nears them.</p>
<h2><strong>Is Fight Out the Best Crypto to Buy in 2023?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Fight Out has already raised $3 million in its presale alone. Investors understand the crypto industry is moving beyond DeFi and NFTs, and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-crypto-bull-run-coins.htm" rel="nofollow">next bull market</a> will see the industry tackling issues people face in the real world.</p>
<p>Blockchain has been touted to revolutionize the world as we know it. But until now, most blockchain innovations have come in the virtual world. But investors see the power in projects which solve everyday problems.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250615/fght1-6.jpg" alt="Expected market values of related industries to Fight Out" /></figure>
<p>What gives Fight Out so much potential is that the cryptocurrency community already embraces it, and it has a first-mover advantage in the $21 billion virtual fitness industry. The combination of crypto community investment and real demand for the FGHT token to buy workout programs and marketplace items could make the token price explode.</p>
<p>Early this year, the coin will have its IEO, and what the roadmap calls its &#8220;CEX listing drive&#8221;. The initial price is $0.0333, and exchange listings will include the likes of LBank.</p>
<p>Overall, Fight Out is a truly innovative project with enormous potential. It could be the coin to onboard the masses to cryptocurrency through social and incentivized fitness. With this in mind, now is the best time to buy Fight Out before its price increases for CEX listings. </p>

<h2><strong>How To Buy Fight Out</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/fightout" rel="nofollow">Fight Out</a> is currently in its presale, so you can only buy it from its website. To do so, you will need an Ethereum hot wallet. The two most common ones people use are MetaMask and Trust Wallet. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Create A Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>For this guide, we will use MetaMask, but the process is almost identical if you use Trust Wallet. If you are using a mobile, you can install the wallet to your phone via your app store and then use the in-app browser to visit the Fight Out website. But if you are on a desktop, you will want to install the extension to your browser.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250616/fght1-7.jpg" alt="Metamask wallet Chrome extension" /></figure>
<p>Once you have installed the extension or app, you will be instructed to generate a new wallet, write down a seed phrase and create a password. Keep multiple copies of your seed phrase in separate secure locations. Losing this means you could lose access to your coins, and if someone else gets it, they could steal your crypto.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Buy USDT or ETH</strong></h3>
<p>Next, you either have the option to get USDT or ETH. You can do this by paying with your bank card in the wallet or transferring it from another wallet into your hot wallet. If you are using MetaMask, just click buy, select Transak, and choose the amount of USDT or ETH you want. You will need this to purchase your FGHT tokens.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250617/fght1-8.jpg" alt="USD to ETH transaction" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Connect Wallet and Purchase FGHT</strong></h3>
<p>Now for the exciting part! Visit the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/fightout/" rel="nofollow">Fight Out website</a>, click connect wallet and follow the instructions. You have three options here, but if you followed along, you would pay with ETH or USDT, depending on the tokens you bought. Remember, you will have to pay gas fees, so keep some extra ETH to one side.<br /><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/101507/250618/fght1-9.jpg" alt="FGHT token presale" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Claim Your FGHT Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>All presale tokens are vested for three months, and you can choose to vest for longer for extra rewards. But once your vesting period is up, you can claim your FGHT.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Fight Out has already proven immensely popular. It is one of the first cryptos with real-world utility. It has already amassed a community of over 65,000 Twitter followers and $2.9 million in funding. </p>
<p>The project is still in its early stages but is already showing positive signs for the future. Therefore, we have high hopes for the price of FGHT going forward.</p>
