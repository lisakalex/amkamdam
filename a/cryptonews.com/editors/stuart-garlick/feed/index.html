										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A blog post from an Estonian government official about a new crypto-token, estcoin, has added to widespread excitement over the Baltic country and its plans for using cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. Should investors in crypto matters look to Estonia next? </p><p>On the official blog of Estonian e-Residency (the government-run organization that issues official ID cards for the setting-up and basing of companies in Estonia by non-residents of the country), e-Residency Managing Director Kaspar Korjus explained the concept behind estcoin. &#8220;[They] were proposed as a way to raise money and support for the development of our digital nation. We would also want to structure the tokens so that they help build our e-resident community and incentivise our own key objective, which is to increase the number of companies started in Estonia through e-Residency.&#8221;</p><p>Estonia, as a European Union member state, is tightly tied into the European Central Bank framework, meaning it cannot launch a full cryptocurrency. Korjus acknowledges this. &#8220;Much of the criticism of estcoin was based on the fact that Estonia simply can&rsquo;t start its own cryptocurrency even if it wanted to&#8230;That&rsquo;s why we have always referred to estcoin as a proposed &#8216;crypto token&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>Siiri Suutre, from the Public Relations Department of the Estonian Ministry of Finance, exercises restrained enthusiasm on the details of Estonia&#8217;s future plans. &#8220;The e-Residency team has come up with the idea of an estcoin, which is envisaged to be an official crypto-token of the Estonian State. The Ministry of Finance, and also the Central Bank of Estonia, are more cautious in this regard. We are aware that it is important for Estonia to endorse innovation but we have to balance it with consumer and investor protection and financial stability issues.&#8221;</p><p>According to Suutre, there is a fundamental philosophical or ideological question &ndash; how much endorsement or interference from the state does the cryptocurrency community really want? </p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t anticipate that cryptocurrencies will acquire systemic importance as means of payment in the near future but of course we are monitoring the situation and how it develops. We do believe that cyptocurrencies and the underlying technologies are going to play a certain role in the financial sector,&rdquo; Suutre said. However, she added that the markets and the technologies will have to mature quite a bit.</p><p>The Ministry of Finance published a study in 2016 into the possibility of a policy for recognizing and using cryptocurrencies. Suutre explained, &#8220;The main conclusion was that outside the financial sector, there aren&rsquo;t currently any noticeable legal obstacles for private parties to agree upon paying for goods and services in cryptocurrencies, as far as we know.&#8221;</p><p>Some may argue with the assertion that there are no &#8220;noticeable legal obstacles.&#8221;</p><p><b>Law vs. PR</b></p><p>Dutchman Otto de Voogd, these days based in his country of birth, once ran the website referenced by Enberg, btc.ee, which facilitated trades. Back in 2014, de Voogd was contacted by law enforcement, who requested the names, and Estonian ID card numbers, of all Estonia-based Bitcoin traders his site was in contact with. He was also asked to acknowledge that his site was a financial services provider, and was as such covered by the Financial Services Act. The end result was de Voogd shutting down his site and moving his business out of the country. </p><p>When asked for a comment for this article, de Voogd added, on the difference between the bold plans for estcoin and the more tentative reaction of the Ministry of Finance, &#8220;[e-Residency] certainly have the upper hand in the PR department, but in spite of all that, the restrictive laws still stand, so I&#8217;m guessing their power is somewhat limited to publishing nice press statements.&#8221;</p><p>Estonia has, in spite of this criticism from the crypto community, proved itself in other respects a good country in which to start a business, thanks to an efficient e-services infrastructure. Not only that, there are hundreds of Estonian tech startups who are garnering global interest due to doing things in an innovative and eye-catching way. Suutre cited Estonian-run Funderbeam, a blockchain-powered online stock exchange, as an example.</p><p>Due to Estonia&#8217;s recent history as a startup hotbed, it&#8217;s highly likely that, on the heels of estcoin, there will be a panoply of other crypto-solutions proposed by Estonian private businesses, while Funderbeam is one of several innovative enterprises in the country using the blockchain. However, it is equally true that cryptocurrencies, while legal to use in Estonia, and while officially tolerated, are hardly being welcomed with open arms by all areas of government, and cryptocurrency traders will hope to see a change in this regard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning, the Japanese crypto exchange platform Coincheck was hacked and had 526 million XEM (c. USD 400 m) stolen, Lon Wong, President of the NEM.io Foundation, told Cryptonews.com.</p><p>It has nothing to do with NEM &#8211; there is no issue with the tech, and according to them, the blame lies exclusively with Coincheck: </p><p>&ldquo;As far as NEM is concerned, tech is intact. We are not forking. Also, we would advise all exchanges to make use of our multi-signature smart contract which is among the best in the landscape. Coincheck didn&#8217;t use them and that&#8217;s why they could have been hacked. They were very relaxed with their security measures,&#8221; Wong said.</p><blockquote class="left"><p>&#8220;This is the biggest theft in the history of the world,&#8221; he added.</p></blockquote><p>Wong also said that it was one account that stole the tokens, and they will do what they can to track them down. </p><p><b>Watch the Coincheck 500m hack interview with Jeff McDonald, NEM Vice president:</b>.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe width="560" height="315" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kAN0C3__5qU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Following Friday&rsquo;s news of Coincheck being hacked and more than 500 million XEM stolen, their <a href="https://coincheck.com/en/blog/4673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> is being updated to reflect on the current situation of one of Japan&rsquo;s greatest cryptocurrency exchanges. As of right now, sales and purchases of any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin are restricted.</p><p>From Coincheck&rsquo;s official blog, the update says:</p><p><i>Update: 6:19 pm (JST), 1/26 1<br>
Currently, credit card, Pay Easy, and convenience store payments are suspended. We sincerely apologize for these inconveniences and will continue to do our best to be back to normal operations as soon as possible.</i></p><p>As of right now, the XEM coin&rsquo;s price has fallen by 18.46% in the last 24 hours (and the fluctuations are almost impossible to follow, because of their erratic behavior), which is significantly higher than its previous fall of a measly 1% in the week between January 18 and January 25. The coin dropped in price to USD 0.77 at 08:34 UTC today, not long after the news was published on Yahoo Japan. It eventually recovered to USD 0.78, where we are right now, but this is still a far cry from its last week average of USD 1.05. (source: coinmarketcap.com) </p><p>An obvious answer to this sudden plunge would be panic selling &#8211; even though the President of the NEM.io Foundation told Cryptonews.com that the blame lies solely in Coincheck for not using their multi-signature smart contract.</p><p>Reactions vary from people calling this event &ldquo;spreading FUD&rdquo; (Fear, uncertainty and doubt, or a disinformation strategy) to those who are sure this event is just whales* moving money out of his wallet/exchange.&rdquo; The public seems reluctant to consider this a hack, and with good reason: panicking, as we see from the price drop, can play heavy tricks on the market.</p><p>If the hack is confirmed, it will be even bigger than Mt Gox by USD 50m.</p><p>While the blog post apologizes for the inconvenience, many have other, more sinister ideas: &ldquo;Even if this is [a case similar to MtGox], the exchange needs to return investor&#8217;s funds as much as possible,&rdquo; an article on Yahoo Japan argues. &ldquo;If we assume that this business management sloppiness was in order to expand profit, not only management but also shareholders shall be held responsible.&rdquo;</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a6/af9c6bc27c.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a6/af9c6bc27c.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a6/af9c6bc27c.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a6/af9c6bc27c.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a6/af9c6bc27c.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5a6/af9c6bc27c.jpg 1280w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>In purple &#8211; the account that the money was stolen from.</figcaption></figure><p>The implication of the case of MtGox may not be what the officials over at Coincheck want to hear right now, but their users are frozen in fear of the same scenario being reenacted. </p><p>Others argue that it is not actually known if it was a hack yet, because the money has not left the wallet it was moved to. &ldquo;You would want to get that sh*t sold,&rdquo; says Redditor u/Shniper.</p><p>Others warn against panic selling: &ldquo;If a bank gets robbed, do you sell all your dollars?&rdquo; asks u/web2linc.</p><p>It must be mentioned that Coincheck is not registered with Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Authority &#8211; a regulator responsible for overseeing exchanges in the country &#8211; unlike several other prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, such as bitFlyer and Quoine.</p><p>Japanese media seem to be flocking to the Coincheck headquarters, according to reports.<br>
_______</p><p>* <i>The term &ldquo;whale&rdquo; is frequently used to describe the big money cryptocurrency players that show their hand in the crypto market.</i><br>
***<br>
<b>Some of the biggest crypto exchange hacks:</b></p><p><b><u>Mt. Gox</u></b><br>
Two hacks, one in 2011 and one in 2014, were so severe that the Japanese-based Bitcoin exchange was forced to declare bankruptcy. At its peak, Mt. Gox was handling 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. <br>
How much was stolen? Approximately USD 350m</p><p><b><u>NiceHash</u></b><br>
The most recent of the hacks here was on a Slovenian-based exchange (not the first we&#8217;ll mention), which lost 4700 BTC in December 2017. The hack was the result of an employee&#8217;s security credentials being used to access the exchange&#8217;s systems. NiceHash&#8217;s Bitcoin wallet was robbed. <br>
How much was stolen? Approximately USD 80m</p><p><b><u>Bitfinex</u></b><br>
This exchange was at least prepared for the worst when a massive hack happened, the result of a breach in the exchange&#8217;s wallet architecture. Users were refunded gradually, unlike with the earlier Mt. Gox hack.<br>
How much was stolen? Approximately USD 72m</p><p><b><u>The DAO</u></b><br>
The Decentralized Autonomous Organization was set up in 2016, with the aim of allowing for investment using cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately a flaw in the smart contract meant it returned Ether multiple times before updating the system.<br>
How much was stolen? Approximately USD 70m</p><p><b><u>Parity Wallet</u></b><br>
Another Ethereum theft, the hack here was the result of a flaw in the multi-sig wallets used on the Parity client, in July 2017.<br>
How much was stolen? Approximately USD 30m</p><p><b><u>Bitstamp</u></b><br>
Bitstamp was set up in Slovenia as a European-based Bitcoin exchange, with the aim of providing a safe place to do trades. It was hacked in 2015. These days, they&#8217;ve stepped up their security significantly, meaning it is much harder to imagine a repeat hack happening.<br>
How much was stolen? Approximately USD 5m</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As not every cryptocurrency is designed for buying goods and services, it&#8217;s worth taking a look at the most popular ones in terms of spending. </p><p><b>Bitcoin</b><br>
In mid-January, there were more than 11,500 venues where it is possible to spend Bitcoin, according to coinmap.org data. This is currently the largest network of crypto merchants. However, Bitcoin is sometimes criticized for its slowness in transaction and high fees, which are putting off some early adopters hitherto loyal to the almost decade-old currency. One may expect these problems will be solved in the future. <br>
In either case, because of Bitcoin&#8217;s popularity and, up to now, resilience, a wide range of companies have opened up their businesses to transactions using the currency. These range from travel websites to car manufacturers. </p><p><b>Bitcoin Cash</b><br>
For those who like the original concept of Bitcoin, but not the difficulties that have emerged since it became more widely-used (high transaction fees, the slowness of the network, and so on), a separate team has developed Bitcoin Cash.<br>
Born in August of 2017, this cryptocurrency has the aim of being a lighter, more nimble, and more easily scalable alternative to its older brother.<br>
In mid-January, there were 1,040 websites supporting use of Bitcoin Cash, according to acceptbitcoin.cash data. </p><p><b>Dash</b><br>
Dash, or Digital Cash, takes the advantages of the other currencies and repackages them in an easy-to-follow framework, with speedy ordering and stronger anonymity at its centre.<br>
Over 50 online stores are listed on the Dash website as accredited merchants of the cryptocurrency, while there are seven online casinos, five other gaming companies, and 11 web and graphic design agencies who are mentioned as accepting Dash payments. Dash&#8217;s own Merchants&#8217; Map lists 558 separate resources available from 344 locations around the world. </p><p><b>Litecoin</b><br>
Litecoin says, it &#8220;features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency.&#8221;<br>
There are plenty of merchants cited on the Litecoin forum, while Cointal says it is the world&#8217;s first P2P multi-cryptocurrency marketplace, and brings additional flexibility when it comes to using Litecoin along with a whole host of other cryptocurrencies.  </p><p><b>Monero</b><br>
Monero&#8217;s main focus is security for the end-user, with a promise that its encryption ensures that sending and receiving addresses, as well as amounts sent or received, are hidden. Transactions are confidential and untraceable, with the currency&#8217;s decentralized development community working tirelessly on finding new ways of keeping the currency&#8217;s holders safe from any form of spying or surveillance.<br>
Monero&#8217;s own site lists 34 service providers who are happy to take payments in that format &#8211; these include Azur Samui, a luxury apartment development in Koh Samui, Thailand, and K9 Satisfaction, a dog training company in northeast Illinois. There are also 13 manufacturers and sellers of goods listed, along with five iGaming sites. </p><p><b>Zcash</b><br>
Another cryptocurrency that promises shielding for transactions is Zcash, which aims to keep its users safe and secure, also protecting their identity.<br>
Zcash currently has a limited scope when it comes to using it for the purchase or sale of goods and services, though it is possible to use a variety of exchanges to trade it for bitcoins if you want to broaden your spending possibilities. </p><p><b>Bytecoin</b><br>
Bytecoin is anonymous and decentralized, using open-source code. Private transactions are provided by the Bytecoin Network, and there are no additional fees for transactions. That last point is a plus over Bitcoin, whose fees have seen users migrate to other currencies in recent months. To make sure of a prudent process, all transactions take place every 120 seconds. <br>
Bytecoin says that it has seven merchants that it classes as its most popular for the trading of the currency for goods and services. </p><p><b>Verge</b><br>
Verge claims to improve upon the original Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions are anonymous and secure on a decentralized network, with users&#8217; IP addresses obfuscated. Another reason why Verge looks like a very promising cryptocurrency is the Simple Payment Verification technology, which helps to keep transaction times down to around five seconds.<br>
There are more than 20 merchants that accept this cryptocurrency, according to Verge&#8217;s official site, and these include a company devoted to producing natural beard products, a hot sauce company, and several media companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions we&#8217;re asked most by people new to the world of cryptocurrencies, or people considering buying coins, is &#8220;how can I spend cryptocurrencies?&#8221; More often than not, cryptocurrencies are viewed as speculative ventures, with the emphasis on keeping hold of your assets and watching them appreciate in value. </p><p>While it&#8217;s true that the global infrastructure governing cryptocurrencies of all kinds is still being developed, there are many ways in which you can spend your coins on goods and services. It&#8217;s a bit like online shopping was, before Amazon began to dominate: there are a lot of smaller, independent players in the market for your money, and they require judicious sifting to get to the truly helpful providers. Here are some of the most popular sites you can visit if you want to spend your cryptocurrencies.   </p><p><b>Cryptoallowed</b> <br>
We all have a natural tendency to ask Google any question we may have. However, if you were to ask Google how to spend your cryptocurrencies, you would have to scroll through thousands of barely-relevant results, because the information out there is so disparate. Cryptoallowed is a very basic-looking site, but it is effective and very easy to use. Type in what you want to spend your cryptocurrency on, and you&#8217;ll get a feed full of useful results, with likely a few alternatives for each transaction you might want to make.  </p><p><b>Spendabit</b> <br>
Spendabit focuses on webshops that accept bitcoins, though it may be that some of its search matches will also take other currencies &#8211; you need to check this on a site-by-site basis. Nonetheless, for anything you would care to search on, results are easy to find.<br>
I went as specific as I dared, typing in the name of an artist whose records I wanted to buy &#8211; Leonard Cohen &#8211; and got plenty of reasonably-priced results. I then tried the same thing for a garden rake, thinking that results might be thinner on the ground &#8211; if you&#8217;ll excuse the pun. Instead, there were many of search matches, mostly from Overstock, but also from competing sites. I was able to filter by price, then head to the individual merchant to complete my purchase. </p><p><b>Overstock</b> <br>
This is the is closest to an Amazon of the cryptocurrency retail world. If you thought buying cryptocurrency was something only for financial speculators, you need to look again.<br>
A random browse shows that you can purchase everything from a frying pan, right through to men&#8217;s gym clothing. The other really great thing about Overstock is that they don&#8217;t just take Bitcoin. Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero and a whole host other currencies are also accepted.  </p><p><b>Expedia </b><br>
Expedia has gained a deserved reputation for making the process of booking a trip as painless and pleasurable as possible. Currently the site takes Bitcoin transactions through its partner Coinbase.<br>
A slight issue is that only Expedia Hotels takes Bitcoin transactions, meaning that you can book a room for yourself or your business, but not other aspects of the trip, something that somewhat negates the convenience of the end-to-end service you can normally get on the site.  </p><p><b>Shopify </b><br>
Sites like Shopify have been powering ecommerce for the smallest and most independent of producers for years now, and that&#8217;s why the platform has grown so much. Whatever you make, create or produce, Shopify can help, and has a series of customizable themes.<br>
Shopify has accepted bitcoins since 2013, and claims to accept &#8220;almost any currency&#8221;, though whether or not your particular cryptocurrency can be used in a sale depends on which third-party payment processor the vendor is using. </p><p><b>Geekorama</b> <br>
We had to include this one. The word &#8216;geek&#8217; has stopped being an offensive term in recent years, thanks to the massive popularity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and of superhero movies in general, plus the return of Star Wars.<br>
This store, run by and for pop-culture fanatics, offers everything from Japanese anime action figures to Pacman pillows. Whatever you want, bitcoins are accepted for payments on Geekorama, and other cryptocurrencies may be accepted in due course. </p><p><b>Namecheap</b> <br>
One of the global leaders in domain and hosting services for websites, Namecheap is a supporter of the cryptocurrency community. You can pay for any service offered by Namecheap using Bitcoin. </p><p><b>Purse</b> <br>
Earlier on we talked about how Amazon doesn&#8217;t take cryptocurrencies as payment methods, but that&#8217;s not strictly true; not if you&#8217;re willing to exploit a perfectly legal loophole to get your desired item.<br>
Purse.io gives both you and the Amazon Gift Card holder the chance to gain from a transaction, by matching your Amazon order with a Gift Card holder, who them swaps the value of his Gift Card for your bitcoins. The end result is that you get 5% discount on the face value of the Amazon item, and the person on the other end, who wanted to cash in his Gift Card, gets some bitcoins to spend, save, or invest. You can get a bigger discount by setting up a Wish List on Amazon. There are simple instructions on how to use Purse, and the whole transaction is safe, secure, and seamless, as if you were shopping on Amazon in the first place. </p><p><b>Luckygames</b> <br>
There are hundreds of online gaming sites accepting some form of cryptocurrency, but we wanted to mention Luckygames because, although most of the crypto-enabled sites permit the use of bitcoins in their poker and casino rooms, Luckygames has probably the widest range of cryptocurrencies open for use of any such site. These include BlackCoin, CLAMS, DigiByte, DigitalCash, and Dogecoin in a choice of over 30 supported cryptocurrencies. <br>
As for the interface itself, Luckygames offers five categories of game, Balls, Dice, Roulette, Cells and Hacker. At the time of writing, more than BTC 12,000 had already been won on the site.</p>
