<p>Since its humble beginnings in 2009, Bitcoin has grown from a fringe alternative currency worth pennies to a globally known asset, with a single Bitcoin now worth tens of thousands of dollars. Many in the investment space see continued growth in the Bitcoin market. If you’re a new investor who wants to learn how to buy Bitcoin, we’ll explain the best ways to get started.</p>
<p>This guide covers the basics of investing in Bitcoin, including the best places to buy Bitcoin. We’ll also explore ways to secure your Bitcoin investment with a crypto wallet and other strategies for Bitcoin investing.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin is a finite digital currency that allows people to store and transfer value to others without an intermediary. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, Bitcoin is independent and controlled by a decentralized worldwide community of node operators. To change the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin node operators accept any changes by choosing to install a new version of the Bitcoin Core software that implements the changes. If they don’t adopt the new version, the protocol does not change.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was founded by an anonymous person or team who using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>What started as a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a> outlining a proposed peer-to-peer money system and drafted during the great financial crisis in the late 2000s became a worldwide phenomenon, an alternative currency that ensured transactions could not be reversed and that balances could not be spent twice. This stood in stark contrast to what appeared at the time to be a deeply troubled traditional financial system.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin network itself is now distributed worldwide, with each full node hosting a copy of all blocks and transactions, checking each against the network’s consensus rules.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s appeal centers on critical characteristics, including a fixed supply and proof-of-work consensus. To date, there are about 19.54 million Bitcoin in existence, with a fixed cap of 21 million. The last bitcoin is expected to be mined in 2140. Scarcity drives Bitcoin’s value, but its consensus method also attracts sound-money fans. Bitcoin uses proof of work to validate transactions, a cost-intensive method of solving for a hash value when mining a new block of transactions. As new blocks are added to the blockchain, it becomes financially inviable to reverse a transaction that has already occurred.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>What is the Bitcoin Blockchain?</h4>
<p>Blockhains are ledgers, a record of balances and transactions. New transactions are grouped into a block and then each block is added to the chain.</p>
<p>In the Bitcoin protocol (set of rules) each block also references the previous block. This continuity, combined with Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus method to add new blocks to the chain, makes it prohibitively expensive to reverse a transaction in a previous block. After 60 minutes, the time it takes to add 6 blocks to the chain, transactions are considered permanent.</p>
<p>Its scarcity and resistance to changes make bitcoin an attractive option to today’s inflation-prone fiat currencies, including the USD, GPB, and others. But the market is still young. Bitcoin’s worldwide market capitalization is just north of $700 million, a fraction of gold’s nearly $13 trillion market cap and still smaller than silver’s $1.3 trillion market cap.</p>

<h2>Where to Buy Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In this guide, we’ll discuss how to buy Bitcoin, including the best places to buy BTC. The most common options include cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers. Exchanges provide a platform for traders to transact with each other – or with each other’s orders more accurately. Brokers transact with the trader directly. The end transaction, however, often looks very similar because both offer a way to buy or sell Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Best Places to Buy Bitcoin</h3>
<ol>
<li>MEXC: Best Crypto Exchange With 0% Spot Trading Fee and Over 1,000 Cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>OKX: Crypto Exchange With Trading Bots and Bot Marketplace, and 350+ Cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>Binance: World’s Largest Crypto Exchange With 350 Cryptocurrencies and Futures Trading</li>
<li>Coinbase: Publicly Traded Crypto Exchange With 250+ Cryptocurrencies and Advanced Trading</li>
<li>eToro: Low-Fee Broker With Copy Trading, Smart Portfolios, and 80+ Cryptocurrencies</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. MEXC: Best Crypto Exchange With 0% Spot Trading Fee and Over 1,000 Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="300" height="49" class="aligncenter wp-image-138430 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701440260-mexc-logo.jpg" alt="MEXC logo" /></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC</a> is the best crypto exchange not only to buy Bitcoin but to buy over 1,000 other cryptocurrencies that aren&#8217;t listed on other major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Buy or trade cryptocurrencies with a 0% spot trading fee and trade crypto futures with a 0% fee for limit orders and 0.02% fee for market order. This is by far the lowest fees you can find with a crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Moreover, MEXC offers advanced trading tools and charts, including integrated TradingView charts, as well as order book view, which should be more than enough to cater to seasoned crypto traders.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean that beginners aren&#8217;t welcome. On the contrary, beginners can easily buy Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency either via bank or SEPA transfer, depending on the country, or by purchasing crypto with card or Apple and Google Pay via third-party services like Moonpay and Mercuryo.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-138327 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage.jpg" alt="MEXC homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage-768x434.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Grow your crypto portfolio with MEXC Savings. This is similar to crypto staking where you lock your coins for a certain period of time to accrue interest in the form of more coins. For example, USDT has an APR of up to 8.8%, while Bitcoin has up to 1.8% APR. There are some amount limitations, though, such as you earn the maximum APR on amounts up to $300 for some coins. Make sure to read about them before you lock your coins.</p>
<p>Hands-off investors who don&#8217;t want to actively participate in the market and trade crypto themselves can use the copy trading feature where you can follow successful traders and let them trade your funds on your behalf. This could be a useful tool to potentially increase your portfolio in addition to buying and holding Bitcoin.</p>

<h3>2. OKX: Low-Fee Crypto Exchange With Trading Bots and Bot Marketplace, and 350+ Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="142" height="54" class="aligncenter wp-image-138858 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686992-okx-logo.jpg" alt="OKX logo" /></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/okx">OKX</a> is the second largest crypto exchange based on derivatives trading volume. This means that not only OKX is an excellent exchange to buy Bitcoin, but to trade Bitcoin and derivatives as well because of OKX&#8217;s low trading fees.</p>
<p>Those looking to buy Bitcoin can buy it directly on OKX with a card, Apple Pay or Google Pay once you open an account and verify it.</p>
<p>You can then hold it on the exchange and maybe even use OKX Earn where you lock your coins for a select period of time and earn rewards in the meantime. Currently, you can get up to 5% APR on Bitcoin with a flexible lock. This means you can unlock whenever you want.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="467" class="alignnone wp-image-138857 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange.jpg" alt="OKX crypto exchange" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange-300x156.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange-768x399.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange-150x78.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>OKX is also one of the best exchanges for spot and derivatives trading as it comes with 0.08% spot trading fee for limit orders and 0.1% for market orders. If you hold OKB coins or have a certain amount of assets in USD, you can further lower the fees.</p>
<p>The exchange is also famous for its bot marketplace. This means you can subscribe to trading bots or build your own and sell it to subscribers to earn additional income.</p>

<h3>3. Binance: World’s Largest Crypto Exchange With 350 Cryptocurrencies and Futures Trading</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="492" height="130" class="aligncenter wp-image-131889" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069472-binance-logo.png" alt="binance logo" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069472-binance-logo.png 492w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069472-binance-logo-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p>The cheapest way to buy Bitcoin in this roundup is through the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance">Binance</a> exchange.</p>
<p>However, location plays an important role. In the US, traders can only access Binance.US, which has transitioned to a crypto-only exchange. To buy Bitcoin on Binance.US, you have to first load your account with USDT (a popular stablecoin valued at $1) through a third-party provider, which you can then trade for BTC (with zero trading fees). We priced this out, and the cost was close to $112 to buy $100 worth of USDT. Fees may vary based on region and network demand.</p>
<p>While Binance.US is easy to use, the extra step of buying crypto off-platform before you can buy Bitcoin makes it less attractive for US users than Coinbase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="411" class="aligncenter wp-image-131893" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard-1024x411.png" alt="binance.com crypto exchange" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard-1024x411.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard-300x121.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard-768x309.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard.png 1523w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>If there’s a downside to Binance’s Advanced Trade, it might be that there are too many advanced features if all you need to do is buy BTC. Advanced Trade is loaded with trading tools, including margin trading, so you can trade with leverage (borrowing against your investment capital). Other advanced features include trading bots, which can make trades for you automatically, and futures trading, which allows you to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin or other crypto assets.</p>
<p>But for power users, it isn’t easy to match the trading options available on Binance.com</p>

<h3>4. Coinbase: Publicly Traded Crypto Exchange With 250+ Cryptocurrencies and Advanced Trading</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="462" height="128" class="wp-image-131848 aligncenter" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066571-coinbase-logo.png" alt="coinbase logo" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066571-coinbase-logo.png 462w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066571-coinbase-logo-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" />With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/803531/number-of-coinbase-users/">100 million users worldwide</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase">Coinbase</a> is the largest publicly traded exchange on the planet. The company trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker COIN. Coinbase’s initial purchase offering (IPO) valued the company at $86 billion, helping to build a stable platform for trading and crypto-economy services, including crypto storage, lending, and staking services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="502" class="aligncenter wp-image-131851" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-1024x502.png" alt="coinbase crypto offerings" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard.png 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Being publicly traded brings benefits to users as well in the form of transparency and regulation. Coinbase’s <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx">SEC filings</a> and <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx">earnings reports</a> provide an up-to-date view of the company’s financial health while also adhering to regulations in the US and in other markets where Coinbase is registered.</p>
<p>You’ll save on trading fees by using Coinbase Advanced, a full-featured trading platform with TradingView charts that offer 100+ trading indicators. But advanced doesn’t mean difficult to use. Coinbase places trading controls within easy reach and offers well-placed help tips.</p>
<p>Trading fees for Coinbase Advanced come in lower than on eToro, with limit order trading fees at just 0.6%.</p>

<h3>5. eToro: Low-Fee Broker With Copy Trading, Smart Portfolios, and 80+ Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="500" height="180" class="wp-image-131840 aligncenter" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065655-etoro-logo.png" alt="etoro logo" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065655-etoro-logo.png 500w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065655-etoro-logo-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro">eToro</a> isn’t an exchange, so you’re not interacting with the order book. Instead, you’re buying from or selling to eToro, which then interacts with its own market makers. While the process seems more complicated when described, it’s actually much easier for newer traders to get started with eToro compared to many exchanges.</p>
<p>There’s no need to learn the ins and outs of complicated trading tools. One easy-to-use trading box does everything you need, and trading fees are dead simple at 1% of your trade value. eToro was founded with the goal of making investing simple and transparent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="456" class="aligncenter wp-image-131844" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065792-etoro-virtual-portfolio-1024x456.png" alt="etoro virtual portfolio" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065792-etoro-virtual-portfolio-1024x456.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065792-etoro-virtual-portfolio-300x134.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065792-etoro-virtual-portfolio-768x342.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065792-etoro-virtual-portfolio-1536x684.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700065792-etoro-virtual-portfolio.png 1575w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The platform also enables copy trading, an easy way to find successful traders and copy their trades automatically. With copy trading, you choose the investment amount for the trade and can also set a trigger to protect against larger losses if the market turns against the trade. Copy trading can eliminate the need for technical analysis, and the platform lets you view the historical performance of other traders before you choose who to copy.</p>

<h2>How To Buy Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Exchanges are the most common way to invest in Bitcoin, but you have several other options. Which is the best way to buy Bitcoin? The answer depends on your goals and how you plan to use your Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Centralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>A centralized exchange like Coinbase or Kraken offers a convenient onramp and offramp for crypto assets, allowing you to exchange cryptocurrencies for traditional currencies or trade crypto for crypto.</p>
<p>On a centralized exchange, you’re trading against an order book, which is a list of open buy and sell orders on the exchange. Your exchange acts as an intermediary in that it creates the trading environment and provides storage for your crypto after you make a trade.</p>
<h3>Decentralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap or Balancer offers a way to trade cryptocurrency without an intermediary. Your trades, typically called swaps, happen from your own crypto wallet, so you don’t have to deposit crypto with a third party to make a transaction. Decentralized exchanges use computer programs that run on the blockchain to execute transactions.</p>
<p>While decentralized exchanges don’t support Bitcoin natively, you’ll find wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on every popular DEX. WBTC is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that tracks its value and can be swapped 1:1 for BTC on many centralized exchanges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="334" class="aligncenter wp-image-131905" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-1024x334.png" alt="uniswap crypto exchange wbtc usdt swap" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-1024x334.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-300x98.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-768x250.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-1536x501.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap.png 1892w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It’s helpful to have some trading experience and research the trading risks before using a DEX to build your Bitcoin investment.</p>
<h3>Brokerages</h3>
<p>A broker is a go-between. On a centralized exchange, you’re interacting with orders placed by other traders. Although the transaction looks similar in that you can buy or sell Bitcoin, in a brokerage transaction, you’re transacting with the broker rather than other traders.</p>
<p>The broker sources the assets for purchases and takes the inventory when you sell.</p>
<p>eToro, for example, is a broker, although the buying experience is very similar to what you’d find with a basic exchange platform. Robinhood is another example of a broker that offers Bitcoin and other cryptos.</p>
<h3>Payment Apps</h3>
<p>Many popular payment apps now offer crypto purchases. Some, like Cash App and Strike, only offer Bitcoin. Others, including PayPal and Venmo, offer several popular cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH, and Litecoin.</p>
<h3>Peer-to-Peer Exchanges</h3>
<p>You also can buy Bitcoin from other people directly. Several exchanges, including Gemini and Binance, offer peer-to-peer trading. Bisq, a popular open-source application, allows you to buy Bitcoin without using a centralized exchange.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="396" class="aligncenter wp-image-131906" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-1024x396.png" alt="peer-to-peer crypto exchanges" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-1024x396.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-300x116.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-768x297.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-1536x594.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange.png 1541w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Payment methods vary based on the preferences of the seller. Bisq uses BTC security deposits to help ensure safe trading between users.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin ATMs</h3>
<p>Almost as easy as using a vending machine, Bitcoin ATMS let you buy BTC with a debit card or cash. The operating network then sends Bitcoin to your Bitcoin wallet address. Buying fees for Bitcoin machines can be much higher than you’ll find with exchanges or brokers.</p>
<h3>Crypto Wallets</h3>
<p>Many crypto wallets offer ways to buy BTC or other cryptocurrencies through third-party providers. Exchanges and brokers typically provide a more cost-effective way to invest in Bitcoin, but the option is available with many hardware and software wallets. We’ll cover crypto wallets in just a bit.</p>
<h3>Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Depending on which method you choose when you buy Bitcoin, you may have several payment options available to you. Bitcoin ATMs take cash or debit cards, for example, whereas centralized exchanges usually support bank deposits, debit cards, and possibly credit cards.</p>
<p>You can buy Bitcoin with any of the following, depending on where you trade.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash: Local sellers on apps like Bisq may take cash. Bitcoin ATMs offer another way to buy BTC with cash.</li>
<li>Bank transfer: Centralized exchanges like Coinbase support bank transfers.</li>
<li>Debit card: Most leading centralized exchanges and brokers support debit cards. Read the fine print on debit card fees.</li>
<li>Credit card: Although not as common as debit cards, many exchanges also support credit card purchases. Again, check the fees before you confirm the transaction.</li>
<li>Wire transfer: You can wire money to an exchange or brokerage account in many cases.</li>
<li>PayPal: Coinbase and eToro both support PayPal for transactions.</li>
<li>Neteller/Skrill: In some regions, you can use other payment apps like Neteller to fund your trading account on an exchange or brokerage account.</li>
<li>Other cryptocurrencies: Crypto-only exchanges like Binance.US and decentralized exchanges require that you trade crypto for crypto.</li>
<li>Fiat currencies like USD and GPB aren’t supported directly, but you can use a third party to buy crypto with fiat or trade with crypto you already have.</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>Choosing a Payment Option to Buy Bitcoin</h4>
<p>Additional payment options like PayPal are convenient for people who already use those payment apps. Freelancers, for example, often already have a PayPal balance they can use.</p>
<p>However, PayPal, debit cards, and credit cards often increase trading costs because some exchanges add a processing fee. These fees can range from 2% up to 5%, creating a headwind for your investment to overcome.</p>
<p>Generally, the cheapest way to fund your trading account is with a bank transfer because many exchanges don’t charge a deposit fee for bank transfers. Check the fine print before making a deposit to be sure the trade still works for you.</p>

<h2>Start Investing In Bitcoin Today With MEXC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the earlier parts of this guide, we discussed where to invest in Bitcoin. Now, let’s look at how to invest in Bitcoin. We’ll use MEXC in this example because the platform is easy to use, and MEXCs simple trading fees are 0% of your trade.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open an account with MEXC</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">Visit MEXC</a> to open a trading account. At this step, you can use an email or you can sign up with your MetaMask wallet, your Telegram or Google account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="442" class="alignnone wp-image-138363 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg" alt="MEXC signup" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-768x377.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Fund your account</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your country, you can buy Bitcoin with a SEPA bank transfer. You&#8217;ll need to verify your ID, however. If your country isn&#8217;t supported for such transfer, you can purchase Bitcoin with a credit card via third-party providers such as Mercuryo and Moonpay. You may have to pass an ID verification at these providers as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="541" class="alignnone wp-image-138349 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="MEXC buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Buy Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>Select Bitcoin from the dropdown menu and enter the amount of money you wish to spend. Select the provider with the best rate and click &#8220;Continue&#8221;. Follow the prompts and complete the transaction. Alternatively, you can buy &#8220;USDT&#8221; and then buy Bitcoin on the spot market with 0% fees.</p>
<h2>How Much Is Bitcoin Worth?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At press time, Bitcoin is worth about $37,000, meaning each coin has a value of nearly $40,000, considerably less than its <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/326707/bitcoin-price-index/">all-time high of over $65,000</a> in 2021. However, BTC has more than doubled in the past year, recovering from its lows.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s current market cap is over $700 billion, making it more valuable than Visa, which has a $512 billion market cap and nearly twice the size of Mastercard’s $375 billion market cap.</p>
<p>Don’t be intimidated by Bitcoin’s value when investing, however. Much like you can buy fractional shares in stocks, you can buy part of a Bitcoin. While the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin is a satoshi (1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin). Currently, one penny in USD equals 28 satoshis, making the smallest unit in Bitcoin much smaller than the smallest unit in US currency.</p>
<p>For one satoshi to reach the value of one penny, the price of one Bitcoin would have to rise to $991,172.</p>
<h2>How Much Bitcoin Should I Buy?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Because Bitcoin is divisible, you can buy small or larger amounts, depending on your budget.</p>
<p>To date, <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-as-legal-tender-5-countries-that-could-be-next-in-line-to-adopt-15228761.htm">Bitcoin is legal tender in two countries</a>, which makes it a speculative investment. Governments around the world could slow the growth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and in some countries, cryptocurrencies are illegal. For instance, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-where-bitcoin-legal-135148775.html">China banned cryptocurrency trading</a>.</p>
<p>All this is to say Bitcoin and other crypto assets are risky investments. However, they also might outperform other assets significantly.</p>
<p>Here’s how Bitcoin’s performance compares to the S&amp;P 500 index over the last ten years.</p>
<div class="su-table su-table-responsive su-table-alternate">
<figure class="table">
<table>
<tbody>

</figure>
</div>
<p>$1,000 invested in the S&amp;P in 2013 would be worth $2,460 ten years later. By comparison, the same $1,000 invested in Bitcoin in 2013 would be worth $84,050 after ten years.</p>
<p>Many in the industry see cryptocurrencies as a young asset class, one that will continue to grow, perhaps replacing some traditional assets. However, it’s important to match your investment to your budget and never invest in cryptocurrency unless you’re willing to risk losing your investment.</p>
<h2>Storing Your BTC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If you buy Bitcoin through an exchange like Coinbase or MEXC, the trading platform can hold your crypto for you, much like a bank holds your deposits.</p>
<p>However, there’s a big difference between banks and crypto exchanges. Crypto balances are not insured by the government and exchanges get much less oversight compared to banks. To safeguard your investment, you may want to move your larger balances to a self-custody crypto wallet.</p>
<p>As a digital asset, Bitcoin can’t be stored physically. Instead, your Bitcoin is held at a wallet address on the blockchain. A crypto wallet holds the private keys that control the assets at that address.</p>
<p>When an exchange holds your crypto for you, your crypto is still secured by a wallet, but the exchange has the keys. If the exchange becomes insolvent, as was the case with FTX, or your account login is compromised, your crypto is at risk. Instead, it’s often wiser to store your Bitcoin with a self-custody wallet like Electrum or Sparrow or even use a hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor wallet.</p>
<h3>Hot Wallets vs Cold Wallets</h3>
<p>Software crypto wallets like Electrum and Sparrow are also called hot wallets because the private keys for the wallet are generated on a device connected to the internet. If you’re a technical user, there is a way to build a cold wallet with Electrum, however.</p>
<p>A cold wallet means the private keys for the wallet are generated and stored on a device that’s not connected to the internet. Typically, this points to a hardware wallet, which is a device that generates the wallet’s private keys and stores them offline.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-hardware-wallets.htm">Hardware crypto wallets</a> either connect to another device via USB or Bluetooth, although some devices use airgap technology instead, using QR codes to approve or decline transactions. In both cases, hardware wallets act like a form of two-factor authentication, and no transactions for the wallet’s assets can be approved without confirming the transaction with the device.</p>
<h2>What Can You Buy With Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin is now a household name, and many merchants are more comfortable accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as payment for products and services.</p>
<p>If you find a willing retailer or service provider, you can use Bitcoin to buy any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cars</li>
<li>Jewelry</li>
<li>Video games</li>
<li>ElectronicsClothing</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Gift cards</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>Should You Spend Your Bitcoin?</h4>
<p>Bitcoin was invented as a peer-to-peer cash system, implying that it was meant to be spent or sent to others. The Bitcoin protocol excels at this task. However, there are some reasons you may want to hold your BTC.</p>
<p>Future price appreciation: For many, Bitcoin is seen as a store of value in an uncertain financial climate. Spending your Bitcoin could mean you miss out on future gains as more investors buy the asset.<br />
Tax considerations: Many governments around the world see Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies as property, which means that as you spend your Bitcoin or otherwise disposes of it, you may be responsible for capital gains taxes if the Bitcoin you spend has increased in value.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Some well-known merchants that accept Bitcoin for select products and services include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://about.att.com/story/2019/att_bitpay.html">AT&amp;T</a></li>
<li><a href="https://promotions.newegg.com/nepro/16-6277/index.html">Newegg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://global.rakuten.com/corp/news/press/2021/0224_03.html">Rakuten</a></li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Starbucks</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, tools like Coinbase’s Visa debit card let you spend your crypto just like cash just about anywhere.</p>
<h2>Should I Invest in Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The financial world still centers around traditional assets, but the growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is hard to ignore. Whether to invest in a speculative asset is an individual decision, and with a digital asset like Bitcoin that challenges traditional finance and government control of currencies, there’s reason to be cautious.</p>
<p>If you think Bitcoin deserves a place in your portfolio, match your investment to your budget, knowing there’s a possibility it all goes to zero. If you’re still ready to invest, you can use one of the exchanges we detailed earlier. But there are also some ways to invest in Bitcoin while still keeping two feet planted in the traditional investment world. Let’s look at some possibilities.</p>
<h3>Indirect Ownership of Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Owning stock in companies that hold Bitcoin makes you a Bitcoin owner. This strategy also allows you to diversify with one investment because the stock price is driven by both the value of the Bitcoin assets held by the company and the company’s performance.</p>
<p>Coinbase and MicroStrategy are two well-known companies with tall, wobbling stacks of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) holds over 158,000 Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Here are some companies with significant holdings.</p>

<h3>Bitcoin ETFs</h3>
<p>You may also be able to invest in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) depending on where you are in the world. Exchange-traded funds allow investors to trade in and out of assets by trading shares of the fund. For Bitcoin ETFs, that asset is Bitcoin. The fund buys and sells Bitcoin as investors buy and sell shares in the fund.</p>
<p>Early iterations of Bitcoin ETFs used the futures market to approximate the value of Bitcoin, but a new breed of ETFs will use the Bitcoin spot market to buy and sell the real asset rather than a derivative.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As the most widely traded cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is ubiquitous on trading platforms. Which platform you choose depends on what you need from the trading experience. Traders who need more tools like futures trading can choose a full-featured exchange like MEXC, Binance or Coinbase.</p>
<p>We recommend MEXC because it offers 0% spot trading fees and it has over 1,000 cryptocurrencies to choose from should you wish to diversify your crypto portfolio.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3>How do beginners buy Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Buying Bitcoin is similar across all platforms. To get started, open an account and verify your identity. Then, you can connect a funding source like a bank account or debit card, choose an investment amount, and make a purchase.</p>
<h3>How much do you need to start buying Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Platforms like Coinbase allow you to make trades as low as $2, but fees can be much higher as a percentage if you’re using the simple trading interface. Instead, you can use the advanced platform, where fees are lower, or choose a platform like MEXC, where spot market fees are fixed at 0%.</p>
<h3>How can I buy Bitcoin instantly?</h3>
<p>Many exchanges, such as MEXC, Binance and Coinbase let you buy Bitcoin directly with a card. But you will have to open an account and verify your ID first in most cases.</p>
<h3>Where is the best place to buy Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>The best place to buy Bitcoin depends on your preference mostly. Coinbase is an excellent choice for US citizens, while MEXC and Binance are best for buying Bitcoin in other regions.</p>
<h3>Should I buy Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Bitcoin is gaining acceptance beyond the core crypto community but remains a speculative asset. If you’re unsure about investing in Bitcoin, it may be safer to invest a small amount as you continue to learn about the asset and gauge its long-term potential.</p>
<h3>Is it safe to buy Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Buying Bitcoin brings both price risk and regulatory risk. In addition, exchange solvency risks should be considered. There are ways to mitigate many of these risks, however, including dollar-cost averaging to mitigate price risk and moving your Bitcoin off the exchange to address exchange-related risks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you follow crypto happenings, you’ve probably seen the blockchain buzz around Shiba Inu. But what is it, and how do you buy Shiba Inu coin? Like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a dog-themed meme coin with an army of loyal investors. But SHIB is different, creating its own blockchain (Shibarium), a metaverse project, and much more.</p>
<p>In past runups, SHIB has seen meteoric gains of up to 1200% in one month. The good news: You don’t have to bet the farm on SHIB. You can dabble in this digital doggie coin with a small investment of $10 or more. In this guide, we’ll discuss what Shiba Inu is, what SHIB does and how its ecosystem works, and some of the best ways to invest in Shiba Inu Coin when you’re ready to make your move.</p>
<p>What’s next for this popular crypto, and is SHIB a good investment for your portfolio? Let’s dig in.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h2>How to Buy Shiba Inu Coin &#8211; 5 Simple Steps</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The best place to buy Shiba Inu coin may be MEXC . We’ll also cover some other choices, like Coinbase, Kraken, and others, later in the guide. MEXC&#8217;s platform is easy to use and it comes with 0% spot market trading fees.</p>
<p><strong>To get started on MEXC and invest in Shiba Inu Coin, just follow these simple steps.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open an account with a crypto platform.</strong> MEXC makes a good choice for crypto investors who want to buy SHIB or trade it. You can sign up with an email, your Telegram or Google account, or by using your MetaMask crypto wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Verify your identity.</strong> You’ll need to provide proof of identity, like a driver’s license. The process is typically quick, taking just a few minutes. If you&#8217;re using a third-party processor like Mercuryo on Moonpay, you may need to verify your ID with them.</li>
<li><strong>Decide how much Shiba Inu to buy.</strong> The minimum purchase amount is $50.</li>
<li><strong>Deposit funds for trading.</strong> You&#8217;ll need to buy USDT first as MEXC doesn&#8217;t offer a direct way to buy Shiba Inu.</li>
<li><strong>Buy some SHIB.</strong> Go to the Market tab on MEXC and search SHIB in the search tab. Select the SHIB/USDT pair. Enter the amount of USDT you wish to spend and click &#8220;Buy SHIB&#8221;.</li>
</ol>

<h3>MEXC &#8211; Best Crypto Exchange With 0% Spot Market Fees And Over 1,000 Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>The best crypto exchange to buy Shiba Inu as well as more than 1,000 other cryptocurrencies is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC</a>. This exchange lets you sign up using only your email or a crypto wallet like MetaMask and start trading, especially if you already have cryptocurrencies to deposit.</p>

<p>MEXC is a full-fledged crypto exchange that caters to seasoned traders with advanced charts and tools, as well as for those who want to let someone else do the trading for them by using copy trading features. If you need liquidity to make a purchase, don&#8217;t sell your coins. MEXC offers loans with low interest rate where you use your crypto assets as collateral to borrow against them.</p>
<h4>MEXC Trading Fees</h4>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts who trade often will love MEXC because you pay a flat 0% fee on all spot market trades. Those who trade futures will pay 0% fee for limit orders and 0.02% for market orders, which is by far the lowest trading fees you can get with a crypto exchange.</p>

<h3>Binance &#8211; Crypto Exchange for Beginners and Advanced Traders With Crypto Staking and Over 350 Cryptos</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/binance">Binance exchange</a> boasts the title of largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume. However, there are actually two exchanges, Binance.com and Binance.US, the latter of which only serves the US market (and doesn’t support bank deposits).</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll compare the larger Binance.com (worldwide) exchange against other platforms for investing in Shiba Inu Coin.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="746" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126909" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade.jpg" alt="binance trading chart BTC pair" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade.jpg 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-300x140.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-1024x477.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-768x358.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-1536x716.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>If you venture outside of Binance’s easy-to-use instant buy/sell trades, the platform can become overwhelming for newer traders. With choices for futures trading, perpetual futures, leveraged trades, options trading, staking, crypto loans, and peer-to-peer trades, Binance is a powerhouse of an exchange. But some of these trading options can bring additional risks as well.</p>
<p>There’s a place for full-featured exchanges, including Binance . If you have a few trades under your belt, you’ll find more powerful exchanges offer more ways to trade or earn a yield, and more ways to grow as a trader. Expect a learning curve.</p>

<h3>Coinbase &#8211; Beginner-Friendly Crypto Exchange With Over 250 Cryptos and Advanced Trading</h3>
<p>As the largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the world, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/coinbase">Coinbase</a> brings a greater level of financial transparency compared to many competitors. Required filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) make the company an open book rather than a black box.</p>
<p>Coinbase is known for being a safe starting point for new crypto traders and offers a wide range of over 250 cryptocurrencies, including SHIB. Coinbase sells SHIB as single units. In effect, you’ll buy SHIB based on the purchase amount in dollars — or whichever currency you use in your part of the world.</p>
<p>Coinbase offers SHIB trading pairs for USD, USDT (a crypto stablecoin pegged to the USD), EUR, and GBP.</p>

<h4>Coinbase Trading Fees</h4>
<p>Coinbase’s trading fees range from 0.6% for limit orders on the advanced trading platform (called Coinbase Advanced) to as high as about 10% for small orders using the simple trading platform, the trading box found throughout the app.</p>
<p>For a $100 Shiba Inu investment using simple trades, you’ll pay $3.84 in fees (plus a 1% spread), whereas on the advanced platform your cost for a limit order trade is just $0.60. You can save money trading on Coinbase Advanced, but the advanced platform is better suited to experienced traders.</p>
<p>Using market orders on Coinbase Advanced puts trading costs at 0.8%.</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/kraken">Kraken</a> is one of the oldest crypto exchanges in the business (the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, came on the scene in 2009). The US-based exchange was also among the first to offer <a href="https://www.kraken.com/proof-of-reserves">proof of reserves</a>, which is a blockchain-based way to prove the exchange actually has your crypto. While US-based, Kraken serves traders in nearly 200 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Similar to Coinbase and Binance, Kraken offers both a simple trading interface and an advanced platform. In the simple interface shown below, you can buy Shiba Inu coin in just a few clicks. Trading fees in the example below show $3.84 + a 1% spread for the same trade.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="775" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126904" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro.jpg" alt="kraken pro trading dashboard" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro.jpg 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-300x145.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-1024x496.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-768x372.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-1536x744.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>Like Coinbase, Kraken supports recurring buys, although the option is only available for debit card-funded trades, which adds to the cost of the trade. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/14/how-dollar-cost-averaging-works.html">Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with recurring buys optimizes your purchases</a> by buying more when prices dip.</p>
<h4>Kraken Trading Fees</h4>
<p>How you choose to pay makes a big difference with Kraken. Deposits via bank transfers are free (US market), but you’ll pay a 3.75% fee for credit or debit card transactions. That said, Kraken is one of the few remaining crypto exchanges where you can buy Shiba Inu Coin with a credit card (but not in the US). Debit cards are widely supported throughout the world.</p>
<p>On the simple trading interface, you’ll pay about 2% in fees for bank transfers or cash buys. However, you’ll pay less on Kraken Pro, the exchange’s advanced trading platform. Limit orders pay 0.16% in fees, whereas market orders pay 0.26% in trading fees, assuming a 30-day trading volume of under $50,000.</p>

<h3>eToro &#8211; Easy-To-Use Crypto Platform With Copy Trading and 80+ Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>Perhaps best known for its social trading features like copy trading, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/etoro">eToro</a> has carved out a place in the market for traders who value simplicity and the ability to leverage the trading knowledge of others.</p>
<p>Copy trading is a perfect example of eToro’s social trading. With a few clicks, you can follow the trades of successful investors on the platform, buying when they buy and selling when they sell. This approach simplifies trading for newer investors and can eliminate the need for technical analysis before making a trade.</p>
<p>On eToro, you’ll buy Shiba Inu coin using an asset they call SHIBxM, or “Shiba (in millions).” Depending on current market prices, your first SHIB investment with eToro’s $10 minimum investment could be a stack north of 1 million SHIB tokens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="725" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126963" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020698-etoro-crypto-selection.jpg" alt="etoro crypto selection by market cap" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020698-etoro-crypto-selection.jpg 725w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020698-etoro-crypto-selection-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<h4>eToro Trading Fees</h4>
<p>If you trade often, trading fees can make or break your profits. Many crypto trading platforms make trading fees, well, cryptic. You won’t need a scientific calculator to figure out what you’re spending on crypto trading fees with eToro. In typical people-friendly fashion, the platform charges a flat 1% on crypto trades.</p>

<h2>How we Ranked the Best Places to Buy SHIB</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
When choosing the best places to buy Shiba Inu Coin, we considered a number of different factors, with safety and ease of use among the top considerations. When you choose where to invest in Shiba Inu Coin for your own portfolio, do some additional research before making a deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Factors to weigh before choosing a platform:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulation:</strong> An exchange regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), or similar regulatory bodies may be a safer place to trade compared to an unregulated exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Account safety features:</strong> Look for platforms that offer features like two-factor authentication (2FA) to help secure your account. Additionally, consider exchanges that offer cold storage, such as Kraken, Coinbase, or eToro. Cold storage refers to storing crypto in an offline wallet to protect against hacks and exploits.</li>
<li><strong>Trading fees:</strong> The cost of trading can add up if you trade frequently or in large amounts. Weigh trading fees as part of your decision, but be sure to consider ease of use as well. Complicated platforms may not be worth the cost savings for newer traders.</li>
<li><strong>Account or transaction minimums:</strong> Most major exchanges offer low minimum trades of $10 or less. However, check the fine print to be sure you have the flexibility to trade the way you want to invest.</li>
<li><strong>Transferability:</strong> For some cryptocurrencies, you may want to move your crypto off the exchange at some point.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Role of Regulators</h3>
<p>No trading platform is 100% safe. The same holds true for banks, brokerages, insurers, and other financial entities we use daily. However, regulatory oversight can help make trading platforms safer and may offer additional protections for traders within a regulatory jurisdiction.</p>
<p>For example, eToro is regulated by <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/298361">FINRA</a> and the <a href="https://www.etoro.com/en-us/customer-service/help/1281240422/is-etoro-regulated/">SEC</a> in the US, the <a href="https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/regulation-license/">FCA in the UK, ASIC in Australia, and CySEC in Europe</a>. These agencies keep a watchful eye on exchanges under their jurisdiction, helping to ensure consumer safety.</p>
<p>Coinbase, another popular choice, is regulated by the SEC and holds licenses in most US states. Like eToro, Coinbase is also regulated by the FCA in the UK.</p>
<h2>The Basics of Buying Shiba Inu Coin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Opening an account and making your first deposit are the first steps and platforms like eToro make the next step (buying Shiba Inu) easy as well. However, it’s still helpful to understand trading basics so you can trade effectively and reduce the risk of mistakes.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the key aspects of trading that can have the largest impact on your trading costs, including trading fees and spreads.</p>
<h3>Trading Fees</h3>
<p>Exchanges need to make a profit, and often this profit comes from trading fees. When we buy crypto with USD, for example, there’s usually a cost in the form of a trading fee. However, MEXC charges 0% fees on the spot market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="950" class="alignnone wp-image-138959 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib.jpg" alt="MEXC Buy SHIB" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib-284x300.jpg 284w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib-768x811.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib-150x158.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Keep an eye out for fees on the confirmation page of your order. In many cases, the platform shows the fee for the trade, but it’s possible to miss this important number.</p>
<p>On advanced trading platforms, like Coinbase Advanced, trading fees can be harder to find.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="573" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-129242" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699543916-coinbase-advanced-trade.png" alt="Coinbase advanced trade" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699543916-coinbase-advanced-trade.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699543916-coinbase-advanced-trade-300x143.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699543916-coinbase-advanced-trade-1024x489.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699543916-coinbase-advanced-trade-768x367.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699543916-coinbase-advanced-trade-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699543916-coinbase-advanced-trade-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699543916-coinbase-advanced-trade-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Fees for advanced platforms, like Coinbase Advanced or Kraken Pro, typically come in a bit lower. The tradeoff is that advanced platforms can be more difficult to use.</p>
<p>However, advanced exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken also offer simple trades. You’ll find these easy-to-use buy-and-sell boxes throughout the site. Be wary of fees for simple trades, though. Often, simple trades use much higher fees compared to advanced trading platforms or even people-friendly platforms like MEXC.</p>
<h3>Spreads</h3>
<p>Crypto trading platforms use an order book, which is just what it sounds like. An order book is a list of open buy and sell orders that use a limit trade, a fixed price order. You’ll also see these limit orders referred to as “maker” orders because they make a market for others.</p>
<p>Limit sell orders are priced above limit buy orders, and the difference between these two prices is called a spread.</p>
<ul>
<li>The highest-priced limit buy order is the <strong>bid price</strong>.</li>
<li>The lowest-priced limit sell order is called the <strong>ask price</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price.</p>
<p>To use BTC as an example, if the highest limit buy order is $26,000 and the lowest limit sell order is $26,001, the spread is $1.</p>
<p>Spreads can be much wider on thinly traded assets or on platforms that have fewer users. Wider spreads can affect your trading cost when using market orders. We’ll cover market orders briefly in just a bit.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the spread is just a padded price. Coinbase uses a 1% “spread” on simple trades, for example. This price buffer allows the exchange to hold a stable price for your trade while it completes.</p>
<h3>Market Orders vs Limit Orders</h3>
<p>On advanced trading platforms like Coinbase or Kraken, you can choose limit orders (you set the price) or market orders that fill from the existing orders in the book. Market orders, also known as “taker” orders, take orders off the book at the bid or the ask. You’ll pay a bit more in fees for taker orders compared to maker orders. You’ll also pay the spread because you’re buying at the ask or selling at the bid price.</p>
<h3>Shiba Inu DEX Trading</h3>
<p>You can also buy Shiba Inu on a decentralized exchange (DEX), which we’ll cover in more detail shortly. Be aware that decentralized exchanges are unregulated, however. These exchanges run on blockchain computer programs called smart contracts that allow trading without an intermediary.</p>
<h2>What is Shiba Inu Coin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shiba Inu was founded in 2020 by an anonymous developer (or developers) called Ryoshi. The project adopted a Shiba Inu mascot, furthering the crypto-dog theme and drawing comparisons to DOGE, which uses a similar Shiba Inu mascot. And there is some crossover. Many people who invest in DOGE also invest in SHIB. Both cryptos have also seen meteoric gains, with SHIB gaining as much as 1200% in a single month.</p>
<p>Moving beyond trading dynamics and friendly mascots, Shiba Inu offers its own value proposition and development plans that could drive future growth. Notably, Shiba Inu has its own Layer 2 blockchain and a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/11/shiba-inus-metaverse-will-partially-open-by-2023-end-developers-say/">planned metaverse project</a> in which people can buy virtual assets like land.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>The Role of Layer 2 Blockchains</h4>
<p>Layer 2 blockchains bring faster and cheaper transactions to users and then pass the transaction on to the main blockchain for security using that blockchain’s validation method. For example, Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 blockchain will be a layer on the Ethereum blockchain, which ultimately holds the records of all the transactions on Shibarium.</p>
</div></div>
<p>There’s also a decentralized application (dApp) called <a href="https://shibaswap.com/#/">ShibaSwap</a> that allows SHIB holders to earn yields through cryptocurrency swaps, staking, and yield farming. We’ll cover these aspects in the next section when we discuss Shiba Inu uses.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4><strong>SHIB as an ERC-20 token</strong></h4>
<p>Technically, Shiba Inu Coin isn’t a coin at all. SHIB is a token, meaning it’s a crypto that’s used on another cryptocurrency blockchain (Ethereum in this case). Specifically, SHIB is an ERC-20 token. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20 tokens are designed to be fungible</a>, meaning each token is the same as the others (assuming they are the same type of token.) In short, 1 SHIB = 1 SHIB, just like 1 USD = 1 USD and 1 GPB = 1 GPB.</p>
<p>Coins typically represent cryptocurrencies used on their own blockchain.</p>
<p>ETH is a coin used on its own Ethereum blockchain.<br />
SHIB is a token used on the Ethereum blockchain (rather than its own blockchain).</p>
<p>For trading purposes, the distinction between coins and tokens doesn’t matter, and much of the crypto world refers to SHIB as Shiba Inu Coin.</p>
</div></div>
<h2>Shiba Inu Coin Uses</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Unlike DOGE, which primarily acts as a way to transfer value from one person to another, Shiba Inu boasts a growing ecosystem. You can put your tokens to use on ShibaSwap to earn more crypto, buy land in Shiba Inu’s upcoming metaverse, or use your SHIB on the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu is the primary token in the SHIB crypto ecosystem, but two other dog-themed tokens derive value from SHIB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEASH:</strong> The LEASH token, with its limited supply, is the most valuable token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, currently priced at over $285. You can stake (lock your tokens in a contract) LEASH on ShibaSwap to earn xLeash. BONE tokens (up next) are given to xLeash holders. xLeash holders also earn swap fees.</li>
<li><strong>BONE:</strong> The BONE token is the governance token for Shiba Inu. Members of the community can propose changes to the protocol, and BONE tokens let you vote on the proposals. You can also stake BONE to help validate transactions on the Shibarium blockchain, earning a yield in the process. Lastly, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shiba-inu-shibarium-layer-2-093550583.html">BONE is the token used to pay for gas</a> on the Shibarium blockchain. Gas fees pay for computing power for contracts and transactions on the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, like DOGE, SHIB is accepted as payment at several leading merchants, including NewEgg, GameStop, and AMC. You can use SHIB to buy electronics, games, or even tickets to the newest blockbuster movies.</p>
<p>Lending platforms like Binance and CoinRabbit also let you use your SHIB as collateral for crypto loans.</p>
<h2>Is Shiba Inu Coin a Good Investment?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although the ecosystem is growing, SHIB is still a speculative investment. The token’s volatility makes it popular amongst traders, while true believers see it as a long-term investment. Early investors in SHIB have been rewarded with <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/951382">returns of up to 14 million percent</a>. Since then, the token’s value has fallen along with much of the broader crypto market. Consider the possibilities when choosing Shiba Inu as a long-term play or a shorter-term trade. Or – perhaps both.</p>
<h3>Trading for Profit</h3>
<p>Not everyone wants to go neck deep into a crypto project. Trading lets you capture profits from the market’s ups and downs without making a long-term commitment. A platform like eToro offers an easy way to trade the market using SHIBxM, which gives you 1 million SHIB for by buying 1 SHIBxM.</p>
<h3>Investing for Long-Term Gains</h3>
<p>If you see a bright future for Shiba Inu, you can make a longer-term investment using a centralized exchange like Kraken. This could be better suited to larger investments because you can move your SHIB off the platform as your balance grows.</p>
<h3>DeFi Yields</h3>
<p>In addition to possible price appreciation, you can use SHIB in DeFi applications to earn a yield. For example, you can provide liquidity on Uniswap or ShibaSwap and earn swap fees, currently at 0.2% of each swap. Because traders are dipping into liquidity pools all day (and night), that seemingly small number adds up quickly with each new swap.</p>
<h3>Future Blockchain Uses</h3>
<p>As the Shibarium Layer 2 network gains momentum, we’ll likely see more ways to put SHIB to work in the ecosystem. Initially, you can stake BONE to help validate transactions on the network. In return, you can earn a yield. With only 12 validators online thus far, future yields are difficult to predict, but community members have already <a href="https://shibarium.shib.io/">staked over 26 million BONE tokens</a>, more than 10% of the total supply.</p>

<p>SHIB still has a massive supply of nearly 600 trillion tokens, but <a href="https://docs.shibatoken.com/shiba-inu/our-ecosystem/shib">the project expects the supply to be deflationary going forward</a>. This combined with a strong community of <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce">1.3 million SHIB holders</a> could bode well for future prices.</p>
<h2>What is the Cheapest Way to Buy Shiba Inu Coin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If you’re able to buy SHIB from Binance, OKX, or Kraken, these sources offer the most cost-effective way to make your purchase.</p>
<p>The cheapest way to buy Shiba Inu Coin may depend on where you live, however. For example, if you live outside the US, you may be able to buy SHIB on Binance or OKX, where fees are quite low. Binance Advanced Trades are just 0.1% whether you use a market order or a limit order. OKX comes in at just 0.08% for limit orders and 0.1% for market orders.</p>
<p>In the US, however, Kraken brings low-cost trades for SHIB. On Kraken Pro, you can buy SHIB with 0.16% trading fees for maker (limit) orders or 0.26% taker (market) orders.</p>
<p>Here are the primary ways you can buy Shiba Inu Coin, ranging from brokers to wallet apps.</p>
<h3>Four Ways to Buy SHIB</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brokers: Many brokers like eToro, Robinhood, and Webull offer SHIB. In eToro’s case, you can buy SHIB in millions (SHIBxM). While not the cheapest way to buy Shiba Inu Coin with its 1% crypto trading fee, eToro appeals to buyers who value simplicity and a secure platform.</li>
<li>Centralized exchanges: A centralized exchange (CEX) lets you buy crypto with fiat money such as USD, Euro, or GPB. You can also trade one cryptocurrency for another if the exchange has a trading pair for what you want to trade. CEXs are often the cheapest way to buy crypto, assuming you use the advanced trading platform.</li>
<li>Decentralized crypto exchanges: A decentralized exchange (DEX) allows you to trade crypto for crypto without using an intermediary (like a centralized exchange or a broker). Traders like yourself supply cryptocurrencies to liquidity pools, a place where you can trade the crypto you have for the crypto you want to buy. DEXs can be less expensive than brokers or simple trades on exchanges, but trading on DEXs can be much more complex.DEX examples include Uniswap and ShibaSwap.</li>
<li>Crypto wallet apps: If you have a crypto wallet like Zengo, Trust Wallet, or Atomic Wallet, you may be able to buy SHIB through your wallet app. However, it’s likely you’ll encounter some additional steps because most wallets don’t support direct purchases of SHIB. Instead, you may have to purchase ETH through the wallet app’s crypto provider and then exchange your ETH for SHIB on the wallet app. Purchasing crypto through wallet apps can bring much higher fees. Moonpay, a popular provider for wallet crypto purchases, charges a <a href="https://support.moonpay.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360011930117-What-fees-do-you-charge-">4.5% fee for card-funded purchases</a>. The wallet app itself may add a fee as well. Notably, Atomic Wallet makes buying SHIB easy, although <a href="https://support.atomicwallet.io/article/62-what-is-the-fee-to-buy-cryptocurrencies">buying fees can reach 5% or more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Choose a Purchase Method to Buy SHIB</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Each method detailed above has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on your needs or perhaps your location. The best way to buy SHIB may be MEXC, which combines 0% trading fees with an easy-to-use platform.</p>
<p>Experienced traders may prefer an advanced exchange like Binance, OKX, or Kraken, all of which offer low trading fees and a way to transfer your tokens off the exchange. Advanced traders might choose a decentralized exchange that lets them trade one crypto for another and execute the swap directly from their crypto wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cheapest:</strong> Centralized exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Kraken offer low fees.</li>
<li><strong>Easiest:</strong> MEXC lets you buy cryptocurrencies as soon as you sign up either with an email or your crypto MetaMask wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Most private:</strong> Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, SushiSwap, and ShibaSwap let you swap cryptos without an intermediary. This method can be more complicated and requires that you have a self-custody wallet (and some crypto to swap).</li>
<li><strong>Costliest:</strong> Many crypto wallet apps let you buy crypto from within the app, but fees can be much higher than you’ll find with other methods. However, in many cases, you can buy Shiba Inu Coin with a credit card. Expect a few extra steps to convert the crypto you buy (ETH) to SHIB.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Centralized Exchanges vs. Decentralized Exchanges</h4>
<p>Crypto exchanges come in two main types: centralized and decentralized. Both allow crypto-to-crypto exchanges but there are some distinct differences in how these two types of exchanges work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized exchanges</strong> act as an intermediary, a go-between that provides a marketplace for traders. CEXs provide a convenient on-ramp for crypto purchases, meaning it’s an easy way to buy crypto with USD or GBP or whichever currency you use in your part of the world. One possible downside is that the exchange can pause or halt withdrawals (or go out of business), trapping your crypto on the platform. You’ll also have to provide proof of identity, much like with a bank or brokerage account.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized exchanges</strong> run on computer programs called smart contracts. Traders provide tokens to a liquidity pool, and other traders can swap Token A for Token B within the pool. It’s all managed by code rather than people, and the transaction happens right from your crypto wallet. DEXs come with a learning curve, however. You’ll need to manage your wallet securely and keep an eye on trading costs. Typically, DEXs do not require proof of identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is Investing in Shiba Inu Coin Safe &amp; Legal?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If you’re cautious in how you manage your crypto assets, investing in Shiba Inu can be relatively safe. However, taking safety steps like moving your crypto off exchanges to a self-custody wallet or choosing regulated platforms like eToro can’t protect you against market volatility.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu has had some incredible run-ups of up to 1,200% in a single month. But investors who bought in October 2021 saw the value of SHIB fall by up to 90% during the bear market in 2023 and 2023.</p>
<p>In short, there’s always price risk, and increased volatility of low-market-cap cryptos like SHIB can lead to both outsized gains and noteworthy losses. Weigh the percentage of your portfolio that SHIB (or any crypto) represents and trade within your means.</p>
<p>Investing in SHIB is legal in most parts of the world. However, certain cryptocurrencies like XRP have come under fire by regulatory agencies like the SEC which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ripple-effect-coinbase-kraken-among-211810960.html">led to delisting (and later relisting) of XRP</a> on exchanges like Coinbase. Similar risks exist for Shiba Inu and many other cryptocurrencies, which could affect your ability to trade out of your position as well as your investment’s value.</p>
<h2>Which is the Best Shiba Inu Coin Wallet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Because SHIB is an ERC-20 token, you’ll need a crypto wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens if you want to self-custody your tokens.</p>
<p>MetaMask supports ERC-20 tokens and can connect to popular decentralized applications like Uniswap or ShibaSwap.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1999" height="844" class="aligncenter wp-image-129276" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699546704-metamask-crypto-wallet.png" alt="MetaMask Crypto Wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699546704-metamask-crypto-wallet.png 1999w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699546704-metamask-crypto-wallet-300x127.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699546704-metamask-crypto-wallet-1024x432.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699546704-metamask-crypto-wallet-768x324.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699546704-metamask-crypto-wallet-1536x649.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>Coinbase Wallet offers another option and makes it easy to connect to leading dApps. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm">Crypto wallets</a> that support WalletConnect, including Trust Wallet, can also make good choices if you want to put your crypto to work in decentralized finance (DeFi) or make swaps on DEXs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could leave your SHIB tokens on the exchange if you bought through Kraken, for example, or a trading platform like eToro. For convenience, many traders keep a small amount of crypto on the exchange they use for trading while moving the bulk of their holding to a self-custody wallet.</p>
<h2>How to Buy Shiba Inu Coin &#8211; Detailed Tutorial</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
MEXC makes a solid choice for everyone who want to buy SHIB, including traders who want an easy way to trade the market with 0% spot market fees. Follow these simple steps to get started.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Sign up with MEXC</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">Visit MEXC</a> and sign up using your email address, your MetaMask crypto wallet or your Telegram or Google account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="442" class="alignnone wp-image-138363 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg" alt="MEXC signup" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-768x377.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Purchase crypto</strong></h3>
<p>Purchase crypto on MEXC using a bank or SEPA transfer, or by using a card or Apple/Google Pay via third-party providers. You need to buy USDT, which you can swap for SHIBA on the market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="541" class="alignnone wp-image-138349 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="MEXC buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Buy Shiba Inu coins</strong></h3>
<p>Once you have your USDT, select &#8220;Market&#8221; on MEXC and search SHIB in the search tab. Select the SHIB/USDT pair. Enter the amount of USDT you wish to swap for SHIB and select &#8220;Buy SHIB&#8221;.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="950" class="alignnone wp-image-138959 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib.jpg" alt="MEXC Buy SHIB" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib-284x300.jpg 284w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib-768x811.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701694376-mexc-buy-shib-150x158.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shiba Inu brings together a growing ecosystem with a passionate community, which could mean a bright future for investors. The upcoming launch of the metaverse project and the continued development of the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain offer two more reasons for optimism. However, all crypto investments come with a degree of risk. Always invest within your budget.</p>
<p>If you’re considering investing in SHIB, MEXC provides 0% spot market fees and a quick signup process to get started. You can also lock your SHIB tokens to earn annual percentage rate returns on the platform or withdraw it to your wallet. While MEXC is available to most countries, US citizens can&#8217;t use this platform yet. In that case, consider Coinbase as an alternative.</p>

<h2>The Top Crypto Exchanges Reviewed</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We compared the best crypto exchanges, including features, pros and cons, and trading fees.</p>
<h3>1. MEXC &#8211; Overall Best Cryptocurrency Exchange With 0% Spot Fees and Over 1,000 Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC</a> is the overall best crypto exchange in 2023. With 0% spot trading fees and just 0.02% taker fee for futures trading (0% fee for limit orders), MEXC is ideal for crypto day traders. For comparison, Coinbase charges 0.4% maker and 0.6% taker fee for those with a 30-day trading volume of less than $10,000. This means that even if you trade $1,000 in a month, you&#8217;re saving $6 with MEXC, which you can use to buy more crypto.</p>
<p>Being a full-fledged crypto platform, you get advanced charting features with multiple indicators and drawing tools as well as order book view. You can also use TradingView charts if that&#8217;s what you prefer.</p>

<p>That said, MEXC isn&#8217;t just focused on day traders and seasoned investors. Beginners are welcomed just as well. Aside from saving on fees, you can use the MEXC Savings feature to grow your crypto portfolio with low risk. For example, you can lock your USDT for up to 8.8% APR and your XRP for up to 6% APR.</p>
<p>This is similar to staking, meaning you lock your tokens for a certain period of time to earn rewards, except most of the coins on MEXC have a flexible lock, which you can unlock whenever you want.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="544" class="alignnone wp-image-138322 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701428720-mexc-savings.jpg" alt="MEXC savings" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701428720-mexc-savings.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701428720-mexc-savings-300x181.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701428720-mexc-savings-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Purchasing crypto with MEXC is easy; You can do so via bank transfer or SEPA, or you can use a credit and debit card. Alternatively, purchase crypto coins from someone else in a peer-to-peer manner. Some third-party payment processors like Moonpay and Mercuryo accept Google Pay and Apple Pay for direct crypto purchases.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the crypto space or how to trade, MEXC has a vast library of educational materials at your disposal. Aside from beginner guides, you can learn how to trade crypto futures and how to profit from it. And if you want professional traders to trade your funds, there&#8217;s copy trading feature available to MEXC customers.</p>

<h3>2. OKX &#8211; Best Crypto Exchange for Low Fees </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/en">OKK</a> offers many of the advanced features you’ll find on Binance but with even lower fees for limit orders. This could make OKX the best Bitcoin exchange if trading fees are your main consideration and you’re comfortable using an advanced trading platform. (OKX offers a demo account perfect for learning.) You’ll pay just 0.08% for limit orders while market orders parallel Binance’s trading fees at 0.1%. Also, like Binance, OKX has over 350 cryptocurrencies available, including BTC, ETH, and a host of newer tokens to discover.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="511" class="aligncenter wp-image-126912" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-1024x511.jpg" alt="okx bitcoin trading platform" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-1024x511.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-768x384.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-1536x767.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>One downside, however, is that OKX is not available in the US or Canada. Instead, traders in (northern) North America — and elsewhere — can use OKcoin, a sister exchange that serves over 190 countries and offers a simple trading interface. Trading fees on OKcoin come in slightly higher at 0.1% for limit orders and 0.2% for market orders, both of which are more affordable than Kraken or Coinbase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="415" height="502" class="aligncenter wp-image-126913" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019291-okcoin.jpg" alt="OKcoin buy bitcoin" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019291-okcoin.jpg 415w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019291-okcoin-248x300.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></p>
<p>The main exchange at OKX offers trading bots, which are programmable automated traders that buy and sell according to the rules you define. You’ll also find perpetual futures trading, a way to bet on the future price of a cryptocurrency without buying it, and a demo account so you can practice your trades or tune up your trading bots before you turn them loose in real-world trades.</p>

<h3>3. Binance &#8211; Best for Range of Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/binance/en">Binance</a> is the largest crypto exchange worldwide by trading volume, but whether you can use the platform depends on where you live in the world. US residents aren’t able to use the main exchange but can use Binance.US. Currently, Binance.US does not support bank deposits (crypto deposits only), which makes an otherwise easy-to-use exchange less beginner-friendly.</p>
<p>Traders from other areas of the world will find Binance.com offers basic trading with plenty of room to grow into advanced trading, including futures, leveraged trades, crypto loans, and much more. With over 350 cryptocurrencies available for trading, Binance offers one of the largest crypto selections in our roundup, giving you access to staples like BTC and ETH, as well as many lesser-known cryptocurrencies like RDNT or ARB.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-126909" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-1024x477.jpg" alt="binance trading chart BTC pair" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-1024x477.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-300x140.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-768x358.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-1536x716.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>You’ll also find more trading on Binance pairs compared to many other exchanges. Above, you’ll see the RDNT/BTC trading pair. Many exchanges don’t offer smaller cryptocurrencies at all and BTC trading pairs are typically limited to very high-volume assets like UDST or ETH.</p>
<p>Binance offers more flexibility in trading, but like many other exchanges, much of the functionality revolves around the advanced trading platform rather than the instant buy boxes you’ll see throughout the site.</p>

<h3>4. Coinbase &#8211; Best Publicly Traded Crypto Exchange </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/en">Coinbase</a> dates back to 2012 and the exchange is currently the largest publicly traded exchange worldwide. Being a publicly traded company brings more transparency for users because Coinbase discloses its <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx"><u>SEC statements</u></a> and <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"><u>financial statements</u></a> to comply with regulatory requirements. Following the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/rise-fall-crypto-exchange-ftx-2022-11-10/"><u>collapse of FTX</u></a> in 2022, transparency has become more important than ever.</p>
<p>You’ll find over 250 cryptocurrencies available for trading on Coinbase, ranging from top assets like BTC and ETH to newly launched tokens. Coinbase is known for its user-friendly interface. However, Coinbase uses two trading platforms  — simple and advanced — which can add some complexity for newer traders. <img decoding="async" width="1024" height="486" class="aligncenter wp-image-126895" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-1024x486.jpg" alt="coinbase exchange trade crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-1024x486.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-768x364.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-1536x729.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There’s also a third trading option called Coinbase One. With a $30 monthly subscription, traders can trade with no additional fees. Coinbase reports that subscribers save an average of $55 per month with Coinbase One.</p>
<p>Most new traders will gravitate toward Coinbase’s simple trades, which you can access through conveniently placed Buy &amp; Sell buttons throughout the site. While easy to use, it’s worth noting that simple trades come with higher fees, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/"><u>Coinbase’s fee structure</u></a> varies based on the amount of the trade as well as the funding source.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18.72px">5</span><span style="font-size: 16px">. eToro &#8211; Solid Crypto Brokerage For Social Trading </span></h3>
<p>Started in 2007 as a trading platform focused on transparency and ease of use, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> initially offered forex trading, letting users trade currencies easily. Over time, the platform added stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and then added cryptocurrency trading in 2017.</p>
<p>What started as a Bitcoin-only offering has grown to over 80 cryptocurrencies available for trading, including popular choices like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIBxM).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="631" class="aligncenter wp-image-126881" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview-1024x631.jpg" alt="etoro's crypto selection" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview-1024x631.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview-300x185.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview-768x474.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>A simple search box at the top of the screen helps you discover new assets to trade, news stories, and posts from other traders, which leads to one of eToro’s strongest selling points: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/etoro/"><u>eToro Social Trading</u></a>.</p>
<p>You can follow posts from other investors (or share your own thoughts), but eToro also lets you copy the trades of other traders using their intuitively named Copy Trading. In the US, copy trading is currently limited to crypto trades (and cryptos supported in the US). Elsewhere in the world, you can copy trades for crypto, stocks, ETFs, and even commodities.</p>
<p>Just find a trader that interests you, and check their trading history — including long-term performance, risk level, and percentage of profitable weeks — and then click “copy.” You choose the investment amount for each copy trade, and you can also set a “stop loss” by choosing a level to exit the trade if the market turns south. <img decoding="async" width="634" height="704" class="aligncenter wp-image-126888" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018250-etoro-copy-trade.jpg" alt="etoro copytrading" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018250-etoro-copy-trade.jpg 634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018250-etoro-copy-trade-270x300.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></p>
<h4>eToro Trading Fees</h4>
<p>eToro uses a flat 1% trading fee for cryptocurrencies. Here’s how it works. For a $100 BTC purchase, you’ll pay $1 in trading fees. You’ll also pay 1% when you sell, which may be higher or lower than $1 based on the value when you close the position. For standard orders, you’ll buy at the ask price (and sell at the bid price), so you also pay a spread.</p>
<h4>Tradable Coins</h4>
<p>eToro offers over 80 cryptocurrencies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Shiba Inu (SHIBxM &#8211; SHIB in millions)</li>

<h3>6. Kraken &#8211; Best for Pro Trading Tools</h3>
<p>As one of the oldest crypto exchanges, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/en">Kraken</a> has earned a loyal following through transparency combined with low trading fees. Kraken was founded in 2011, just two years after Bitcoin came onto the scene as the first cryptocurrency. Now, this San Francisco-based exchange offers 200+ cryptocurrencies and provides trading services in nearly 200 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>This gives Kraken a wider footprint compared to Coinbase, which operates in just over 100 countries. Transparency has always been paramount with Kraken, and the company was the first to provide <a href="https://www.kraken.com/proof-of-reserves"><u>proof-of-reserves</u></a>, which is a blockchain-based method of proving that the company has the crypto it shows for your account. <img decoding="async" width="390" height="675" class="aligncenter wp-image-126900" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018809-kraken-simple-trade.jpg" alt="kraken exchange buy bitcoin" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018809-kraken-simple-trade.jpg 390w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018809-kraken-simple-trade-173x300.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" />  </p>
<p>Like Coinbase, Kraken offers both simple trades and advanced trading, with the latter being called Kraken Pro. Despite the Pro moniker, you can use Kraken’s advanced trading platform as a beginner or intermediate trader to enjoy lower fees and access advanced analytics at a glance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="496" class="aligncenter wp-image-126904" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-1024x496.jpg" alt="kraken pro trading dashboard" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-1024x496.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-300x145.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-768x372.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-1536x744.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h4>Kraken Trading Fees</h4>
<p>Similar to Coinbase, Kraken offers two trading platforms. The simpler of these is called Instant Buy/Sell and brings higher trading costs. Instant Buy/Sell orders use a variable “display fee,” which you see on your details before you confirm, plus a spread that can vary based on market conditions. Like many simple buy boxes, it can be a pricier way to trade crypto.</p>
<p>The real trading-cost savings come from Kraken Pro, where you’ll pay just 0.26% for market orders and 0.16% for limit orders. This compares well against Coinbase Advanced where you’ll pay 0.8% or 0.6%, respectively. Watch out for higher fees on debit card transactions, however. <strong>Here are the fees we saw in sample trades for $100 worth of Bitcoin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instant Buy/Sell (bank transfer):</strong> $1.97</li>
<li><strong>Instant Buy/Sell (debit card):</strong> $5.42</li>
<li><strong>Kraken Pro (limit order): </strong>$0.16</li>
<li><strong>Kraken Pro (market order): </strong>$0.26</li>
</ul>
<p>Healthy trading volume combined with low fees help make Kraken one of the best bitcoin exchanges and crypto exchanges overall.</p>

<h3>7. Nexo &#8211; Popular for Crypto Lending &amp; Loans</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/nexo/en">Nexo</a> dates back to 2018. Since its launch, the Swiss-based crypto exchange has grown to over 6 million users in over 200 countries worldwide. With 60+ cryptocurrencies available for trading, you’ll find the most popular crypto assets, like BTC and ETH, as well as some that can be more difficult to find, like TRON (TRX)  and XRP. Nexo’s features parallel many of those you’re familiar with from banks.</p>
<p>In many regions (but not in the US), you can earn interest on your cryptocurrency held on the exchange. You can also easily borrow against your crypto holdings. Notably, Nexo also offers a credit/debit card you can use to access the value of your crypto.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="444" class="aligncenter wp-image-126939" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-1024x444.jpg" alt="nexo spot trading dashboard" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-1024x444.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-300x130.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-768x333.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-1536x665.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Fees are beginner-friendly, with no extra trading fees on Nexo’s main platform. Instead, Nexo uses a spread that’s included in the price. If you choose to use Nexo Pro, the advanced trading platform, you can buy without a spread with trading fees at 0.3% for limit orders, half the cost of Coinbase Advanced.</p>
<h4>Tradable Coins</h4>
<p>Nexo offers over 60 cryptocurrencies, including:</p>

<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>

<li>Avalanche (AVAX)</li>

<h3>Nexo Pros and Cons</h3>

<h3>8. Strike &#8211; Best Crypto App for No Trading Fees </h3>
<p>This one’s for the Bitcoin fans. With the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/strike/en">Strike</a> app, you can buy any crypto you want, as long as it’s Bitcoin. Built by Bitcoin HODLers for Bitcoin HODLers, Strike lets you put your BTC stacking on autopilot. Choose an investment amount and frequency and set up a payment method. Strike does the rest, delivering your Bitcoin to your Strike wallet on schedule with no fees. You can also buy BTC on demand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="500" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-126946" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019904-strike-buy-bitcoin-500x1024.jpg" alt="strike crypto exchange buy BTC" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019904-strike-buy-bitcoin-500x1024.jpg 500w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019904-strike-buy-bitcoin-146x300.jpg 146w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019904-strike-buy-bitcoin.jpg 706w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Like many other platforms, Strike makes its profit from the spread, but unlike on other platforms, there are no trading fees. You can even withdraw BTC from your Strike wallet to a self-custody Bitcoin wallet without network fees. Strike also functions as a payment app, letting you send money globally, but the Bitcoin network — and specifically Bitcoin’s Lightning network — is the wizardry behind the curtain.</p>
<p>The Lightning network is a second layer on the Bitcoin network that enables fast transactions for a fraction of the cost. Strike’s easy setup and no-fee structure might make it the best Bitcoin exchange for absolute beginners or Bitcoin-only investors. The downside, of course, is that if you want to buy other cryptos, like ETH, you have to look elsewhere. Strike is now <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/19/bitcoin-payments-app-strike-expands-to-65-countries-from-three/"><u>available in over 65 countries</u></a>.</p>

<h3>9. Bitstamp &#8211; No Fees for Low-Volume Traders</h3>
<p>Bitstamp’s fee structure makes it easy to get started with smaller investment amounts. If your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitstamp/en">Bitstamp</a> trading volume is under $1,000 per month, you’ll pay <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/fee-schedule/"><u>no trading fees</u></a> on the advanced platform. At $1,000 per month or less (based on trailing 30-day trading volume), limit order fees come in at 0.3%, which is lower than you’ll find on Coinbase Advanced, for example. Market orders in the same tier cost 0.40%.</p>
<p>There’s often a tradeoff to no-fee trades, and in this case, it’s withdrawal fees — which can get spendy. BTC withdrawal fees, for instance, are 0.005 BTC, or about $13 at today’s BTC price. If you’re taking advantage of Bitstamp’s no-fee trades at lower volume, it might be best to let your position build up before withdrawing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="967" height="754" class="aligncenter wp-image-126949" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019992-bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro.jpg" alt="bitstamp exchange welcome page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019992-bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro.jpg 967w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019992-bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro-300x234.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019992-bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro-768x599.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></p>
<p>The platform offers both a simple interface and an advanced interface. Advanced trading gives you more control over your trade, whereas the simple interface offers a welcoming way to start buying crypto.</p>

<h3>10. Gemini &#8211; Well-Regulated Exchange with Perpetual Futures and Low Fees</h3>
<p>Founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/gemini/en">Gemini</a> has grown to become one of the top crypto exchanges due largely to its commitment to security. In addition to being a leading exchange, Gemini is also a leading crypto custody provider. The company was the first to earn both SOC 1 Type and SOC 2 Type 2 certifications, which are measures of financial reporting integrity and customer data security, respectively.</p>
<p>Like Coinbase and several other exchanges, you can choose from either a simple trading interface called Gemini or an advanced trading platform called Active Trader. Also like other exchanges, you’ll find the lowest trading fees on the advanced platform.</p>

<h2>What is a Cryptocurrency Exchange?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A crypto exchange is a marketplace where you can buy cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, with traditional (fiat) currencies, like the USD or GBP. Exchanges work like on ramps, a way to convert your fiat money into crypto and back again if you decide to sell. A crypto exchange or platform also acts as an intermediary, a go-between that allows buyers and sellers to transact without ever meeting, much like a stock exchange.</p>
<p>Full-featured exchanges like Binance or OKX also allow you to trade one cryptocurrency for another using trading pairs (trade this for that). For instance, you may want to trade some ETH (Ether from the Ethereum blockchain) for BTC (Bitcoin).</p>
<p>If there’s a trading pair on the exchange, you can trade one for the other, adjusting your crypto portfolio in one trade. Some platforms don’t offer everything you’ll find on an exchange, however, meaning you may not be able to trade one crypto for another.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>Crypto Exchanges vs. Crypto Brokers</h4>
<p>Both crypto exchanges and crypto brokers provide a way to trade cryptocurrencies. There are differences going on behind the scenes, however. Exchanges use an order book, a list of open buy and sell orders. You’re buying and selling against existing orders placed by other traders or market makers. If you use an advanced trading platform on an exchange like Kraken, you can see these orders.</p>
<p>Crypto brokers, on the other hand, are intermediaries between traders and the market. Brokers are in the middle of the transaction and you’re really buying from or selling to the broker rather than other traders. The broker then fills the buy or sell order through market makers and orders placed by other traders.</p>
<p>Crypto trading platforms also offer basic crypto storage. The exchange or platform provides a built-in crypto wallet called a custodial wallet that you can access with your account login. The details above all refer to centralized exchanges, trading platforms run by a company and often regulated by local governments. There’s another type of exchange called a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm"><u>decentralized exchange</u></a> (DEX) run by computer programs on the blockchain.</p>
<p>DEXs let users swap crypto directly from their crypto wallets. We’ll focus on the best centralized exchanges in this guide. A third (and less common) type of crypto exchange, called a P2P or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm"><u>Peer-to-Peer exchange,</u></a> allows buyers and sellers to transact directly.</p>
</div></div>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Exchange Fees</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>You can often avoid deposit fees by linking a bank account and depositing to your trading account from your bank account. Debit card transactions often come with additional fees of up to 4%. But there are some other fees to understand as well.</p>
<h3>Trading Fees</h3>
<p>We’ll discuss fees for specific types of trades in more detail in a bit, but crypto trading fees can come in several forms, depending on the platform and the type of trade.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed fees and simple trading fees:</strong> Many exchanges and platforms use a specific fee structure for trades that use a simple buy/sell widget as opposed to an advanced trading platform. Often, you’ll pay a fixed fee, which varies based on the transaction amount. The fee schedule may convert to a percentage-based fee as the transaction value crosses a certain threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Maker and taker fees:</strong> Advanced trading platforms use a maker/taker fee schedule, with the fee percentage typically driven by your 30-day trading volume. Placing a fixed price limit order maker you a “maker” because you’re making a market for other traders. “Takers” take liquidity off the market by trading against existing limit orders with a (buy at) market order. Take orders usually cost more in trading fees compared to maker orders.</li>
<li><strong>Spread fees:</strong> The spread generally refers to the difference in price between the highest-priced limit buy order and the lowest-price limit sell order. Exchanges may use a spread fee as the trading fee itself or in addition to a simple trading fee.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Withdrawal Fees</h3>
<p>Like trading fees, withdrawal fees come in more than one type.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiat withdrawal fees:</strong> Some exchanges charge a fee to withdraw your money from the exchange. If the exchange uses a fixed dollar amount for a fee, waiting until you can withdraw a larger amount reduces the cost of the withdrawal fee as a percentage of the withdrawal amount.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto withdrawal fees:</strong> If you withdraw crypto from an exchange by sending it to another wallet, you’ll pay a network fee. These fees vary by cryptocurrency type and the network to which you withdraw. For example, withdrawing ETH on the Ethereum network may cost several dollars depending on network activity. However, if you withdraw ETH on the Abitrum network, you’ll pay pennies rather than dollars. The size of the transaction does not affect network fees, but some platforms may charge a fixed withdrawal fee for crypto transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do Crypto Trading Platforms Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We discussed crypto exchanges as a marketplace to buy crypto with fiat money, such as USD or GBP, for example. Larger exchanges typically attract more buyers and sellers, making the pricing for common cryptos like Bitcoin competitive with the price elsewhere. For creating this marketplace and transferring crypto between buyers and sellers, the exchange typically charges a fee on trades.</p>
<p>However, you may find some platforms that don’t charge a trading fee. Generally, those platforms make money on the spread instead, which we’ll discuss in a bit. To comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations, many exchanges also require proof of identity. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges.htm"><u>Some exchanges don’t require KYC</u></a>, however. Typically, these include decentralized and P2P exchanges.</p>
<h3>How Crypto Trades Work</h3>
<p>Mechanically, there’s a lot going on under the hood of a cryptocurrency trading platform. Beginner-friendly platforms like MEXC obscure the complicated mechanics, giving you a simple trading interface and fee structure, especially when purchasing crypto directly with a card or Apple and Google Pay.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="541" class="alignnone wp-image-138349 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="MEXC buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>On MEXC, you can buy crypto like Bitcoin with USD. The spot market on MEXC as well as on other exchanges, like OKX or Coinbase Advanced, show more of what’s going on behind the scenes, including the ever-changing order book and executed orders flashing in real time.</p>
<p>The order book is at the heart of any exchange. As the name suggests, it’s a list of open orders. You’ll see sell orders stacked on top and buy orders listed at the bottom. These are all limit orders, meaning the trader sets a fixed price for the order. These are also called “maker” orders because the traders are making a market with their orders. Without maker orders, there are no trades because there’s no one to buy from or sell to, at least not visibly. As the market-making heroes of the story, maker orders typically earn lower trading fees.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="844" class="aligncenter wp-image-126955" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-1024x844.jpg" alt="coinbase crypto order book spread" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-1024x844.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-300x247.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-768x633.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-1536x1265.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In the screenshot of Coinbase Advanced above, you’ll also see the spread ($0.68) right above the limit buy orders and below the limit sell orders in the order book. Often, the spread on BTC is just $0.01 between the lowest-priced sell order (called the ask) and the highest-priced buy order (called the bid). However, spreads can be wider depending on which orders are open. On cryptocurrencies that don’t trade often or on low-volume exchanges, you can sometimes see much wider spreads.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>Spreads as Trading Fees</h4>
<p>Some platforms and exchanges use the spread as their fee, rather than charging a trading fee, while others might charge both a trading fee and a spread fee. Also, sometimes, a spread isn’t a spread as we described earlier.</p>
<p>Instead, the spread may be a fixed percentage fee, as seen with Coinbase’s simple trades. With Coinbase simple trades, you’ll pay a trading fee plus a 1% “spread.” Exchanges may use spread fees to lock in a price for your trade because ask prices can change quickly.</p>
</div></div>
<p>When you buy or sell without setting a price, it’s called a market order. You’re buying from or selling to other traders who placed limit orders on the exchange. Another name for a market order is a “taker” order because you’re taking liquidity provided by the maker orders in the order book. In the example below, if you wanted to buy 1 BTC, you could place a fixed-price limit order, which may or may not fill, or you could buy with a market order.</p>
<p>None of the existing orders offer one full BTC, however, so your order would fill from the bottom of the list and move up in price until you fill your order for 1 BTC. This is called slippage; the order slips into the next order in the order book, changing the average price for your order.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="1014" class="aligncenter wp-image-126956" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-1024x1014.jpg" alt="coinbase crypto order book slippage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-1024x1014.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-300x297.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-768x761.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book.jpg 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>You’ll also pay a bit more for the market order on many exchanges due to higher fees for taker orders. For example, Coinbase Advanced charges 0.6% on maker orders but 0.8% on taker orders.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>The Role of Market Makers in Crypto</h4>
<p>Odds are good that many of the orders you see in an exchange order book are from market makers rather than individual buyers and sellers. Market makers are people or companies that keep an inventory of an asset ready to sell (and cash ready to buy) while making a profit from the difference between the buy and sell price.</p>
<p>This parallels the role of market makers on stock exchanges, where they fill a similar role: reducing spreads and providing liquidity (making a ready trading market available). Typically, market makers earn a very small percentage on the asset they trade, making their profits from volume rather than margin.</p>
</div></div>
<h3>How Crypto Storage Works on Exchanges</h3>
<p>Once you’ve made your trade, the exchange holds your crypto for you. Technically, your crypto is in a crypto wallet controlled by the exchange called a custodial wallet. Crypto wallets work a lot like mailboxes.</p>
<p>You can send things from an address or receive things at an address. In this case, it’s crypto rather than bills and postcards. Unlike a mailbox, where your mail is hidden from view, the whole world can see the transactions in your crypto wallet, as shown in the transaction below from <a href="https://etherscan.io/"><u>Etherscan</u></a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="104" class="aligncenter wp-image-126960" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-1024x104.jpg" alt="etherscan history transaction hash" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-1024x104.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-300x31.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-768x78.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-1536x156.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The good news is that it’s unlikely that the average blockchain detective knows your wallet address belongs to you. For many traders, this custodial arrangement with exchanges works well. The exchange provides custody for your crypto and you use your login to access your account. As your crypto balance grows, however, or if you want to do things with your crypto, you may want to research the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm"><u>best crypto wallets</u></a> so you can self-custody your crypto.</p>
<h2>How to Choose the Best Crypto Exchange</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Whether you’re looking for the best crypto exchanges for beginners, the best bitcoin trading platform, or the best crypto trading platform for advanced traders, there are several factors to weigh. Features, fees, and safety all play important roles when choosing a platform that fits your trading needs and that won’t break the bank with surprise fees. Of course, it’s also essential to choose a platform that won’t disappear tomorrow, especially as your balance grows.</p>
<h3>Regulation/Licenses</h3>
<p>Much of the crypto industry remains unregulated, but some exchanges and trading platforms have taken steps to register with regulators and obtain licenses to operate in certain jurisdictions. For example, eToro operates in over 140 countries throughout the world and <a href="https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/regulation-license/"><u>is regulated in several larger trading markets</u></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>US: FINRA, SEC</li>
<li>UK: FCA</li>
<li>Australia: ASIC</li>
<li>Europe: CySEC</li>
</ul>
<p>Regulatory oversight offers an extra safeguard for investors that helps ensure cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto trading platforms follow regulations and conform to best practices. However, where each company is licensed or regulated matters. Exchanges often do business under different business units in various parts of the world. If you live in the UK, but the company is regulated in another country, UK safeguards may not apply. Ideally, look for exchanges that are regulated in your country or region.</p>
<p>Recently, the FCA named dozens of exchanges that it says are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-09/huobi-kucoin-among-crypto-firms-added-to-uk-fca-s-warning-list"><u>promoting financial services without the FCA’s permission</u></a>. While this, in itself, doesn’t make the named exchanges unsafe, it does illustrate regulatory risk. Exchanges that come under fire from regulators can be forced to change the business dramatically, as happened with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101"><u>Binance.US and the SEC</u></a>, or may even fall into insolvency, as happened with FTX (also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219"><u>charged by the SEC</u></a>).</p>
<h3>Available Cryptos</h3>
<p>Most exchanges offer BTC and ETH, which together represent about 70% of the total crypto market cap. Bitcoin alone represents about 50% of the market and often moves the rest of the market with its ebbs and flows. But you might not find the latest crypto that people are talking about on social media on some of the most popular exchanges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="623" class="alignnone wp-image-138356 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431984-mexc-spot-market.jpg" alt="MEXC spot market" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431984-mexc-spot-market.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431984-mexc-spot-market-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431984-mexc-spot-market-768x532.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>MEXC offers over 1,000 cryptos worldwide, whereas Binance and OKX offer over 350 each. If if you have your sights set on a particular cryptocurrency that’s only available at a few exchanges, that’s likely to drive your decision.</p>
<h3>Trading Fees and Additional Fees</h3>
<p>Many exchanges offer competitive fees if you use the advanced platform. However, the advanced platforms often look like a hacker’s terminal, with numbers flashing in green and red and trades whooshing by. It’s not a welcoming place for beginners. By contrast. simpler trading platforms often come with higher fees.</p>
<p>For example, using Coinbase’s simple trades will rack up $3.84 in fees to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin. By comparison, MEXC, costs $0 for the same $100 buying transaction on the spot market. Weigh trading fees in the context of how you’ll use the platform. Low fees for advanced trading don’t mean much if you think you’ll only use the simple trading interface.</p>
<h3>Crypto Wallet</h3>
<p>Centralized crypto exchanges and trading platforms offer a built-in crypto wallet, but it’s not always obvious. In short, the exchange holds your crypto in a crypto wallet that they control. You access your funds through your account login. Many exchanges also offer a separate wallet that allows you to send and receive supported cryptocurrencies or move cryptocurrencies off the platform. For example, Coinbase offers Coinbase Wallet, which supports Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs using a mobile app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="511" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-126965" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020789-coinbase-crypto-wallet-511x1024.jpg" alt="coinbase crypto wallet dashboard" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020789-coinbase-crypto-wallet-511x1024.jpg 511w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020789-coinbase-crypto-wallet-150x300.jpg 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020789-coinbase-crypto-wallet.jpg 694w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" /></p>
<p>Coinbase Wallet can be more complicated to set up, though, compared to simpler wallets like eToro’s wallet, called eToro Money, or the Strike app, which serves as a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. Some traders never need or want a separate crypto wallet, although two benefits of crypto wallets merit consideration. Crypto wallets allow you to store your crypto in a wallet you control.</p>
<p>The custodial exchange wallets on FTX were controlled by FTX. Customers who held balances on the exchange are now <a href="https://time.com/6236610/ftx-account-holders-money-back/"><u>unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy process</u></a>. Crypto wallets allow you to put your crypto to use elsewhere. Crypto held on an exchange usually doesn&#8217;t do much. The price goes up and down, but you often can’t use it to earn a yield. However, ETH, for example, can be moved off the exchange and used in decentralized finance  (DeFi) applications like Lido or Balancer to earn yield with your crypto. The availability of a crypto wallet with the platform’s branding is of lesser importance than the ability to move your crypto off the platform to a crypto wallet of your choosing.</p>
<h3>Trading Tools &amp; Features</h3>
<p>Consider which tools you’re likely to use when trading. OKX and Binance both offer trading bots, for example, which are rules-driven digital traders that work for you 24-7. You may not need these digital gizmos, but you might want access to advanced charts like the customizable TradingView charts on MEXC. And there isn’t always one answer. You might use OKX for its trading bots or Strike for its Bitcoin DCA, while also using MEXC for its copy trading, which lets you copy money-making traders trade-for-trade.</p>
<h3>Available Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Sometimes, how you can pay for trades (and the fees for those payments) makes all the difference. MEXC supports bank deposits and cards. Coinbase also supports all these payment methods plus PayPal deposits. Generally, bank transfers are the cheapest way to fund your trading account.</p>
<h3>Reputation and Customer Service</h3>
<p>Overall, crypto exchanges have a pretty spotty record when it comes to customer service. Check a rating site like Trustpilot before you make a move. But bear in mind that, like the insurance industry and many other financial services, the crypto industry tends to garner low customer satisfaction ratings. Coinbase, for example, has a <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/coinbase.com"><u>1.5 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. Binance isn’t much higher with its <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/binance.com"><u>2.1 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. These are two of the largest crypto exchanges on the planet. eToro is the standout in this group with an impressive <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.etoro.com"><u>4.4 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. Also, look for ways you can reach out if you have a question or problem. Many platforms offer chat or email support. A handful, like Coinbase, offer a customer service phone number.</p>
<h3>Mobile App</h3>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/"><u>60% of internet traffic</u></a> happens on mobile devices now, so a full-featured mobile app becomes a must for many traders. Both MEXC and Coinbase offer mobile apps that closely match the trading experience you’ll find on the desktop app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="398" class="alignnone wp-image-138359 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432207-mexc-mobile-app.jpg" alt="MEXC mobile app" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432207-mexc-mobile-app.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432207-mexc-mobile-app-300x133.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432207-mexc-mobile-app-768x340.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Strike, on the other hand, is a mobile-first app, although there’s also a Chrome extension available. Check the App Store or Play Store ratings for the exchanges you’re considering if you think you’ll be accessing your trading account with a phone or tablet.</p>
<h2>Are Cryptocurrency Exchanges Legal?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto exchanges are legal in many parts of the world, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, but it’s important to note that they’re unregulated, meaning the chances of being covered by financial compensation schemes are very slim. However, centralized trading platforms are subject to certain regulations that share a common theme.</p>
<p>In the US, for example, exchanges fall under the scope of the <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html"><u>Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</u></a>, which focuses on anti-money laundering (AML) and similar financial crimes. If you’ve ever wondered why you need to prove your identity before you can trade, AML and KYC (<a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/meaning-kyc"><u>Know Your Customer)</u></a> banking standards are at the heart of this requirement.</p>
<h3>US Cryptocurrency Laws</h3>
<p>In the US, cryptocurrencies fall under the purview of the SEC if they are securities. A security refers to a financial instrument in which there is an investment of money and in which the expected profits are due to the actions of someone else. For example, if you buy TSLA stock, your expected returns are based on the actions of Tesla’s management and workers. TSLA is a security.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies don’t all share this third-party element, although the topic is a source of constant controversy with the SEC. The agency <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102"><u>sued Coinbase in 2023,</u></a> alleging the sale of unregistered securities, one of many such lawsuits. Complicating the crypto scene in the US further, each of the US states has its own laws and licensing requirements. As a result, many crypto exchanges that operate in the US don’t operate in all 50 states.</p>
<h3>UK Cryptocurrency Laws</h3>
<p>Trading crypto is legal in the UK, but <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-bill-2022-factsheets/fact-sheet-cryptoassets-technical"><u>exchanges that operate in the UK must register with the FCA</u></a> and comply with AML rules such as proof-of-identity requirements. The FCA also introduced <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-introduces-tough-new-rules-marketing-cryptoassets"><u>new rules regarding crypto marketing</u></a> designed to protect new investors.</p>
<h3>Australia Cryptocurrency Laws</h3>
<p>Crypto trading platforms operating in Australia <a href="https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/your-industry/digital-currency-cryptocurrency/digital-currency-exchange-providers"><u>must register with AUSTRAC</u></a>, the country’s anti-money laundering authority. This brings with it the familiar identity verification requirements we see on most centralized exchanges. Exchanges also fall under the purview of the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/"><u>Australian Securities and Investments Commission</u></a> (ASIC), Australia’s equivalent of the SEC in the US.</p>
<h3>Canada Cryptocurrency Laws</h3>
<p>In Canada, regulators see crypto assets as securities, a distinction still open to debate in the neighboring US. Like other securities, including stocks, cryptocurrencies are legal in Canada, although the country has enacted tougher rules regarding trading limits, prompting exchanges like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-will-proactively-withdraw-canada-2023-05-12/"><u>Binance to leave the Canadian market</u></a>. The <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/"><u>Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)</u></a> oversees crypto trading in Canada. While trading cryptocurrencies is legal in many countries, it’s prudent to stay up-to-date on the regulatory climate where you live, as well as which crypto exchanges may encounter trouble with local regulators. After the SEC sued Binance, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/banks-to-cut-off-binance-access-to-us-banking-system-exchange-says.html"><u>US-only exchange lost its banking partners</u></a>, causing temporary chaos in trading for USD-based trading pairs on the platform as there was no easy way to take USD off the exchange.</p>
<h2>Are Crypto Exchanges Safe to Use?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>No exchange or trading platform is 100% safe to use, but there are ways to reduce your risk. There’s also a possibility of outsized gains that might make the risk worth taking. Between 2011 and 2021, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-vastly-outperformed-gold-and-sp-500-over-the-past-decade"><u>Bitcoin rewarded investors with more than 437,000% returns</u></a>. First, it’s important to understand that there’s no government insurance available.</p>
<p>The exception is pass-through insurance available on cash balances on platforms like eToro and Coinbase. In both cases, US customers enjoy pass-through FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) on cash balances of up to $250,000. However, crypto assets are not covered by FDIC insurance or any similar program. This theme is carried throughout the crypto industry.</p>
<p>For example, eToro (UK) carries <a href="https://www.etoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Insurance-Disclosure-to-Clients-17.11.2020.docx.pdf"><u>Excess of Loss insurance</u></a>, which safeguards investors against broker insolvency. However, this policy excludes real cryptocurrencies. That doesn’t mean there’s no insurance at all. Coinbase carries a policy that <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured"><u>insures against platform breaches</u></a>. But generally, your crypto assets are uninsured. By choosing a platform that’s regulated in major markets, such as eToro, Coinbase, Kraken, or Bitstamp, you’ll have government regulators as allies, a set of well-trained eyes watching over the exchange.</p>
<p>You can also look for crypto trading platforms that offer proof-of-reserves (POR) to verify the platform has your crypto. Kraken and OKX both offer POR. Lastly, if you trade in size or as your account grows, you can consider moving your crypto to a self-custody wallet like MetaMask (Ethereum) or Electrum (Bitcoin). It comes down to the old adage about eggs and baskets. Moving some crypto off the exchange can reduce your risk if the exchange runs into trouble.</p>
<h2>Types of Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and brokers like eToro represent the most common way to buy crypto with traditional currencies. But what is a centralized exchange, and what is the alternative?</p>
<h3>Centralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>A centralized exchange (CEX) is a crypto trading platform run by a company that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Coinbase may be the most well-known example. When you trade on Coinbase, you’re not trading directly with another trader. Instead, you’re buying or selling against on order book, a list of open fixed-priced orders on the exchange.</p>
<p>Centralized exchanges offer a convenient way to convert fiat money, like USD or GBP, to cryptocurrency or to sell crypto for fiat currencies. But centralized exchanges also offer custodial storage, meaning they can hold your crypto for you on the exchange. Similarly, centralized exchanges typically offer ways for you to take your crypto off the exchange. Centralization makes is easier to establish fiat on-ramps and off-ramps.</p>
<p>In many cases, it also means the exchange may be subject to regulation in many jurisdictions. One potential downside, however, is that the exchange controls your crypto wallet on the exchange. They have the ability to pause or freeze withdrawals.</p>
<h3>Decentralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>Where centralized exchanges are run by management teams, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is run by software called smart contracts. A smart contract is a computer program on the blockchain that users can interact with to perform various transactions. Instead of an order book, decentralized exchanges typically use liquidity pools.</p>
<p>Crypto investors can deposit one or more types of crypto into a liquidity pool, and this pool and other traders use the pool to swap crypto A for crypto B. Decentralized exchanges let you trade from within your own crypto wallet, so you don’t have to deposit your crypto before making a swap. Swap fees typically come in low as well, often at 0.3% or lower. To make swaps on a decentralized exchange, though, you’ll need crypto to swap. In many cases, you can buy crypto through a third-party provider partnered with the DEX. Fees can be higher than using a centralized exchange, however.</p>
<p>Many traders buy on centralized exchanges and then transfer the crypto to a self-custody wallet where they can use their crypto for swaps, to provide liquidity (and earn trading fees), or in several other ways. The most popular decentralized exchanges, including Uniswap and Balancer, run on the Ethereum network. Many also support Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum or Polygon.</p>
<h2>Buy Crypto Within Cash and Payment Apps</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Sometimes, the best crypto exchanges aren’t exchanges at all. Several payment apps, including Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, provide a convenient way to buy popular cryptocurrencies. You won’t find a massive selection of hundreds of choices, however. But if you’re primarily interested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other cryptos, you may not need to learn a new platform. You can build your stack with an app you may already use daily.</p>
<h3>Cash App</h3>
<p>Cash App offers Bitcoin as its only crypto option, but the popular payment platform also offers over 1,800 stocks and exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin trading fees on Cash App come in higher than you’ll find on an advanced trading platform like Coinbase Advanced or Gemini Active Trader but compare well with user-friendly platforms like Coinbase’s simple trades. For example, to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Cash App, you’ll pay $2.25 in fees. Using Coinbase’s simple trades, you’d pay $3.84 for the same purchase amount. <a href="https://cash.app/help/3103-bitcoin-fees">Cash App Bitcoin fees</a> range from 0.75% to 3%, depending on the transaction amount. Cash App also provides a Bitcoin wallet, so you can send or spend your Bitcoin or move it to another crypto hardware wallet if needed.</p>
<h3>PayPal</h3>
<p>With a few more cryptocurrencies available, PayPal offers another way to buy popular crypto assets like Bitcoin. In total, PayPal offers five options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
<li>Bitcoin Cash</li>
<li>Ethereum</li>
<li>Litecoin</li>
<li>PayPal USD (PYUSD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Like Cash App, PayPal lets you withdraw your crypto to a separate crypto wallet. PayPal used a fixed fee schedule to purchase crypto in amounts of $200 and under. At the lowest tier (up to $4.99), you’ll pay $0.49. The cost to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin falls into the highest fixed fee tier at $2.49, or about 2.5%. Above $200, fees range from 1.5% to 1.8%. PayPal supports crypto purchases for personal accounts but disables the feature for business accounts.</p>
<h3>Venmo</h3>
<p>PayPal owns Venmo, and now both platforms offer the same lineup of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Crypto buying and selling fees parallel PayPal as well, with both platforms using a fixed fee schedule for purchases up to $200. A purchase for up $100 worth of Bitcoin costs $2.49 on Venmo. Similar to Cash App, you’ll need to use the mobile app to buy and sell crypto, however. The web app for both platforms offers limited functionality.</p>
<h2>How do Crypto Exchange Fees Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Earlier in the guide, we discussed limit orders, market orders, and spreads. Here’s how they all come together to determine crypto exchange fees.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commission:</strong> Brokers like eToro charge a commission, which is another name for a trading fee. The difference, in eToro’s case, for example, is that the commission is a fixed percentage of the order and does not change based on trading volume.</li>
<li><strong>Trading fees:</strong> Exchanges like OKX charge a trading fee based on the value of the trade and your trading volume (usually looking at a 30-day history). These trading fees might also differ depending on whether you place a market order or a limit order.</li>
<li><strong>Market orders</strong> (also called taker orders) mean you’re buying at market price from the existing orders in the order book. On many exchanges, you’ll pay a higher fee for market orders compared to limit orders (up next).</li>
<li><strong>Limit orders</strong> (also caller maker orders) mean you’re placing an order at a fixed price. These orders sit on the order book until there’s a match or a market order in the price range of your order. You’ll usually pay a lower fee for limit orders, but there’s also a chance that your buy or sell order might not be filled if the market price is too far away.</li>
<li><strong>Spreads: </strong>A spread refers to the price difference between the lowest price limit sell order and the highest price limit buy order. On busy exchanges and with high-volume cryptos like BTC, the spread is often just $0.01. However, we showed a screenshot earlier where the spread was $0.68. For BTC, which trades at over $26,000 currently, that $0.68 spread is still quite small, but for thinly traded cryptos, the spread can be much wider relative to the trading price, possibly causing a sub-optimal trade.</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>How Display Fees Work</h4>
<p>There’s another type of fee structure you’ll see on Coinbase&#8217;s simple trades or Kraken’s simple trades, for example. These easy-to-use trading boxes can come with much higher fees and often use complicated schedules that assign a different fee based on the value of the order and the payment method. Kraken, for instance, calls this a display fee, meaning you’ll see it displayed before you make your trade.</p>
<p>Typically, trades with a display fee also bring an additional cost in the form of a spread. In this case, the spread may be much wider than you’ll see in order-book spreads. Usually, the spread is in the quoted price, so it’s not hidden, but it’s also not shown precisely. Always check the price for your trade — including spreads and fees — to be sure the trade still makes sense for you.</p>
</div></div>
<p>There are a few other fees to watch out for, but not all exchanges charge these fees. Consider the big picture in regard to costs when choosing the best crypto exchange for your needs. A cryptocurrency trading platform with low trading fees might charge other fees that make trading costlier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit fees</li>
<li>Withdrawal fees</li>
<li>Conversion fees</li>
<li>Inactivity fees</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let’s say you buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Bitstamp with no trading fee. If your balance stays at $100 and you want to withdraw, you’ll pay about $13 in withdrawal fees or about 13% of your investment’s value.</p>
<p>However, if you continue buying and your balance grows to $5,000, that same $13 fee drops to 0.26% of your investment’s value. Weigh how you’ll use the platform and how additional fees might affect your trading cost on each of the crypto trading platforms you’re considering.</p>
<h2>How to Use a Cryptocurrency Exchange &#8211; 4 Simple Steps</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When you’re ready to buy cryptocurrency, you can follow these 4 simple steps. We chose <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC</a> for this example because the onboarding process is smooth and crypto trading fees are a flat 0% on the spot market. This winning combination makes MEXC well-suited for all traders and investors.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Open an Account</h3>
<p>Visit <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC.com</a> to open a trading account. You can signup with your MetaMask wallet, your Telegram or Google account. Or you you can use an email.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="442" class="alignnone wp-image-138363 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg" alt="MEXC signup " srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-768x377.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3>Step 2: Fund your account</h3>
<p>If you use a SEPA bank deposit, you will have to verify your account via a KYC (know your customer) process. However, this option is not available in all countries, meaning you will have to use other deposit methods, including credit card purchases to fund your account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="541" class="alignnone wp-image-138349 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="MEXC buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3>Step 3: Buy the Cryptocurrency You Want</h3>
<p>Buying crypto directly with a card is limited to only a few options including Bitcoin. If you&#8217;re looking to buy other crypto coins, purchase USDT first and then use the spot market to buy the coins you want.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Make Your First Trade</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to buy DOGE. You will first need to purchase USDT coins and then go to the spot market. Look for DOGE in the search bar at the top of the page and select DOGE/USDT pair.</p>
<p>Enter the amount of DOGE you wish to buy and select the price. Click &#8220;Buy DOGE&#8221;. And you&#8217;re set.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="436" class="alignnone wp-image-138366 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge.jpg" alt="MEXC buy DOGE" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-300x145.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-768x372.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to keep your coins on the exchange, simply go to your wallet section and withdraw your coins into your crypto wallet. Alternatively, visit MEXC Savings and stake your coins to earn annual percentage rate.</p>
<h2>Why Trust Us</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Our editors are committed to independent and fair reviews. Wherever possible, we use the products or services we review to bring you a real-world perspective on the pros and cons of each. For this exchange review, we made real trades with real money. This gives us the ability to speak knowledgeably about each aspect of the exchange and trading platforms reviewed from a user perspective. When appropriate, we used a data-driven ranking system to determine which exchanges and trading platforms earned a spot.</p>
<h2>Our Methodology</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We evaluated dozens of different exchanges, trading platforms, and crypto trading apps. The trading fees shown for each platform reflect the cost of trading at various volume tiers. Where possible, simple trading platforms and advanced trading platforms on the same exchange were also compared. Additionally, we compared the cost to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on each platform.</p>
<p>In this review of the best crypto exchanges, we looked for benefits that can help you save or make more money while also being mindful of features or limitations that may create a stumbling block for newer users. On each exchange, we used the advanced trading platform or simple trading platform, depending on which options were available, and compared the experiences. The best crypto exchange in a given area may not have earned a top pick overall. In ranking the top exchanges, we considered the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple trades:</strong> We evaluated both trading costs and ease of use for platforms that offered simple buy/sell widgets.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced trades</strong>: For platforms with advanced trading features, we weighed trading options as well as ease of use and charting ability.</li>
<li><strong>Available cryptocurrencies:</strong> Support for Bitcoin was mandatory, but we also evaluated the depth of available cryptocurrencies on each exchange and which other popular or trending cryptos were available.</li>
<li><strong>Overall trading costs:</strong> We considered other fees and expenses people may encounter, including deposit fees, withdrawal fees, inactivity fees, and spread costs.</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources for new investors:</strong> We weighed the educational content available on each platform as well as help tip placement near trading widgets that could be confusing for new users.</li>
<li><strong>Security features:</strong> We evaluated account security, custodial storage, and the ability to move crypto assets off the platform if needed. Regulation: Where applicable, we detailed the regulatory agencies that oversee each exchange in major markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There’s a trading platform available for nearly every trading style. Crypto trading platforms like Kraken and MEXC give you room to grow as a crypto trader with a vast library of educational resources, but they also cater to seasoned traders with advanced charting features and tools.</p>
<p>But one of the top features is copy trading, which lets you copy the trades of successful traders on the platform. This strategy can eliminate the need for technical analysis before making a trade. MEXC is one of the few exchanges that offers this feature. And when you want to invest by yourself, MEXC&#8217;s flat 0% spot trading fee will save you money in the long run. While MEXC is available in most countries, it&#8217;s not supported in the US at the moment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Letting an exchange or trading platform hold your crypto brings risk. Millions of compromised website logins are for sale on the dark web at any given time.

The best crypto hardware wallets offer offline storage of your wallet’s private keys, keeping your crypto safer from online threats.</p>

<h2>The Best Crypto Hardware Wallets Reviews</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Here’s how our top picks for best hardware wallets compare.</p>
<h3>1. Ledger Nano X &#8211; Bluetooth-Enabled Hardware Wallet With Open-Source Software</h3>
<p>Building on the success of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/en">Ledger</a> Nano S and S Plus, the Ledger Nano X updates the iconic design of Ledger wallets and brings Bluetooth connectivity for crypto management without wires. Connect to your phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop to do your crypto thing at home or on the go. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015216913-Frequently-asked-questions">Bluetooth connectivity for desktops is in the works</a> and should become available with a future firmware update.</p>
<p>Ledger was the first hardware wallet maker to include a Secure Element chip in its devices. Designed to protect against known attacks and make the device tamper-resistant, this chip safely stores sensitive data. Ledger hardware wallets use the Secure Element to generate and store the private keys that control the assets in your wallet.</p>
<p>About the size and shape of a USB thumb drive, the Ledger Nano X is easy to carry. And with battery power and Bluetooth, it’s designed to go anywhere your crypto journey takes you. The wallet pairs with the Ledger Live mobile or desktop application. Send and receive crypto to your hardware wallet using the Ledger Live App.</p>
<p>Where the Ledger Nano X and most other mobile-friendly wallets disappoint is in their ability to connect to third-party wallet apps. If you want to connect to MetaMask’s mobile app, for example, there’s currently no way to do so. The companies are working together to build support for <a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-metamask-strengthen-partnership-ledger-nano-x-soon-compatible-with-metamask-mobile-app">Ledger Bluetooth-enabled devices paired with MetaMask</a>. In the interim, Ledger Live provides access to an assortment of built-in dApps, and MetaMask offers Ledger wallet support for its desktop browser extension.</p>

<p>Upmarket from the Ledger Nano X is the still-in-production Ledger Stax, which raises the bar higher with its innovative E-Ink touchscreen, Bluetooth, and roomy user interface. At press time, the Stax is available for preorder.</p>
<p>Ledger’s Nano X remains the flagship model for now and a top choice for the company’s over 5 million customers.</p>

<h3>2. Trezor Model T &#8211; Touchscreen Bitcoin Hardware Wallet With Support for Multiple Blockchains</h3>
<div>In 2014, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en">Trezor</a> made the world’s first hardware crypto wallet. Since that innovation, dozens of competing wallets have emerged. Yet, Trezor remains one of the most trusted wallets available today. Much of that trust centers around transparency. Trezor makes the entire device code open-source. Anyone can read the source code for both the firmware that powers the device itself as well as the software suite used to set up the device and explore the ecosystem.</div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="466" class="aligncenter wp-image-121244" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-1024x466.png" alt="trezor model t crypto wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-1024x466.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-300x136.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-768x349.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-1536x699.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t.png 1565w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>The Trezor Model T is the company’s flagship product, boasting a 240&#215;240 touchscreen display combined with a slim, portable design. The device measures just under 2.5 inches tall and slightly over 1 inch wide. While the Model T and its slightly smaller Model One, which we’ll cover in just a bit, are easy to travel with, they aren’t designed to connect with mobile devices. This Trezor hardware wallet connects to a laptop or desktop.</p>
<p>With support for 1470+ tokens and coins, the Trezor Model T won’t recognize as many tokens natively as Ledger devices. However, you can still store ERC-20 tokens that aren’t specifically listed as supported. With new tokens launching daily, this issue is common to most wallets. As a workaround, you can view your Ethereum and Layer 2 portfolio using a frequently updated portfolio app, such as Debank, Zapper, or Zerion.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trezor.io/6-features-that-make-trezor-the-1-hardware-wallet-5e3bcbdb2c31">Trezor reports support for over 8,000 coins and tokens</a> using the Trezor Suite and (unnamed) third-party tools.</p>
<p>One standout feature of Trezor wallets is easy access to hidden wallets. You can build a standard wallet, keeping a small amount of crypto available while also keeping a hidden stash protected by a password. Build your hidden wallet using Trezor Suite, the open-source app that accompanies Trezor devices, allowing easy updates or even installation of custom firmware.</p>
<h4>Trezor Model T Pros and Cons</h4>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Portable design</li>
<li>Open-source software &amp; firmware</li>
<li>USB-C support</li>
<li>Tamper-resistant design</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<li>Higher cost</li>

<h3>3. Ledger Nano S Plus &#8211; Budget-Friendly Hardware Wallet With a Secure Element Chip</h3>
<p>As a lower-cost alternative to the Ledger Nano X, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/en">Ledger Nano S Plus</a> combines much of the same functionality and a familiar design language with a budget-friendly price tag. At $79, the Nano S Plus comes in $70 lower than the Nano X.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s missing versus the Nano X:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth connectivity</li>
<li>Battery-powered portability</li>
<li>Slightly larger screen on the Nano X</li>
</ul>
<p>The Nano S Plus gets its power from a supplied USB-A to USB-C cable. Optionally, you can connect with a USB-C to USB-C cable, allowing you to use your Nano S with USB-C-enabled mobile devices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="560" height="689" class="aligncenter wp-image-121249" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus.png" alt="ledger nano s plus" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus.png 560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus-244x300.png 244w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p>Like the slightly larger X, the S Plus supports up to 100 installed applications as well as 5,000 coins and tokens. Both devices share a similar design, diverging mainly on screen size and button placement. While the Nano X is sleeker in appearance, the Nano S Plus borrows from the legacy of the legendary Nano S, giving you a sturdy yet powerful device that can survive many of life’s mishaps.</p>
<p>While more affordable, the Nano S Plus doesn’t feel like a budget device. When compared to other popular lower-cost devices like the Trezor Model One, the S Plus is a smidgen heavier, but by no means heavy, and doesn’t exhibit any unexpected creaks or rattles.</p>
<p>The Nano S Plus also features the Secure Element chip found in all of Ledger’s lineup. The chip offers a tamper-resistant storage solution for your wallet’s private keys.</p>
<p>If you don’t need Bluetooth connectivity or battery-powered portability, the Nano S Plus provides a no-compromise solution with a lower price tag than the upmarket X.</p>

<h3>4. Trezor Model One &#8211; Low-Cost Open-Source Hardware Wallet With a Proven History</h3>
<p>No hardware wallet is more iconic than the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en">Trezor</a> Model One. Dating back to 2014, the Model One was the first crypto hardware wallet ever made, and it’s still a leading choice as a Bitcoin hardware wallet or multi-chain hardware crypto wallet for many in the crypto community.</p>
<p>There are no finicky touchscreens or wireless Bluetooth connection options. Instead, you get a battle-tested two-button hardware wallet that’s reliable and affordable.</p>
<p>As evidence of the Model One’s heritage, the device connects via a Micro USB cable. This legacy cable type is prone to wear, but you can use any data-enabled Micro USB cable with the wallet. Two pleasantly clicky buttons under a smallish but clear display allow you to navigate through transactions easily.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="493" class="aligncenter wp-image-121256" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-1024x493.png" alt="trezor model one" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-1024x493.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-768x370.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one.png 1226w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Like the Model T, everything about the Model One is transparent. The device is powered by open-source firmware, which you can wipe, which resets the device, or replace entirely. The device pairs with the open-source Trezor Suite, which enables setup and offers simple exchange or peer-to-peer trading.</p>
<p>Token support on the Model One is about a third lower than you’ll find on the Model T. Of note, Ripple (XRP) is not supported, but Model T devices with firmware version 2.08 or higher support the in-demand cryptocurrency. Similarly, Cardano (ADA) is not supported on the Model One but is supported on the Model T and the new Trezor Safe 3.</p>
<p>However, you’ll find support for widely traded cryptos like BTC and ETH, as well as ERC-20 tokens and NFTs</p>
<h4>What Are ERC-20 Tokens?</h4>
<p>The crypto economy is made up of both coins and tokens.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coins are the cryptocurrency specific to their own block chain. For example, Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin blockchain.</li>
<li>Tokens are crypto assets used on other blockchains. For example, WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin used on the Ethereum blockchain as well as several other blockchains. But there is no Wrapped Bitcoin blockchain. WBTC only exists on other blockchains.</li>
</ul>
<p>ERC-20 refers to a way to standardize tokens used on the Ethereum blockchain and other compatible blockchains. Many of the crypto assets you see traded on exchanges are actually tokens rather than coins, and many of these follow the ERC-20 token standard. In practical application, the ERC-20 standard means that each ERC-20 of the same type is the same as the next, much like each Bitcoin is the same as the next or each dollar is the same as the next dollar.</p>
<p>Expect a lengthy initial setup process on any Trezor device. However, each step leaves newer users with a better understanding of how crypto wallets work and how Trezor’s features help keep your crypto secure.</p>

<h3>5. Tangem &#8211; Slim, Credit-Card-Sized Hardware Wallet With NFC Support for Mobile Devices</h3>
<p>If you can make room in your wallet for one more credit-card-sized item, you can carry a secure crypto hardware wallet with you wherever you go. That’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tangem/en">Tangem</a>, a card-like crypto wallet powered by (near-field communication) NFC technology and designed to work with mobile devices.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever used tap to pay, you’ve used NFC.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" class="aligncenter wp-image-121277" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-1024x678.png" alt="tangem hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-1024x678.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-300x199.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-768x509.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Tangem, a Swiss-based company, launched the Tangem wallet in 2018 with the goal of making affordable, secure crypto storage available to everyone. The simple setup process takes just a few minutes, and the wallet costs less than $55 for a 2-card set.</p>
<p>Most crypto wallets use a seed phrase, a human-readable version of the wallet’s private key that lets you send or spend your crypto. Typically, these seed phrases are 12 or 24 words long and often difficult to remember. Tangem sidesteps this newbie-unfriendly aspect of crypto storage by doing away with the seed phrase. Instead, you can back up your wallet to a second Tangem wallet card, which is then protected by an access code.</p>
<p>While Tangem wallets are designed to be used without a seed phrase, the <a href="https://tangem.com/en/blog/post/new-tangem-wallet/">newest (version 2.0) cards support a seed-phrase option</a> using the companion mobile app.</p>
<p>The wallet really does resemble a credit card and uses an embedded NFC chip to communicate with a partner app installed on your NFC-enabled smartphone. Not all smartphones support NFC, so double-check compatibility before you make a purchase.</p>
<p>The brains of the operation are found in a 1 x 1 mm Samsung chip held inside the card itself. No batteries are needed, and the wallet is resistant to dust, water, X-rays, and even electromagnetic pulses.</p>

<h3>6. Ellipal Titan &#8211; Air-Gapped Crypto Hardware Wallet With a Large Touchscreen</h3>
<p>If credit-card-sized wallets are a bit too small for your tastes, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ellipal/en">Ellipal Titan</a> may be a better fit. As the name suggests, it’s big, nearly 6 inches tall and over 4 inches wide. The Titan’s larger dimensions translate to more real estate for the device’s responsive touchscreen display.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="493" class="aligncenter wp-image-121279" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-1024x493.png" alt="ellipal titan crypto wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-1024x493.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-768x370.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan.png 1138w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Ellipal’s Titan supports over 10,000 cryptocurrencies and is completely air-gapped. There’s no Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC, USB, or any other way for the wallet’s private keys to come anywhere near the internet. Instead, the Ellipal Titan uses QR codes to share information with the Ellipal mobile app. The wallet itself also has a camera to scan QR codes from the mobile app.</p>
<p>You can also send crypto to your Ellipal cryptocurrency hardware wallet from a crypto exchange like Coinbase. Using the Coinbase app, snap a pic of the QR code for your crypto wallet address shown on the Ellipal device. Coinbase and similar apps convert the QR code to an address, ensuring the crypto goes to the right address without the risk of typos.</p>

<h3>7. NGRAVE ZERO &#8211; Air-Gapped Crypto Hardware Wallet With Military-Grade Construction</h3>
<p>Similar to the Ellipal Titan, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ngrave/en">NGRAVE ZERO</a> is a completely air-gapped wallet. That means the wallet cannot connect to the internet at all. There’s no WiFi, NFC, USB, or Bluetooth support. Also like the Ellipal, the NGRAVE communicates via QR codes and cameras. The device uses these QR codes to communicate with the LIQUID companion app.</p>
<p>The internet-enabled mobile app is where you can view your balances. The ZERO device itself is used for signing transactions using its 480&#215;800 pixel touchscreen display.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="693" class="aligncenter wp-image-121285" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-1024x693.png" alt="ngrave zero hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-1024x693.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-300x203.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-768x519.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero.png 1075w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Security is job one with the NGRAVE. The ZERO comes with an EAL7 security-certified OS, the highest security certification available, and a first within the crypto hardware wallet space. The hardware wallet also features a fingerprint reader to help ensure secure access.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>What Are EAL Certifications?</h4>
<p>Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) ratings offer a way to compare the security of a product and use a scale from EAL1 to EAL7.</p>
<p>Crypto wallet hardware devices with a Secure Element chip often earn an EAL5 rating or higher. EAL ratings can also apply to operating systems as well, as shown with the NGRAVE ZERO’s EAL7-certified operating system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Private key generation on the NGRAVE uses a clever combination of techniques to aid randomness. A combination of a random number algorithm, your fingerprint, and the ambient light in the room all play a role when the ZERO creates your unique private key. These variable elements make reverse engineering of the private key improbable.</p>
<p>Although the ZERO is a pricier option at nearly $400, the investment may be worthwhile for those with more to protect.</p>
<div>
<h4>NGRAVE ZERO Pros and Cons</h4>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Randomized private key</li>
<li>Airg-gapped wallet</li>

<h3>8. Safepal S1 Pro &#8211; Budget-Friendly Air-Gapped Hardware Wallet With a Secure Element Chip</h3>
<p>You could spend hundreds on an air-gapped crypto hardware wallet, but <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/safepal/en">Safepal</a> delivers air-gapped security for under $100 with two models: the S1 and the S1 Pro. The Pro offers longer battery life combined with a more durable housing made with aluminum alloy and tempered glass. If you’re making an investment in your long-term crypto security, the $90 S1 Pro may be a better value compared to the $50 Safepal S1.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="410" class="aligncenter wp-image-121288" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-1024x410.png" alt="safepal s1 cold wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-1024x410.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-768x307.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1.png 1094w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Otherwise, the devices deliver the same specs. Both come with a 1.3-inch color screen paired with a d-pad for navigation. Both devices are also air-gapped, meaning they can’t connect to the internet, and come with EAL5+ certified Secure Element chips.</p>
<p>Choose your level of security on demand with a choice of 12, 18, or 24 mnemonic seed phrases for your private key. Longer phrases are more secure. Shorter phrases may be easier to memorize. Then, secure your device with a PIN.</p>
<p>Like other air-gapped wallets, the Safepal communicates with a mobile app via QR codes.</p>

<h3>9. KeepKey &#8211; Affordable Hardware Wallet With Support for 7,000+ Cryptos and ShapeShift Integration</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/keepkey/en">KeepKey</a> app and wallet experience is reminiscent of using a Ledger wallet with the Ledger Live app. Both offer polished user experiences and high-quality devices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="414" class="aligncenter wp-image-121291" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-1024x414.png" alt="keepkey wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-1024x414.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-300x121.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-768x311.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There are two key differences, however. KeepKey does not support Bluetooth, a leading feature of the Ledger Nano X. Additionally, the KeepKey app features <a href="https://shapeshift.com/">ShapeShift</a>, a leading multichain trading platform. <a href="https://www.keepkey.com/faqs">KeepKey is currently owned by former ShapeShift team members</a> and contributes to the ShapeShift DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). You can also connect your KeepKey directly to the ShapeShift app.</p>
<p>KeepKey crypto wallets make setup easy, although the app itself is packed with features, including dApp integration. This lets you explore the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) from a trusted starting point.</p>
<p>Like Trezor devices, covered earlier, KeepKey uses open-source firmware. This brings the advantage of numbers. More people can view the code, making it possible to catch possible security concerns.</p>

<h3>10. SecuX W20: Cross-Platform Crypto Wallet With Support for Bluetooth</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/secux/en">SecuX</a> offers a variety of hardware wallets, including an upcoming credit-card-style wallet called the Shield BIO. The W20, a larger touchscreen wallet with Bluetooth support, stands out for its features and price point. Many hardware wallets are made for desktop use. Others focus on mobile use. The W20 handles either well, supporting iOS and Android via Bluetooth and computers via USB or Bluetooth.</p>

<h2>What is a Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A crypto hardware wallet, also called a cold wallet, is a device that generates and stores the private keys for a crypto wallet offline. Some hardware wallets resemble a USB thumb drive, while others might be a touch screen device similar to a cell phone. A third type of wallet looks like a bank card and even contains an NFC chip that allows the wallet to communicate with a mobile app on an NFC-enabled smartphone.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>How Crypto Wallets Work</h4>
<p>A crypto wallet is a convenient way to describe what’s going on under the hood. We think of a wallet as a place to store money. That’s almost accurate. Instead, a wallet secures the assets held at an address, a digital location on the blockchain that can hold crypto assets. With the right key, anyone can control the assets at that address. That’s where a crypto wallet comes into the picture. The wallet holds the private keys that can control the crypto at that address or sign transactions related to that address.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin private key:</strong> L28FTDMPFVNrykyaWXDjRRH5u8eaTACKq63ApsZ6XWZB3g2m8AFE</li>
</ul>
<p>The private key above was generated using an online app. Hence, this Bitcoin wallet should be considered insecure. Does the online app store all the keys it generates? Are the browser and its extensions secure? Is the computer itself compromised?</p>
<p>If someone else has the same keys, you can both control the assets, a situation that could lead to the irrevocable loss of your crypto assets.</p>
<p>When you use an exchange to hold your crypto, the exchange controls the keys. Many exchanges provide you with a public address so you can send crypto to your account. However, you don’t have access to the private keys at all. You just have the exchange login credentials in most cases. The collapse of the FTX exchange is just one recent example of the risks involved with trusting someone else with your keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll discuss the importance of protecting private keys in more detail shortly, but a hardware wallet creates an additional layer of security by authorizing transactions on a device that you physically control. This reduces the risk of loss due to compromised private keys — or the seed phrase used to generate those keys. More on that in a bit.</p>
<h2>How do Hardware Wallets Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hardware wallets can be used to authorize crypto transactions by approving or declining the transaction from an offline device. The process works similarly to two-factor authentication (2FA), in which you use a device you control to authenticate a login to a bank account, for example.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you’re using MetaMask as your Ethereum wallet. MetaMask generates a seed phrase, a people-friendly way of encoding the private keys. Typically, seed phrases are 12-24 words long. MetaMask, however, is a hot wallet. The private keys are generated on an online device and stored on that same device used for online activities.</p>
<p>The keys from hot wallets can become compromised in a number of ways, ranging from software exploits to keyloggers that record your keystrokes. The wallet addresses generated by MetaMask are less secure compared to hardware wallet addresses because the private keys can be more easily compromised with hot wallets.</p>
<p>But MetaMask also supports popular hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. You can generate private keys offline using your hardware wallet and then import the public addresses from your hardware wallet to MetaMask. This lets you use MetaMask to see your assets and connect to decentralized applications (dApps) like Uniswap.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" class="aligncenter wp-image-121294" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-1024x531.png" alt="metamask connect to hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>However, if you need to authorize a transaction for the hard wallet addresses, you’ll need to connect your hardware wallet to accept or decline. MetaMask asks the device for authorization but never has access to the private keys in your hardware wallet.</p>
<p>If there is no input from the hardware wallet, the transaction can’t be authorized, and your crypto remains in your wallet.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of security, much like when your bank sends you an email or text to be sure it’s really you logging into your account.</p>
<h3>Wired or Wireless Connections</h3>
<p>Many hardware wallets use a USB connection to connect to your computer and accept or decline transactions. Newer models may use Bluetooth, which allows support for mobile use, or even an NFC chip that can connect to an NFC-enabled mobile device.</p>
<p>Regardless of which connection type a hardware wallet uses, there’s still an additional layer that requires input from a separate device you physically hold.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Hardware Crypto Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The advantages of hardware wallets compared to software wallets or exchange wallets center on security. You may have to sacrifice some convenience, but the goal is to protect your crypto. By keeping some or all of your crypto in a hardware wallet, you greatly reduce the risk of losses.</p>
<p>Hot wallets like MetaMask, Electrum, or Trust Wallet make crypto transactions more convenient. However, all hot wallets bring similar risks because the private keys are generated and stored on a device connected to the internet. Someone on the other side of the world can drain the wallet if they gain access to private keys (or the seed phrase).</p>
<p>By contrast, a hardware wallet forces the transaction to be approved or declined on a device you hold.</p>
<p>Hardware crypto wallets also allow you to split your stack for safety. Similar to traveling with pocket money while the rest of your money is safe in the bank, you can keep some crypto available in a convenient hot wallet while using your hardware wallet to safeguard the bulk of your holdings.</p>
<h3>Using a Hardware Wallet to Move Your Crypto Off Exchanges</h3>
<p>You don’t need to be active in the crypto ecosystem to benefit from a hardware wallet. One of the most common reasons to choose a hardware wallet is for the secure storage of cryptocurrencies you&#8217;re holding as an investment.</p>
<p>As a beginning investor, you might choose to keep your crypto on the exchange where you trade. Exchange wallets are called custodial wallets because the exchange has custody of your crypto. It’s convenient. And when your balances on the exchange are lower, your financial exposure is also lower.</p>
<p>As your balances grow, however, you’re at risk of losing much more. Using a self-custody crypto hardware wallet can protect you against exchange-related risks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your exchange login can be compromised.</strong> About a third of us use password managers that offer a way to create unique passwords for each website. Others may be re-using passwords or using insecure passwords. However, even a password manager can create risk, as the app itself or an online vault can be a target for exploits. LastPass, a popular password manager, has suffered <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/">more than one breach</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The exchange might freeze withdrawals.</strong> The collapse of crypto platforms like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bankrupt-crypto-lender-voyager-digital-predicts-35-customer-payout-2023-05-17/">Voyager</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/crypto-lender-celsius-sends-bankruptcy-plan-creditor-vote-2023-08-14/">Celsius</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/business/ftx-bankruptcy.html">FTX</a> — all of which declared bankruptcy — are examples of why it may be wiser to move your crypto off exchanges. Once you move some or all of your crypto to a hardware wallet, any insolvency issues pose less risk to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to keep a certain amount of crypto on the exchange for trading purposes, consider moving the rest to a hardware crypto wallet for safekeeping.</p>
<h2>Hardware Wallets vs Software Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Moving your crypto to a wallet you control is often the best move, but is a software wallet just as good a choice? Probably not.</p>
<p>A software wallet like MetaMask (Ethereum) or Electrum (Bitcoin) generates and stores the private keys on an internet-connected device. The private keys used to authorize transactions are on your device at all times. If multinational companies like Microsoft and Oracle have <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-215a">security vulnerabilities</a> in their applications, hot wallets developed by smaller teams may be at risk as well.</p>
<p>Conversely, hardware wallets store your private keys on a separate device not connected to the internet. Even when temporarily connected to a computer or mobile device, the hardware wallet’s firmware limits interaction with your wallet to accepting or declining a transaction by clicking a button or taking a similar action on the device in your possession.</p>
<p>Both types of wallets share some similar risks, however. Specifically, safeguarding the wallet’s seed phrase or private key is tantamount, but sometimes, they get out into the wild.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="478" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-121297" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase.png" alt="metamask recovery phrase" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase.png 478w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase-221x300.png 221w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone else has this seed phrase, also called a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase, they can create a duplicate of your wallet (and its keys) and send your crypto to another wallet you can’t access. Any compatible software wallet can be used to access a crypto wallet created by a hardware device if someone has the seed phase.</p>
<p>The seed phrase and private key look different, but either can be used to make a carbon copy of your wallet. They’re really just two ways of expressing the same value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="434" height="592" class="aligncenter wp-image-121298" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key.png" alt="metamask private key" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key.png 434w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key-220x300.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /></p>
<p>This concern applies to both hot and cold wallets because they both use seed phrases and private keys. Choose a secure way to store your seed phrase so you can recreate your wallet if needed while preventing someone else from making a copy of your wallet elsewhere.</p>
<p>Generally, avoid storing your seed phrase in cloud storage or leaving it somewhere where others can find it.</p>
<h2>How to Choose a Hardware Cryptocurrency Wallet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Which cryptocurrency hardware wallet is right for your needs depends on your risk profile and how you think you’ll use your wallet. Cost, transparency, security features, and even mobile support can all play a role in your purchase decision.</p>
<h3>Security Features</h3>
<p>Consider how you’ll use the wallet and which security features are most important to you.</p>
<p>Often, there’s a trade-off between security and convenience. The most secure wallets are air-gapped, meaning they can’t connect to the internet in any way. Instead, they typically use QR codes. You scan the QR code in an app or on the device itself and then approve or deny the transaction on the device. This may require more steps to complete transactions compared to a device that connects via Bluetooth or USB.</p>
<p>Also, consider security features like a Secure Element chip. But weigh the benefits against the trade-offs for this as well. For example, Ledger states it <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/11132311094813-Ledger-s-open-source-roadmap">can’t fully open-source its firmware due to the Secure Element chip</a>. Trezor, by contrast, does not use a Secure Element chip on the Model T or Model One and provides full transparency with open-source firmware for these devices.</p>
<h3>Supported Coins and Blockchains</h3>
<p>Many popular wallets support multiple blockchains. However, some wallets only support one blockchain, most commonly seen with Bitcoin-only wallets. Choose the best crypto hardware wallet for your overall needs while weighing which assets you think you’ll need to store. For example, if you’re considering a Trezor but need to store XRP, you’ll need to jump up to a Model T. Trezor’s Model One doesn’t support XRP.</p>
<p>Most multi-chain wallets support the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks at a minimum. Ethereum Layer 2 support may be limited, however. You may not see assets you hold on the Abitrum Layer 2 blockchain, for example, even though they are in your wallet. If needed, you can use a portfolio app like Debank or a blockchain explorer like <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> (for Ethereum) or <a href="https://arbiscan.io/">Arbiscan</a> (for Arbitrum) to verify transactions or tokens that don’t show in your hardware or software wallet.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>Software wallets are typically free to use. By comparison, you can expect to pay $50 to well over $200 for a hardware wallet, depending on which model you choose.</p>
<p>Cost is a consideration, but paying a lot doesn’t always translate to more secure storage. Plenty of people store large amounts of crypto on inexpensive yet reliable and well-supported devices like the Trezor Model One.</p>
<p>Also, it might not make sense to spend hundreds of dollars to protect a smaller amount of crypto. If you choose a less expensive device to start, you can always upgrade when you have more to protect.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>The top hardware wallets generally don’t charge an additional fee to use the wallet after you’ve purchased it. However, many wallets enable crypto swaps or purchases from within the wallet’s software app. In this case, you may encounter fees or other costs.</p>
<p>There are several ways to trade crypto, ranging from centralized crypto exchanges to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">decentralized exchanges</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm">peer-to-peer exchanges</a>. Ledger Live, for example, offers ways to buy crypto from within Ledger’s wallet software suite. Transaction fees vary depending on the provider you choose within the app.</p>
<p>In most cases, buying on an exchange will be less expensive compared to using your wallet’s app. But you may prefer to buy through your wallet app. If so, compare buying fees before choosing the best crypto hardware wallet for your use case.</p>
<h3>Mobile Experience</h3>
<p>Not too long ago, mobile and hardware wallets didn’t belong in the same sentence. Most cold wallets worked via a USB cable plugged into a computer. However, with Bluetooth connectivity available on some hardware wallets or even NFC support, as seen with the Tangem, crypto hardware wallets can go wherever you go.</p>
<p>Some models, like Ledger wallets, can connect to Android phones via an optional OTG cable that uses the USB-C port on your phone.</p>
<p>If you think you might need to use your hardware wallet on the go, consider models that work with a cell phone or tablet. Check the App Store or Play Store reviews for the mobile app that accompanies the wallet you’re considering. Ledger Live scores well here with a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ledger.live&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">4.8 out of 5-star rating</a> on Google Play Store.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may also be able to use the mobile wallet app as an on-the-go portfolio to track your investments.</p>
<h3>Open-Source or Closed-Source Software and Firmware</h3>
<p>Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was open-source, meaning the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">Bitcoin Core code was and is available online</a>. The alternative would be closed source, in which we don’t know what the software really does, what security flaws it may have, or if it phones home with sensitive transaction details. Many in the crypto community insist on open-source software for crypto wallets.</p>
<p>Crypto hardware wallets use two sets of code:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wallet firmware:</strong> You can think of firmware as software that lives on the hardware wallet device itself. Trezor, for example, makes the <a href="https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware">Trezor firmware available to view</a>. If so inclined, you could even modify the firmware and run a customized device. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/11132311094813-Ledger-s-open-source-roadmap">Ledger is taking steps to open-source its firmware</a> following a crypto-community kerfuffle over <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/24/ledgers-pr-struggle-reveals-uncomfortable-trade-offs-for-crypto-storage/">Ledger’s planned private key backup service</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Wallet software:</strong> The software suite is an important tool to interact with the wallet device, particularly during device setup and updates. The wallet software talks to the wallet’s firmware but often also brings other features, like charting, swaps, or the ability to connect with other apps. Both <a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live">Ledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite">Trezor</a> open-source their software suites.</li>
</ul>
<p>The big advantage of open-source software and firmware is transparency, but security can also benefit from open-source code. An army of coders around the world poring over the code may be more likely to identify a potential issue than a smaller development team.</p>
<p>Lastly, open-source code for firmware gives the community a way to keep older devices active even after the manufacturer ends support. If Trezor ends firmware support for the tried-and-true Model One at some point in the future, the community can fork the code and make updates as needed.</p>
<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
<p>Top hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor balance security with ease of use. Both wallets offer beginner-friendly software suites that make maintenance like firmware updates a breeze. By comparison, Ellipal requires you to update the device using an SD card (not included).</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>The Ledger Nano series of crypto wallets were tough to break. The same is true of the Trezor Model One. Newer devices with large touch screens, like the Ellipal Titan or Ledger Stax, are akin to a small smartphone and may not survive accidental drops on a tile floor well. Consider your use case and where you’ll use your device before making a choice.</p>
<h3>Your Risk Profile</h3>
<p>The best crypto hardware wallets can help protect any amount of crypto, large or small, but for smaller amounts of crypto, it may be more prudent to let your balance grow before buying the latest crypto wallet gizmo. For some, a hardware wallet is a must-have piece of gear. Others may be well-served with a software wallet as a starting point.</p>
<h2>Limitations of Hardware Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Using a hardware wallet is an important security measure, but it creates some extra steps, and there are still some risks. Using software wallets alone is much easier, and you aren’t tied to a physical device that’s probably safely stored at home. However, software wallets are also less secure.</p>
<p>Pairing a software wallet with a hardware wallet makes sense in many situations.</p>
<p>You’ll have to weigh some considerations before making a choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Form factor: Roughly the size of a thumb drive, Ledger Nano wallets are easily pocketable. Credit-card-sized Tangem wallets might be even easier to carry around. But devices like Ellipal or Ledger Stax might have a touchscreen as large as 4 inches, making them portable – but not always convenient to carry.</li>
<li>Wear and breakage: The internal batteries in hard wallet devices can fail, just like those in your phone or tablet. These batteries may not be replaceable. Simpler devices like the Trezor Model One don’t use a battery, instead powering on when connected via USB. But that’s also a consideration. The connector (micro USB in the case of the Model One) could fail. Or, the buttons might stop working. The screen could break. In short, there’s a useful lifetime for hardware wallets, after which you’ll likely have to replace the device. Software wallets don’t suffer the same issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the best crypto hardware wallets won’t make you 100% secure. You’ll still need to take steps on your own to secure the seed phrase. It’s also wise to conceal the hardware wallet itself. You may not want visitors or the occasional home repair worker to see your Bitcoin hardware wallet lying around.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The field of options continues to grow, making choosing the best crypto hardware wallets a bit more challenging. For most crypto investors and traders, well-established brands may still make the best choices. Wallet makers like Ledger and Trezor led the market and still make some of the most compelling products. We were particularly impressed with the Ledger Nano X due to its sturdy construction, convenient size, security features, and wireless connectivity option. As a lower-cost alternative, the Ledger Nano S Plus offers many of the same features, less Bluetooth support. Ledger offers a well-built and well-priced solution for most common uses.</p>
