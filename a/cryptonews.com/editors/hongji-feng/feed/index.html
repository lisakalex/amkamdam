<p>Merit Circle DAO and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-1-celestia-immutable-blur.htm">Immutable</a> have <a href="https://www.immutable.com/blog/merit-circle-dao-chooses-immutable-to-unlock-beams-future-gaming-and-trading-experience">announced</a> a strategic partnership to develop the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/parliament-of-india-holds-discussion-on-future-of-web3.htm">web3</a> gaming ecosystem, emphasizing blockchain technology and digital asset ownership.</p>
<p>The collaboration involves launching Merit Circle&#8217;s gaming subnet, Beam, on Immutable&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/games-backed-by-disney-alibaba-google-square-enix-will-build-on-immutable-zkevm-blockchain-gaming-to-become-synonymous-with-gaming.htm">zkEVM</a>, a scaling solution powered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-pos-now-supported-by-amazon-managed-blockchain-access.htm">Polygon</a>. This move expands Beam&#8217;s reach beyond its previous exclusivity to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/french-court-acquits-hackers-accused-of-targeting-avalanche-stablecoin-project-platypus.htm">Avalanche</a> network. The partnership is expected to drive innovation and growth in web3 gaming, offering enhanced experiences for developers and players alike.</p>
<p>&#8220;This strategic alliance with Merit Circle DAO and commitment from Beam aligns perfectly with our mission to bring digital ownership to every gamer in the world,‚Äù said James Ferguson, Co-founder and CEO of Immutable. ‚ÄúImmutable&#8217;s robust ecosystem and cutting-edge technology combined with Merit Circle&#8217;s web3 gaming expertise allows us to enrich the gaming experience for millions of players worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Merit Circle DAO&#8217;s Partnership with Immutable</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Merit Circle DAO&#8217;s Beam network, an integral part of this partnership, stands as an open-source, multi-chain gaming environment. The integration with Immutable&#8217;s zkEVM positions Beam at the forefront of technological innovation in the gaming sector.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;At the Merit Circle DAO, we want Beam ‚Äì our gaming ecosystem ‚Äì to be wherever games, players and developers are. This collaboration with Immutable and Polygon Labs represents a huge leap towards that vision,&#8221; said Marco van den Heuvel, CGO and co-founder of Merit Circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our user-friendly applications, combined with Immutable&#8217;s zkEVM, powered by Polygon, are going to be a key piece of the gaming jigsaw in the very near future. We simply can&#8217;t wait to explore what&#8217;s next,&#8221; said van den Heuvel.</p>
<h2>Immutable Officially Launches zkEVM Testnet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the <a href="https://www.immutable.com/blog/the-gold-standard-of-gaming-on-ethereum-immutable-zkevm-testnet-is-finally-here">latest announcement</a>, Immutable has just officially launched Immutable zkEVM Testnet. Offering Ethereum compatibility, the testnet&#8217;s key features include seamless migration of existing smart contracts and enhanced security, alongside low costs and high scalability.</p>

<p>Some game studios and marketplace partners of Immutable have begun transitioning to Immutable zkEVM, with games including MetalCore, Shardbound, and Infinite Victory, and ecosystem partners like AQUA Marketplace and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/court-rejects-class-certification-request-against-robinhood-in-gamestop-meme-case.htm">GameStop</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the company will continue to support Immutable X, the previously available service of ‚Äúzero gas fees, instant transactions, and streamlined gameplay mechanics.‚Äù</p>

<p>Changpeng Zhao, former CEO of Binance known as CZ, had his guilty plea accepted by a U.S. judge in a case involving anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://ecf.wawd.uscourts.gov/doc1/197110983819">court filing</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, Judge Richard Jones officially accepted Zhao&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">guilty plea</a>. This decision comes weeks after Zhao and Binance acknowledged their regulatory lapses in anti-money laundering practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Court, having considered the Report and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge, to which there has been no timely objection &#8230; hereby accepts the plea of guilty of the defendant &#8230; the defendant is adjudged guilty of such offense,&#8221; said Judge Richard.</p>
<h2>CZ&#8217;s Sentencing Date and Bond Terms</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The acceptance by the court signifies a major development in the legal proceedings, with Zhao&#8217;s sentencing now scheduled for February 2024. The closure of this case is expected to set a precedent in the enforcement of financial regulations within the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<p>Zhao&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">guilty plea</a> last month was part of a comprehensive <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">settlement</a> addressing his and Binance&#8217;s roles in anti-money laundering and sanctions violations. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Zhao has committed to a personal fine of $50 million and relinquished his role as CEO of Binance.</p>
<p>Currently released on bond, CZ faces his sentencing on February 23, 2024. Under the terms of his release, Zhao would typically be permitted to travel back to the UAE, but he is required to return to the U.S. two weeks before his sentencing date. However, Judge Jones recently ordered Zhao to remain in the United States for now, pending a final decision on these terms.</p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Fine and Management Changes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In parallel, Binance has agreed to a corporate settlement of $4.3 billion, one of the largest in the history of corporate penalties. This plea marked a significant development in a series of federal investigations targeting compliance practices within the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-6-helium-celestia-avalanche.htm">cryptocurrency</a> exchange.</p>
<p>Following Zhao&#8217;s guilty plea and subsequent resignation, Binance has undergone notable changes in its management structure. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-crypto-exchange-appoints-richard-teng-lead-all-regional-markets-outside-us.htm">Richard Teng</a>, formerly a director at Binance, has stepped into the role of CEO.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/richard-teng-claims-binance-has-changed-following-record-breaking-compliance-settlement.htm">recent interview</a>, Teng emphasized the transformative changes the exchange has experienced. &#8220;Binance is now &#8216;totally different&#8217; from its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-sued-binance-cz-monday-whats-complaint.htm">early days</a>,&#8221; said Teng. &#8220;I‚Äôm taking the baton and pushing ahead with our growth agenda while working very closely with global regulators.‚Äù</p>

<p>IBM has <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/new-cold-storage-digital-assets/">announced</a> the release of the latest technology designed to enhance the security of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-cold-wallets.htm">cold storage</a> for digital assets, aiming to revolutionize the way <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-5-stacks-conflux-kucoin.htm">cryptos</a> are managed and protected.</p>
<p>The IBM <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/IBM+Hyper+Protect+Offline+Signing+Orchestrator+demonstration/1_h07r665u">Hyper Protect Offline Signing Orchestrator</a> (OSO) is specifically developed to overcome the challenges associated with traditional methods of cold storage for digital assets. By integrating advanced security features such as disconnected network operations, time-based security, and electronic approval by multiple stakeholders, OSO represents a significant leap in protecting high-value transactions.</p>
<p>In the announcement blog, IBM wrote, &#8220;OSO is designed to address limitations of current cold storage offerings for digital assets, including the need for people to perform manual procedures for the execution of a cold storage transaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further elaborating on the functionality, the blog explained, &#8220;Hyper Protect OSO provides a policy engine that brokers communication between two different applications that have been designed not to communicate directly with each other for security purposes.&#8221;</p>
<h2>IBM Partners with Metaco for Improved Crypto Storage</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This new approach has also been reflected in IBM‚Äôs practical application for customer needs. &#8220;IBM has worked with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hsbc-announces-plans-to-launch-digital-asset-custody-service-in-partnership-with-metaco.htm">Metaco</a>, an IBM Business Partner and digital asset custody provider, and tier 1 banks, to help ensure OSO addresses client requirements,&#8221; said the blog.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a provider of institutional grade custody infrastructure that is trusted by some of the largest global custodians and banks, it is our responsibility to deliver cutting-edge digital asset security to our clients,‚Äù said Adrien Treccani, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Metaco.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIBM‚Äôs confidential computing division has been a reliable partner throughout the years, and we are pleased to complement Metaco‚Äôs catalog of institutional cold storage solutions with the unique air-gapped cold storage that OSO enables, especially as cold storage requirements are increasingly being stipulated by regulators in markets such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-central-bank-chief-sees-no-future-for-private-crypto.htm">Singapore</a>, Hong Kong and Japan,‚Äù said Treccani.</p>
<h2><strong>Market Growth and Regulatory Pressures Drive Need for Improved Solutions</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As the financial ecosystem continues to mature, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is emerging as a significant business opportunity. This progression accentuates the need for more sophisticated cold storage solutions. Traditional methods, challenged by limitations such as scalability, insider threats, and operational errors, are becoming increasingly inadequate.</p>
<p>With digital assets becoming mainstream, country-specific security regulations are intensifying, especially in markets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-chief-executive-expresses-willingness-to-cooperate-on-granting-more-powers-to-regulate-crypto-exchanges-report.htm">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/japanese-tax-agency-investigates-hundreds-of-crypto-tax-violations.htm">Japan</a>. These various regulations mandate digital asset custody providers to store a portion of customer assets in cold storage, heightening the demand for secure and compliant cold storage solutions in the financial industry.</p>

<p>The U.S. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-pushes-for-judge-to-classify-crypto-as-securities-in-terraform-labs-case-bypassing-jury.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has postponed its decision on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-positions-itself-for-bitcoin-etf-race-with-hire-of-former-invesco-head-john-hoffman.htm">Grayscale</a>&#8216;s application for its spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-ethereum-etf-plans-spur-on-bitcoin-etf-token-investors-to-take-last-chance-to-buy-at-low-0-005-price.htm">Ethereum exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF), extending the review period with a new deadline set for January 2024.</p>
<p>According to the SEC‚Äôs <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2023/34-99082.pdf">latest filing</a>, the commission has now designated Jan. 25, 2024, as the new deadline to replace the previous due date of Dec. 11, 2023. The filing stated that this postponement is to allow a longer period for comprehensive consideration of the proposed rule change and the issues it entails.</p>
<h2>SEC Postpones Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum ETF Decision</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In their explanation, the SEC wrote, &#8220;The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.&#8221;</p>
<p>By Jan. 25, the SEC ‚Äúthe Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove‚Äù Grayscale‚Äôs proposed spot Ethereum ETF application.</p>
<p>The ongoing scrutiny by the SEC over <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-5-stacks-conflux-kucoin.htm">crypto</a>-based ETFs, including both Ethereum and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-price-to-hit-50k-soon-as-traders-rush-to-buy-up-bitcoin-etf-btcetf-token-after-successful-2-5-million-raise.htm">Bitcoin</a>, underscores the cautious stance of the regulatory body towards integrating these digital assets into mainstream financial products. This extended deadline for Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum ETF is a continuation of the SEC&#8217;s pattern of diligently assessing the viability and impact of such investment choices in the U.S. market.</p>
<h2>Meetings and More Delayed Decisions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The SEC has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">holding meetings</a> with major financial institutions that have filed for their crypto ETFs, including Grayscale and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">BlackRock</a>. A memorandum published by the SEC indicated that officials from the agency‚Äôs Division of Trading and Markets met with Grayscale Investments on Nov. 29 to consider the proposed conversion of Grayscale‚Äôs listed Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Previously, the SEC has delayed its decisions on numerous ETF filings, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-xs-bitcoin-etf-decision-delayed-by-sec-new-deadline-set-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Global X</a>‚Äôs, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Franklin Templeton</a>‚Äôs, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-grayscale-ether-etf.htm">Hashdex</a>‚Äôs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update: As expected <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Grayscale</a>&#39;s Ethereum trust filing just got delayed. It was due by 12/6/23 so this is completely normal. <a href="https://t.co/I6LXMZIGGN">pic.twitter.com/I6LXMZIGGN</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Commission has not yet approved any spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF applications for listing on a U.S. exchange. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the postponement is ‚Äúcompletely normal.‚Äù Seyffart believed that once the authority decides to finally approve a crypto ETF, multiple applications can be approved simultaneously.</p>

<p>Robinhood has reported a substantial 75% increase in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-4-ordi-pepe-bitcoin-cash.htm">cryptocurrency</a> trading volume for November compared to October, highlighted in a recent filing with the U.S. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC).</p>
<p>In their detailed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000178387923000277/hood-20231204.htm">8-K update</a> to the SEC, Robinhood&#8217;s significant uptick in crypto trading in November was noted to mark a notable shift in the platform&#8217;s recent performance. This increase in trading activity comes after a period of comparatively lower engagement, suggesting a renewed interest in cryptocurrency trading among Robinhood&#8217;s user base.</p>
<h2>Crypto Trading Volume Recovered</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The file provided by Robinhood to the SEC explicitly stated, ‚ÄúNovember Crypto Notional Trading Volumes were roughly 75% above October 2023 levels.‚Äù The ‚ÄúNotional Trading Volume‚Äù was defined as ‚Äúthe aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time,‚Äù November in this case.</p>
<p>Prior to this notable surge, Robinhood&#8217;s cryptocurrency trading had been witnessing a decline. The exchange had reported a significant decrease in transaction-based revenues from cryptocurrencies, with a 55% drop to $23 million in the <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_news/Robinhood-Reports-Third-Quarter-2023-Results-2023.pdf">third quarter of 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This downturn was a continuation of the trend observed in the second quarter, indicating a period of reduced trading activity and revenue from digital assets on the platform. The recent upturn in November&#8217;s trading volumes may represent a key reversal in this trend, signaling a resurgence of interest in cryptocurrency trading among Robinhood users.</p>
<h2>Robinhood to Launch in EU and UK</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Though the company‚Äôs crypto revenue had a 26% slide from the previous quarter, it still persists to expand. Vlad Tenev, CEO and co-founder of Robinhood, announced that the exchange will <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/robinhood-to-launch-crypto-trading-services-in-eu-in-the-coming-weeks.htm">expand to the European Union</a> in the near future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLooking ahead, we remain focused on providing industry-leading products that serve far more of customers‚Äô financial needs, gaining market share, expanding internationally, and continuing to change the industry for the better,‚Äù said Tenev.</p>
<p>In addition to the EU, Robinhood also plans to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/robinhood-to-launch-in-u-k-in-early-2024.htm">launch in the U.K.</a> in early 2024, targeting the British market along with the continent.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe intention is, for the U.K. market, Robinhood to be the best place to invest in U.S. stocks and U.S. dollars, and we believe we can fulfill that need better than anyone else,‚Äù said Tenev in an interview. The company has plans to launch commission-free share trading of U.S. stocks as well as a 5% ADR on invested cash and its 24-hour trading feature in the U.K.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs particularly useful for consumers here because there‚Äôs just less overlap between waking hours and U.S. East Coast hours,‚Äù said Tenev. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôll just make it a lot more usable and a lot more welcoming for customers to invest here.‚Äù</p>

<p>BlackRock and Bitwise have recently updated their filings for spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-breaches-40000-level-for-the-first-time-in-18-months.htm">Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These frequent amendments may signal pivotal progress.</p>
<p>In its most recent updated submission, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">BlackRock</a>, the asset management giant, filed an amended S-1 filing with the SEC for its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF. This move reflects BlackRock&#8217;s ongoing commitment to launching a Bitcoin ETF, a monumental product that has seen heightened interest from investors and the broader financial community.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitwise-has-no-connection-with-now-defunct-bitwise-industries.htm">Bitwise</a>, another major player in the digital asset management space, has also filed an amended application for its Bitcoin ETF just before BlackRock did. This update aligns with Bitwise&#8217;s strategic efforts to introduce a bitcoin ETF to the market, catering to the growing demand among investors for listed crypto investment options.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETF Filings: ‚ÄúThey&#8217;re Just Pouring In‚Äù</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
‚ÄúThey&#8217;re just pouring in,‚Äù said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1731804911350804573">James Seyffart</a>. ‚ÄúWhat does this mean? Without having read them &#8212; it just means that the wheel is still turning.‚Äù</p>
<p>Leading financial establishments like BlackRock and Grayscale have been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">meeting with the SEC</a> regarding their Bitcoin ETF filings. On Nov.28, the SEC officials met with BlackRock and the Nasdaq, as indicated by a memorandum. According to the memo‚Äôs note, BlackRock revised its In-Kind model design to address to the SEC‚Äôs concerns and ‚Äúunresolved‚Äù questions regarding the model.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth the SEC and these issuers are working hard to iron things out,‚Äù said Seyffart. ‚ÄúThese filings are likely the result of many conversations and a lot of man hours on/between both sides.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Hit $42,000</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin is currently trading at around $41,870, marking a 13% up from a week ago, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>. Bitcoin price broke the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-breaks-through-42000-up-6-6-in-24-hours.htm">$42,000 benchmark</a> on Dec. 4 and was up 6.6% within 24 hours. The surge represented a recovery to levels last achieved before the Terra crash back in May 2022. Bitcoin reached an all-time high price of $67,566.83 in Nov 2021, based on the data of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp">Statista</a>.</p>

<p>A critical Supreme Court case and its ruling could redefine the taxation of digital assets. Intersecting with the vexed IRS broker rule announced earlier, this case may potentially reshape crypto tax reporting and compliance on a fundamental level.</p>
<p>The case in question, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22-800.html">Moore v. U.S.</a>, revolves around a dispute concerning the tax treatment of certain investments. Charles and Kathleen Moore, the plaintiffs, are challenging a tax imposed on their investment in an India-based company. They argue that they had not realized income from this investment when the law was enacted, meaning they had not cashed in their profits or brought these profits back to the U.S. to make them subject to taxation under the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-16/">16th Amendment</a>. Ratified in 1913, the 16th Amendment grants Congress the power to levy income taxes without apportioning them among the states based on population.</p>
<h2>Defining &#8216;Income&#8217; in the Digital Age</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The argument focuses on the definition of ‚Äúincome‚Äù and ‚Äúrealized income‚Äù, questioning whether unrealized gains should be subject to tax. While this case primarily concerns overseas investments, its outcome could spark a broader debate about the taxation of various investment types, potentially influencing the tax code‚Äôs treatment of emerging asset classes, including digital assets like cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear the case on Dec. 5, and the outcome of Moore v. U.S. could carry significant consequences for cryptocurrency investors. If the Moores lose, it could enable the government to tax digital asset investments like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-soars-3-5-fed-cuts-stir-usd-zodia-joins-ripples-network.htm">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/get-ahead-of-the-ethereum-price-explosion-with-the-ethetf-token-before-blackrock-ethereum-etf-launches-price-pumps-400-in-early-action.htm">Ethereum</a>, or altcoins based on increased values, regardless of whether these gains have been cashed in or not. Conversely, a win for the Moores might establish that gains from such investments are not taxable until they are ‚Äúrealized‚Äù in a more traditional sense, such as being converted to cash.</p>
<p>The interpretation of ‚Äúrealization‚Äù in cryptocurrency, however, remains a contentious point. For example, some view the use of Bitcoin to purchase other altcoins as a realization of gains, essentially converting one investment form into another. This debate exemplifies the complexities and evolving landscape of tax regulations in the digital asset domain, highlighting the pressing need for clear, comprehensive guidelines.</p>
<h2>A Reddit User&#8217;s Crypto Tax Surprise</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Reddit user ‚ÄúFrosty_Huskers07‚Äù presents a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/189e3u6/owe_irs_over_50k_from_2021_looking_for_advice/">live example</a> of the complexities and challenges faced by cryptocurrency investors under the current tax laws. An early investor in Bitcoin and Ethereum, they faced unexpected tax implications during the 2021 crypto boom. ‚ÄúI was inexperienced and did not understand the concept every time I did this it created a taxable event,‚Äù they explained, referring to their trades from Bitcoin and Ethereum into various altcoins, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-solana-meme-coins.htm">Solana</a> (SOL), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-chainlink-going-to-zero-link-price-struggles-as-new-mining-protocol-bitcoin-minetrix-secures-4-6-million.htm">Chainlink</a> (LINK), and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/litecoin-price-prediction-as-ltc-gains-2-16-in-24-hours-can-this-uptrend-continue.htm">Litecoin</a> (LTC).</p>

<p>Believing that tax liabilities only arose when converting to USD, the user now finds themselves owing the IRS over $50k for 2021. Their portfolio, which had soared to around $330k, plummeted in value during the market crash, stabilizing at around $80k, diversified across several digital currencies. It remains unclear whether ‚ÄúFrosty_Huskers07‚Äù received this tax assessment directly from the IRS, derived it through their own calculations, or consulted with tax experts for this estimation.</p>
<h2>IRS&#8217;s Broker Rules and Crypto Oversight Future</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The IRS&#8217;s newly proposed digital asset broker reporting regulations, introduced in August 2023, have sparked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/irs-holds-hearing-on-digital-asset-reporting-regulations-following-pushback.htm">widespread debate</a> within the cryptocurrency sector. These regulations, which came under scrutiny during a public hearing following a deluge of nearly 125,000 comments, propose to expand the definition of &#8220;broker&#8221; for tax reporting purposes in a decentralized environment.</p>
<p>Coinbase, in a strongly worded <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-raises-concerns-over-proposed-irs-tax-regulations-crypto.htm">comment letter</a>, raised alarms about potential &#8220;unprecedented, unchecked, and unlimited tracking into the daily lives of American citizens.&#8221; This stance reflects a broader industry concern that the IRS&#8217;s approach, while aiming for transparency and fairness in treating cryptocurrencies like traditional assets, could lead to overcomplex and invasive regulations. As the implications of the Moore v. U.S. case collide with the IRS&#8217;s new broker regulations, the landscape of cryptocurrency reporting and taxation faces a potential overhaul.</p>

<p>Reddit has officially <a href="https://nova.arbiscan.io/tx/0x48fece81ba5ee6feef5b4d4caf8b832e6ba0cae7ea007fc3106d4aa82c2764db#eventlog">renounced the contract</a> of its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-30-iota-radix-theta-network.htm">cryptocurrency</a> Moons, setting a milestone completing the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm#:~:text=MDEX%20is%20not%20shy%20to,%241%20billion%20in%20market%20cap.">decentralization</a> of the token.</p>
<p>The Reddit administrators <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/187tg7a/moons_update_reddit_has_officially_renounced_the/">published a post</a> in the ‚Äúr/CryptoCurrency‚Äù community, confirming that the renouncement of the Moons contract has been finalized. This action not only caps the supply but also ensures that no further modifications can be made to the contract, thereby establishing Moons as a fully decentralized entity within the crypto community.</p>
<p>With Reddit‚Äôs remaining 98,000 MOON tokens <a href="https://nova.arbiscan.io/tx/0x48fece81ba5ee6feef5b4d4caf8b832e6ba0cae7ea007fc3106d4aa82c2764db">burnt</a>, the total supply has been lowered from around 125,969,899 to 83,205,951, according to Reddit‚Äôs estimation. Moons now are effectively deflationary.</p>
<h2>Reddit Announced to Renounce Contract in October</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In October, Reddit administrators <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/17un84c/update_regarding_moons_contract_community_tanks/?share_id=vKdg9CkrZJJeXT8w03avX&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">announced</a> their intention to renounce the contract, a process which has now been finalized. ‚ÄúThe contract will forever remain unchanged, rendering Moons completely decentralized,‚Äù highlighted the post from the ‚Äúr/CryptoCurrency‚Äù community. This move ensures that no further alterations can be made to the contract, solidifying its status as a fully decentralized digital asset.</p>
<p>With the renouncement now complete, Reddit has set a new precedent in the community-driven governance of blockchain projects. The post outlined, ‚ÄúNo new Moons can be created, and Moons can continue to be listed and traded by exchanges and wallets as before.‚Äù This maintains the token&#8217;s accessibility and liquidity in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>The forum‚Äôs sector remains the biggest crypto community, and advertisers still need to buy MOON for their space. Many users were celebrating the renouncement, cheering, ‚ÄúOver 40 million moons being burned and nobody owning the contract ever again is the best thing that could have happened.‚Äù</p>
<p>This decisive action by Reddit underscores a significant shift towards community empowerment in the digital currency space, reflecting a growing trend of decentralization and user-driven governance in blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the mod team will ‚Äúcontinue to work on bringing back and improving features such as memberships, governance and tipping‚Äù and explore ‚Äúrestarting distribution, though exactly how that will work remains to be seen.‚Äù</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently held meetings with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-evaporating-and-traders-back-new-bitcoin-etf-token-with-more-than-2m-as-sellout-looms-and-sec-approval-bets-mount.htm">Grayscale</a> and BlackRock to discuss their filed applications regarding spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">Bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs).</p>
<h2>SEC Meets with Grayscale to Discuss its Bitcoin ETF Filing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-305159-785022.pdf">memorandum</a> published by the SEC indicates that officials from the agency‚Äôs Division of Trading and Markets met with Grayscale Investments on Nov. 29 to consider the proposed conversion of Grayscale&#8217;s listed Bitcoin Trust into a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-hits-38000-amid-microstrategy-buy-sec-etf-buzz.htm">Bitcoin</a> ETF.</p>
<p>According to the memo, the discussion ‚Äúconcerned NYSE Arca, Inc.‚Äôs proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.‚Äù</p>
<p>The participants of the meeting included David Shillman, the Associate Director in the SEC&#8217;s Division of Trading and Markets, who oversees the U.S. equity, options and fixed income markets, and Michael Sonnenshein, the CEO at Grayscale Investments. Grayscale‚Äôs external representatives from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP also attended the meeting.</p>
<h2>BlackRock Revises its In-Kind Model Design</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On Nov.28, the SEC officials also met with BlackRock and the Nasdaq, as indicated by <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nasdaq-2023-016/srnasdaq2023016-303319-781202.pdf">another memo</a>. While the SEC‚Äôs side was led by Eric Juzenas, the Associate Director in the SEC&#8217;s Division of Trading and Markets, BlackRock‚Äôs Digital Assets Head Robert Mitchnick and Nasdaq‚Äôs Principal Associate General Counsel Jonathan Cayne participated in the discussion, specifically about <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-revises-bitcoin-etf-model-to-appease-sec-concerns.htm">revising BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF model</a>.</p>
<p>According to the published memo‚Äôs note, BlackRock revised its In-Kind model design to address to the SEC‚Äôs concerns and ‚Äúunresolved‚Äù questions regarding the model.</p>
<p>BlackRock‚Äôs proposed ‚ÄúIn-Kind‚Äù redemption model involves market makers adjusting ETF shares supply and directly redeeming them for Bitcoin. This aims to closely link the share price with Bitcoin‚Äôs value.</p>
<p>However, the SEC has concerns with this model, mainly because it requires U.S. broker-dealers to directly handle Bitcoin, posing potential risks to their investments. In response, the SEC suggested a ‚ÄúCash‚Äù model, which, though safer for broker-dealers, could make the fund‚Äôs operation more complex and involve more steps for BlackRock.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis [revised] model appears to address the Staff‚Äôs concern with In-kind, addressing the critical dimension on which the In-kind model would otherwise be not preferred to the Cash model,‚Äù said the note.</p>

<p>The list includes innovators like the co-founders of Injective Labs, the co-founder of Fractal, the co-founders of Toku, and leaders from financial establishments including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/apple-ends-partnership-with-goldman-sachs-as-tech-giant-expands-into-lending.htm">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-report-highlights-resurgence-in-defi-and-nft-sectors.htm">JPMorgan</a>. This representation of young crypto pioneers on Forbes&#8217; list demonstrates the vital role digital assets and blockchain technology are playing in shaping modern financial services and solutions.</p>
<h2>Young Visionaries Transforming Crypto &amp; Blockchain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Eric Chen and Albert Chon, cofounders of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/eric-chen-ceo-of-injective-labs-building-finance-specific-blockchains-current-state-of-defi-ep-263.htm">Injective Labs</a>, lead a blockchain platform that&#8217;s made significant strides in the decentralized finance space. Their Injective blockchain has processed over 300 million transactions, totaling nearly $13 billion, at an average cost below 1 cent. Supported by investors like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-in-philippines-binance-is-operating-without-a-license-heres-the-latest.htm">Binance</a> Labs and Mark Cuban, they raised $57 million. This January, they launched a $150 million fund, backed by crypto giants like Pantera Capital, to further propel decentralized finance.</p>
<p>Kenneth O‚ÄôFriel and Dominika Stobiecka co-founded Toku, specializing in helping crypto startups manage token-based employee compensation and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/this-supreme-court-case-and-irs-broker-rule-together-could-redefine-crypto-taxation.htm">tax regulations</a> across over 100 countries. Their clients include notable firms like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/derivatives-trading-protocol-dydx-chain-commences-rewards-distribution-after-greenlight-from-community.htm">dYdX</a> and Protocol Labs. In March, Toku raised $20 million in a round led by Blockchain Capital.</p>
<p>Sei Labs, co-founded by Jeff Feng and Jayendra Jog, focuses on enhancing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">crypto</a> trading on its specialized blockchain. Developed in response to the 2021 GameStop frenzy, Sei offers faster transaction times than Ethereum and has quickly grown since its August launch, backed by $35 million from investors. The platform already boasts an estimated 7 million active wallets.</p>
<h2>The 2023 List</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Forbes&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2023/finance">2023 list</a> also featured numerous crypto and blockchain leaders.</p>
<p>Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap Labs, transformed an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum</a>-based concept into one of the most popular crypto applications. After working as an analyst at Siemens, Adams contributed to the development of Uniswap exchange in 2018, pioneering the use of automated market makers for decentralized cryptocurrency trading. Uniswap has amassed millions of users and earlier this year achieved a significant milestone, surpassing $1 trillion in lifetime trading volume.</p>
<p>Starting as an equity research analyst at Credit Suisse, Ria Bhutoria later joined the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-market-dominance-hits-18-month-low.htm">stablecoin</a> issuer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-signs-mou-with-sbi-holdings-to-expand-usdc-in-japan.htm">Circle</a> to develop their research platform. By 26, she rose to the position of Director of Research at Fidelity Digital Assets, managing $4.5 trillion in assets. Committed to diversity in the crypto space, Bhutoria invests in female and nonbinary founders through the decentralized collective Komorebi, alongside her work at Castle Island.</p>
<h2>&#8217;30 Under 30&#8242; On Chain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This year‚Äôs ‚Äú30 Under 30‚Äù list was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/forbes-latest-under-30-list-data-will-be-listed-on-ethereum.htm">live</a> on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-l2-protocol-blast-faces-scrutiny-as-paradigm-raises-concerns-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Ethereum blockchain</a>, marking a new milestone as the publication marched onto web3.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forbes is at the forefront of marrying traditional media with cutting-edge technology. By launching the Under 30 list on the Ethereum blockchain, we&#8217;re not just recognizing the influential young leaders; we&#8217;re also demonstrating the vast, untapped potential of blockchain technology in the realm of data storage and security,&#8221; said Vadim Supitskiy, Forbes‚Äô Chief Digital and Information Officer.</p>

<p>Celo‚Äôs developer has proposed a <a href="https://forum.celo.org/t/framework-for-selecting-an-l2-stack/6992">comprehensive plan</a> to guide the selection of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-l2-protocol-blast-faces-scrutiny-as-paradigm-raises-concerns-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Layer-2</a> technology provider, with a plan to finalize their decision in January 2024.</p>
<p>cLabs, the primary developer behind Celo, published a ‚Äúframework for selecting an L2 stack‚Äù on their discussion forum, seeking feedback from the users. The framework outlines the criteria for selecting a Layer-2 technology provider, a key part of Celo&#8217;s plan to integrate with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-breaches-2000-resistance-time-to-buy.htm">Ethereum</a>&#8216;s network. cLabs&#8217; initiative aims for community involvement in the decision, with the final choice expected by mid-January.</p>
<h2>Key Features of Celo&#8217;s Proposed Layer-2 Framework</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The framework detailed some of its core criteria and values, including Ethereum compatibility and increased security for technical considerations, simple migration with minimal downtime for migration feasibility, and independence within Ethereum for governance alignment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe would love your input, suggestions and feedback, to make this framework more reflective of all the priorities and concerns of Celo stakeholders,‚Äù said the post. ‚ÄúRight now, ‚Äòwe‚Äô reflects cLabs‚Äô views, but we hope as this doc evolves we can incorporate the general consensus of the whole community.‚Äù</p>
<p>cLabs also aim to adjust to the users‚Äô suggestions if the team sees fit. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running a little behind our own stated timeline for figuring this out, but hope we can get general consensus on the framework by mid Dec. Once we feel we‚Äôve reached general consensus on this framework, cLabs will begin work on evaluating each L2 stack against this framework.‚Äù</p>
<p>On 13 Dec. 4pm (GMT), cLabs will hold an L2 discussion call regarding the framework. The announced framework was an extension from cLabs‚Äô <a href="https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109">original proposal</a> published in July. The L1 to L2 upgrade was initially brought out to ‚Äúfoster a financially inclusive community and build openly in the spirit of Web3, bringing real-world use cases to the Ethereum ecosystem.‚Äù In August, Celo <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/google-cloud-partners-with-celo-network-as-validator-facilitating-ethereum-layer-2-migration.htm">announced</a> that they are partnering with Google Cloud for the Ethereum L2 migration.</p>

<p>Zipmex has put forward a new proposal to repay creditors, initially offering 3.35 cents for each dollar of their claims as part of its restructuring efforts, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-29/ailing-crypto-firm-zipmex-makes-another-attempt-at-restructuring?leadSource=uverify%20wall#xj4y7vzkg">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>This initial payout is part of a broader plan to address the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-28-celestia-uniswap-toncoin.htm">crypto</a> exchange&#8217;s $97.1 million debt and is contingent on the future recovery of assets, according to ‚Äúpeople familiar with the matter.‚Äù The proposal could potentially increase the repayment to as much as 29.35 cents per dollar, depending on the success of these recovery efforts.</p>
<p>The sources also addressed that major creditors have expressed reservations about Zipmex&#8217;s latest plan. They are advocating for an independent review to closely examine the recent changes in the company&#8217;s assets and liabilities as reported in the October 4 court document. This scrutiny is seen as crucial for ensuring transparency and fairness in the restructuring process.</p>
<p>Zipmex&#8217;s Group Chief Executive Officer Marcus Lim commented on the situation, stating, &#8220;I am unable to comment on the on-going scheme of arrangement as this is confidential.&#8221; He acknowledged the presence of inaccuracies in the information obtained from the sources but chose not to elaborate on them.</p>
<h2>Zipmex Faces Regulatory Scrutiny Amid Restructuring</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The proposal comes in the wake of a challenging period for the crypto exchange, which has been grappling with the fallout from last year&#8217;s rout in crypto prices. Zipmex, operating across Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Singapore, is currently undergoing restructuring supervised by a court in Singapore.</p>
<p>A prior attempt to sell Zipmex to V Ventures, a subsidiary of Thoresen Thai Agencies, did not materialize. Additionally, last week, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-and-gulf-energy-to-launch-crypto-exchange-in-thailand.htm">Thailand</a>&#8216;s securities regulator instructed Zipmex to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/zipmex-thailand-suspends-crypto-trading-citing-compliance-with-the-countrys-sec-rules.htm">suspend its operations</a> in the country due to insufficient net capital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDear customers, Zipmex Limited would like to ensure the proper and compliant conduct of the company‚Äôs business operations in accordance with the criteria set by Thailand‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),‚Äù the exchange said following the suspension. ‚ÄúTherefore, it is necessary for the company to temporarily suspend digital asset trading and deposit of all types.‚Äù</p>

<p>The KyberSwap hacker has indicated plans to propose a deal, with a statement expected on November 30.</p>
<p>Following last week&#8217;s $47 million <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/4-common-cybersecurity-risks-to-your-crypto-wallet.htm">exploit</a> of KyberSwap, the hacker has <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5c27d8e9248608f36b028a945f3d6ff31244ab45eb89e1d1a631f608a36454a1">left a message</a> on the network reinstating the inclination to negotiate, with plans to release a detailed statement on a potential agreement tomorrow.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI said I was willing to negotiate. In return, I have received (mostly) threats, deadlines, and general unfriendliness from the executive team. That&#8217;s ok, I don&#8217;t mind,‚Äù said the hacker in an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum</a> transaction. ‚ÄúI have prepared a statement concerning our (potential) treaty. I plan to release it on Nov. 30 at Noon UTC, sharp.‚Äù</p>
<p>The hacker also left an on-chain message when they first <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-hacked-for-48-million-hackers-suggest-negotiations.htm">exploited</a> the decentralized <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-28-celestia-uniswap-toncoin.htm">crypto</a> exchange on Nov. 23, stating, ‚ÄúNegotiations will start in a few hours when I am fully rested. Thank you.‚Äù</p>
<h2>KyberSwap Recovered $4.67 Million</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Recently the company engaged with the operators of frontrunning bots that withdrew approximately $5.7 million from KyberSwap&#8217;s pools on Polygon and Avalanche amid the security breach. Following discussions, these operators consented to return 90% of the extracted user funds, resulting in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-retrieves-4-7-million-after-security-attack.htm">a recovery of $4.67 million</a> by KyberSwap.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The KyberSwap team has been in contact with the owners of the frontrun bots that extracted about $5.7M* worth of funds from KyberSwap pools on Polygon and Avalanche during the exploit.<br />We have negotiated with the owners of the frontrun bots to return 90% of the users‚Äô funds taken‚Ä¶</p>
<p>&mdash; Kyber Network (@KyberNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1728800315955437743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing this recovery of users‚Äô funds from the frontrun bots, we will continue to support law enforcement and cybersecurity on track down and recovery of users‚Äô funds from the perpetrator of the exploit attack,‚Äù KyberSwap said.</p>
<p>KyberSwap suggested its users to withdraw funds after the hack last week, while stating that its aggregator was ‚Äúnot impacted‚Äù and ‚Äúoperating fully as normal.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to Ambient Exchange founder Doug Colkitt, the hacker <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-exploited-in-46-million-attack-due-to-infinite-money-glitch.htm">targeted a specific aspect</a> of KyberSwap&#8217;s concentrated liquidity feature, tricking the contract into recognizing more liquidity than was actually present. This exploit essentially allowed for what amounted to an &#8220;infinite money glitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>HTX (formerly known as Huobi Global) <a href="https://www.htx.com.nr/support/en-us/detail/94955073779429">announced</a> that deposit services for major chains will be gradually resumed on their platform, beginning today, complemented by an airdrop event as a gesture of gratitude to its users.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, HTX has completed the necessary preparations for resuming deposit services. After thorough security checks, the exchange will start allowing deposits for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-now-september-1-maker-toncoin-tron.htm">TRON</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-many-bitcoins-are-there.htm">BTC</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">ETH</a> chains.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCurrently, a thorough review is underway through collaboration between the team and a third-party security company. To ensure the security of user assets, HTX is set to gradually resume deposits for TRON, BTC, and ETH chains on the platform, starting from November 24, 2023, at 08:00 (UTC),‚Äù said HTX.</p>
<p>Besides the mentioned chains, other services will resume, too. ‚ÄúFollowing this, the resumption of withdrawal services will be conducted in an orderly manner. Please stay tuned for our further announcements,‚Äù said HTX.</p>
<p>The resumption should begin at the time of writing.</p>
<h2>HTX Announces Airdrop to Thank Users</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In addition, HTX is celebrating the restoration of its services with an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pyth-airdrop-ethereum-solana-and-aptos-set-to-benefit-from-new-platform-launch-heres-how-to-check-eligibility.htm">airdrop</a> event for all users, as a gesture of appreciation for their support. The event details will be shared in early December, with rewards drawn from a premium asset soon to be listed on the platform.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo express our gratitude for your ongoing support and trust, we have specially planned an extraordinary token airdrop event to reward all our users,‚Äù wrote the announcement. ‚ÄúWe will unveil the specific details of this event in early December. Please keep an eye on our updates.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Nov. 22, HTX was <a href="https://www.htx.com.nr/support/en-us/detail/24955033595175">attacked by hackers</a> and suffered a $13.6 million exploit. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/htx-huobi-global-to-resume-deposits-and-withdrawals-after-13-6-million-exploit.htm">exchange promised</a> to ‚Äúfully compensate for the losses caused by this attack and 100% guarantee the safety of user funds‚Äù in a statement following the attack.</p>
<p>In September, Huobi <a href="https://www.htx.com/support/en-us/detail/84948926582328">rebranded itself</a> as HTX, with &#8220;H&#8221; for Huobi, &#8220;T&#8221; for its commitment to being all in TRON, and &#8220;X&#8221; for the exchange.</p>

<p>JPMorgan analysts have reported that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-updates-bitcoin-etf-prospectus-after-discussing-with-sec.htm">Grayscale Bitcoin Trust</a> (GBTC) could experience outflows of at least $2.7 billion if it is converted into a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-rises-above-37000-amid-market-optimism-is-the-bull-market-back.htm">Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-etfs.htm">exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/264543/jpmorgan-gbtc-outflows-estimates-etf-conversion">report from JPMorgan</a> suggests that traders have been buying GBTC shares at a discount, likely aiming to profit by cashing out the holdings if the trust converts to an ETF and the share price rises to match its Bitcoin assets.</p>
<h2>JPMorgan&#8217;s Report on GBTC&#8217;s Potential Outflow</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After the calculation of the GBTC inflows since 2023, the analysts came to the conclusion that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to ETF conversion could result in outflows upwards of $2.7 billion as investors sell off shares.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan analysts team, led by Global Market Strategy Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, explained their methodology, stating, ‚ÄúTo proxy the buying flow into [the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust] since the beginning of the year, we cumulate the daily signed dollar volume, i.e., the daily volume in thousands of shares times the price times the sign of the price change, positive if the price had increased over that day and negative if the price had decreased.‚Äù</p>
<p>&#8220;This methodology produces an estimate of around $2.5 billion for the net cumulative flow into [the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust] since the beginning of the year. This number increases to close to $2.7 billion if one also adds the covering of the short interest since the beginning of the year,&#8221; said the analysts.</p>
<p>In addition, the analysts‚Äô estimated $2.7 billion is the bare minimum outflow, and it could be ‚Äúsignificantly more‚Äù unless GBTC‚Äôs current fee of 200 basis points is lowered to around 50 basis points.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnce the SEC approves spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., we envisage a more intense competition with the average fee for bitcoin ETFs converging towards that of Gold ETFs, which currently stands at around 50 basis points,&#8221; said the JPMorgan analysts.</p>

<p>GBTC is currently trading at $30.45, up by 27% from a month ago, according to Yahoo Finance.</p>
<h2>Incoming Competition of Management Fees</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To give some context, Cathie Wood‚Äôs <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-and-21shares-amend-bitcoin-spot-etf-application.htm">ARK Investment Management</a> and 21Shares recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/cathie-wood-s-ark-21shares-unveil-0-8-fee-on-pending-spot-bitcoin-etf">filed an update</a> for their spot Bitcoin ETF application (ARKB), adjusting the management fee from 70 basis points to 80.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brief-approval-window-opens-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-90-chance-of-approval-by-january.htm">James Seyffart</a> initially assumed that the fee of ARKB would be lower and ‚Äúcloser to 50 basis points,‚Äù which would be around the average of 54 basis points (0.54%) across US-listed ETFs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlso the fact that Ark and 21Shares have updated their filing from a 70 basis point fee to 80 basis points might mean that running these products is going to cost even more than some sponsors and issuers thought it would,‚Äù said Seyffart.</p>

<p>KyberSwap, a decentralized exchange, has been compromised in a hack resulting in the theft of $48 million, prompting the platform to <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1727475235342217682">advise users</a> to withdraw their funds while the attackers hint at entering negotiations.</p>
<p>On-chain data indicates that the hack on KyberSwap resulted in significant losses of $48 million across several blockchain networks, including 20 million from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-arbitrum-network-tokens.htm">Arbitrum</a>, $15 million from Optimism and $7 million from Ethereum.</p>
<p>The stolen funds were primarily deposited in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, Wrapped Ethereum (wETH), and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-launches-bridging-standard-for-stablecoin-deployment-on-new-networks.htm">USD Coin (USDC)</a>. The analysis of the incident indicates a direct attack on the exchange&#8217;s liquidity pools instead of a vulnerability in the platform&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>Kyber Network has sent out notifications to advise users to withdraw their funds. ‚ÄúWe regret to inform you that KyberSwap Elastic has experienced a security incident,‚Äù said Kyber Network. ‚ÄúAs a precautionary measure, we strongly advise all users to promptly withdraw their funds.

<p>The company stated that KyberSwap‚Äôs aggregator is ‚Äúnot impacted‚Äù and is ‚Äúoperating fully as normal.‚Äù In the meantime, Kyber Network reminds the investors of potential scams and not to click any phishing links or respond to direct messages.</p>
<p>In addition to being a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">decentralized exchange (DEX)</a>, KyberSwap is also an automated market maker (AMM) with liquidity protocols and concentrated liquidity. Instead of using traditional order books like a conventional exchange, an AMM like KyberSwap uses liquidity pools that allow assets to be traded automatically.</p>
<h2>Rampant Hacker Activities</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The hackers have recently been rampantly exploiting exchanges for profits. On Nov. 22, the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heco-chain-htx-hit-by-100m-hack-justin-sun-says-exchange-will-cover-all-losses.htm">HTX and blockchain protocol Heco Chain</a> were hacked for $97 million worth of digital tokens. Earlier on Nov. 19, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/taiwanese-crypto-trading-firm-suspends-operations-following-26-million-hack.htm">Kronos Research</a> was also breached with $26 million stolen.</p>

<p>According to the Statement, the UK government will proceed with the legislation to implement the DSS, which will ‚Äúfacilitate the adoption of digital assets across financial markets.‚Äù The government will also ‚Äúlay an SI to implement the DSS, delivering on the Edinburgh Reform announcement to implement a Financial Market Infrastructure Sandbox in 2023.‚Äù</p>
<p>The SI, also known as the statutory instrument, will be introduced by the government before the Parliament can officially and permanently implement the DSS. The DSS initiative will presumably begin in the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>UK&#8217;s Attempt to Focus on Innovation and Regulation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In July, the UK government <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/launch-permanent-digital-sandbox">published a consultation</a> on its proposal for implementing a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/digital-sandbox">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>, an initiative run by the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority. It was the first Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) Sandbox set up under the powers given to the Government in the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) 2023.</p>
<p>Following its launch, the DSS has received feedback from the industry on the consultation. The government has also published a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/655c893ed03a8d001207fda1/M8298_Draft_response_to_DSS_consultation_final.pdf">response to the consultation</a>, summarizing the feedback received. According to the response, ‚Äúfeedback praised the emphasis on facilitating innovation, without compromising on regulatory outcomes.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, the DSS still have some gaps to fill. ‚ÄúOn unbacked cryptoassets, the government will maintain the policy of exclusion for the DSS,‚Äù said the Response, ‚Äúgiven there is currently no established regime for cryptoassets that could be amended in the Sandbox.‚Äù</p>
<p>It is also possible to include non-GBP digital assets in the DSS. But for now, ‚Äúthe early activity in the DSS is likely to be focused on GBP-only assets.‚Äù The Bank of England will eventually decide if to include non-GBP assets.</p>

<p>In South Korea, the cryptocurrency community is calling for stronger reporting standards and a more rigorous regulatory framework as multiple virtual assets encounter delistings and circulation discrepancies, <a href="https://www.digitaltoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=495199">according to Digital Today</a>.</p>
<p>The push for enhanced oversight follows a series of delistings and reported inconsistencies in the circulation volumes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/phantom-wallet-guide-how-to-set-up-get-started.htm">altcoins</a> such as Galaxia (GXA) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/enjin-coin/">Enjin (ENJ)</a>, sparking controversy and undermining investor confidence in the market.</p>
<h2>ENJ and GXA Circulation Issues Trigger Regulatory Call in South Korea</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Enjin Coin was delisted from the Upbit fiat market in September due to a significant increase in tokens released. The Enjin Coin mainnet integrated the original <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum</a>-based tokens with a new Polkadot-based chain, resulting in the issuance of up to 2 billion new tokens.</p>
<p>Last September, 350 million ENJ tokens were released and distributed, leading to a substantial 35% of total existing tokens being released into the market within two months of the mainnet&#8217;s launch, potentially driving up the token&#8217;s inflation rate to about 75%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_134929" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-134929" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-134929" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia.png" alt="Galaxia" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-134929" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Galaxia</figcaption></figure>
<p>Galaxia (GXA), another virtual asset, also fell into controversy when it was discovered that the actual number of tokens in circulation exceeded the amount initially announced by the foundation.</p>
<p>On October 17, a hack on the platform compounded the issue with 380 million GXA tokens stolen. Following the hack, Galaxia was found to have exceeded the announced distribution volume in the market. As of October 31, the distribution announced by the Galaxia Foundation was 2.5 billion units, but the actual distribution amount reached 3 billion units.</p>
<p>Galaxia Foundation responded to the incident, claiming, ‚ÄúThe quantity known to have been exceeded, approximately 500 million units, is the quantity paid by the Galaxia Foundation to Galaxia Metaverse as operating agency fees, etc. in 2022. The reason the Foundation did not collect (the quantity) was unnecessary due to coin movement.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis was to eliminate any potential misunderstandings. We decided to deduct this amount as operating agency expenses in 2023,‚Äù said the Foundation.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency data service company Xangle demonstrated the importance of strengthened scrutiny, saying, ‚ÄúIn order to prevent similar distribution volume incidents from recurring, it is necessary to introduce clear standards for calculating distribution volume and a proven disclosure system that can monitor them.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Bithumb CEO&#8217;s Trial Begins as Crypto Scrutiny Escalates</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trial-of-bithumb-operators-ceo-begins.htm">The trial of Lee Sang-jun</a>, CEO of Bithumb Holdings, began in Seoul on Nov. 21, adding to the urgency for greater scrutiny in South Korea&#8217;s cryptocurrency sphere. Lee faces charges for allegedly ‚Äúsoliciting the listings‚Äù of unnamed altcoins on the Bithumb exchange.</p>
<p>This case adds to the existing concerns over transparency and regulation in the industry, as exemplified by the recent delistings and circulation discrepancies of several altcoins, stressing the need for stricter oversight within the crypto community.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently held discussions with Grayscale about converting the Grayscale <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-minetrix-presale-enters-stage-9-last-chance-to-buy-before-price-hike.htm">Bitcoin</a> Trust (GBTC) into its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-301179-767742.pdf">A memorandum</a> published by the SEC indicates that officials from the agency‚Äôs Division of Trading and Markets met with Grayscale Investments on Nov. 20 to consider the listing matters for turning its Bitcoin Trust into a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-rocky-token-surges-270x-in-24-hours-investors-are-turning-their-attention-to-this-other-bitcoin-etf-project-how-does-it-work.htm">bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>
<p>According to the memo, the discussion ‚Äúconcerned NYSE Arca, Inc.‚Äôs proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.‚Äù</p>
<p>The participants of the meeting included David Shillman, the Associate Director in the SEC&#8217;s Division of Trading and Markets, who oversees the U.S. equity, options and fixed income markets, and Michael Sonnenshein, the CEO at Grayscale Investments. Grayscale‚Äôs external representatives from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP also attended the meeting.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1727105945120194617">Another filing</a> revealed that Grayscale has agreed with the Bank of New York Mellon for it to act as the transfer agent for the trust‚Äôs shares.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Investments&#8217; Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In October, Grayscale filed an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-blackrock-file-updated-applications-for-bitcoin-spot-etfs-with-sec.htm">updated application</a> for its spot Bitcoin ETF. The updated application came after the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-crypto-asset-management-firm-wins-lawsuit-against-sec.htm">court ruling</a> favor Grayscale‚Äôs previous application. More specifically, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of Grayscale ordering the SEC to set aside its earlier rejection of Grayscale‚Äôs application and reopen the review process.</p>
<p>In the meantime, other major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Ark Invest, and Fidelity are also seeking opportunities to list their spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the SEC has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-to-decide-on-two-spot-bitcoin-etfs-by-nov-17.htm">constantly postponing</a> applications filed by different entities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
