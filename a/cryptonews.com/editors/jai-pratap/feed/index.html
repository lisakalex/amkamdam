<p>Boyaa Interactive International Limited, a Hong Kong-listed company, has scheduled a special general meeting of shareholders to <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2023/1204/2023120402093_c.pdf">vote on a $100 million crypto purchase plan</a> on December 20.</p>
<p>Directors, including independent non-executive directors, have expressed their belief that the proposed purchase authorization terms for potential cryptocurrency acquisitions are fair, reasonable, and align with standard commercial practices.</p>
<h2>Boyaa Interactive Plans to Buy $90 Million of BTC and ETH</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Earlier, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/boyaa-interactive-looking-to-purchase-100-million-in-crypto.htm">Boyaa Interactive proposed</a> to buy $45 million each for Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">ETH</a>) in the next 12 months. Additionally, the company intends to allocate $10 million to Tether (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">USDT</a>) and USD Coin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/#:~:text=USD%20Coin%20(USDC)%20is%20a%201%3A1%20representation%20of,link%20a%20legitimate%20bank%20account.">USDC</a>).</p>
<p>The decision to diversify into cryptocurrencies reflects a strategic move by Boyaa Interactive, echoing the broader trend of traditional companies recognizing the value and potential of digital assets. The upcoming shareholder vote will play a pivotal role in shaping the company&#8217;s foray into this dynamic and evolving market.</p>
<p>As Boyaa Interactive positions itself for this substantial crypto investment, shareholders will weigh in on the proposal, considering the potential risks and rewards associated with venturing into the volatile cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>The outcome of the vote will not only impact Boyaa Interactive&#8217;s financial strategy but may also signify a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional corporate structures.</p>
<p>Earlier on August 11, the Hong Kong-listed company disclosed that its board of directors had greenlit a $5 million budget for the group to acquire cryptocurrencies on regulated and licensed trading platforms within the upcoming year, starting from the announcement date.</p>
<p>The funding sources for these cryptocurrency acquisitions stem from the cash reserves generated by the group’s operations, spanning both Hong Kong and overseas.</p>

<p>A federal judge in Seattle has ruled that Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, must remain in the United States while awaiting sentencing on money laundering charges.</p>
<p>The decision overturned a previous ruling by a magistrate judge, who had allowed Zhao to return to the UAE pending his <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-cz-released-on-175-million-bond.htm">sentencing scheduled for February</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard Jones, in his ruling, acknowledged the unusual step of overturning a magistrate judge&#8217;s pre-sentencing decision but indicated that he was persuaded by the Justice Department&#8217;s argument that Zhao posed a flight risk.</p>
<h2>Judge Cites CZ’s Wealth Abroad as Flight Risk Factor</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite a substantial $175 million bond posted by Zhao, Judge Jones expressed concern that the Binance founder&#8217;s considerable wealth could incentivize him to forfeit the bond in exchange for his freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government’s fear is supported by its belief that the vast majority of the defendant’s wealth is held overseas and the belief that he has access to hundreds of millions of dollars in accessible cryptocurrency,&#8221; <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/690694065/CZ-Bail-Ruling">wrote Judge Jones in his decision</a>.</p>
<p>Zhao faces a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison for money laundering charges linked to allegations that Binance turned a blind eye to criminal transactions on its platforms.</p>
<p>Last month, Binance reached one of the largest corporate fines in U.S. history, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">agreeing to pay over $4 billion</a> to settle the charges, with Zhao personally agreeing to a $50 million payment.</p>
<p>Highlighting Zhao&#8217;s status as a citizen of Canada, where he moved at the age of 12 but no longer maintains ties, Judge Jones referenced an unverified claim by the Justice Department that Zhao was offered citizenship by the UAE.</p>
<p>This claim further fueled concerns that Zhao might exploit the lack of an extradition treaty between the UAE and the U.S.</p>
<p>Despite recognizing that Zhao does not pose a danger to the community, Judge Jones ordered that he could remain at liberty, pending his February sentencing, on the condition that he stays within the continental United States.</p>

<p>The lower house of the Indian Parliament, Lok Sabha, held a discussion on the importance of web3 and blockchain sector in India on December 6.</p>
<p>Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology, emphasized the importance of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">Web3</a> and Blockchain technologies in India&#8217;s digital future.</p>
<p>Addressing crucial questions, Chandrasekhar outlined the government&#8217;s support for Web3 startups, emphasizing the significance of promoting emerging technologies and raising awareness around Web3.</p>

<h2>Indian Government Warms Up to Web3</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Reacting to the parliamentary discourse, Om Malviya, President at Tezos India, a blockchain adoption entity, commended the growing synergy between Web3 startups and the Indian government.</p>
<p>Malviya told Cryptonews.com that India is a fertile ground for Web3 startups, with entrepreneurs increasingly exploring blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized technologies. He expressed optimism about the transformative potential of this vibrant ecosystem in contributing to India&#8217;s economic growth.</p>
<p>Malviya applauded government initiatives such as Algobharat, Regulatory Sandbox, and the creation of a startup-friendly environment.</p>
<p>These efforts are expected to generate employment opportunities and attract foreign investment, fostering a thriving Web3 startup ecosystem in India.</p>
<p>Malviya remains optimistic that India will emerge as a global leader in blockchain innovation.</p>
<h2>India Yet to Adopt Crypto Regulations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The current regulatory environment in India still remains in a gray area because of lack of regulatory clarity. India is among the top countries with the highest rate of crypto adoption as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/india-tops-chainalysis-global-crypto-adoption-index-despite-heavy-tax-regulations.htm">reported by Chainalysis</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Despite this the government is yet to clarify regulations surrounding crypto. Crypto traders in India are also dealing with high tax rates. There is currently a 30% income tax on crypto earning and a direct 1% GST on crypto transactions.</p>
<p>India recently concluded Presidency of G20 where crypto reguations was one of the major topics. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indian-crypto-exchanges-expect-clear-regulations-following-g20-declaration.htm">Indian crypto firms are expected clear regulations</a> as soon as next year.</p>

<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest continues its selling spree of shares of the largest US-based crypto exchange, Coinbase, amid the ongoing crypto rally.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ArkkDaily/status/1732601384292245545">Ark Invest Daily reported</a> that the fund management firm offloaded $24.2 million worth of Coinbase shares and $3.4 million worth of shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A day before, Ark Invest had <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-capitalizes-on-bitcoin-rally.htm">dumped nearly $33 million in Coinbase shares</a> and $5.9 million of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>Ark sold Coinbase shares on Wednesday through different exchange-traded funds. The fund management offloaded 120,433 Coinbase shares across three different ETFs: Innovation (ARKK), Next Generation Internet (ARKW), and Fintech Innovation (ARKF).</p>

<h2>ARK Invest still holds over 6 million Coinbase shares.</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin proponent Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest still holds 6,847,644 shares of Coinbase, with a market value of over $960 million. Coinbase shares amount to 11.64% of all ARKK holdings at the moment.</p>
<p>Coinbase shares are up nearly 7% in the last five days. The closing price of COIN on Wednesday was $140.20, with a 4% decrease in pre-market trading.</p>
<p>The price of the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has surged significantly since last weekend as it breached pre-Terra crash prices. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading just below $44,000, up nearly 16% in the last seven days.</p>
<p>The price of Bitcoin is surging based on several factors, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">potential spot BTC ETF approval</a> in the US and anticipation around the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates in the coming months.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, Ark offloaded 43,956 Coinbase shares valued at $5.3 million on November 28, coinciding with Coinbase&#8217;s impressive 55% surge in share price throughout November.</p>

<p>Terraform Labs co-founder, Do Kwon, has officially filed an appeal against the extradition decision of the High Court in Montenegro.</p>
<p>On December 6, the Montenegrin Court of Appeal confirmed that Kwon Do-hyung submitted an appeal, expressing his refusal to accept the court&#8217;s decision to extradite him, as per <a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=5200&amp;utm">local media reports</a>.</p>
<p>The appeal triggers a mandatory reexamination of the extradition ruling, compelling the Montenegrin Court of Appeal to review the case.</p>
<p>The timing of Kwon Do-hyung&#8217;s appeal introduces uncertainty into the resolution timeline, making it challenging for the Montenegrin Ministry of Justice to finalize a decision on his extradition destination before the set deadline of December 15.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon’s Extradition to South Korea and USA</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The legal saga dates back to June 15 when the Montenegrin court decided to detain Kwon Do-hyung for extradition for six months, setting the deadline for a final decision on his extradition.</p>
<p>The appeal comes approximately two weeks after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-founder-do-kwons-extradition-approved-by-montenegrin-court-heres-the-latest.htm">Montenegro&#8217;s High Court approved the extradition</a> requested by South Korea and the United States.</p>
<p>The court clarified that the decision did not specify whether Kwon Do-hyung would be extradited to Korea or the United States, leaving the final determination to the Montenegrin Minister of Justice.</p>
<p>During the extradition trial, Kwon Do-hyung expressed a desire to be extradited to Korea, according to statements from the court.</p>
<h2>Chances of Overturning Extradition Look Slim</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite Kwon Do-hyung&#8217;s appeal, local observers in Montenegro suggest that the chances of overturning the extradition decision are slim.</p>
<p>A local journalist familiar with the legal situation noted that there is a prevailing belief among Montenegrin government officials and judiciary figures that Do Kwon’&#8217;s continued detention attracts undue attention.</p>
<p>The Montenegrin Court of Appeal&#8217;s forthcoming decision on the extradition appeal will be closely watched as it holds the key to Do Kwon’&#8217;s potential extradition either to Korea or the United States.</p>

<p>Hong Kong <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=23PR145">Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has issued a warning</a> to the public about potential virtual asset-related frauds involving &#8220;HongKongDAO&#8221; and &#8220;BitCuped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Collaborating with the Hong Kong Police Force, the SFC has taken decisive action to block access to the websites associated with HongKongDAO and BitCuped, signaling a proactive stance against suspected fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>HongKongDAO, a particular focus of the warning, has introduced a token named &#8220;HKD&#8221; or &#8220;HongKongDAO&#8221; (HKD Token) available for purchase on its platform.</p>
<h2>HongKongDAO Falsely Claims to Hold Exchange License</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The SFC suspects that HongKongDAO may be disseminating false and misleading information through online channels.</p>
<p>An online article affiliated with HongKongDAO falsely claims that the entity holds licenses from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kongs-sfc-moves-update-crypto-market-regulations-following-new-market-developments.htm">SFC</a> for regulated activities and is actively bidding for a &#8220;Hong Kong Digital Currency Exchange Licence.&#8221;</p>
<p>These deceptive claims could mislead individuals into acquiring or subscribing to the HKD Token, posing significant risks to unsuspecting investors.</p>
<p>The SFC has highlighted discrepancies related to another crypto platform as well &#8211; BitCuped. The entity, according to the SFC, falsely represents &#8220;Laura Cha&#8221; as its Chairman and &#8220;Nicolas Aguzin&#8221; as its Chief Executive Officer. However, neither individual has any affiliations with BitCuped.</p>
<h2>SFC Urges Public to be Cautious</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The commission urges the public to exercise caution when encountering investment opportunities and advice on social media platforms and instant messaging apps.</p>
<p>This cautionary note comes amid a global push by regulatory bodies to safeguard investors from the increasing threats within the cryptocurrency and virtual asset space.</p>
<p>The SFC reiterates the importance of vigilance and prudence, particularly when making investment decisions, in order to mitigate the risks associated with potential fraudulent schemes. Investors are advised to conduct thorough due diligence and verify the legitimacy of entities before engaging in any financial transactions.</p>
<p>Earlier, Hong Kong witnessed a massive crypto fraud when law enforcement agencies discovered the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpex-scandal-undermines-trust-crypto-among-hong-kongers-survey-reveals.htm">JPEX scandal</a> that ballooned up to $200 million.</p>

<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest is capitalizing on the recent surge as it offloaded millions of Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares when the leading crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-surges-past-44k-el-salvador-sees-soaring-returns-on-btc-investment.htm">surpassed the $44,000 threshold</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the investment firm led by Wood <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkkDaily/status/1732234152156536989">sold over $33 million worth of Coinbase</a> Global Inc shares, aligning with the prevailing market dynamics.</p>
<p>This strategic decision follows a tactical shift a day prior when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ark-invest-sells-another-1-4m-shares-of-coinbase-increases-exposure-to-robinhood.htm">Ark Invest offloaded</a> $1.4 million worth of Coinbase shares while simultaneously increasing exposure to Robinhood.</p>

<p>&mdash; Ark Invest Daily (@ArkkDaily) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkkDaily/status/1732234152156536989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>Ark Invest Continues to Offload Coinbase Shares</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ark Invest&#8217;s sale of 237,572 Coinbase shares across multiple ETFs, including ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF, amounted to an estimated $33.3 million. Despite a 0.63% lower closing price at $140.20 on Tuesday, this move is in line with Ark&#8217;s broader strategy adjustment amid the ongoing cryptocurrency market rally.</p>
<p>The sale of a substantial portion of Coinbase holdings is consistent with Ark Invest&#8217;s historical advocacy for cryptocurrency and reflects the firm&#8217;s adaptability to market conditions. The decision to divest Coinbase shares, valued at over $33 million, coincides strategically with the considerable increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>In addition to the Coinbase trade, Ark Invest executed a significant sale of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-drops-update-on-gbtc-spot-bitcoin-btc-etf-approval-get-ready-for-ethereum-eth-and-everlodge-eldg-price-surge.htm">Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</a> shares worth $5.9 million through ARKW. This move aligns with Cathie Wood&#8217;s previous insights on the potential impact of Bitcoin ETF approvals on Grayscale&#8217;s market position. On Tuesday, GBTC shares closed 4.35% higher at $35.10.</p>
<p>This marks another chapter in Ark Invest&#8217;s ongoing adjustments, showcasing their ability to navigate the evolving crypto landscape dynamically.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time the firm has trimmed Coinbase holdings; on November 28, Ark <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-coinbase-near-top-loads-up-on-robinhood.htm">offloaded 43,956 Coinbase shares</a> valued at $5.3 million, coinciding with Coinbase&#8217;s impressive 55% surge in share price throughout November.</p>

<p>South Korean crypto traders are emerging as key influencers in driving Bitcoin price up by over 50%, reaching its highest price level in two years.</p>
<p>As per data compiled by CCData for November, Korean won surpassed the dollar, becoming the largest fiat trading pair in crypto for the first time, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/south-korean-crypto-traders-influence-jumps-during-recent-bitcoin-rally-1.2007720">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p>Korean won accounted for 42.8% of fiat trading activity in Bitcoin in November, outpacing the dollar.</p>
<h2>Market Share of S.Korean Exchanges Increases</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Excluding stablecoins and select trading pairs, CCData&#8217;s findings reveal a substantial increase in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-traders-drive-recent-crypto-surge.htm">market share of South Korean-based exchanges</a>, rising to 12.9% in November compared to 5.2% at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Particularly, platforms like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/upbit-dominates-korean-crypto-exchange-market-with-a-market-share-of-80-research.htm">Upbit</a> have contributed significantly to the surge in trading activity on centralized exchanges in the East Asian nation.</p>
<p>The surge in trading activity aligns with a broader uptick in overall trading volume throughout October and November.</p>
<p>This surge in the digital asset market coincides with a sense of optimism surrounding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">potential approval of U.S. exchange-traded funds</a> to hold digital assets.</p>
<h2>South Korea Remains on Top Despite Setbacks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
South Korea, renowned for its robust blockchain and crypto community, has weathered challenges, including the collapse of Terra in May 2022, led by Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon.</p>
<p>Despite setbacks, the nation remains a focal point for many crypto firms eyeing substantial opportunities, particularly as regulatory challenges intensify in the United States.</p>
<p>The data suggests that South Korean traders are not only contributing significantly to the surge in the market but also diversifying their influence across various digital assets.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, analysts from the South Korea-founded blockchain data platform CryptoQuant revealed that traders in South Korea are particularly responsible for the escalating trading volume of altcoins.</p>

Coinbase shares, which closed nearly 5.5% higher at $141.09 on Monday, have been subject to Ark&#8217;s strategic adjustments.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Ark Invest has trimmed its Coinbase holdings. On November 28, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-coinbase-near-top-loads-up-on-robinhood.htm">firm offloaded 43,956 Coinbase shares</a> valued at $5.3 million as the stock reached $119.77, marking its highest point since April 2021.</p>
<p>The strategic move coincided with Coinbase&#8217;s impressive 55% surge in share price throughout November, reflecting an improved sentiment in the crypto market.</p>
<p>Ark&#8217;s latest Coinbase selling spree follows its significant divestment in July, when the firm <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-53-million-coinbase-shares-amid-record-highs.htm">sold over $100 million worth of Coinbase shares</a> as prices hovered around $90.</p>
<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s firm has been dynamic in adjusting its exposure to Coinbase, showcasing an ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating potential risks.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the Coinbase sell-off, Ark Invest increased its stake in Robinhood Markets Inc. On Monday, Ark Invest bought 14,704 shares of Robinhood. The purchase comes at the same time the stock and crypto trading platform announced a 75% increase in crypto trading on its platform in November compared to October</p>

<p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is exploring the possibility of introducing cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>The FSC revealed that it is closely studying foreign cryptocurrency futures products and ETFs. The intention is to gradually ease restrictions in alignment with global market conditions, <a href="https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20231205700057-430301">FSC revealed to local media</a>.</p>
<p>The context of this exploration coincides with several significant global developments. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to cut interest rates and the upcoming review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">Bitcoin spot ETF in January</a> next year have added to the momentum. The anticipation around the Bitcoin halving in April, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-breaks-through-42000-up-6-6-in-24-hours.htm">contributing to a 150% surge this year</a>.</p>
<h2>Taiwan Regulators Monitoring Crypto ETF Developments</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The FSC recognizes the potential impact of a Bitcoin index stock fund, contingent on SEC approval and subsequent public investment permission. Taiwan&#8217;s domestic investment banks, attuned to these advancements, have expressed longstanding interest in introducing similar products.</p>
<p>The FSC draws parallels with global counterparts, pointing out the proliferation of cryptocurrency futures products and ETFs in various markets.</p>
<p>The FSC acknowledged that Canada&#8217;s Toronto Stock Exchange, Cboe Australia Exchange, and major U.S. exchanges have listed or are in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-could-grow-by-1-trillion-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-cryptoquant-report.htm">process of listing various crypto ETFs</a>.</p>
<h2>FSC Looking to Adopt Phased Approach</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The FSC emphasized a phased approach based on self-discipline and standards for relaxing regulations around crypto ETFs.</p>
<p>This cautious strategy aligns with Taiwan&#8217;s historical prudence, as witnessed in the delay of cryptocurrency ETFs and blockchain ETFs due to concerns over volatility and speculative nature.</p>
<p>As Taiwan contemplates this significant stride into the cryptocurrency ETF domain, industry players are cautiously optimistic. While some considered private placements for overseas cryptocurrency ETFs, challenges such as tightened regulatory supervision and concerns over errors and price lags led to reconsideration.</p>
<p>Taiwan&#8217;s regulator further noted that they may plan something like &#8220;cryptocurrency concept ETFs,&#8221; which could potentially invest in cryptocurrency-related software and hardware vendors, providing investors with exposure to the industry without direct linkage to cryptocurrency price fluctuations.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price briefly broke through the $42,000 mark earlier today, gaining 6.6% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>This surge marks a recovery to levels last witnessed before the Terra crash in May 2022.</p>
<p>Liquidations in the crypto market have concurrently spiked, with over $160 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, primarily affecting short positions.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price reached a peak of $42,100, and is currently trading at $41,603, following a slight decline subsequent to surpassing the $42,000 milestone.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price Reaches Highest Level Since May 2022</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This surge represents a complete retracement to Bitcoin&#8217;s level above $41,000 in early May 2022, reflecting a remarkable value increase of over 150% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The global cryptocurrency market cap has also experienced a notable uptick, reaching $1.62 trillion, signifying a 4.0% increase within the past 24 hours. The last time the combined cryptocurrency market cap reached this level was in late April 2022.</p>
<p>In terms of trading volumes, November&#8217;s cryptocurrency exchange trading volume surpassed $826 billion, marking the highest monthly volume since March of the same year.</p>
<p>Onchain data reveals that <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin&#8217;s daily trading volume</a> has increased from over $30 billion on December 1 to the current value of $32 billion, reaching a yearly high and its highest level since November 2022.</p>
<p>The surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price has not been without consequences, as evidenced by significant liquidations in the past 24 hours.</p>
<h2>$216 Million Liquidated</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">Coinglass data</a> indicates that 75,887 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations exceeding $216 million. The majority of these liquidations targeted short positions, with $166 million shorts wiped out compared to just over $50 million in long positions.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin takes the spotlight, other blue-chip cryptocurrencies experienced varying gains on Monday. Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">ETH</a>) rose by over 4% to maintain its position above the $2,250 mark. BNB posted a more modest uptick of over 2%, reaching a current price of $234, while Solana traded flat, hovering around the $63.50 mark over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price has surged past the $40,000 mark for the first time since early May 2022.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price had been hovering around the $40,000 level in recent days and finally breached it on late Sunday, trading above $40,750 as of the latest update, reflecting a 24-hour rise of nearly 4%.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is up nearly 10% in the last 7 days, as per <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Coingecko data</a>.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Surpasses $2,200 Mark</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Simultaneously, the second largest crypto Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">ETH</a>) lso experienced a positive trajectory, surpassing $2,200 amid the overall market rally.</p>
<p>Ethereum was observed to be trading at $2,205, showcasing a similar percentage rise over the past 24 hours. While most other top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization marked smaller gains, BNB coin, affiliated with the Binance exchange, exhibited a slight decline of about 0.1% over the past day.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent climb follows its dip below $40,000 in April 2022. However, the largest crypto by market cap has been on an upward trend over the past few months, driven in part by what seems to be dovish remarks from U.S. central bankers and optimistic expectations regarding the potential approval of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-could-attract-3b-on-first-day-and-up-to-55b-over-five-years-analysts.htm">spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) in the country.</p>
<p>Similarly, Ethereum, having not traded above $2,200 since May 2022, has approached this threshold several times in recent weeks. A notable trend in Bitcoin transactions has been the withdrawal of 37,000 BTC by holders between Nov. 17 and Dec. 1, suggesting a preference for direct custody of their coins.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Rallies 120% in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin price has experienced a remarkable rally of over 120% throughout the year, with optimism prevailing among industry experts for this surge to extend into 2024.</p>
<p>Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, emphasized this sentiment, stating that 2023 appeared to be a preparatory year for the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/04/bitcoin-price-at-100000-in-2024-crypto-execs-say-bull-run-has-begun.html">anticipated bull run in 2024</a> and beyond.</p>
<p>However, the cryptocurrency landscape has faced its share of challenges since Bitcoin&#8217;s last record high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.</p>
<p>Issues ranging from project collapses and bankruptcies to criminal trials have marked the industry. Recently, high-profile cases involving FTX and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Binance</a> have reached resolutions, with industry observers perceiving these conclusions as a potential turning point in addressing long standing challenges within the crypto market.</p>

<h2>The Venture is Fully Funded by DOGE Tokens</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The brainchild of the space technology company Geometric Energy Corporation, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doge-1-mission-set-for-november-but-doge-slips-behind-rampant-qube.htm">DOGE-1 satellite project</a> was unveiled in May 2021 and is set to be launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>This satellite venture marks the first-ever launch fully funded in DOGE tokens.</p>
<p>Miniature screens on the satellite are poised to display a variety of content, including advertisements, images, and logos, which will be transmitted back to Earth.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after a series of delays that have beset the DOGE-1 mission.</p>
<p>Initially revealed by SpaceX founder Elon Musk in 2021 as part of a rideshare collaboration with Intuitive Machines and NASA, the mission faced repeated postponements from its initially targeted 2022 launch to the now-scheduled January 2024 liftoff.</p>
<h2>DOGE-Satellite Will Launch in January 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The DOGE-1 satellite&#8217;s unique feature of accepting DOGE tokens as payment aligns with the cryptocurrency&#8217;s growing acceptance in various spheres. This mission is not only a symbol of innovation but also a testament to the expanding influence of cryptocurrencies beyond traditional financial landscapes.</p>
<p>The DOGE-1 mission is not the only dogecoin-related venture in the pipeline. Another mission is reportedly in the works, indicating a growing interest in leveraging cryptocurrency for space exploration initiatives. The historic launch is scheduled for January 2024.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the leading meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin is trading at $0.084875, an increase of 4% in the last 24 hrs, as per Coingecko data.</p>

<p>Beosin EagleEye&#8217;s latest report exposes a <a href="https://beosin.com/resources/blockchain-security-recap-of-november-35653m-lost-in-attacks?lang=en-US">massive surge in blockchain security incidents</a> during November 2023, leading to a staggering total loss of over $356 million.</p>
<p>This marked an alarming 6.9-fold increase compared to the losses reported in October.</p>
<h2>Hacker Attacks Resulted in $335 Million Loss Alone</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hacker attacks took the lion&#8217;s share of the losses, accounting for approximately $335.63 million. The two high-profile incidents involving stolen funds exceeding $100 million each shook the industry.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/poloniex-to-resume-withdrawals-starting-with-trx-after-100m-hack.htm">Poloniex fell victim to a hack</a> of approximately $126 million, while HTX, along with its affiliated cross-chain bridge HECO Bridge, suffered a theft of approximately $110 million.</p>
<p>Remarkably, these two incidents, both affiliated with Sun Yuchen, constituted a significant 66% of the total losses attributed to hacker attacks in November.</p>
<p>Phishing scams also witnessed a surge, with individual addresses falling prey to schemes exceeding $1 million.</p>
<p>The global cryptocurrency landscape experienced a spike in crime cases involving amounts exceeding $100 million, encompassing various forms of fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>Exchanges, both centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX), bore the brunt of security incidents in November, with a combined loss of $215 million.</p>
<p>Poloniex, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heco-chain-htx-hit-by-100m-hack-justin-sun-says-exchange-will-cover-all-losses.htm">HTX</a>, CoinSpot, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dydx-dex-and-yfi-token-hit-by-9-million-targeted-attack-heres-what-happened.htm">dYdX</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-hacked-for-48-million-hackers-suggest-negotiations.htm">KyberSwap</a> were among the affected platforms.</p>
<p>The report issues a stern recommendation for major projects to fortify private key management, conduct routine security audits, establish emergency response plans, and intensify security awareness training for privileged employees.</p>
<h2>Phishing Scams and Rug Pulls Witness an Uptick</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The phishing scam landscape, witnessing an uptick in incidents, prompts user advisories to securely store private keys, exercise caution during signing procedures, and avoid engagement with suspicious content.</p>
<p>On the regulatory front, the US Treasury Department took action against cryptocurrency mixing platform Sinbad.</p>
<p>Allegations linked the platform to North Korean hackers, accusing Sinbad of handling funds from Horizon Bridge and Axie Infinity hacking incidents.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-treasury-sanctions-north-korean-governments-crypto-mixer-sinbad.htm">Sinbad faces sanctions</a> for purported involvement in activities such as evading sanctions, drug trafficking, purchasing materials for child sexual abuse, and participating in illegal sales on the dark web market.</p>

<p>Analysts are now eyeing a potential window for the approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), setting the time frame between January 5 and 10, 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-to-decide-on-two-spot-bitcoin-etfs-by-nov-17.htm">Previous deadline of November 17</a> by analysts passed without any discernible action from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2>Deadline for Hashdex and Franklin Templeton ETF Around Jan 5 &#8211; 8</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
James Seyffart, an ETF specialist from Bloomberg Intelligence, shed light on this updated timeline, pinpointing the deadline for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-grayscale-ether-etf.htm">Hashdex and Franklin Templeton</a> around January 5-8.</p>
<p>This aligns with the broader window of January 5-10, where approval for all twelve spot BTC ETF filings could potentially materialize.</p>
<p>This revised timeline quashes any lingering hopes for a December approval, with recent SEC developments pushing the odds to the year 2024.</p>
<p>Seyffart and colleague Eric Balchunas maintain their prediction of a 90% likelihood of approval by January 10.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Financial Advisors Waiting to Provide BTC Access to Clients</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Financial advisors, eagerly anticipating Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, are poised to provide access to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">BTC</a> for their clients. Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Services, a $250 billion asset management firm, underscores the significance of ETF approvals for financial advisors.</p>
<p>Edelman predicts a surge in interest, citing that 12% of advisors currently recommend Bitcoin, while 47% own the asset.</p>
<p>Edelman emphasized the importance of Bitcoin ownership among advisors for credibility.</p>
<p>He notes that advisors often grapple with the conflict of owning Bitcoin while not recommending it to clients, presenting a potential challenge.</p>
<p>Among the 47% of advisors who own BTC, many are eagerly awaiting the availability of spot BTC ETFs, anticipating compliance department approvals for this innovative investment product.</p>
<p>In a recent memo, the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-305159-785022.pdf">US SEC disclosed that it engaged in discussions with Grayscale</a> on Thursday regarding the prospective transformation of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.</p>
<p>The regulator body had initially opposed this transition, but Grayscale contested the decision in a legal battle, ultimately emerging victorious.</p>

<p>The RARI Foundation, the nonprofit entity linked to the Rarible ecosystem, has officially launched the testnet for the <a href="https://rarichain.org/">RARI Chain</a> on Arbitrum.</p>
<p>This novel EVM-equivalent blockchain is designed to serve as a nonfungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/nft/">NFT</a>) infrastructure solution, embedding royalties directly into its nodes.</p>
<h2>Rarible Witnesses Massive Surge in Trading Volume</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The recent surge in Rarible&#8217;s trading volume acted as a catalyst for this initiative. Following a 585% uptick in the 24-hour trading volume on Rarible, the platform decided to exclude marketplaces lacking royalty support. This commitment to royalty enforcement and support evidently struck a chord with the community, setting the stage for the unveiling of the RARI Chain.</p>
<p>In a press release shared with CryptoNews, Jana Bertram, the Head of Strategy at RARI Foundation, emphasized the pivotal role of creators in propelling the NFT landscape forward. Bertram highlighted the importance of providing creators with robust tools and environments that contribute to their success, ultimately preventing their disintermediation from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">Web3</a> growth.</p>
<p>Alex Salnikov, Co-founder of Rarible, echoed these sentiments, underlining the belief in a &#8220;creator-centric ecosystem&#8221; for Web3. The introduction of the RARI Chain, with royalties embedded at the node level, is positioned as a safeguard for creators&#8217; earnings. Salnikov emphasized that this approach transforms creator royalties from a mere promise into a tangible guarantee.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum, LayerZero, WalletConnect Support Rari Chain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The partnership ecosystem supporting the RARI Chain includes key players such as Arbitrum, LayerZero, Thirdweb, Gelato, WalletConnect, Magic, and Caldera, all actively contributing to the success of this new blockchain.</p>
<p>Nina Rong, the Head of Ecosystem Development at Arbitrum Foundation, stressed the significance of fairly rewarding creators for their efforts. Royalty enforcement at the node level, as facilitated by the RARI Chain, marks a substantial step in realizing this vision.</p>
<p>Founded in the year 2022, the RARI Foundation is a non-profit entity fulfilling the role of the authorized representative for the RARI DAO. Operating under the decentralized governance of $RARI token holders within an autonomous organization, the RARI DAO delegates pivotal responsibilities to the RARI Foundation.</p>

<p>Indian authorities are intensifying efforts to bring the alleged mastermind behind a massive $240 million cryptocurrency scam back to the country.</p>
<p>The special investigation team (SIT) of the Himachal police, after nearly two months of probing, has prepared a comprehensive 2,100-page chargesheet, unveiling the intricate details of the 2,000 INR crypto scam (approximately $240 million).</p>
<h2>Main Suspect in Crypto Scam Fled to Dubai</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The key figure identified as Subhash Chand, believed to be the mastermind, is currently on the run and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mastermind-behind-indias-24-million-crypto-fraud-flees-country.htm">suspected to be hiding in Dubai</a>.</p>
<p>The SIT has initiated the extradition process, with a hearing scheduled in a UAE court on December 4. Reports suggest that Subhash&#8217;s visa is also nearing expiration, adding urgency to the extradition plea, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachalcrypto-scam-probe-finds-funds-came-back-to-india-through-hawala-network-101701283422771.html">local media reported</a>.</p>
<p>The chargesheet, submitted to the prosecution department for sanction, names Hemraj, Sukhdev, and Abhishek as the main accused.</p>
<p>The investigation has unraveled a sophisticated network, exposing that the proceeds from the fraudulent transactions were funneled back to India through the hawala network.</p>

<p>Switzerland-based Pando Asset has emerged as the latest contender in the race to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.</p>
<p>Joining dozens of other applicants, Pando Asset is seeking to introduce a fund type that has yet to receive approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2>Swiss Firm Proposes Pando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pando Asset revealed its intentions through a Wednesday filing, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2001771/000182912623007712/pandoasset_s1.htm">proposing the creation of the Pando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust</a>.</p>
<p>The trust&#8217;s assets would predominantly comprise bitcoin, held under the custody of Coinbase Custody Trust company, with the trust administration duties entrusted to BNY Mellon.</p>
<p>Despite numerous inquiries, a spokesperson for Pando Asset remained silent, offering no immediate comments on the matter.</p>
<p>The SEC finds itself at the epicenter of a substantial influx of filings, with approximately a dozen issuers, including financial heavyweights <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-revises-bitcoin-etf-model-to-appease-sec-concerns.htm">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fidelity-submits-revised-application-for-bitcoin-etf-amid-increasing-confidence-regarding-approval.htm">Fidelity</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-race-intensifies-as-wisdomtree-invesco-both-file-submissions-within-24-hours-joining-blackrock.htm">Invesco</a>, presenting live spot Bitcoin ETF applications.</p>
<p>This surge in interest marks a pivotal moment for the SEC, as it navigates uncharted territory in considering approvals for such investment vehicles.</p>
<h2>Spto Crypto ETFs Internationally</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Internationally, regulators in Canada, Brazil, and the Netherlands have already given their nod to spot crypto ETFs in recent years. Meanwhile, crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs), financial instruments collateralized by underlying exposures like bitcoin, have enjoyed a longer history in the market.</p>
<p>Pando Asset, with a suite of three exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the SIX Swiss Exchange, aims to leverage its European crypto product expertise in the US. Notably, one of its ETPs allocates to six diverse crypto assets, including bitcoin, ether, binance coin, cardano, solana, and polkadot.</p>
<p>The SEC is anticipated to deliver its ruling on the proposed Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF by January 10. Industry pundits speculate that this could open the floodgates, with a potential green light for multiple such products.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have even given a compelling <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brief-approval-window-opens-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-90-chance-of-approval-by-january.htm">90% likelihood of such approval</a>, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency investment opportunities in the US.</p>

<p>Forbes has announced that the latest iteration of its revered &#8220;Under 30&#8221; series <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesweb3/2023/11/28/forbes-unveils-new-ethereum-project-under-30-list-goes-live-on-blockchain-pioneering-web3-transparency--data-storage/?sh=1a1fc9c6533ehttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesweb3/2023/11/28/forbes-unveils-new-ethereum-project-under-30-list-goes-live-on-blockchain-pioneering-web3-transparency--data-storage/?sh=1a1fc9c6533e">will be etched onto the Ethereum blockchain</a> for the first time.</p>
<p>This narratives of the exceptional individuals featured in the list will be permanently recorded on the blockchain, marking a significant foray into the intersection of traditional media and web3.</p>
<h2>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire Among Judges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The &#8220;Under 30&#8221; list spans across 20 diverse categories, including art, entertainment, retail and e-commerce, finance, and investment.</p>
<p>The judges for the &#8220;30 Under 30 Finance 2024&#8221; list comprise influential figures such as Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, and Web3 practitioners like Injective Labs founders Eric Chen and Albert Chon, and Fractal co-founder and co-CEO Aya Kantorovich, among others.</p>
<p>Forbes, recognized for spotlighting the brightest young entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders, is leveraging the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> blockchain to immortalize its data.</p>
<p>The move aligns with Forbes&#8217; commitment to marrying traditional media with cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>Vadim Supitskiy, Forbes&#8217; Chief Digital and Information Officer, emphasized the significance of this step, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By launching the Under 30 list on the Ethereum blockchain, we&#8217;re not just recognizing the influential young leaders; we&#8217;re also demonstrating the vast, untapped potential of blockchain technology in the realm of data storage and security.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The blockchain-enabled &#8220;Under 30&#8221; list is positioned as just the beginning of Forbes&#8217; foray into blockchain technology, showcasing its commitment to innovation and foresight in the dynamic digital landscape.</p>
<p>Taha Ahmed, Forbes&#8217; Chief Growth Officer, echoed this sentiment, expressing excitement about further exploration of how blockchain and Web3 technologies can transform the way important information is shared, stored, and secured.</p>

<p>The financial world bids farewell to Charlie Munger, the distinguished investor and long-time collaborator of Warren Buffett, who <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/28/investing/charlie-munger-dies/index.html">passed away at the age of 99</a> on November 28.</p>
<p>Munger&#8217;s demise marks the end of an era, leaving behind a legacy of impactful contributions to the investment landscape, notably during his tenure at Berkshire Hathaway alongside Buffett.</p>
<h2>Munger Wanted to Ban Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Munger&#8217;s financial prowess earned him accolades, he was equally <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/charlie-munger-expresses-concern-over-bitcoin-rise.htm">known for his opposition to Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>His critical stance on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> was evident in his public statements, branding the digital currency as &#8220;disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Munger&#8217;s skepticism was rooted in Bitcoin&#8217;s notorious volatility and the absence of regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>Of particular concern to Munger was Bitcoin&#8217;s potential misuse in criminal activities, including kidnapping and extortion.</p>
<p>He vocally <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">advocated for a U.S. ban on cryptocurrencies</a>, citing their unregulated and predatory nature.</p>
<p>In a candid interview, Munger expressed his reservations about a currency that could be exploited by criminals, stating, &#8220;I don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite acknowledging Bitcoin&#8217;s rise, Munger begrudgingly referred to it as an &#8220;artificial substitute for gold,&#8221; comparing it to an unattainable pursuit. Even in the face of Bitcoin&#8217;s success, he maintained a critical perspective, stating during a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, &#8220;Of course, I hate the Bitcoin success.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passing of Charlie Munger marks a significant moment in financial history, triggering reflections on his outspoken views that have fueled extensive discussions within the financial sector.</p>
