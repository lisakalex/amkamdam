										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of crypto and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) is a fast-paced environment with a steep learning curve. With thousands of people, projects, and social posts to keep up with, it can seem like a daunting task, particularly if you are new to crypto.</p><p>When we look for ways to stay on top of all that&#8217;s going on in the industry, there are a few core things we can do and use to ease our journey. For starters, you can use recognized wallets and marketplaces while simultaneously making most of the social media and crypto-specific websites to aid your success.</p><p>In this piece, I will be running through the best way to make the most of your crypto, including the best sources of information and the best way to spend your money, helping you get your journey off to the best start possible.</p><p>This guide assumes you are already invested in cryptocurrencies and are looking for ways to invest your money. If you have not started your adventure yet, please <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/"><u>click here</u></a> to view our other beginner guides.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/guide/85898/217742/untitled-5.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/85898/217742/responsive-images/untitled-5___media_library_original_1181_497.jpg 1181w, https://cimg.co/guide/85898/217742/responsive-images/untitled-5___media_library_original_900_379.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/85898/217742/responsive-images/untitled-5___media_library_original_720_303.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/85898/217742/responsive-images/untitled-5___media_library_original_600_253.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/85898/217742/responsive-images/untitled-5___media_library_original_300_126.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1181" class="content-img"></figure><p>So, you have purchased crypto through exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/"><u>Coinbase</u></a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/"><u>Binance</u></a> and are now ready to make the most of your newfound currencies. Scouring for the best projects and resources can help you on your quest &#8211; however, with so much contradicting information, it is too easy to become overwhelmed.</p><p>But do not fret! It is only natural to start wondering how to stay on top of it all, particularly when you notice the sheer number of tools and software that are available to you. With that, of course, you might also notice the enormous amount of creative scammers and hackers trying to get their hands on your money!</p><p>In this piece, we will be exploring four of the key avenues you can use to help set yourself up for the most enjoyable crypto experience possible, building your understanding and confidence of the markets at your disposal and what they can mean for both you and your budding portfolio.</p><h3>A recognized wallet</h3><p>To truly make the most of your investments and utilize your crypto beyond the exchanges, you will need a recognized crypto wallet to help you spend your money. Most of these &ldquo;hot&rdquo; wallets are browser extensions with accompanying apps and act as a safe place to store, and convert, your currencies from your PC or phone.</p><p>It is important, particularly when using a hot wallet that is always connected to the internet, to use a reputable, recognized wallet to best serve your needs and also protect your hard-earned fund. If you are after additional security, you should look to grab yourself a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin-cold-storage.htm">cold wallet</a> which, similar to a USB, is inaccessible once removed from your PC, keeping you safe from any online threats.</p><p>There are a number of these crypto wallets to choose from, but a few of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://metamask.io/"><u>Metamask</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://phantom.app/"><u>Phantom</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.coinbase.com/wallet"><u>Coinbase Wallet</u></a></li></ul><p>When it comes to hardware wallets, which can be used in tandem with your software wallet of choice, be sure to check out hardware wallets by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/">Trezor</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/">Ledger</a>.</p><h3>The best social media platforms</h3><p>With the world more connected than ever, it is imperative that you use networks to engage and interact with other enthusiasts and also find new projects. By using these platforms, you are able to engage in ways you never thought possible and may also be granted special access to mints and drops which you would not have otherwise known about!</p><p>Always use caution when on these social platforms as, amongst the honest users, there will also be scammers attempting to shill you a project with no potential or try to steal your funds. Never share your passwords, logins, or wallet details with strangers online, and always do your own due diligence!</p><p>There are a plethora of social networks now, but some of our favorites for cryptocurrencies and projects include:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://discord.com/"><u>Discord</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://twitter.com/home"><u>Twitter</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://telegram.org/"><u>Telegram</u></a></li></ul><p>Follow and join your favorite projects or groups on these platforms, make new friends, and be amongst the first to obtain the hottest information about existing and up-and-coming projects.&nbsp;</p><h3>A recognized marketplace</h3><p>Once you have decided that it is time to spend your crypto, it is important you know where to look! If you are too late to mint a fresh NFT or decide that you would like to jump into an existing project, then you need to know about the amazing NFT marketplaces at your disposal, each with thousands of projects and their own benefits.</p><p>When purchasing from these marketplaces, it is imperative that you always ensure you are on a legitimate website, as there are carbon copies of websites that prey on people granting access to their wallets. Always check the URL to make sure you are on the legitimate site.</p><p>There are too many NFT marketplaces to list here, but a few of our recommendations include:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://opensea.io/"><u>OpenSea</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rarible.com/"><u>Rarible</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://magiceden.io/"><u>MagicEden</u></a></li></ul><h3>Crypto specific websites</h3><p>Do not be afraid to be curious! With so much going on every day in the crypto world, use crypto-specific websites to your advantage to stay ahead of the game and in the know about what is going on. Use and engage with communities to help develop your understanding and enjoyment of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Despite their obvious perks, these websites are not immune to people trying to scam you; as with everything crypto, always do your own due diligence before spending your hard-earned money on a project!</p><p>So many websites are now available to help you, and some of the most useful, no matter your experience, include:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/"><u>Cryptonews</u></a> Guides</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://nftcalendar.io/"><u>NFT Calendar</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NFT/"><u>Reddit</u></a> NFT Subreddit</li></ul><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>The crypto world can seem like the wild west at times. With so much going on, it is easy to become overwhelmed with all of the projects being minted and people claiming to be offering you free money. It may seem like a daunting task looking for the right projects to invest in.</p><p>My advice is to be curious and ask questions, use social media to help build a rounded understanding of what is hot (and what is not!), do your own due diligence before investing, and only invest what you can afford to lose &#8211; particularly with the current volatility of the markets.</p><p>But the final, and most important rule, have fun! There are some amazing projects and communities out there just waiting for you to join; all you need to do is find them!</p>

Following the ever-expanding popularity of cryptocurrencies, it seems like they are set to be around for a long time to come! Some of those tokens come with an array of benefits for collectors, which makes them a valuable commodity as well as great collection pieces.</p><p>Obtaining those NFTs without minting them yourself requires the use of an NFT marketplace. Today, there are hundreds of these available, but <a href="https://opensea.io/"><u>OpenSea</u></a> was the world&#8217;s first marketplace. As a result, it is one of the most trusted and widely used online marketplaces that hosts a wide array of niche as well as mainstream NFT projects.</p><p>In this OpenSea review, we assess the OpenSea marketplace and give you an unbiased opinion of how it compares to the wealth of other NFT markets available to investors today.</p><h3>NFTs and OpenSea</h3><p>NFTs are quickly becoming a commodity of choice in the crypto world, and there are hundreds of thousands of them to choose from. Some are popular because they look amazing; others are known for their functionality and the fantastic communities that support them. The most common question that remains is: where to purchase these tokens? For many, their first port of call is OpenSea.</p><p>OpenSea is the original and arguably biggest NFT marketplace available online today. Established on December 20, 2017, during the very peak of the 2017 crypto craze, and based in New York, United States, it boasts a huge array of projects and pieces and is one of the most trusted marketplaces among both new and old NFT investors. But what exactly makes it so great?</p><p>In this OpenSea review, we explore the OpenSea website, its app, and its marketplace. Then, we share our final thoughts on OpenSea&#8217;s offering as a whole and how useful it might be for investors just like you.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with the OpenSea website.</p><h3>OpenSea Review: The Website</h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1600" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214417/opensea-2.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214417/responsive-images/opensea-2___media_library_original_1600_716.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214417/responsive-images/opensea-2___media_library_original_1200_537.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214417/responsive-images/opensea-2___media_library_original_900_402.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214417/responsive-images/opensea-2___media_library_original_720_322.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214417/responsive-images/opensea-2___media_library_original_600_268.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214417/responsive-images/opensea-2___media_library_original_300_134.jpg 300w"></figure><p>The <a href="https://opensea.io/"><u>OpenSea website</u></a> is the first port of call for NFT investors. Logging into OpenSea takes a matter of seconds, especially if you use a wallet like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-guide-how-to-set-up-get-started.htm">Metamask</a>. Once connected, you can begin purchasing artwork immediately.</p><p><i>Learn how to set up your OpenSea profile </i><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-use-opensea-the-easy-way-to-set-up-your-profile.htm"><i>here</i></a><i>.&nbsp;</i></p><p>The OpenSea marketplace offers a really simple, user-friendly interface that offers a wide range of filters and categories. This makes it perfect for beginners exploring NFTs for the first time, and also experienced collectors who know exactly what they are after!</p><p>Being the largest NFT marketplace available means that there is a huge range of projects and collections, and that takes time to explore. Once you have found the right piece for you, you can easily tailor your profile to display your collection to your friends.</p><h3>OpenSea Review: The App</h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="740" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214418/opensea-3.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214418/responsive-images/opensea-3___media_library_original_740_1600.jpg 740w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214418/responsive-images/opensea-3___media_library_original_720_1556.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214418/responsive-images/opensea-3___media_library_original_600_1297.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214418/responsive-images/opensea-3___media_library_original_300_648.jpg 300w"></figure><p>As is to be expected by an established marketplace, the OpenSea app is well streamlined and easy to navigate. Much like the website, it seamlessly connects with your wallet and then displays your full collection and profile.</p><p>The app homepage displays an array of collections, including notable drops, trending collections, and most active collections. This lets you stay up to date with what is hot on the app. The stats section takes this one step further, offering a range of detailed rankings and activity from across the marketplace.</p><p>As with many NFT marketplace apps, the search function can be a little slow and clunky at times. However, this can be forgiven if you consider the sheer number of projects being searched at any one time. Even though the quantity of search filters has been reduced on the app, there are still plenty available to help you find what you want.</p><h3>Purchasing an NFT through OpenSea</h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="719" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214419/opensea-4.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214419/responsive-images/opensea-4___media_library_original_719_683.jpg 719w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214419/responsive-images/opensea-4___media_library_original_600_569.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214419/responsive-images/opensea-4___media_library_original_300_284.jpg 300w"></figure><p>The platform makes finding, and purchasing, NFTs quick and easy across a variety of blockchains, most recently adding support for Solana NFTs.&nbsp;</p><p>Please check out our &ldquo;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-an-nft-on-opensea.htm"><i><u>How To Buy an NFT On OpenSea</u></i></a>&rdquo; guide to learn how to buy NFTs on OpenSea.</p><p>The first purchase is a long process that, although straightforward, adds friction to the customer experience. There are lots of pop-ups and contracts that need to be accepted, particularly if need to deposit ETH into Polygon as we did in the aforementioned guide.&nbsp;</p><p>It must be noted that not all of these steps have to be replicated after your first transaction, and future purchases are far quicker as a result. As such, be sure to not let this slightly longer process, which may seem intimidating to a beginner, deter you from using OpenSea in the future.</p><h3>OpenSea: Listing an NFT</h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="717" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214420/opensea-5.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214420/responsive-images/opensea-5___media_library_original_717_551.jpg 717w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214420/responsive-images/opensea-5___media_library_original_600_461.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/84629/214420/responsive-images/opensea-5___media_library_original_300_230.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Listing an NFT from your collection back onto the marketplace is a really simple, straightforward marketplace and, as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-list-an-nft-on-opensea.htm"><u>our listing guide</u></a> shows, can be done in just a few clicks.</p><p>Similarly, should you wish to remove the sale from the OpenSea marketplace, this can also be done just as quickly, meaning there is no problem with you floating your NFT and seeing what offers come in for it before making a decision.</p><p>Taking 2.5% of every transaction, OpenSea is slightly more expensive than some of its competitors. However, its massive user base, great reputation, and sheer scale of its marketplace mean that OpenSea can demand these fees. Nevertheless, this is definitely something to bear in mind when selling your pieces.</p><h3>OpenSea Review: Conclusion</h3><p>As NFTs grow in both value and popularity, it is vital that you are aware of different marketplaces and whether they are right for you. Being established and straightforward, OpenSea is a go-to for many NFT beginners and veterans, and rightly so.</p><p>It makes searching for, buying, and listing NFTs really simple, and in just a few clicks, you are up and running with very little hassle, building your portfolio and joining some amazing communities.</p><p>As discussed, OpenSea does have its downsides, namely its fees on the seller side. However, the pros outweigh the cons, and I would personally recommend OpenSea to anyone looking to dive into or expand their NFT knowledge and collection. There is a reason they have remained at the top for so long, and it looks set to continue into the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With cryptocurrencies exploding in popularity, the internet has become flooded with non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, each offering unique benefits for you, the collector. With so many different marketplaces at your disposal, it is important to know the pros and cons of each, allowing you to make the best choice for your needs.</p><p><a href="https://rarible.com/"><u>Rarible</u></a> is one of the largest and most widely used marketplaces on the internet today, with thousands of NFT projects available for investing. A veteran in the space, Rarible allows you to create a personal collection and become a part of some amazing communities in the process.</p><p>In this review, we will weigh the pros and cons of the Rarible NFT marketplace, giving you an unbiased assessment of how we think it stacks up against the multitude of NFT marketplaces appearing online today.</p><h3>Rarible Review (2022)</h3><p>Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Cool Cats are just three of the most sought-after NFT projects available to crypto enthusiasts, each with their own unique properties and communities that make them fun, popular, and profitable. To buy them, you need access to an NFT marketplace, but with hundreds of marketplaces available, where should you turn?</p><p>Many people choose Rarible &#8211; one of the most trusted NFT marketplaces for beginners and experts.</p><p>But, just how good is Rarible? Beyond being a trusted name, how easy is it to navigate? Does it have extortionate fees? What is the app like?</p><p>In this Rarible review, we will answer, impartially, all of these questions and more in order to determine just how useful Rarible is for the everyday investor. Finally, we&rsquo;ll conclude whether or not Rarible is a worthwhile marketplace for you as you venture through the wild world of NFTs!</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with Rarible&#8217;s website.</p><h3>Rarible Review: The Website</h3><p>The first port of call for many collectors, the <a href="https://rarible.com/"><u>Rarible website</u></a> offers a great starting point for any excited, budding collector. Logging into the marketplace using your wallet could not be simpler, and within just a couple of clicks, you can begin purchasing NFTs.</p><p>With a wide variety of search options and filters, the Rarible website makes searching for your ideal NFT really easy even across a range of blockchains. The platform is user-friendly and prides itself on being &ldquo;community-centric,&rdquo; which comes across in its site design.</p><p>This, combined with a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-use-rarible-the-easy-way-to-set-up-user-profile.htm"><u>customisable profile page</u></a>, makes Rarible ideal for both a seasoned NFT collector and a novice to the space, allowing users to seamlessly find their ideal NFTs piece, and display their tailored collection on their profile in just a few clicks.</p><h3>Rarible Review: The App</h3><p>Much like the website, Rarible&rsquo;s app is very slick; it immediately links to your wallet (should you have the corresponding app installed on your phone) and connects seamlessly to your web account, displaying your profile and collection in all its glory.</p><p>The homepage of the app allows you to showcase your NFTs for quick access to all those looking over your shoulder. You can seamlessly transition into the marketplace to search for your next pick-up with just one tap.</p><p>The search feature can sometimes take a few seconds to update. However, when you take into account the sheer number of projects it is searching for, this is easily forgiven. The only slight downside is the lack of search filters at your disposal when looking through the marketplace, so you can spend a lot of time trawling through projects should you not have a particular NFT in mind.</p><h3>Purchasing an NFT via Rarible</h3><p>As we have previously discussed in our guide, &ldquo;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-an-nft-on-rarible.htm"><i><u>How To Buy an NFT On Rarible</u></i></a>,&rdquo; the platform makes searching and purchasing NFTs across a range of blockchains really simple, particularly on their website.</p><p>As with most marketplaces, the first purchase is usually the most long-winded and typically the most confusing, as you need to accept multiple contracts via Metamask. However, this is not a slight on Rarible, whose team does their best to make the process very straightforward. Ultimately, it can be completed in just a few clicks.</p><p>With this in mind, it is clear that Rarible is a great entry point for a beginner keen to begin building an NFT collection without being bogged down with technical details, whilst avoiding a fresh NFT mint which may, or may not, be a scam.</p><h3>Rarible: Listing an NFT</h3><p>Similarly to making a purchase, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-list-an-nft-from-your-collection-on-rarible.htm"><u>listing an NFT</u></a> could not be simpler. With just a few clicks, you can relist your NFT on the Rarible marketplace, and with fees for the sale as low as 1%, the profits are nearly all yours &#8211; a clear win-win!</p><p>Likewise, delisting an NFT from Rarible is just as easy should you change your mind, and with no fees attached to ending a sale early. As such, there is no harm in testing the water to see if there is a market for your digital collectibles.</p><p>Rarible takes any potential complexity away from listing and delisting your NFTs on their marketplace. The low fees and ease of use make this the perfect place to sell your NFTs via live auction and buy-it-now features.</p><h3>Rarible Review: Conclusion</h3><p>In a world of confusing jargon and a huge variety of marketplaces, Rarible is a trusted source that makes buying, selling, and displaying NFTs easy no matter your experience levels within the space.</p><p>Of particular interest to beginners due to its straightforward interface and variety of projects, Rarible is the perfect marketplace to learn and hone your craft, build confidence and make purchases with your crypto safely along the way.</p><p>I personally would recommend Rarible as one of the first marketplaces anyone should try. Despite some minor app limitations around the search filters, I think it is a go-to marketplace for investors both new and experienced as they build, and display, their own collection of artwork.</p>

Once you have made your first purchase, the rest will be seamless.</p><p>In this guide, we will teach you how to explore the OpenSea marketplace, filter your search to find exactly what you want, and filter pull the trigger and make your first purchase.</p><h3>Purchasing Your NFT</h3><p>First, it is essential to make sure that you are on the authentic OpenSea site. There are many malicious copies of OpenSea set up by scammers that will try to gain access to your MetaMask when you log in using your wallet. Therefore, you must be vigilant and check your main search bar carefully to ensure that you and your funds are safe.</p><p>See below for what should be in your search bar on the authentic website. Bear in mind that scammers can make tiny changes to this link to catch you and redirect you to their site, so always check if this is correct.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3qo95-aXybhWNWnvPbhGTZGbOF1VbT4Vqy-7vQQWkzXViQGFIz26mQ5Bgbw7nzNGIUx2Ya5XYHKPT18lIrMiJsos2af8zVLY9GqqcrvAlEmIPlgmLt7A2YY106Vd8jyNQ4dzLcfmp5pUqy3Ixg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Once you are on the OpenSea website, you can either search for a specific project or explore the marketplace via the button to the right of the search bar. For this guide, we will explore the market as a whole, so I tap &ldquo;Explore.&rdquo;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GHHqIZGRgBHJ0WW-whT9SNYC8p6oLL2BTrcxHVCcMrDV4ogkAEzrTXTKVSYzKIui5It_grfyWmvF_EexPHuFYsf2MIy2PfTr8HU0FfKH1AZrlB5H_l6ZJVd9DEKRjrBH-lxKCAByohGT6H3njA" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Upon clicking this, you will be met with a drop-down menu offering a wide range of options. Again, if you know what you are after, then this is ideal. But being undecided, I want to explore, so I will click &ldquo;All NFTs&rdquo; to see everything.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KIdYXRpF7xJZ0DvhBfjlH7UQlSh2CSVREQ59J0Aenq3zqWnoMIjdZYkDFCTqW88Btu0jlS0bOfNp2cDU_KQI3Ao-fQJiLUEvtFycwdZOTM4AcALOF7y3NTlUpjFVBJxxHAsoUvxsuBThxpFw_g" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Upon clicking this, you will be redirected to their marketplace. Here, you will see a plethora of projects. Some will be uber-successful, commanding vast sums of money, but I want something more subtle for this guide. As such, I will use the filters down the right side of the page.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6uKr3iliNycNNDewIY2ZY41ptByoUgat-DOAgD2Hq_ET5ozsDwbU3Jz5zGHHJKa5ePv4oKabM9A-oKkndlnR3RYGMbi6dG8ESVDpvPAyovy3tgr0SmNXZx-Weu726ooyR-KTyovlxihM0zIhdg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>From these selections, I can break down the type of NFT I am after today. I want an NFT that I can buy now that is not too expensive and is on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-use-metamask-wallet-to-the-polygon-network.htm"><u>Polygon network to keep my fees low</u></a>.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ImLutBa4d9d1hG0XpoQaV52wi7mKTuZaRjVwt9N8sH9BoLRLgs5wOPLT75ZDJ0k5dCsgygmm3joI8AL-gK8E5IT2Ps5_u_mYAhyhm2xGySmh6kjZmMAQ5oT6nDhKN2KC8EUJhyW92m6ecdfOlw" data-srcset=""></figure><p>The page will automatically update as I fill this in, showing me NFTs that match my criteria.

However, they have not yet been reviewed by OpenSea as an authentic project. Without thousands of projects on their site, this does not mean that the NFT you are purchasing is part of a scam, as many projects can be authenticated after their mint. However, this is something to be aware of, particularly with cheaper pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Minting&rdquo; means converting data into a digital asset recorded on the blockchain. When the digital artwork is &ldquo;minted,&rdquo; it becomes an official verifiable digital commodity.</p><p>As a result, you may see this pop-up when making your purchase. If you are happy to proceed, read the pop-up and click the check box at the end to be redirected and continue your transaction.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/m5AxbM36FqWHq92rU9YBxGffvyPWlC0eT0X_YJgvJzxTZYEl1eu6qBbY0Gm2vTKHjKoBJ6ZxRxyXTdQyLrevKiFAMaDY3WCAfikOjVcwGkKNBVI5UHD5OAzGxljQzti7Rjr-0sZRFsd9-T0Iqg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Following this, you will be prompted to complete your purchase. Here, you will be presented with the cost of your NFT.</p><p>Check the box to confirm you agree to the Terms of Service to continue, which will, in turn, activate the &ldquo;Checkout&rdquo; button. Once this is illuminated, tap it to proceed.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yG4QhR7vqcXd607XbwHF5aCCeO8zXOy1Qn--wDn3iiTdNfh85yaTNpdzpbvmmHu8nmH4JKRQMa-42scuP3Wbin-9vX2cpVeRXGi8inPTCTOoydNL_WWWxY1jKRi21D4uKnnA4NViJo2fjPj42Q" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Unlike <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-an-nft-on-rarible.htm">Rarible</a>, OpenSea uses the Ethereum Mainnet for its transactions even when you are purchasing an NFT from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/polygon">Polygon Network</a>. As a result, it is important to make sure you have enough of the correct currency on the right network.</p><p>If not, OpenSea will prompt you to deposit your Eth into Polygon. It will automatically fill in the amount you need to convert, so you can click &ldquo;Convert&rdquo; to proceed.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MB7z-XOy4nEiCxcM_5mFLleBJV09QXxXPVPFqHLbUTbaVoqhXvJ7ZVtaDwJjmKvZqqlLbhaoHK1Liab7DhzR-PanRHS-fscOSikx8yKRmrIkiscIEJA0nF21f0xy1IT16zxblHzBDIaEcOLAzg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>This will prompt a MetaMask pop-up, confirming the conversion and any costs you may accrue.

Therefore, it is important to know not only how to buy NFTs but also to sell them.</p><p>This short guide will break down, step by step, how to list NFTs from your collection on the Rarible marketplace.</p><p>This guide assumes you have already started purchasing NFTs through Rarible. If you have not yet begun this journey, please click here to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/nft/"><u>view our guides</u></a>.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aqALy1Hw0j-iuj5Cd1ian1reYd3ALVFLpgNKIZop4ntXKk__7afAnsWrrPbPduFEz9HQV0hGyAjvwMdvY5YGKsUFaYF-B_LGZ4Utt16rjYxS5rhbJO2p0_AcTgxT5PXcgy0LkRj7CMsZJMJ7eQ" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Now that you have begun to purchase NFTs, it is exciting to watch your collection grow and reap the benefits that being a part of certain projects may have, such as airdrops or access to exclusive events.</p><p>However, what can you do once you decide you no longer want a particular piece in your collection? Perhaps it has risen in value, and you want to take your profits, or you have just gone off the piece and no longer want it.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the reasoning is, listing an NFT for sale could not be easier, and in this guide, we will teach you how to list an item for sale on Rarible and also how to remove the listing should you change your mind.</p><h3>How to List Your Artwork for Sale</h3><p>To begin listing your NFTs for sale, head to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rarible.com/"><u>Rarible homepage</u></a> and click the coloured circle to the left of the moon symbol. This will produce a pop-up menu on the right-hand side of your screen &#8211; if you use the night mode setting, this moon will be replaced by an image of the sun.</p><p>Be aware of websites impersonating Rarible and make sure that you are definitely on the correct website before allowing any Metamask permissions on the site &#8211; otherwise you may be at risk of being hacked.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9y0FrbKBVa1zeTgBfdbb73ty45aJk-BIccsHcgc92ZQ_32u_GprE3Gr1MN_v4yenePk6ydV_0Gl5lxVyJ0tFS9Oh2SGH9hmL1Gn8ItSSovoFnq0qQqKEXv-glDKFlu6hega6RTprxBoRiOBHJA" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Once this menu has appeared, click the slightly greyed-out &ldquo;<i>View profile</i>&rdquo; underneath your username to be redirected to your profile page.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GNV1q0xJhepIg4wbuCnnm41OpQh_-NwvPOtrZb2oHpKE3oNVpQ8sKcY87Z_yTV7QRjLauWj0_9bbjUsWhMQPSQbf6KTKVYFlx2pg39G75GzKbr65jy7sHzKHFbyNlIF40uUR56cnE506MGib1g" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Here, you will be met with your profile page.
