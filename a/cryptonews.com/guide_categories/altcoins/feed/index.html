Phantom is one such wallet built on the Solana blockchain. It is available on a variety of browsers and is easy to use, thus allowing you to make the most of the low GAS &#8211; or transaction &#8211; fees on the Solana chain.</p><p>This short guide breaks down, step by step, how to set up a Phantom wallet on your Google Chrome browser and allow you to start making purchases using your SOL coins.</p><p><i>This guide assumes you have already purchased your first cryptocurrencies and are looking to take the next steps. However, if you have not and want some advice, </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/nft/"><i>click here</i></a><i> to read our guides and get started.</i></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1181" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219686/phantom-wallet-guide.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219686/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-guide___media_library_original_1181_497.jpg 1181w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219686/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-guide___media_library_original_900_379.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219686/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-guide___media_library_original_720_303.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219686/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-guide___media_library_original_600_253.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219686/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-guide___media_library_original_300_126.jpg 300w"></figure><h2>What Is Phantom Wallet?</h2><p>Purchasing and storing cryptocurrencies on an exchange such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/"><u>Coinbase</u></a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/"><u>Binance</u></a> might be the first step in most people&#8217;s crypto journey, but to take the next step and interact with NFT marketplaces with the ability to spend your crypto and acquire digital collectibles requires the use of a specific wallet.</p><p>There are many of these wallets available, some of which, like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-guide-how-to-set-up-get-started.htm">Metamask</a>, are all-encompassing. However, other wallets, such as Phantom, are chain-specific and only work with certain cryptocurrencies. Having a chain-specific wallet might come with exclusive benefits that only apply to its native currency &#8211; it can be significantly lower fees, convenience, or lucrative staking rewards. Such wallets can often be set up within minutes, and you can get started straight away!</p><p>For this guide, we will be setting up the Phantom wallet on a Google Chrome browser. You will learn how to download a Phantom wallet extension and set up a new account for your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana (SOL)</a> adventure, which will enable you to connect to various marketplaces and discover promising NFT projects.</p><p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p><h3>How To Get Phantom Wallet</h3><p>Phantom is available as a direct download from their own site &#8211; so head over to the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://phantom.app/"><u>Phantom website</u></a> to get started.</p><p>It is critical to ensure you are on the correct website. There are numerous copies and imitating scam sites that are set up to capture your credentials and steal your cryptocurrency. For your own protection, only download the Phantom wallet from its official, trusted website.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://phantom.app/">Click here to go to the official Phantom Wallet site.</a></p><p>Here, you will be greeted with a screen below where you must scroll down to find available browser extensions created by Phantom.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1600" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219694/how-to-get-phantom-wallet.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219694/responsive-images/how-to-get-phantom-wallet___media_library_original_1600_778.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219694/responsive-images/how-to-get-phantom-wallet___media_library_original_1200_583.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219694/responsive-images/how-to-get-phantom-wallet___media_library_original_900_437.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219694/responsive-images/how-to-get-phantom-wallet___media_library_original_720_350.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219694/responsive-images/how-to-get-phantom-wallet___media_library_original_600_291.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219694/responsive-images/how-to-get-phantom-wallet___media_library_original_300_145.jpg 300w"><figcaption>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://phantom.app/">https://phantom.app/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Once you are at the bottom of the page, you can select the appropriate browser for your download.</p><p>For this guide, I am downloading the Chrome extension. Therefore, I am clicking the grey &ldquo;Chrome&rdquo; button below the well-known Google Chrome logo.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="760" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219695/phantom-wallet-download.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219695/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-download___media_library_original_760_374.jpg 760w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219695/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-download___media_library_original_720_354.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219695/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-download___media_library_original_600_295.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/87328/219695/responsive-images/phantom-wallet-download___media_library_original_300_147.jpg 300w"><figcaption>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://phantom.app/">https://phantom.app/</a></figcaption></figure><p>If you were following my steps, you would then be redirected to the Chrome Web Store. Click &ldquo;Add to Chrome&rdquo; to begin the download.</p><p>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/</a></p><p>At the top of the page, you will receive an automated pop-up asking you to confirm this addition.</p><p>Click the &ldquo;Add extension&rdquo; button to be redirected, this time to the Phantom sign-up page.</p><p>As we are only setting up our account, we will click the purple &ldquo;Create a new wallet&rdquo; button to begin the signup.</p><p>You will then work your way through a short, four-step process to create your account. You will be prompted to start with the creation of your password.</p><p>As you type and confirm your password, you will see that its strength is displayed in the second box. Ensure this your password is as strong and random as possible. It will be your first line of defense against hackers on your device since there are no emails or passwords linked to your private Phantom account.</p><p>Once you are happy with your password, click to agree to the Terms of Service, and then tap &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; to carry on.</p><p>Your next step is to record and store your secret recovery phrase. This assortment of words, also known as your &ldquo;Seed phrase,&rdquo; is the only way to recover your account should you change your browser, computer, or simply forget your password.</p><p>As a result, it is important that you make a note of these words in the exact order they are presented. If you forget your password, this is the only means of accessing your Phantom wallet, so be sure your note is both legible and stored in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-to-protect-your-absolute-crypto-lifeline-seed-words-3565.htm"><u>secure place</u></a>.</p><p>Once you have done this, click the check box stating you have saved your secret recovery phrase and tap the now illuminated continue button.</p><p>Next, you will be told of a quick shortcut you can use to access your wallet at any time within your browser. Once you have memorized this, hit continue to progress and finalize your Phantom wallet setup.</p><p>At this point, you have now completed the setup, and you will receive two pop-ups. The first one is letting us know we have successfully signed up for and downloaded the Phantom Wallet.</p><p>The second one prompts us to add the extension to our toolbar for easy access in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Definitely worth doing!</p><h3>Closing Thoughts</h3><p>Phantom is an easy-to-use, industry-standard crypto wallet that allows you to make the most of the Solana (SOL) coins you have purchased. It allows you to quickly and easily complete blockchain transactions, including sending funds and completing purchases online.</p><p>Phantom, like Metamask and other competitors, acts as your wallet but also your login credentials for many NFT applications such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://magiceden.io/"><u>Magic Eden</u></a> game. This makes it an excellent place to store your digital, everyday-use funds online.</p><p>In my upcoming guides, I will cover how to transfer funds from exchanges into your Phantom wallet as well as how to link your wallet to marketplaces and begin to purchase NFTs on the Solana blockchain.</p>

With over 10,000 projects, selecting the right ones for your portfolio can seem like a thankless task as they each have different values, teams, significance, and properties.</p><p>When we look at it from an elementary point of view, crypto can be broken down into four rough categories, which broadly cover all of the current digital assets and their uses; cryptocurrency, stablecoins, tokens, and memecoins.</p><p>This guide breaks down each of these classes and their benefits, allowing you to create the best possible portfolio for your needs and goals.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tan3VA2yvQcg97I17wWz0qxQ9zI_bC9JSVYf5v9d3GuaLOHrfqTU6Sc6WnSSV67g1_h0tKB6PCknoV3Zd8yBWbA57ZjmqKQUb0fuuA5mBd3Fuc5VRGZml81ViMX5mD4XdrqYry_TJlojQwkWzg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>So, you signed up to a crypto exchange such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.coinbase.com/"><u>Coinbase</u></a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.binance.com/"><u>Binance</u></a> and laid your eyes upon the thousands of currencies available to you at a wide range of price points.</p><p>Now, each of these coins looks appealing, and they are only listed because of their utilities, right? Not entirely &#8211; there are four broad categories that most, if not all, currencies fall into as a result of their properties.</p><p>Let&#8217;s explore these categories, why these currencies are useful, and what this means for you as an investor looking to build and grow your crypto portfolio moving forward.</p><h3>Currencies</h3><p>Cryptocurrencies are the ones that spring to mind first. Currencies like bitcoin and ethereum are built onto their own native blockchain and were designed to enable faster, more secure exchange of value over the internet.</p><p>These are a staple part of a portfolio as they have a proven track record as a store of value, with the price of these currencies skyrocketing from fractions of cents, to hundreds and, in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> cases, thousands of dollars.</p><p>These currencies are suitable for the everyday investor as they act as both an investment and a viable currency. Ethereum and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> are hugely popular with NFT projects and marketplaces, allowing you to buy, sell and trade seamlessly.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9-8qAX_S2cj3OUKgyB7H1LIoWRYklgFdee8sDQgXiU4dW6Zmmnqx3_W0X_YzMStglN5YrV9gNzzBwag_4HswYwZgSLbajo37Dr_IbAT9sOks9f9uGsKed-ADE1We5nwOTnY6nkoTBo4K7on3Hg" data-srcset=""></figure><h3>Stablecoins</h3><p>Stablecoins, as the name suggests, are much more stable than some of the more prominent cryptocurrencies as they are pegged to, and backed by, more traditional reserves such as a FIAT currency, gold, and cash equivalents.</p><p>As a result, coins such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/"><u>Tether (USDT)</u></a> are not subject to the same, sometimes violent, price swings that still impact some of the largest cryptocurrencies, often making these a safe haven for investors who want to avoid a withdrawal during times of uncertainty.</p><p>If you are looking to make money through cryptocurrencies, you would be better off avoiding stablecoins as they are best suited for digital transactions and being a bridge between FIAT and digital currencies.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MtpV4bnbK8q2Zs98cIhRvg4a8pyGWDmDpJvNSP8CBOBPscHaMDoNRgs8zu_NK000iyu2BTF1KrMYEteDzMshT-YcRzLpekD7Bdo0rbrY_B0YFjpt_FvVuSQbqsX-vLaYYwchOEV6O2ODGH6ASg" data-srcset=""></figure><h3>Native Project Coins</h3><p>These projects are where you will find hundreds of tokens. These currencies allow individuals access to specific projects and have unique properties depending on their value.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.cryptonews.com/coins/chiliz-chz"><u>Chiliz</u></a> (CHZ, see central logo below), for example, is native to Socios.com (see my other <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-socioscom.htm"><u>guides</u></a>) and allows you to purchase fan tokens for your favourite teams for exclusive opportunities unavailable to those without the tokens. Without the initial purchase of CHZ, you cannot engage with the platform.</p><p>As a result, these currencies are essential if you are looking to engage with new or existing projects and are looking to go beyond just investing your money. If you do your due diligence, these can be amazing tokens to hold and can grow in value if the project takes off, but be sure to do your research when investing in projects as people are looking to rug pull these tokens, leaving you with a worthless token!</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4vBhhffb2JBmG_ZxuJr15Nw1BfCfOGXuNSrwBAhH6huL-UPhSEVKlxwQAgzU62RIuN1fmMJipoVi5_GIi-oulD8GexftnjKrelf1h8x28i1gL74-QpFa89woih1JhZveGSZhyWnA-6D_OBmGrg" data-srcset=""></figure><h3>Meme Coins</h3><p>Possibly the riskiest of the investments, these coins are subject to the wildest price swings possible, sometimes fluctuating by hundreds of percent in short spaces of time; they have no intrinsic value beyond the community behind them, usually found in places like Discord and Reddit.</p><p>With an infinite supply of coins, currencies such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/"><u>DOGE</u></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/shib-shiba-inu/"><u>SHIB</u></a> may never hit massive highs, but if you are an experienced investor, you can make some good money with timely buys and sells. However, if you saw the recent Squid Coin news, you will know these are not immune from a rug pull, where the currency&#8217;s value quickly plummets to zero!</p><p>Although not for the faint of heart, there is no reason meme coins cannot be a part of your portfolio. However, it is not recommended to make them the <i>bulk </i>of your portfolio due to the lack of stability and applicability beyond the exchange you purchase them from.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BTNDMxMCKq5X8TGixy2W2OrYPIyhjyhCCRxQA7T7bHz3bm8oky5_c8vug5fmBqIvLN1JASWVyfBdMpqNOvmWHfpnZw0pKAotHKDSQ71-3Afj-j0yIy1PflXk57q4Bs0w3l2oknGrohBRJk_7tA" data-srcset=""></figure><h3>Closing Thoughts</h3><p>Cryptocurrencies can be fun and useful when used safely, and they can also be used to invest and trade, allowing you to make good money along the way. This guide has broken down into very broad terms the different coin types and what they may mean for you.</p><p>You will likely come across all of these classes on your crypto journey, and it is essential to know their properties before jumping in, understanding what currencies allow you what access.</p><p>If you are after the coins that offer the broadest uses, then traditional cryptocurrencies may be the best for you. If you are after stability, then, as the name suggests, stablecoins are a staple of your portfolio. To engage with projects, you will need some of their native tokens, and if you want to be a part of a community and are happy with a bit of risk, then meme coins are for you.</p><p>Be sure to follow our guides throughout your adventure; we can help you enjoy crypto every step. As with every investment, crypto can go both up and down. Because of this, be sure to do your due diligence before making any investments and only use reputable brokers that you trust when exchanging currencies.</p>

The project addresses the issues of scalability that plague most blockchain-based solutions nowadays and claims to have a throughput of more than 50,000 TPS. A significant factor making this possible is its consensus algorithm, Proof of History, which allows for more efficiency within the network.</p><p>The SOL token is Solana&rsquo;s native currency that can be used to perform micropayments or to facilitate on-chain programs and/or validating their outputs.

In this guide, we will cover five possibilities; each of these has its own strengths that may work for some traders, but less for others, and vice versa. What is more than likely, however, is that this list will help you find where to buy SOL with low fees and high liquidity.</p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60b/81ff1ee3ef.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60b/81ff1ee3ef.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60b/81ff1ee3ef.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60b/81ff1ee3ef.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60b/81ff1ee3ef.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60b/81ff1ee3ef.png 1880w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p><b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance</a></b>. As the cryptocurrency exchange with the highest 24-hour trading volume, Binance is one of the most popular platforms currently in existence. Most of the SOL 24-hour trading volume also stems from Binance: the USDT pair alone makes up for almost a third of all daily trades, and with the other trading pairs added onto this&mdash;like BTC, BUSD, and BNB&mdash;the exchange is plainly the most popular one for this asset. This is also owed to the fact that they charge very low fees, have near global coverage, offer purchases with a wide range of fiat currencies, and boast a professional trading interface that even newcomers can get the hang of pretty quickly. </p>

Traders can choose whether they want to purchase SOL with fiat or cryptocurrencies that include stablecoins like USDT, which are usually the most popular choice. The platform is very easy to use and has quite low fees that are discounted even further with higher trading volumes within one month. On the other hand, this comes with a waiting time of 6-8 weeks for your KYC process to complete&mdash;but once this is satisfactorily done, you will gain access to an excellent platform for all your investing needs. </p>

The platform wants to go as far as to become a decentralized World Wide Web, as well as a complete operating system that would simplify and streamline the creation and deployment of decentralized applications (dapps). As far as existing smart contract platforms go, TRON wants to position itself as the most lightweight option on the market, as it has some compatibility with others, along with lower development costs with more transactions per second.</p><p>The TRON token, with the TRX ticker, is the life force that runs the network. It can be used to share content on the network, to compensate content creators as an added incentive, but also locked in as the gateway to voting power. </p><h2 id="how-to-buy-tron-(trx)-in-2021:-a-list-of-exchanges">How to Buy TRON (TRX) in 2021: A List of Exchanges</h2><p>It is not very difficult to buy TRX in 2021&mdash;but it may be slightly complicated to navigate all the pros and cons of each exchange before you settle on one. This is why we assembled this list with five reputable exchanges, ranging in skill sets needed to navigate each, as well as other considerations&mdash;like geographical availability and whether it is privacy-oriented.</p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60b/49166d409a.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60b/49166d409a.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60b/49166d409a.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60b/49166d409a.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60b/49166d409a.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60b/49166d409a.png 1880w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p><b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/poloniex/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Poloniex</a></b>. Poloniex is one of the best choices for users who like their privacy: all you need to open an account is a valid email address, as the KYC process is completely optional (but preferable if you intend to trade large volumes). On the other hand, the exchange does not have any fiat options, meaning complete newcomers are better off purchasing their TRX elsewhere. But if you already have USDT, BTC, ETH, or any number of different altcoins, you can get the TRON coin here with very low fees compared to the industry average. </p>

Oracles are the intermediaries between blockchain, which cannot access real-time data by design, and the real world and any data a blockchain-based program and its smart contracts might need. This helps automate processes that would otherwise need external proof of performance to be provided manually.</p><p>Chainlink aims for blockchain-agnosticism, meaning that it wants to be supported by any kind of blockchain. Its decentralized nature is the way it reaches consensus: instead of needing to trust one or two oracles, it relies on the majority to provide the same data. This removes a single point of failure&mdash;which is a significant advantage of decentralization everywhere&mdash;but also helps weed out potentially malicious oracles, in case they consistently provide bad information. In other words, decentralization ensures reliability in a way that centralized third party APIs or apps cannot, in that it completely removes the need for any intermediary at all, while still letting Chainlink and the like serve a similar purpose.</p><h2 id="buying-link-in-2021:-everything-you-need-to-know">Buying LINK in 2021: Everything You Need to Know</h2><p>With its significant use case in the real world, it is no wonder that Chainlink&rsquo;s native token, LINK, is among the most popular coins currently in the market.

If you&rsquo;re looking for one of the most beginner friendly platforms in the market, Coinbase is your friend. Its LINK markets are also reasonably popular, meaning you won&rsquo;t struggle to have your order filled&mdash;and you can purchase it with a wide range of fiat currencies, as well as BTC and ETH. However, in comparison to the industry average, the fees on Coinbase are quite high, which is a tradeoff for its ease of use and intuitiveness. Also, its simplicity may be a deterrent for professional traders, as the platform does not offer trading charts that are second nature to many experienced enthusiasts. Still, if you&rsquo;re only now starting out, Coinbase is a good place to buy your first LINK.</p>

On Kraken, you can choose the level of complexity when you&rsquo;re initiating a trade&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t know what some terms mean, you don&rsquo;t have to fill out the spaces, or even include them; but if you do, it is useful to be able to tweak your order until you&rsquo;re completely satisfied by it.

Those who prefer privacy can trade through an unverified account, although for access to large withdrawals you will still have to go through KYC.

Their goal to advance the frontiers of crypto has spoken to a large fanbase. Like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, it is used in the creation of decentralized applications (dapps) and digital assets. </p><p>What makes Cardano so alluring is that each phase of the project has been peer-reviewed by researchers in order to bring about the best possible project according to its developers. The magnitude of the peer-reviewed research is impressive, so there is no doubt that each step of the Cardano road map has been carefully thought out.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/charles-hoskinson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Hoskinson</a>, one Co-Founder of Ethereum, leads the project. He had to part ways with Ethereum over a dispute whether the project should be nonprofit, which was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin&rsquo;s</a> view, or commercial, which was Hoskinsons view, founding Cardano from this rift. Hoskinson is always at the forefront of the crypto community with his continuous streams of content and marketing. This has gained him a passionate fanbase of cryptocurrency advocates.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="cardano" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0b64ef87f.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0b64ef87f.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/e0b64ef87f.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/e0b64ef87f.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/e0b64ef87f.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/e0b64ef87f.png 1304w"><figcaption>The Cardano Roadmap should please fans of literature.</figcaption></figure><p>The blockchain project has proven to be a hundred times faster than the current Ethereum network, which hasn&rsquo;t fixed the transaction speed issue of older blockchain networks. Cardano&rsquo;s gas fees also won&rsquo;t break the bank since the network isn&rsquo;t as clogged up as of right now. One of the aims of Cardano is to spread decentralized protocols to poor countries that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have access to them. The results of these ventures, in turn, may thrust this project far into the future and may find it a rival to Ethereum for years to come.</p><p>Indeed, 2021 has looked to be a good year for Cardano. With <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/revuto-raises-1-7m-usd-to-deliver-subscription-payments-on-c-10347.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projects springing up</a>, a roadmap that is nearing complete realization and continuously being one of the top projects in terms of market cap, Cardano should be on anyone&rsquo;s eye for investment opportunities and blockchain potential.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="daedalus-wallet-and-other-wallet-options">Daedalus Wallet and other Wallet options</h3><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="daedalus wallet cardano" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0ba9afc4e.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0ba9afc4e.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/e0ba9afc4e.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/e0ba9afc4e.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/e0ba9afc4e.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/e0ba9afc4e.png 1190w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Before reviewing how to buy Cardano and which exchanges to buy Cardano on, you should be aware of Cardano&#8217;s own <a href="https://daedaluswallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daedalus Wallet</a> to store your cryptocurrency. Depending on which pool you choose to stake in, you can receive up to 6% APY when staking your Cardano on a wallet, which could be ten times the amount that of a regular savings account at a traditional bank.</p><p>All you need to do is download the Daedalus Wallet, wait for your wallet to sync up with the network and choose staking pools. With this method, you&rsquo;re also running a full node on the Cardano network. Staking pools in that network means you&rsquo;re an active participant in the decisions that are happening in Cardano, instead of just leaving it on an exchange for purely trading purposes. One thing to note is that staking could fluctuate in the market in real time. For example, you may see your stake at 8% and then watch it drop to 4%.</p><p>Once you buy it on an exchange, you just have to go to the wallet section and find your receive address to input into the exchange when withdrawing your cryptocurrency. Also, the geometric pattern, perhaps representing a chain of blocks, a &lsquo;blockchain&rsquo; if you will, is where you&rsquo;ll find your staking options.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="cardano wallet" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0c01aae9c.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0c01aae9c.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/e0c01aae9c.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/e0c01aae9c.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/e0c01aae9c.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/e0c01aae9c.png 1119w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, putting some Cardano in a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor would help in diversifying the security risks of your asset, instead of just leaving it on an exchange or staking it on the Daedalus wallet. This will ensure that you are your own personal bank and are more in charge of your destiny, like the legacy ways of cryptocurrency storage. A hardware wallet is bare in functionality so that it is far less susceptible to hacks, making it a great place to store your crypto.</p><p>Although not recommended, you could just leave all your coins on an exchange. Exchanges are nowadays being audited and come with baseline security protocols, so they aren&rsquo;t the worst place to leave your crypto once you buy. But if you&rsquo;re looking to have a bigger impact in the direction of the Cardano network or want to use actual Cardano applications to store your cryptocurrency, or even just want a higher APY than what your exchange offers, you should check out the Cardano&rsquo;s own Daedalus wallet.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="how-to-buy-cardano-(ada)-on-exchanges">How to Buy Cardano (ADA) on Exchanges</h3><p>There are some exchanges out there that you will need to know how to do regular spot trading on a tradingview graph. If your exchange gives a way to buy ADA through your native currency, you usually have to go through some Know-Your-Customer (KYC) hoops, like giving your centralized bank details and identification.</p><p>Spot trading is the easiest way to buy crypto and is how most HODLers buy crypto. You are buying crypto at the price that the exchange gives you, which is usually based on a price that the exchange had for the crypto on the day you are buying. For many exchanges, spot trading is the simple &lsquo;buy&rsquo; option.</p><figure class="center" style="max-width: 396px"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 396px, 100vw" alt="how to buy ada" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0c3e98478.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0c3e98478.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/e0c3e98478.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/e0c3e98478.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/e0c3e98478.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/e0c3e98478.png 396w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If spot trading isn&rsquo;t a simple buy option, you should learn a way to spot trade on the tradingview graph. Whichever exchange you sign up for, go to the trade section and pull up the graph. In the example exchange above, this is under Trade &gt; Spot Trading.</p><figure class="center" style="max-width: 511px"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 511px, 100vw" alt="how to get cardano ada" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0c6150342.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/e0c6150342.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/e0c6150342.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/e0c6150342.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/e0c6150342.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/e0c6150342.png 511w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In the example above, the trading pair is USDT / ADA.

And Kraken has that in spades.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can find the full review here.</a></p><h4 data-param="3" id="&lt;a-href=https://cryptonews.com/ext/kucoin/-target=_blank-rel=nofollow-noopener&gt;4.-kucoin&lt;/a&gt;"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kucoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">4. KuCoin</a></h4><p>Although <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kucoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">KuCoin</a> doesn&rsquo;t provide a direct fiat currency to trade for ADA, it has one of the highest volumes. KuCoin also has a simple onboarding system that doesn&rsquo;t need you to provide a bunch of Know-Your-Customer trading to begin trading crypto-to-crypto. If you want to buy fiat using Kucoin, however, you need to provide information. But the fact that this isn&rsquo;t forced onto you is a very big plus. This means that those New Yorkers or other highly regulated places can trade for ADA with KuCoin. They also have multiple wallets provided for you that you can just transfer crypto to and start trading. The only thing is that it doesn&rsquo;t provide a fiat-to-ADA direct pair, but the user interface is friendly enough that figuring out how to buy ADA through it with stablecoins like USDT and USDC shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/kucoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can find the full review here.</a></p><h4 data-param="3" id="&lt;a-href=https://cryptonews.com/ext/okex/-target=_blank-rel=nofollow-noopener&gt;5.-okex&lt;/a&gt;"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okex/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">5.

The interface is simple and neat, making it a professional way for you to use your crypto.

Its main task is to enable fast, feeless transactions between devices within the network, which will facilitate data and computing resources sharing, along with the immutable history of each participant. In its most advanced stage, IOTA wants to provide the payment settlement and data integrity layer for various IoT applications that can go as far as whole smart cities.</p><p>IOTA&rsquo;s main difference from other projects in the crypto sphere is that it does not rely on a blockchain: instead, they created their own distributed ledger technology called the Tangle. Tangle removes the need for miners and data-heavy blocks, addressing the issues of transaction fees and scalability that are blockchain&rsquo;s pervasive pain points. IOTA also wants to function as the foundation for a future machine-based economy with a focus on micropayments, which is why their lack of fees is especially important, as there is no way that participants would have to pay fees higher than the value of the transaction itself.</p><h2 id="buying-iota-(miota)-in-2021:-heres-how-to-get-started">Buying IOTA (MIOTA) in 2021: Here&rsquo;s How to Get Started</h2><p>IOTA&rsquo;s well-developed use case means its native token, MIOTA, is highly sought after. Luckily, in 2021, finding an exchange where you can trade the asset is not very difficult; on the other hand, choosing among them is not a walk in the park, either. This is why we have assembled a list of five cryptoasset platforms that offer MIOTA trading pairs. Each of them has its own strengths, meaning no matter what type of trader you are, you are likely to find a good fit for you on our list. Keep in mind that, while MIOTA is the name of the IOTA native token, many exchanges use the two interchangeably&mdash;it&rsquo;s the same coin, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry.</p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/d7e4681ef0.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/d7e4681ef0.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/d7e4681ef0.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/d7e4681ef0.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/d7e4681ef0.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/d7e4681ef0.jpg 1200w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p><b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance</a></b>. As the largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trading volume, it may not come as a surprise that Binance also boasts the most liquid MIOTA trading pairs in the market. You can trade MIOTA with USDT, BTC, BUSD, BNB, ETH, but also buy it with any of the many fiat options offered on the platform, all with competitively low fees. Geographical restrictions are few and far between: you are very likely to be able to access this exchange. The combination of their ease of use and their innovative approach means that traders of all experience levels can feel right at home here. </p>

Bitfinex, on the other hand, is not very accessible to crypto trading novices: the platform is almost exclusively geared towards veteran traders who can take advantage of all the features it offers. Part of this is also the fact that its account verification times are very long, even for highly regulated standards. But if this is your choice, here you can trade MIOTA against BTC and ETH, as well as fiat pairs like GBP, EUR, USD, and JPY. Trading fees on Bitfinex are low and get lower the higher your monthly trading volume gets. </p>

This exchange is a sort of middle ground between complete newcomer accessibility and a fully professional service. A drawback for beginners is that it does not take any fiat deposits, which means you will need to own crypto before embarking on a Gate.io trading journey. On the other hand, the exchange is not regulated either&mdash;this is an advantage for those looking to keep their identities private, but can be a source of worry for high profile traders. Still, with its low trades, it&rsquo;s a very good trading place for MIOTA: to buy the token, you will need to have either ETH or BTC. </p>

Bittrex has an excellent spread of available currencies with low fees, but its trading interface is not always the most intuitive. However, with at least some basic trading knowhow, this should not present an issue. It is also one of the safest exchanges in existence, having been founded by former security engineers. You will have to pass their KYC verification, though. You can trade the IOTA token with USDT and BTC, but also with USD if you prefer fiat methods, which can be topped up directly from your bank account (or even credit and debit cards!) </p>

They also share a co-founder: Jed McCaleb is part of both projects. Where Ripple is geared towards enterprise-level users, Stellar is looking to cater to everyone in simplifying remittances and cross-border payments through their native coin, Lumens (XLM). Users send their funds to so-called anchors which hold these, issuing XLM in return, while their virtual wallets elsewhere can instantly receive those funds in the form of XLM which are redeemable for fiat.</p><p>Lumens are also used to create user accounts and to pay for transaction fees, similar to a number of other blockchains. A significant difference is that the Stellar network has very low fees, as well as a low minimum balance of XLM 0.5 on your account. With the price of XLM hovering around USD 0.42 as of the time of writing, it is clear that the network has a steady use case in providing access to those who cannot use financial institutions, regardless of how much money they want to move, and without the prohibitive overhead and other fees that usually go with this.</p><h2 id="buying-stellar-in-2021:-what-you-need-to-know">Buying Stellar in 2021: What You Need to Know</h2><p>Buying Stellar Lumens in 2021 is simpler than ever before.

However, Poloniex doesn&rsquo;t have any fiat currencies, which means you will have to pre-purchase crypto before trading here! On the other hand, their fees are among the lowest in the market. It is well suited towards both veterans and newcomers, and you only need a valid email address to trade&mdash;no need to go through a KYC process unless you want to. </p>

Created to address the perceived problems of other cryptocurrencies, most notably pseudonymity, it forked from a similar coin called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bytecoin-bcn/">Bytecoin (BCN)</a> after the latter suffered some reputational hits. Taking Bytecoin&rsquo;s powerful privacy-oriented open-source application layer protocol, Monero also added ring signatures, ring confidential transactions (RCT), and stealth address technologies. All of these combined made for an almost perfectly anonymous and secure cryptocurrency.</p><p>Its coin, XMR, is highly sought after by anyone who wants to keep their identity secret beyond what other cryptocurrencies offer. However, Monero also keeps the transaction itself a secret&mdash;the amount and its destination are equally well-protected.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Litecoin has been deemed by many to be the silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold. &lsquo;Bitcoin-lite&rsquo; if you will. Indeed, much of Litecoin&rsquo;s architecture is&#8230;</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/764b011b75.jpeg" alt="how to mine litecoin ltc" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/764b011b75.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/764b011b75.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/764b011b75.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/764b011b75.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/764b011b75.jpeg 1200w" sizes="100vw"></p><p>Litecoin has been deemed by many to be the silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold. &lsquo;Bitcoin-lite&rsquo; if you will.</p><p>Indeed, much of Litecoin&rsquo;s architecture is similar to Bitcoin&rsquo;s architecture and has become influential to blockchain developers and crypto enthusiasts. It was created two years later than Bitcoin, making the technology for its creation slightly more advanced. Although much of Litecoin&rsquo;s codebase is taken from Bitcoin, Litecoin is faster than Bitcoin, with four times the transaction throughput. The blockchain also has four times the supply cap. It was never meant to usurp Bitcoin but to help blockchain technology grow.</p><p>Litecoin became prominent in 2013 for being able to be mined on a regular CPU. Although nowadays mining Litecoin is far more difficult because of the computational power needed and large companies invested in mining it now, Litecoin received widespread attention through mining for regular folks.</p><p>Bitcoin has even been influenced by Litecoin&rsquo;s developments as well. Litecoin was built on similar code, with the Lightning Network, a layer 2 solution to blockchain transactions, first being implemented on Litecoin. These developments have made their way into the Bitcoin network. It seems that these two will forever be tied together in crypto history Bitcoin big brother and Litecoin little brother.</p><p>Litecoin is very much a legacy blockchain network and one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies out there. As the Proof-of-Work mining model may soon be rendered obsolete, being able to mine it as an investor to help out the network and decentralization in general could be a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.</p><h3>What Is Cryptocurrency Mining?</h3><p>Cryptocurrencies, like gold and silver, are able to be mined. This sort of mining uses a device to solve algorithms, cryptographic hash puzzles of incredible complexity. This allows miners to create new blocks, or data where the network is recorded. Many of the older cryptocurrency networks, like Bitcoin and Litecoin, were built on this functionality. Miners act as auditors and verify a network&rsquo;s legitimacy. They are rewarded for this verification work with cryptocurrency tokens.</p><p>The computational work required to solve the algorithms is enormous. Though the climate change impact is often <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/is-bitcoin-really-a-climate-emergency-1f85e51687ab">exaggerated</a>, the Bitcoin network, which is the oldest technology, still requires more power than the entire country of Argentina. Still, it produces a far higher market value than Argentina. Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin only consumes 0.6% of the world&rsquo;s electricity. In comparison, air conditioning is 10% of the world&rsquo;s energy consumption!</p><p>Mining for Litecoin isn&rsquo;t as intense in terms of energy consumption as Bitcoin is, but you should be aware of its effects so you can keep tabs on your electricity bill.</p><p>The protocols coming out like Cardano and Polkadot will function with a Proof-of-Stake model. This is meant to handle many problems, such as energy consumption, of Proof-of-Work. Proof-of-Stake operates on mining power based on tokens a user owns. It doesn&rsquo;t need the large computational power of older generation blockchain mining.</p><p>When you mine Litecoin you are helping out the network. Many who do not have the rigs to efficiently mine Litecoin often do so in support of the network. Every algorithm your rig solves is one that others don&rsquo;t have to solve. So if you have a stake in Litecoin, mining it will increase its value overall and you&rsquo;re helping out the blockchain you&rsquo;re investing in.</p><p>Also, it&rsquo;s pretty cool to be a part of crypto history. Years from now, people might be talking about crypto mining as a legacy of crypto&rsquo;s beginnings.</p><h3>Hardware Requirements</h3><p>Depending on what your goals are, you&rsquo;re going to need specs that follow suit. If your goal is just to participate in mining, then your CPU is fine. But you won&rsquo;t be mining Litecoin directly with it.</p><p>This guide will mostly focus on mining for beginners and intermediates. You may earn a few cryptos along the way but don&rsquo;t expect to be super profitable unless you invest more resources and time into mining.</p><p>Think about it this way. It&rsquo;s just like mining gold. Gold miners have incredible resources in order to mine them. The market is now saturated with those who have incredible technological output to mine gold. You could just find gold randomly but those who churn out the massive profits have entire operations dedicated to them.</p><p>Yes, it is still somewhat profitable by using a string of GPUs or ASICs but don&rsquo;t expect a gold rush of coins to just fall onto your lap.</p><h3>Beginner Miners</h3><p>For beginner miners, you just need your laptop or desktop computer. It&rsquo;s recommended to have a decent graphics processing unit (GPU) at least, one that gamers and video editors use. If you&rsquo;re not looking to earn profit on what you mine, however, a regular PC will be able to mine fragments of Litecoin indirectly.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re only using a CPU, a central processing unit, be prepared to be unprofitable after electricity costs are factored in.</p><h3>Intermediate Miners</h3><p>For those who want to go a step further, buying an ASIC, or an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, can help you kickstart a personal mining operation. These gadgets are made just for mining. So if you&rsquo;re a bit more serious about using Litecoin to stack coins, then having one of these should probably be what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><h3>Advanced miners</h3><p>A whole rig of gaming GPUs or ASICs to whole warehouses full of them, advanced miners are the ones who mean some serious business. The investment on these are massive, and can be tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of hardware. These GPU and ASIC mining rigs are multiple thousand-dollar graphics cards or ASIC mining rigs used together to effectively mine cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The more processing power you have on your computers, the higher likelihood that your computer will solve those cryptographic puzzles, leading to more profits. This is why GPUs are recommended over just CPUs, since they are much more powerful and able to tackle video editing projects and higher end gaming.</p><p>For GPUs, it would be nice to have something at least as powerful as the RTX 2060 series and beyond or an AMD model of similar GPU power. ASIC&rsquo;s, while convenient, are usually only good for mining specific cryptocurrencies. Buying several powerful graphics cards and putting them to use will more likely give you the Mh/s, or million hashes per second, to mine.</p><h3>What You Need To Know Before Mining</h3><p>When mining Litecoin, we&rsquo;ll mostly focus on the beginner and intermediate&rsquo;s way to mine.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to be an advanced miner, it&rsquo;s highly recommended that you consult or hire an electrician in order to fully know what your hardware is capable of and the electrical output that will result from it. This is so that you know if your system is properly set up, what your electricity costs should be and have the knowledge needed for maintenance.</p><p>Before we get into mining Litecoin, a word about Cloud Mining. Cloud mining is when a user rents cloud computing software without having to download it directly. It is best to avoid Cloud Mining as the services aren&rsquo;t profitable for now. You might as well buy the crypto yourself on an exchange and hold if your goal is to make long term profit. However, if you really want to dabble in it, Genesis Mining and Hashflare do provide some reputable services. Factoring costs, don&rsquo;t expect to be profitable until the technology improves.</p><h3>Litecoin Wallet</h3><p>Where your wallet address is is where you&rsquo;ll be paid for your mining work.<br>Using the Litecoin Wallet has its perks. Through Litecoin Core, you are running your own full node on the Litecoin network. Although you can use any wallet&rsquo;s receive address to mine, it might be good to use, if only to be directly part of the network. Plus, you would be directly downloading it from Charles Lee&rsquo;s (the founder of Litecoin) Foundation.</p><p>Of course, if you have your own wallet where all of your coins are stored, then that&rsquo;s fully acceptable to use as well.</p><p>1.

You can copy and paste that</p><h3>Recommended Mining Strategy</h3><p>Again, to preface, the Litecoin network has become saturated over the years. Of course, it is still easier to mine than Bitcoin. The increase in price during a bull run might actually make it worthwhile to mine. However, to know all the costs for advanced miners, you should consult an electrician to know the cost and energy of what you&rsquo;re putting in along with the potential profits that you&rsquo;ll have and the exact wattage and energy consumption you&rsquo;ll be charged. Advanced mining with multiple GPUs and ASICs isn&rsquo;t as easy as plug and play.</p><p>What we will mainly focus on are the recommended and beginner ways to mine Litecoin. One is through a pool. Solo mining is just not feasible, unless you have somehow struck crypto gold and can afford a whole team who can support you building a whole mining operation. Hashing out a block by yourself is incredibly unlikely.</p><p>The absolute beginner way, with not as much upfront investment, is using a program like unMineable. You won&rsquo;t be directly mining Litecoin. Instead, you&rsquo;re mining other crypto which will be automatically converted into Litecoin, saving you from having to convert it yourself. Although this method is not as profitable as having an ASIC, you are, if anything, participating in mining.</p><p><strong>1. Recommended Way with Pool Mining and ASIC</strong></p><p><i>(Disclaimer: Not financial advice and you may not be profitable. The only possible way to be profitable is with an ASIC and even if you choose to go with an ASIC, you should take your financial situation into account. Using this method with a GPU is possible, but Litecoin now needs more hashing power to solve algorithms, unlike the early days).</i></p><p>That being said, the best way to mine Litecoin is still through an ASIC. You can use a GPU to get decent results. However, an ASIC for Litecoin specifically, already has customizations that suit the blockchain. The one you want to look for is the Antminer L3++ as those have much of the recommended specifications needed. The problem with looking out for this ASIC, however, is that you might have a rough time finding quality ASIC miners. For example, they used to sell for a few hundred dollars. Nowadays, they sell out in the thousands of dollars. There is a world where you can grab one of these on a website for around $500 but you should carefully vet the person you buy it from. And remember, an ASIC&rsquo;s purpose is only mine cryptocurrencies. This means that you might find them but might also have a hard time reselling them.</p><p>If you are willing to commit and hold onto the coins, it could still be profitable, especially if Litecoin continues to go up in value over the next few years. Since it is a legacy network and it has a fixed supply, the price could end up being really high.</p><p>Whichever ASIC miner you end up choosing, if you end up doing this, each comes with their own mining software.</p><p>You will need to choose your mining pool afterwards. Unless you have a warehouse full of GPUs and ASICs, you&rsquo;ll need a mining pool. The one that has been around since the early days is litecoinpool.org, which even has the option of you giving a donation to the <a href="https://litecoin-foundation.org/">Litecoin Foundation.</a></p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Litecoin Foundation" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/7669ba99ea.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/7669ba99ea.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/7669ba99ea.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/7669ba99ea.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/7669ba99ea.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/7669ba99ea.png 662w"></p><p>Create a username and password as well as input your email. The platform greatly discourages the use of a CPU and GPU, saying over several steps of the process that it won&rsquo;t be profitable. There is a process that has you use a batch file for an old 2012 protocol but it seems to be dysfunctional nowadays. The protocol for GPU mining on litecoinpool.org is discouraged and may not work unless you heavily configure it.</p><p>It is a bit humorous that, in their own words, it is &lsquo;pointless&rsquo; to mine with GPU.</p><p>Depending on which ASIC you choose to mine with, you will choose them in the <strong>Main Hardware</strong> drop down section. All of these configurations may differ so it&rsquo;s best to read everything on the website to see what configuration works best with your ASIC.</p><p>After you&rsquo;re done with your personal configuration, be sure to input your wallet address or you won&rsquo;t be receiving any of your mined crypto.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="litecoin mining" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/766c951774.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/766c951774.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/766c951774.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/766c951774.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/766c951774.png 900w"></p><p><strong>2. Indirectly Mining Litecoin Through unMineable</strong></p><p>Although there are many ways to indirectly mine Litecoin, this is one of the easiest.</p><p>1. First, go to <a href="https://www.unmineable.com/">unMineable.com</a>. You&rsquo;ll want to click on the unMineable button at the top.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="unminable mine litecoin" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/7671b3c9ec.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/7671b3c9ec.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/7671b3c9ec.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/7671b3c9ec.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/7671b3c9ec.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/7671b3c9ec.png 1180w"></p><p>2. Scroll down until you see the Litecoin button and click. This will make it so that what you mine is converted into Litecoin.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="litecoin mining" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/767416572b.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/767416572b.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/767416572b.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/767416572b.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/767416572b.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/767416572b.png 436w"></p><p>3. Click the Download button at the top. Afterwards, you can click the big green download button. Alternatively, you can right click it and hit Save link as&hellip; in order to put it in a folder of your choice. Like a lot of mining software online, your browser might detect it as a virus. Either switch to another browser to download it or grant your browser permission to download it.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="unmineable" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/7676b3a940.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/7676b3a940.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/7676b3a940.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/7676b3a940.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/7676b3a940.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/7676b3a940.png 1124w"></p><p>4. From here, you want to unzip the folder. 7-zip will do the trick if you don&rsquo;t have the software to unzip files. Right click the application and unzip it to a location of your choosing with Extract here or Extract files.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="litecoin miner setup" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/767a6454e1.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/767a6454e1.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/767a6454e1.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/767a6454e1.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/767a6454e1.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/767a6454e1.png 964w"></p><p>5. After unzipping the software, you want to run unMineable as administrator. Also, if you run into any problems, make sure that your firewall or anti-virus aren&rsquo;t blocking the software and allow unMineable to open, which can be done through your control panel.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="litecoin mining firewall" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/767ceed550.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/767ceed550.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/767ceed550.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/767ceed550.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/767ceed550.png 900w"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="litecoin ltc" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/767f981e6a.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/767f981e6a.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/767f981e6a.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/767f981e6a.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/767f981e6a.png 900w"></p><p>6. You&rsquo;ll be met with the unMineable app. Simply click continue. Next, you&rsquo;ll be met with the mining software you need to get started, which is PhoenixMiner in this case for GPU downloads. If you&rsquo;re using CPU, you&rsquo;ll have to download <a href="https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig">xmRig</a>. Warning: Make sure to only download xmRig and PhoenixMiner from GitHub. If you download from anywhere else, you may be downloading potentially malicious programs. GitHub is the main trusted home for open source software.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="unmineable continue" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/7682d0c9fa.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/7682d0c9fa.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/7682d0c9fa.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/7682d0c9fa.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/7682d0c9fa.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/7682d0c9fa.png 396w"></p><p>7. To find the right program, simply check what operating system you&rsquo;re using and match that with the download. If you&rsquo;re using Windows, click Windows. If you&rsquo;re using Linux, click Linux. You will be using PhoenixMiner if you have a GPU and xmRig for CPU. Note that a Mac option exists for the CPU on xmRig. Macs usually do not come with GPUs, so mining with them is unprofitable.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="phonenix miner setup" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/76862594f1.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/76862594f1.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/76862594f1.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/76862594f1.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/76862594f1.png 900w"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="phoenix miner 2" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/768736a702.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/768736a702.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/768736a702.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/768736a702.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/768736a702.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/768736a702.png 358w"></p><p>8. Like when you downloaded unMineable, extract these files and go back to unMineable. Click on the folder icon and find the .exe files that correspond with your operating system and GPU or CPU.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="how to mine litecoin" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/768c41cb19.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/768c41cb19.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/768c41cb19.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/768c41cb19.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/768c41cb19.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/768c41cb19.png 412w"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="phonenixminer" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/768e74ed0c.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/768e74ed0c.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/768e74ed0c.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/768e74ed0c.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/768e74ed0c.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/768e74ed0c.png 233w"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="xmrig" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/769452fdfd.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/769452fdfd.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/769452fdfd.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/769452fdfd.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/769452fdfd.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/769452fdfd.png 236w"></p><p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble finding the .exe file, right click on the programs and find the properties section. You&rsquo;ll see what kind of file it is.</p><p>9. After you&rsquo;ve chosen your mining software, click next. You should find a space where you can copy and paste your wallet address. This is usually under the &lsquo;receive&rsquo; section of your wallet. If you&rsquo;re using the Lite Core Wallet, you&rsquo;ll find it in the receive section, like in the Wallet section of this article. You&rsquo;ll find it under the QR Code. Whether you&rsquo;re using a software wallet, exchange wallet, or Dogecoin Core wallet, copy and paste that into your unMineable address.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="litecoin ltc" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/76984a9e98.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/76984a9e98.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/76984a9e98.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/76984a9e98.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/76984a9e98.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/76984a9e98.png 399w"></p><p>10. Finally, click start.</p><p>After that, you should be seeing the Hashrate being displayed. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not mining.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="hashrate" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/769b283c88.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60a/769b283c88.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60a/769b283c88.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60a/769b283c88.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60a/769b283c88.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60a/769b283c88.png 365w"></p><p>If your application doesn&rsquo;t work, try using an older version of PhoenixMiner or xmRig. The updated version might not have been added. Also, make sure you&rsquo;ve allowed permissions on your Firewall and anti-virus as well as run unMineable on administrator. If you still don&rsquo;t see a solution to your problem, the support page should help you find what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p>Awesome, you&rsquo;re now mining.</p>
