										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polygon Network and its MATIC token are two building blocks of the Polygon Layer-2 scaling solution. Launched as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/matic-matic-network/">Matic Network</a> and rebranded as Polygon, the network is designed to bring instant and scalable blockchain transactions paired with easier everyday payments and lower fees.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5ce/6a28ab05f5.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5ce/6a28ab05f5.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5ce/6a28ab05f5.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5ce/6a28ab05f5.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5ce/6a28ab05f5.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5ce/6a28ab05f5.jpg 1000w" sizes="100vw"></figure><h2>What Is Polygon Network?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Polygon has made headlines based on its promise of delivering simpler interaction between users and decentralized financial applications and ecosystems. Self-described as a Layer 2 scaling solution (meaning that it does not seek to upgrade the basic blockchain layer), Polygon is all about reducing the complexity of this interaction which is identified as bringing down some crypto-based projects.</p><p>To achieve this, Polygon was built as a decentralized platform running on a customized iteration of the <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-short-history-of-plasma-framework-what-it-is-where-its-going-16920d0376a">Plasma framework,</a> which is seen as the solution tasked with bringing massive scaling capability to Ethereum. As proposed by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a>, this framework is supposed to allow for the easier execution of scalable and autonomous smart contracts, thus allowing for the creation of globally available decentralized financial applications on a single foundational blockchain. It will focus on the applications with which there is no need to record each transaction on a blockchain, such as small-scale daily purchases. To this mix, Polygon added the implementation of sidechains and a network of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> validators to ensure better asset security.</p><h2>What Is Polygon Trying To Achieve?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The Polygon Network comes packed with features that its developers promote as solutions to the prominent issues faced by contemporary crypto technologies.</p><p><strong>Polygon seeks to stimulate mass adoption by resolving problems with scalability</strong>. These issues stem from the fact that blockchain ecosystems have a hard time keeping pace with the popularity of decentralized apps, particularly in terms of scaling with the existing demand. Based on the projections presented in the Matic Network&#8217;s <a href="https://whitepaper.matic.network/#htf">whitepaper</a>, this platform will be able to achieve theoretical speeds of up to 65 000 transactions per second on a single side chain, combined with the block confirmation times of less than 2 seconds.</p><p>At the same time, the platform features a decentralized Plasma operator system, with finality taking place on the main chain. In addition to this, the Network developers promise an easy addition of new horizontal side chains to support even more transactions on the basic Polygon Chain. Based on this, the Network sees itself as helping not only payment systems but gaming networks and decentralized exchanges as well.</p><p><strong>Polygon promises to make slow transactions a thing of the past without compromising the principles of decentralization</strong>. Based on the Polygon team&#8217;s projections, the Network&#8217;s implementation of Proof-of-Stake and its staking mechanism is supposed to clear the obstacles standing in the way of achieving high transaction throughput. Current levels of blockchain transactions are described as suffering from poor performance and limited throughput, partially based on their reliance on PoW (Proof-of-Work) protocols with their limited block sizes and protracted block generation time.</p><p>Polygon&#8217;s PoS consensus model is described as being implemented in a manner that will not harm decentralization and security at the same time. The consensus is ensured by a select team of block producers appointed for each checkpoint (i.e. header block) by the stakers. These producers allow the system to create blocks in an allegedly fast manner. At the same time, decentralization is protected by delegating the PoS checkpoints to the main chain, which is, at least initially, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. The blocks are validated with the publishing of the periodical proofs of blocks created by the block producers, thus affirming the decentralized mode of operation of the Polygon Network.</p><ul><li><strong>Polygon promises to bring down transactions fees and improve user experience (UX)</strong>. In addition to purely technological considerations, some blockchain implementations are seen as preventing their mass adoption by applying high gas and similar fees. Considering that the payment of tokens in exchange for services or transactions is the backbone of many crypto projects&#8217; micro-economy, the Polygon team opted for the economy of scale as its solution. It features a dedicated layer on which the block producers handle a high number of transactions, thus keeping their costs down. The interoperability and smooth transition from the main chain to the Polygon chain should also improve the UX.</li><li><strong>Polygon supports asset interoperability and multiple micropayment channels compatible with other off-chain solutions</strong>. Assets on different sidechains are to achieve interoperability as long as they are provided for by the Polygon Network. As the Polygon Network runs on the state-based system of the <a href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>, it does not need an opening of the payment channels between two parties. Thus, a valid Ethereum address is treated as an equally valid Polygon address without requiring a customer to join the Polygon chain in order to be able to receive payments. All that is needed in this case is the possession of a Polygon wallet.</li></ul><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5ce/6a2936c816.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5ce/6a2936c816.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5ce/6a2936c816.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5ce/6a2936c816.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5ce/6a2936c816.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5ce/6a2936c816.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"></figure><h2><strong>How Does Polygon Network Operate?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Polygon&#8217;s technical architecture reflects what its developers defined as their priorities when designing their solution. For starters, it is supposed to reduce the waiting time associated with the transfer of ETH and ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum platform, particularly for the use cases involving small-time purchases and daily transactions (ranging anywhere from 14-20 seconds). High fees and peak time network clogging only exacerbate the issue, which Polygon hopes to conquer with the following approach:</p><ul><li>Users make a deposit featuring a crypto asset with the help of the Polygon contract on the main chain.</li><li>Deposited tokens need to be confirmed on the main chain.</li><li>Next, the tokens will be shown on the Polygon chain with the help of the Polygon Deposit bridge. These bridges function as components of the block producer nodes. They keep track of the root contract events on the main chain as well as any related token transfers. This is done with the help of the Polygon&#8217;s dedicated tool designated as Dagger. The Dagger helps the bridges detect deposits on the main chain to trigger an event on the Polygon chain and ensure that an appropriate address on the Polygon Network receives the deposit in question.</li><li>Once this is done, the users can send tokens in an almost instantaneous manner at reduced fees. At the same time, there is an option to withdraw tokens to the main chain by verifying proof of remaining tokens on the root contract i.e. the one deployed on the Ethereum chain. The same approach is supported for ERC-20 tokens and other fungible assets existing on the Ethereum blockchain.</li></ul><h2><strong>How Do Consensus and Checkpointing Work on Polygon?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Polygon&#8217;s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism is implemented on its checkpointing layer. This layer plays the role of the host of the PoS stakers. At the same time, the Polygon blockchain layer is the home of the block producers whose numbers are kept low to increase block generation times.</p><ul><li>Any user can decide to deposit/stake their Polygon tokens on the root contract in order to become a staker. In addition to validating transactions, the stakers make proposals regarding the deployment of checkpoints on the main chain. For every few blocks on the block layer, the stakers select a proposer to propose and create checkpoints. The underlying system is based on PoS, with 2/3 majority principle for the approval of a header block i.e. checkpoint.</li><li>Stakers appoint block producers among themselves by voting and task them with creating the Polygon blocks on the blockchain layer. The nomination is confirmed by the evidence of the existence of an adequate stake.</li><li>In addition to securing finality on the main chain, the checkpoints also play a role in withdrawals since they handle the proof-of-burn i.e. withdrawal of tokens. Users can prove the remaining tokens while the withdrawal itself incurs the gas fees.</li></ul><h2><strong>What Is the Role of the Polygon Token?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Polygon Token is a utility token on the Polygon Network. It is designed to perform several main roles:</p><ul><li>Being a unit of payment on the Network.</li><li>It is used as a means of settlement between users who take part in the operation of the Polygon ecosystem.</li><li>The token is hoped to become a medium of financial incentive for the users who want to make contributions to the Polygon Network and keep its ecosystem alive. They can, for example, provide computational resources and services related to proof publishing and block validation and earn Polygon tokens in exchange.</li><li>As said before, the staking of the tokens is required for participation in the Polygon Network&#8217;s consensus procedure. Stakers engaging in irregular activities will be punished by having their Polyogn tokens taken from them.</li></ul><p>The Polygon Network organized the token sale on the Binance Launchpad platform on April 24, 2019. The sale was the first one to follow a novel <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matic-network-wins-usd-5-million-in-binance-lottery-3753.htm">lottery format</a>. In early 2019, the Binance exchange announced a new system in which a user can claim up to five tickets to participate in the token sale, whereas the number of tickets depends on the amount of BNB held over a 20-day period. The effort raised some USD 5 million with the successful sale of 1.9 billion available tokens.</p><p>As of May 2019, the currency&#8217;s market cap stood at USD 56 million, with some 2 billion tokens being in circulation out of the planned 10 billion units. The token is available for trade on cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>, Hotbit, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/matic-network/#markets">others</a>. Acquired tokens can be stored in the <a href="https://matic.network/wallet/">official Polygon wallet</a>.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5ce/6a2a1d29db.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5ce/6a2a1d29db.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5ce/6a2a1d29db.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5ce/6a2a1d29db.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5ce/6a2a1d29db.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5ce/6a2a1d29db.jpeg 2600w" sizes="100vw"></figure><h2><strong>The Polygon Team and Partnerships</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Polygon boasts a small but dedicated team of professionals. Jaynti Kanani is a co-founder and the CEO of the project. His professional background includes software engineering and data science. Sandeep Nailwal is another co-founder and the COO of Polygon, while Anurag Arjun is the Chief Product Officer.</p><p>Polygon&#8217;s partners include Decentraland, a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum, Zebi, a provider of blockchain solutions for governments and enterprises, and MakerDao as a decentralized autonomous organization managing the DAI stable coin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>USD Coin is a stablecoin which is pegged to the US dollar. It is managed by Circle and Coinbase.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/6943286743.png" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/6943286743.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/6943286743.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/6943286743.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/6943286743.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/6943286743.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What is USD Coin?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>USD Coin (USDC) is a relatively fresh <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/stablecoin/">stablecoin </a>pegged to the US dollar. It was launched on September 26, 2018, in collaboration between Circle and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>. USDC is an alternative to other USD backed cryptocurrencies like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">Tether </a>(USDT) or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/trueusd/">TrueUSD </a>(TUSD).</p><p>In a nutshell, USD Coin is a service to tokenize US dollars and facilitate their use over the internet and public blockchains. Besides, USDC tokens can be changed back to USD at any time. The execution of issuing and redeeming USDC tokens is ensured with ERC-20 smart contract.</p><p>Bringing US dollars on the blockchain allows moving them anywhere in the world within minutes, and brings much-needed stability to cryptocurrencies. Also, it opens up new opportunities for trading, lending, risk-hedging and more.</p><h2>Who is the Team Behind The USD Coin?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>USD Coin is developed by the Centre consortium, a partnership between Circle and Coinbase. The technology and governing framework are developed by Centre, while Circle and Coinbase are the first commercial issuers of USDC.</p><p>Circle was founded in 2013 by the entrepreneurs Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville.</p><p>Circle is an official Money Transmitter, which makes the company an open financial book. Money Transmitters are US money service businesses that must comply with federal laws and regulations. Before the issuance of USDC, the equivalent amount of USD is with one of Circle’s accredited partners. Consequently, all USDC tokens are regulated, transparent and verifiable. Besides, Circle is known as the crypto startup backed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/usd-coin-circles-tether-2677.htm">Goldman Sachs</a>.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/694411af69.png" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/694411af69.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/694411af69.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/694411af69.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/694411af69.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/694411af69.png 1000w" sizes="100vw"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How Does USD Coin Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>USD Coins aren’t just being printed out of thin air. Circle guarantees that every USDC token is backed with a single US dollar. The process of turning US dollars into USDC tokens is called tokenization.</p><p>Tokenizing USD into USDC is a three-step process:</p><p>1) A user sends USD to the token issuer&#8217;s bank account.<br>2) The issuer uses USDC smart contract to create an equivalent amount of USDC.<br>3) The newly minted USDC are delivered to the user, while the substituted US dollars are held in reserve.</p><p>Redeeming USDC for USD is as easy as minting the token, except the process is reversed:</p><p>1) A user sends a request to the USDC issuer to redeem an equivalent amount of USD for USDC tokens.<br>2) The issuer sends a request to the USDC smart contract to exchange the tokens for USD and take an equivalent amount of tokens out of the circulation.<br>3) The issuer sends the requested amount of USD from its reserves back to the user’s bank account. The user receives the net amount equivalent to the one in USDC tokens, minus all incurred fees).</p><p>Unlike the most popular stablecoin Tether (USDT), creators of the USD Coin are obligated to provide full transparency and work with a range of financial institutions to maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency.</p><p>All USDC issuers are required to regularly report their USD holdings, which are then published by Grant Thornton LLP. All the monthly attestation reports can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency/index.html">here</a>.</p><h2>How to Use USDC</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>USD Coin (USDC) is a 1:1 representation of one US dollar on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s an ERC-20 token and can be used with every app which supports the standard.</p><p>To tokenize or redeem USDC with Circle, you need to register an account, verify your identity (KYC), and link a legitimate bank account. Circle USD platform allows users to perform four core actions:</p><ul><li>Tokenize USD;</li><li>Redeem USDC;</li><li>Transfer USDC out to ERC20 compatible Ethereum addresses;</li><li>Deposit USDC from external Ethereum wallet addresses.</li></ul><p>Circle USDC doesn’t charge users any fees for tokenizing and redeeming services, except there is a $50 commission for incorrect and rejected bank transfers. For Coinbase USDC operations, all the standard fees apply.</p><p>A minimum USDC redemption amount is 100 USDC. The tokens are processed on business days only, and the process can take up to 24 hours.</p><p>There’s no minimum tokenization amount, and the process can take up to 2 business days.</p><p>In general, stablecoins like USDC are used to:</p><ul><li>Short cryptocurrencies without cashing out and make it easier to buy cryptocurrencies in the future;</li><li>Avoid traditional financial instruments and institutions;</li><li>Avoid hyperinflation (for people living in countries like Venezuela or Turkey);</li><li>Send money instantly, globally, securely and at low cost;</li><li>Purchase items in various crypto dApps, exchanges, and blockchain-based games.</li></ul><h2>How is The USDC Coin Different From Other Stablecoins?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/69452db01a.png" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/69452db01a.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/69452db01a.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/69452db01a.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/69452db01a.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/69452db01a.png 1024w" sizes="100vw"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto stablecoins can be put into four categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Fiat-collateralized.</strong> These include all stablecoins pegged to reserved fiat value. All fiat-collateralized coins are centralized by design. <i>Examples: Tether (USDT); TrueUSD (TUSD); Gemini Dollar (GUSD); Paxos Standard Token (PAX); Digix Gold (DGX); USD Coin (USDC).</i></li><li><strong>Crypto-collateralized. </strong>These are stablecoins whose value is pegged to reserved crypto assets. <i>Examples: Makercoin (MKR &amp; DAI); Havven (nUSD &amp; HAV).</i></li><li><strong>Algorithmic non-collateralized.</strong> Software-based economic models that seek to provide price stability without any collateralized assets. <i>Example projects: Basis; Kowala; Fragments.</i></li><li><strong>Hybrid.</strong> Stablecoins which rely on a blend of the approaches listed above.<i>Example projects: Carbon.</i></li></ul><p>USD Coin falls into the first, fiat-collateralized coins category, and is a centralized stablecoin. In general, all the projects within the same category work in a similar fashion and have only minor differences. The more outstanding ones are Tether (USDT), known for refusing to conduct a genuinely transparent audit, and Digix Gold (DGX), whose value is pegged to gold.</p><p>The rest fiat-collateralized stablecoins release regular attestations and are backed by US dollars. The main differences between them revolve around their fee policies and different partner organizations, but the business model, for the most part, stays the same.</p><h2>Where Can You Get USD Coin?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>USD Coin (USDC) can be purchased in the following exchanges:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/"><strong>Binance </strong></a>(paired with BTC, BNB).</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/poloniex/"><strong>Poloniex </strong></a>(paired with BTC, ETH, XRP, BHC, STR, LTC, ZEC, XMR, DOGE).</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase-pro/"><strong>Coinbase Pro</strong></a> (paired with BTC, ETH).</li><li><strong>Coinbase </strong>(paired with</li><li><strong>CoinEx </strong>(paired with USDT).</li><li><strong>Coinsuper </strong>(paired with BTC, USD).</li><li><strong>OKEx </strong>(paired with BTC, USDT).</li><li><strong>CPDAX </strong>(paired with BTC).</li><li><strong>Hotbit </strong>(paired with USDT).</li><li><strong>Kucoin </strong>(paired with BTC, ETH, USDT).</li><li><strong>Korbit </strong>(paired with KRW).</li><li><strong>FCoin </strong>(paired with USDT).</li><li><strong>LATOKEN </strong>(paired with BTC, ETH).</li><li><strong>SouthXchange </strong>(paired with BSV, DASH).</li><li><strong>COSS </strong>(paired with BTC, ETH).</li><li><strong>Crex24 </strong>(paired with USD).</li></ul><p>Besides these exchange pairs, USDC can be turned to USD and vice versa at Coinbase.</p><h2>Where to Store USD Coin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>USDC is an ERC-20 token issued on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum </a>blockchain and can be stored in any Ethereum wallet. The most popular options are MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Mint or Jaxx wallets.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto industry is quickly moving away from simple price speculation and e-payments to building whole ecosystems for a decentralized way of living and working. With smart contracts having a proven track record of reliability and ease of use, many are opting for a more transparent and secure business model on various platforms. Avalanche offers exactly that: an easy to use platform that facilitates the creation of custom blockchains and decentralized applications in a fast and safe manner.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/62164/31235/1rszd.jpg"></figure><h3>What is Avalanche (AVAX)?&nbsp;</h3><p>Like so many other projects that are labelled the &ldquo;potential Ethereum killer&rdquo;, Avalanche is also a blockchain platform that lets users create their own blockchains with their own ecosystems, but also decentralized applications (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dapps/">dapps</a>) of all sorts. It calls itself &ldquo;blazingly fast, low cost, and eco-friendly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The Avalanche platform is made up of three separate blockchains. The first, called the Exchange Chain and shortened to X-Chain, lets people create and trade tokens, including AVAX. The Platform Chain (P-Chain) serves to coordinate transactions, but also to enable the creation of new blockchains. Finally, the Contract Chain (C-Chain) lets users create and trigger smart contracts. The three blockchains are interoperable, and this approach improves speed and scalability, all of which makes Avalanche a unique project in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Exchange Chain uses the Avalanche consensus protocol, the other two chains use a modified version of it, called the Snowman. They are an adaptation of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus protocol. To learn more about the technical side of how Avalanche works, you can read their whitepapers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.avalabs.org/whitepapers">here</a>. They offer detailed documents on different aspects of the platform, including their consensus protocols, token dynamics, a stablecoin design classification framework, and a whitepaper on the way the platform itself works.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm"><i>Read more: What is Proof-of-Stake?</i></a>&nbsp;</p><p>The idea behind Avalanche was born in May 2018, when a file called &ldquo;Snowflake to Avalanche: A Novel Metastable Consensus Protocol Family for Cryptocurrencies&rdquo; was shared on IPFS by a pseudonymous group of enthusiasts going by the name &ldquo;Team Rocket&rdquo;. The document outlined the fundamentals behind Avalanche, explaining how the family of consensus protocols works together to ensure security and trustlessness, while maintaining high throughput and scalability&mdash;something that has plagued the blockchain world ever since its inception.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/62164/31237/3rszd.jpg"></figure><p>The development of Avalanche was later led by a dedicated team of researchers from Cornell University, with professor Emin G&uuml;n Sirer at the head. He was assisted by two doctorate students, Maofan &ldquo;Ted&rdquo; Yin and Kevin Sekniqi. After completing the required research, they founded a startup company to develop the blockchain network, which was meant to meet the demands of the increasingly complex financial industry. In March, 2020, the AVA codebase (Developer Accelerator Program or AVA DAP) for the Avalanche consensus protocol became open-source and available to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>The team raised funds for the project through an initial coin offering (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/icos/">ICO</a>) that ended in July 2020, where they raised USD 42m. The mainnet launched in September 2020, along with the native AVAX token.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-invest-in-an-ico.htm"><i>Learn more: Why Invest In An ICO?</i></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>AVAX Token and Staking&nbsp;</h3><p>The AVAX token represents the backbone of the network. This utility token is used to stake and pay network fees, and as it is usable across all blockchains and subnets within the Avalanche ecosystem, it is a common usable asset for all of them. It has a capped supply of 720 million tokens. Like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, this creates scarcity, which means the token won&rsquo;t suffer from the continuous dilution through inflation. An additional deflationary effect is achieved through the burning of all AVAX tokens used for fees.&nbsp;</p><p>To be a validator on the network, you have to stake at least 2,000 AVAX. If you can&rsquo;t afford it, or do not want to be a validator for any reason but would like to stake your AVAX anyway, you can support another validator, which makes you a delegator. Validators can earn up to 11% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) and set a custom percentage fee of the reward they keep from delegators who back them.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not sure how much you&rsquo;re willing to stake, regardless of whether you want to become a validator or delegator, the Avalanche website offers a handy <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.avax.network/validators">calculator</a>. Here, you can enter the amount you want to stake and see the APY, but also a daily and monthly percentage yield, as well as its value in US dollars&mdash;at least according to the current AVAX price.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/62164/31238/2rszd.jpg"></figure><p>Additionally, tokens staked on the Avalanche network are never at risk of slashing. This practice, often used by Proof-of-Stake networks to punish validators who work against the health of the network, is simply not part of their modus operandi. Emin G&uuml;n Sirer <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://mobile.twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1382721313299705856">stated</a> that the decision to exclude slashing was controversial when it was first introduced, but that it is simply not required for security. On the other hand, slashing can hurt nodes that are not misbehaving, but are encountering bugs or other issues. &nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as Avalanche uses a type of Proof-of-Stake protocol, participating in the network does not require any special hardware, making it overall more accessible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to Stake AVAX for Validators&nbsp;</h3><p>To become a validator, you will have to stake at least 2,000 AVAX for at least two weeks. However, keep in mind that you can&rsquo;t stake your funds for longer than a year at any given time. Once you decide to start validating, you will have to stake your funds and set parameters like when you&rsquo;re starting and when you&rsquo;re stopping, the address you will use to receive any rewards, and your delegation fee rate (2% minimum). None of these parameters can be changed once you issue the transaction to add a node as a validator, so be sure to double check everything.&nbsp;</p><p>For all the specifics on running a validator node, Avalanche has detailed guides in their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview/staking">developer documentation</a>. In order to receive any rewards you&rsquo;re eligible for, you will have to stay online and responsive for at least 80% of the time you spend in that role. Once you&rsquo;re done validating, you will receive your stake back, as well as the aforementioned rewards, if applicable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to Stake AVAX for Delegators&nbsp;</h3><p>Being a delegator is significantly more straightforward than being a validator. However, while it comes with fewer responsibilities, it also does not include the same rewards as the more complex position. The length of time you can stake your funds for to support another validator is the same as for validators (e.g., two weeks minimum, one year maximum), but it cannot get outside the bounds of your chosen validator&rsquo;s parameters. In other words, if your chosen validator is staking for half a year, you cannot choose to stake for longer than that.&nbsp;</p><p>The minimum amount you must stake as a delegator is 25 AVAX. Once you&rsquo;ve set your parameters and issued the transaction, there is no way to change them. You will receive any rewards after the staking period of your validator has run out, but only in case your validator qualifies for the rewards as well. However, the validator that you delegate to keeps a portion of your reward&mdash;specified by the validator&rsquo;s delegation fee rate.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn more about the steps required to participate in the Avalanche network in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/nodes-and-staking">developer documentation</a>. Here, you can find tutorials for everything from running a node, to staking, to upgrading existing nodes. The site is also being regularly updated, which means any new issues or approaches will be documented and explained in an easy to understand manner within a short timeframe.</p><h3>AVAX Wallets&nbsp;</h3><p>Avalanche offers its own wallet, called simply the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://wallet.avax.network/"><strong>Avalanche Wallet</strong></a>, on its website. Here, users can simply access their existing wallet, or create a new one if they need it. However, this is far from the only option for storing AVAX and related assets. Users who have other coins may want to keep all their holdings in one place. Some of the other wallets that support AVAX include:</p><ul><li><strong>Ledger Nano X.</strong> You will still need an actual Avalanche Wallet, but it can be integrated with the Ledger Nano X hardware wallet for an extra level of security. In the Ledger Live, install the Avalanche App from the App Catalog and set it up by following the steps.</li><li><strong>MetaMask. </strong>Yes, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/"><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong></a> browser extension wallet can also be configured to use it to receive and manage AVAX C and access DApps made on the Avalanche network. However, while the MetaMask extension is very handy and easy to use, setting it up does require some basic technical skills.</li><li><strong>Coin98. </strong>This wallet can be used both as a browser extension and a mobile app, making it doubly useful to AVAX holders. The mobile version also has an integrated DApps browser for Avalanche.</li><li><strong>Coinomi. </strong>While the desktop version of this wallet does not support AVAX yet, the mobile one does.</li></ul><p>Still, unless you have a pressing reason not to use Avalanche&rsquo;s proprietary wallet for storing their tokens, it is still by far the best choice&mdash;plus, it is both safe and non-custodial, so there should be no security issues when using it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Where to Buy AVAX&nbsp;</h3><p>In order to store AVAX, you first need to have some. Luckily, many exchanges have already listed this project, so finding a trading pair you like should not be an issue. However, for those who are looking for the top exchanges listing it, we have compiled a list of five great options.<br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/binance/en"><strong>Binance</strong></a><strong>. </strong>As the largest exchange by 24-hour trading volume, it should come as no surprise that Binance also hosts the highest volume of AVAX trading. Additionally, the exchange is available almost globally (regulations permitting), is easy to use and straightforward, and accepts multiple payment options.</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/gate-io/en"><strong>Gate.io</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This exchange, one of the oldest in the industry, is still going strong and also offers great AVAX pairs. You can even use your account without KYC, but be warned that you will still need to go through the process if you want to trade higher volumes.</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/en"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a><strong>. </strong>A beginner-friendly exchange that only lists vetted projects, Coinbase offers one of the most straightforward ways to purchase AVAX. On the other hand, it has slightly higher fees than most of its competitors, so the simplicity does come at a cost.</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/kucoin/en"><strong>KuCoin</strong></a><strong>. </strong>KuCoin has an incredible selection of altcoins with small market caps, which means you will be able to trade a wide selection of other tokens aside from AVAX. The exchange is also privacy-friendly, which means there are no forced KYC checks, but it doesn&rsquo;t support any fiat trading pairs.</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/bitfinex/en"><strong>Bitfinex</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This formerly professional-only exchange still has an air of exclusivity around it, so trading here offers something of a VIP air. Bitfinex offers many different coins and trading options, but its fees are somewhat higher than on other exchanges, and it is still best suited to those who trade large volumes on a daily basis.</li></ol><p>Of course, this list is far from exhaustive, but it offers a good starting point for anyone who needs it.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/62164/31240/5rszd.jpg"></figure><h3>Avalanche Block Explorer</h3><p>Another useful tool that most blockchains have is a block explorer. Knowing how to use it is a prerequisite for making the most of the network. On Avalanche, their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://explorer.avax.network/">block explorer</a> is especially useful, as it offers insight into AVAX, but also all other blockchains and their tokens that were created on the platform. At the top, the explorer shows the transaction volume on the platform, the number of validators as well as the total amount currently staked, the number of active blockchains and subnets, and the staking ratio plus annual staking reward.</p><p>You can see all recent transactions on the landing page, but also search by address, transaction ID, or asset. Other tabs include subnets, validators, assets, blockchains, C Chain, Status (for the entire network), and resources, which will lead you to any documentation you may need. In other words, their explorer is the best place to start if you need any specific information about the Avalanche platform.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/62164/31241/6rszd.jpg"></figure><h3>AVAX Price</h3><p>At the time of writing (October 2021), the AVAX price was around USD 57, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. The asset reached its all time high on September 23rd 2021, when it soared to USD 79.31. The current total supply (both staked and circulating) is around 377 million AVAX, whereas the coin&rsquo;s hard cap is 720 million. On the other hand, only around 220 million are currently in circulation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are part of the cryptocurrency community for longer than a few hours, you’re likely to hear about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>. But what is this blockchain project that has taken the industry by storm? Here, you can learn everything you need to know, from the basics of the project, its token and what purpose it serves, where you can buy it, and more.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/61377/28785/1rszd.jpg"></figure><h3>What is Solana (SOL)?</h3><p>Let us start from the basics: Solana is an open-source blockchain that aims to provide a fast, scalable and advanced marketplace and platform for decentralised applications (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dapps/">dapps</a>). Often dubbed the “Ethereum killer”—as are most similar projects—it tackles the issues that plague Ethereum and other Proof of Work-based blockchain projects by opting for a different consensus algorithm and making other improvements in all aspects perceived as weaknesses in their competitors.</p><p>Solana was first envisioned in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, who was an executive at tech company <strong>Qualcomm </strong>before that, so he already had extensive experience in distributed systems and decentralization prior to starting the project. He was joined by Greg Fitzgerald, formerly the Chief Technology Officer and, as of August 2021, advisor of Solana Labs, and Eric Williams, now Chief Scientist, in creating the network.</p><p>The project first launched in 2020, three years after it was conceived. It addresses the issues of other blockchains by combining two consensus mechanisms: Proof of Stake and Proof of History. Proof of Stake requires decision-making participants in the network, or validators, to stake some of their token holdings before they can make decisions; making good decisions rewards them, while making bad ones that go against the health of the network is punished by taking their stake away.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm"><i>Learn more: What Is Proof-of-Stake?</i></a></p><p>However, Proof of Stake can run into issues when the correct order of transactions has to be determined. This is where Proof of History comes in. With so many participants in different time zones, a decentralized system is hard-pressed to find a single way to timestamp transactions in order to keep them organized. Instead of trusting any given timestamp, Solana’s Proof of History algorithm just proves something has happened <i>before<strong> </strong></i>and <i>after</i> other events. In other words, it creates a historical record that proves that an event has occurred at a specific moment in time. According to Yakovenko, this ensures that their blockchain is much faster than other Proof of Stake alternatives.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/61377/28786/2rszd.jpg"></figure><p>If you’re interested in learning more about how Solana works, with in-depth technical explanations of the blockchain and its rules, you can read all about it in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://whitepaper.io/document/602/solana-whitepaper">Solana whitepaper</a>.</p><p>Along with the expected pros of blockchains, like decentralization, security, and immutability, Solana’s speed makes it an excellent place for decentralized finance (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) applications, but also dapps like games. Its speed ensures that a network congestion is extremely unlikely to happen, so fee prices are quite low compared to its competitors.</p><p>All of this means that Solana is now the home to many projects of all sorts, with something for everyone—all of which users can access using SOL tokens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>SOL Token</h3><p>The SOL token is the backbone of the Solana network. It is used to pay gas fees on the network, but also for staking, so users can support the network’s security and earn inflationary rewards. The token was launched amid the release of the beta mainnet in March 2020. As of the time of writing, in September 2021, it is the seventh largest token by market cap according to data from aggregator CoinGecko. It reached its all time high on September 9th, when it was trading at USD 213.47 per coin. With a market cap of around USD 40bn, Solana’s token is firmly wedged into the top 10 cryptocurrencies.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/61377/28787/4rszd.jpg"></figure><h3>SOL Wallets&nbsp;</h3><p>Before you buy Solana’s token, you need to have a wallet where you can store your holdings. The wallet you choose will depend on your personal requirements, but also on your comfort with technology; the vast majority of users will need to choose a third-party wallet with an intuitive interface, while those who know their way around their command-line app (advanced users or developers) could opt for those, as new features on the Solana blockchain will always be supported on the command line first before being integrated into third-party solutions.</p><p>If you’re sticking with third-party wallets, you can choose between mobile apps and web wallets. Some mobile app wallets that support solana are:</p><ul><li><strong>Exodus</strong></li><li><strong>Trust Wallet</strong></li><li><strong>Coin98</strong></li><li><strong>Zelcore</strong></li></ul><p>Out of all these wallets, only Exodus supports staking (more on that further down), but Zelcore can also connect to all Solana-based dapps, as well as trade numerous other cryptos.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/61377/28788/3rszd.jpg"></figure><p>On the other hand, if you spend the majority of your time on a PC, a web-based wallet may be more intuitive to use. Some of these include:</p><ul><li><strong>Phantom</strong></li><li><strong>Solflare</strong></li><li><strong>Sollet</strong></li><li><strong>MathWallet</strong></li><li><strong>BitKeep</strong></li></ul><p>The first two support staking as well. Sollet, MathWallet, and BitKeep support all Solana-based tokens aside from SOL, but MathWallet apps do not, which means you will only be able to store your SOL holdings on the web version of the wallet.</p><p>Those who have SOL lying around may be interested in staking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to Stake SOL</h3><p>Staking SOL tokens is one of the best-known ways to earn passive income by simply not being able to spend your SOL holdings. To do so, all you have to do is stake tokens to one or more <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://solanabeach.io/validators">validators on Solana’s Mainnet</a>.</p><p>First, you must use a wallet that supports staking. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Phantom.app </strong>in conjunction with a seed phrase or a Ledger Nano.</li><li><strong>SolFlare.com</strong> in conjunction with a keystore file or a Ledger Nano.</li><li><strong>Solana </strong>command line tools can perform all staking operations in conjunction with a CLI-generated keypair file wallet, a paper wallet, or with a connected Ledger Nano.</li><li><strong>Exodus </strong>wallet—but you are automatically assigned their partner validator instead of choosing your own.</li><li><strong>Binance </strong>and <strong>FTX </strong>exchanges—again, you can only stake to their partner validator here.</li></ul><p>Once you’ve chosen your method, you will have to follow the instructions of the wallet you are going with, as each will work slightly differently. However, they all have detailed guides, so you’re unlikely to get lost in the meantime. The account used for staking will be different from the one you use to send and receive tokens.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/coin/61377/28789/5rszd.jpg"></figure><p>If you’re using a wallet that lets you choose your own validator, you will have to make that choice as well. There are no right or wrong answers here—this is something you have to do by yourself, as the network does not endorse anyone, in the interest of decentralization. After that, your wallet of choice will also have the steps you need to follow in order to delegate your stake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Solana Ecosystem</h3><p>At the time of writing, there were 368 dapps on the Solana blockchain. Most of them are DeFi-related, but many are also non-fungible token (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/nft/">NFT</a>) projects, various explorers and tools, etc. They are all listed on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://solana.com/ecosystem">Solana website</a>, with their names and short descriptions readily available. Some of the projects have a more detailed description when you click on them, offering a very intuitive way to research what they are and how they work.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launched in 2016, the Waves project has developed into an ecosystem consisting of a blockchain platform for the creation of custom tokens, a smart contract solution and a dedicated decentralized exchange named Waves DEX.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/e8455932c9.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/e8455932c9.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/e8455932c9.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/e8455932c9.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/e8455932c9.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/e8455932c9.jpg 1200w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>The Waves platform was founded as a solution to what its developers perceived as the slow implementation of blockchain in everyday applications involving the management of digital assets. They believe that the blockchain adoption process would be sped up and made to cover more fields provided that the following issues are resolved: </p>
<ul><li><b>Blockchain’s main task to ensure value transfer via “tokenization” of digital assets is often overshadowed by other considerations, such as the focus on smart contracts.</b> The Waves platform wants to make it easy to tokenize, buy and sell various digital assets on crypto platforms, no matter which fiat or crypto currency is dominant in any part of the world.</li><li><b>ICOs are an important component of the blockchain project launch, yet their creation is hardly an easy process. </b> One of the main selling points of the Waves project is its intention to become a platform for launching <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-an-ico.htm">initial coin offerings</a> (ICOs) in a cost-efficient and user-friendly manner. </li><li><b>The process of token trading following the project launch is often insufficiently supported on various cryptocurrency exchanges. </b>The Waves platform includes the Waves decentralized exchange (DEX) which allows its users to trade their mainstream cryptos for the Waves token or any other token created on the Waves platform. It also serves as the gateway to fiat currencies such as USD or EUR.</li><li><b>Blockchain needs to be faster, scalable and decentralized.</b> To improve on this, the Waves project includes implementation of the Waves-NG protocol which increases the platform’s throughput while speeding up the block creation times and reducing the potential for unneeded forks.</li><li><b>Smart contracts mechanisms should be optimized for dealing with various assets.</b> The Waves platform proposes to make this easier with its proposed implementation of the dedicated smart contract language named RIDE which enables creation of the categories such as “smart assets” and “smart accounts”.  </li></ul>
<h2 id="how-can-you-use-custom-tokens-created-on-the-waves-platform?-">How Can You Use Custom Tokens Created on the Waves Platform? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Waves platform for custom token creation aims to become a versatile solution for various use cases on the blockchain. At the heart of this process is the &quot;colored coin&quot; method which involves management of real-world assets via their association with addresses on the blockchain. Tokens created on the Waves platform can be pegged to fiat currencies and other real assets, such as bonds, intellectual property, stocks etc.</p>
<p>As such, the use cases for the custom created tokens can include:</p>
<ul><li>Creation of custom digital currencies by businesses that want to make them a means of payment for goods and services within a specific project. </li><li>Securing crowdfunding for projects. Creating custom tokens means being able to transfer value in an easier manner since the tokens are customized in line with the needs of users and investors participating in an ICO.  </li><li>Custom-created tokens can also be used as the stake in decentralized voting model or as part of the rating system. </li><li>Starting a customer loyalty or discount schemes featuring token-based rewards. Take, for example, what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16219468/burger-king-russia-cryptocurrency-whoppercoin-blockchain-trading-waves" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Burger King did with its Whoppercoin</a> which was launched in Russia in 2017 with the help of the Waves platform. As part of its loyalty program, Burger King’s customers were given one Whoppercoin for every ruble they spent in restaurants. </li></ul>
<h2 id="how-are-the-transactions-managed-on-waves?">How Are the Transactions Managed on Waves?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To make this possible, the Waves platform is designed to support both creating tokens and making transfers with them as if they were “attachments” to new transactions on the blockchain.  This is done to get around the issue related to adding new transaction types to an existing network, which comes with the risk of having to deal with hard forks. The reason for this is the fact that a network’s client software needs to be updated to support these transactions. </p>
<p>What the Waves platform does to contend with this is to treat the new transactions as plugins, meaning that they are not treated as the “core” of the client software used to manage them. Instead of this, these new transaction types are treated as “extensions” of the client software which means that the users can relay them and take part in the network’s operations, despite not having the appropriate plugins installed. This provides the third-party developers with the flexibility to create and offer new types of transactions within an environment which resembles application stores most of the users are familiar with. </p>
<h2 id="how-can-one-create-custom-tokens-with-waves?-">How Can One Create Custom Tokens with Waves? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Waves platform offers what it describes as a flexible and fast token creation process that can be completed within a matter of minutes. The process is designed to be as streamlined as possible, with the Waves developers promising that it will not require the user to possess technological expertise:</p>
<p>1) First, you need to download the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wavesliteapp/kfmcaklajknfekomaflnhkjjkcjabogm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WavesLite app</a> or go directly to the <a href="https://wavesplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Waves website</a> and look for the Waves wallet.</p>
<p>2) Selecting the Token Creation option allows for the customization of the token name and description, the planned supply of created tokens, decimal system etc. </p>
<p>3) Once these settings are made, you can either submit your token or restart the entire process. </p>
<p>In order to create a custom-made token and get access to the Waves exchange, a user on the Waves platform will have to set aside 1 WAVES token (WAVES), while the minimum fee for the transfer of funds is 0.001 WAVES. As of late 2018, thousands of custom tokens (such as the aforementioned Whoppercoin) were created with the help of the Waves. </p>
<p>This feature allows the Waves platform to go toe to toe with the competitors such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, which it hopes to beat by focusing on its strengths: </p>
<ul><li>Smart contracts are not needed for the token creation</li><li>No programming or IT background is required</li><li>There is no need for code audit, maintenance and monitoring</li><li>Tokens are immediately tradable on the Waves’ DEX exchange. </li></ul>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/e8465d559b.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/e8465d559b.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/e8465d559b.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/e8465d559b.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/e8465d559b.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/e8465d559b.png 808w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-waves-decentralized-exchange-(dex)-">The Role of the Waves Decentralized Exchange (DEX) </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Waves&#8217; decentralized exchanges DEX is an integral part of the platform’s ecosystem. As such, it is designed to support the platform’s token creation capabilities and offer basic trading functionalities with guaranteed anonymity. For starters, the users’ tokens on this decentralized exchange are stored directly in their wallets, reducing the hacking risks associated with the centralized exchanges. Similarly, the exchange administrators’ authority is also decentralized, meaning that no sanctions against the users’ funds can be imposed arbitrarily, such as in the case of having one’s funds frozen or imposing limits on their trading and withdrawing capacity. </p>
<p>The DEX exchange has implemented an automated matching system for buying and selling orders as well as for the management of token exchange once the orders’ requirements are met. As the matchmaking software of the DEX platform is an open-source one, the nodes on the network can implement their own matchmaking systems and earn Waves tokens in exchange for handling trading transactions. </p>
<p>The Waves’ developers have expressed a desire to establish partnerships with banks which want to issue their own fiat tokens. To them and other business partners, the Waves team promises the following benefits: </p>
<ul><li>Genuine liquidity with more than USD 6,310,000 as the average 24h volume.</li><li>Lower fees, amounting to less than USD 0.01 (0.003 WAVES) per order.</li><li>The exchange serves as the gateway for several fiat and cryptocurrencies, including EUR, USD, TRY, BTC, BCH, ETH, WAVES, ZEC, DASH, LTC and XMR.</li><li>Unlimited withdrawal limits for cryptocurrencies.</li><li>The exchange supports various devices, with supported browser-based access and dedicated mobile versions.</li></ul><p> </p>
<p>In addition to its aim to win over the financial industry players, the Waves platform has to hope that these features will be sufficiently attractive to draw the users away from its immediate competitors such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/0x/">0x</a>, <a href="https://idex.market/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IDEX</a> and <a href="https://kyber.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kyber Network</a>. </p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-waves-ng-protocol-bring-to-the-table?-">What Does the Waves NG Protocol Bring to the Table? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While the Ethereum platform and its ERC-20 token standard have become a popular choice for those who want to launch tokens through ICOs and create smart contracts, this hardly means that this solution is 100% watertight when it comes to various challenges. The Waves intends to make itself a suitable alternative by tackling the issues such as slow transaction speed, high fees and the lack of support for scaling. </p>
<p>To that effect, the Waves network has implemented a new protocol called <a href="https://blog.wavesplatform.com/waves-ng-speed-capacity-and-a-bit-of-blockchain-for-dummies-1cf0cc10f8a4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the Waves-NG</a> consensus algorithm that is supposed to allow its blockchain to handle “thousands of transactions per minute” as well as preclude the creation of forks on the network. This solution was designed around the Bitcoin-NG technology proposed by Emin Gün Sirer and Ittay Eyal. The model does away with the principle of discovering blocks at similar intervals and having the new transactions processed once the miners get to submit them to the network. Instead of this, the Waves-NG model allows for selecting the miner in advance and having them create a key block which is automatically loaded with microtransactions without the need for the additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proof-of-work</a>.  This makes it possible for the Waves platform to confirm transactions as soon as its network allows it, thus increasing its processing capacity and speed. </p>
<p>Waves-NG also aims to tackle the issue of the scalability bottleneck by having its network reach its highest throughput depending on the conditions and the state of the network itself. This is described as the strategy to minimize transaction latency, instead of going for reduced block intervals which can compromise security and increase the likelihood of forks. </p>

<h2 id="waves-as-a-smart-contract-platform">Waves as a Smart Contract Platform</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In September 2018, the Waves implemented the smart contract features with which it aims to compete with the likes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/eos/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/lisk/">Lisk</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/neo/">NEO </a>and Ethereum. The Waves’ smart contract platform promises the following features:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Atomic Swaps</a></li><li><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Multisignature </a>addresses </li><li>Token freezing</li><li>Voting</li><li><a href="https://blockchainhub.net/blockchain-oracles/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Oracles</a></li></ul>
<p>Unlike Ethereum, for example, smart contracts on the Waves platform do not require an equivalent of “gas” to be executed, requiring, instead, the payment of a minimal fee. </p>
<p>In addition to this, the Waves team created a new programming language named RIDE, which was specially developed for the smart contract segment of the platform. RIDE language allows the developers to create “smart assets” and “smart accounts” as well as to move on closer to creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Turing-complete</a> smart contracts. </p>
<p>Smart assets are virtual currency tokens representing both tangible and intangible assets from the real world, all of which can be bought, sold and exchanged based on the script rules which are valid on the Waves network. In this case, the script attached to the asset is in charge of validating each transaction relating to it. As such, the smart assets are supposed to offer greater autonomy, anonymity and lower transaction fees.  </p>
<h2 id="architecture-of-the-waves-platform">Architecture of the Waves Platform</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>At the heart of the Waves platform is an architecture with two distinctive features: </p>
<ul><li>Two-tier system</li><li><a href="https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/platform-features/leased-proof-of-stake-lpos.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Leased Proof-of-Stake </a>model</li></ul>
<p>Two-tier architecture is designed to help the Waves deal with the potential scalability-related problems. This includes having the network maintain two types of nodes: lightweight and full nodes. The lightweight nodes rely on full nodes to confirm transactions and manage interactions taking place on the Waves network. Thanks to this, the lightweight nodes do not have to download blockchain, but rather work with the current network state. This state is subsequently used as the basis for running simpler procedures relating to the payment verifications. </p>
<p>Leased Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) consensus model is described as the “enhanced” version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Proof-of-Stake</a> model and it works hand in hand with the WAVES tokens. Instead of running a full node, the users can “lease” their tokens to the full nodes that keep the network operational, at the rate of 0.002 WAVES per leasing. Once 1,000 WAVES tokens are acquired, a full staking node is created.  Even if a user does not have the required amount of tokens, he/she can take part in staking by leasing their tokens to a mining pool. </p>
<h2 id="waves-token-availability-and-project-history-">Waves Token Availability and Project History </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As of December 2018, the Waves’ market cap was valued at more than USD 178 million, down from USD 1.7 billion it had in December 2017. The amount of tokens in circulation is capped at 100,000,000 WAVES. The Waves ICO took place from April to May 2016, with USD 16.4 million raised in the process. The tokens are available for trading on the cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bittrex/">Bittrex </a>and <a href="https://wavesplatform.com/get-waves" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">others</a>.  </p>
<p>The founder and CEO of the Waves platform is Sasha Ivanov, a theoretical physicist from Ukraine, who worked on the development of software and internet payment platforms and neural network prediction solutions. Before starting the Waves project, Ivanov was involved in the creation of the instant cryptocurrency exchange Coinomat.com, as well as in the development of the <a href="https://nxtplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nxt platform</a> which served as an “inspiration” for the creation of the Waves.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/waves/">Waves</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEO is an open source and decentralized cryptocurrency hailing from China. The network it runs on offers simplified coding of smart contracts and launching of initial coin offerings (ICOs), and is often called a next generation smart economy platform.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-neo">what Is NEO</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The NEO platform allows developers to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">create smart contracts</a> and build decentralized applications (dapps) on it, similar to its competitor <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. The project was founded by Da Hongfei in 2014 under the name of “AntShares” which was changed to “NEO” three years later. The NEO network uses two different tokens: NEO and GAS. NEO coins cannot be divided (to 0.5 NEO for example) &#8211; a behavior that resembles a company’s stock, for example. At the same time, the use of the NEO network and transaction fees related to dapps are paid for with the GAS tokens which one receives for holding NEO. In this sense, GAS can be said to serve a similar purpose as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">Ethereum’s ether</a>, with the addition that NEO platform gave its GAS the status of a real token. </p>
<p>NEO claims to offer easier and more accessible coding of smart contracts, as its platform supports a range of popular programming languages such as C++, Python or Java. This is in contrast with Ethereum that uses only the Solidity programming language. NEO’s broadening of accepted programming languages is an attempt to attract and support more developers.</p>
<p>Aside from the digitization of currency and deployment of smart contracts, NEO is also striving to digitize various types of real assets, such as real estate, to be managed as part of its “smart economy” concept. In practice, this means that physical assets can be represented as digital ones on the NEO network, while their ownership can be distributed among various owners.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese government has often spoken out against cryptocurrencies, NEO seems to be an exception. The company has attended a government-sponsored industry conference last year and is supported by important companies such as Alibaba.</p>
<h2 id="neo-coins">NEO Coins</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As of November 2018, the coin market cap stands at USD 1 billion, down from its all-time high of USD 10 billion that it reached in early 2018. One hundred million NEO coins were created following the ICO which took place in 2016. Half of them were sold, while the NEO council manages the remaining 50 million coins from its pool. NEO coins are not mined but rather bought as the stake to be used with the system’s own Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. This mechanism is, in turn, based on <a href="https://github.com/NeoResearch/ODBFT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) consensus algorithm</a>. At the same time, GAS tokens are used as the incentive for NEO holders for the generation of each new block on the network.</p>
<p>NEO coins can be bought on many cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance </a>or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/hitbtc">HitBTC</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lisk (LSK) supports the operation of its platform for the development of decentralized apps (dapps) and sidechains. With its focus on the Javascript programming language, Lisk aims to become the platform of choice for a larger number of developers.</p><p>Lisk was designed as a platform and decentralized network whose main task is to make working with blockchain much easier for developers. Its designers Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows saw blockchain building as being burdened by the need to stay up to date with basic coding at its foundation. Lisk provided the platform which streamlines application development by focusing on the Javascript programming language. The goal here was to open the way for a larger number of programmers to start working on custom dapps and independent blockchains under the umbrella of a single system. In 2016, an open-source blockchain app platform called Crypti was forked, creating Lisk as we know it today. </p>
<p>Lisk’s aim to bring a broader range of developers into its fold is supposed to help it face the competition from the likes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/neo/">NEO</a>, which also operate as platforms focused on dapps among other things. To bring this vision closer to reality, Lisk gives its users access to its Software Development Kits (SDKs) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-are-sidechains-2658.htm">sidechains</a>. In essence, sidechain works as a separate blockchain linked to the main blockchain via two-way pegging system. In this manner, digital assets on several chains effectively become interchangeable, with no negative impact on their speed or performance. At the same time, tokens on these chains can be easily transferred and synchronized.  For the developers, the use of sidechains allows for a higher degree of customization when working with asset tracking, consensus mechanisms or network scaling. </p>
<p>Lisk operates its own core chain called Mainchain, with its team and 101 delegates being in charge of its security. Developers can freely set up their own blockchain networks as sidechains, without the risk for the Mainchain to be affected by the bugs which can appear on them. The consensus algorithm is based on <a href="https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Delegated Proof-of-Stake</a> (DPoS), while sidechains act as databases needed for the operation of the developed apps. The LSK tokens on the network are used for voting for the nodes which verify transactions and create new blocks. </p>
<p>The total supply of the coins is currently 127,136,218 LSK, with 111,901,077 of them in circulation as of November 2018. Their market cap value currently stands at USD 315 million, down from more than USD 4 billion it had in early 2018. LSK coins are available for buying/selling on major crypto exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/poloniex/">Poloniex</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/lisk/">Lisk</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decred (DCR) coin works on the platform which focuses on decentralization of the blockchain. This covers decision making process, mining and governance, with all of them seen by Decred’s founders as being threatened by centralization.</p><p>The Decred cryptocurrency was launched in February 2016, backed by the vision of the people from Company 0 to create a sort of more decentralized and “democratic” equivalent of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. This is not unusual, considering that the people behind the project were former Bitcoin developers. Going beyond this goal, Decred was supposed to become a cryptocurrency which will achieve full autonomy by focusing on leaving the decision making process and governance solely in the hands of coin owners and miners on its network. In order to make this decentralization possible, Decred had to implement several modifications to its protocol with the focus on several key areas. </p>
<p>The first issue to be tackled by Decred was the one relating to the project governance. The rise in the scope of the mining operations on Bitcoin, for example, led to the dominance of a few big mining companies with the largest resources. Over time, this helped with the centralization of the decision making power in fewer hands. This led to clashing visions regarding the management of cryptocurrency between the members of its community, miners and developers, particularly when deciding on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hard forks.</a> To avoid this, Decred implemented a hybrid voting protocol combining what it saw as the strengths of both proof of stake and proof of work models.</p>
<p>This combo of mining and staking allows all participants to have an off-chain vote on improvement initiatives and proposed forks on Decred blockchain. Each one of them can bring their own suggestions to the table, with every proposal going through the evaluation by the users are appointed to the Decred Assembly by means of voting. </p>
<p>The second problem Decred wants to correct is related to autonomous self-funding as the path to creating a fully decentralized currency. As much as 10% of the block rewards are set aside for the Decred’s treasury fund, by which the platform ensures the self-funding of its development for as long as the mining goes on. Remaining 60% of the rewards are reserved for the miners and 30% for the voters. This promotes the project as something which should remain sustainable through the actions of the coin owners and/or miners themselves.</p>
<p>To make this possible, DCR coins are rewarded for both the mining and stake verification processes. Their holders can buy tickets for the participation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proof of stake</a> mechanism. The tickets are mined as block segments, prompting the user to wait for the completion of this process or pay fees to secure earlier mining of tickets. After the tickets are mined, they still need to “mature” before being chosen among the others in the pool. </p>
<p>Finally, Decred wants to prevent giving some participants an excess level of control over what happens on the network, such as being able to enforce censorship. Instead of this, Decred applies the principle of transparent censorship which prevents users to be silently censored provided that they can give evidence that censorship has actually taken place. To this effect, Decred implements the Politeia web platform which resembles social network Reddit, in which the users are free to submit, review and discuss suggestions and proposals.  Those who own tickets use their wallets to take part in the voting process. </p>
<p>With its focus on making the blockchain work better in terms of its governance, Decred may eventually find itself competing with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dash/">Dash</a> and similar projects. In order to make the transactions on its blockchain faster and reduce transaction fees, Decred is in the process of implementing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a>. This process will involve handling the transaction processing via micropayment channels instead of doing it on the main blockchain. </p>
<p>As of November 2018, DCR’s market cap stands at USD 346 million, down from almost USD 800 million it had earlier in 2018. The total supply of coins is capped at 21,000,000 DCR, with 8,767,868 of them being currently in circulation. The coins are available for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/poloniex/">Poloniex </a>or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bittrex/">Bittrex</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/decred/">Decred</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In development since 2014, the Factom platform has since grown into a blockchain solution and a cryptocurrency (FCT) with two functional tokens, all of them focused on improving the quality of storage and protection of data in business applications.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c1/912f7be1c8.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c1/912f7be1c8.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c1/912f7be1c8.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c1/912f7be1c8.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c1/912f7be1c8.png 900w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.factom.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Factom </a>platform was devised as a blockchain-based solution to the issues the organizations face when creating records and storing them in the databases which often involve working with the paper-based documentation. Seeing the <a href="https://www.verypossible.com/blog/blockchain-explained-how-does-immutability-work" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blockchain immutability</a> as one of the defining characteristics of this technology, the Factom developers presented their platform as a technological answer to some of the key issues in contemporary data management practices: </p>
<ul><li><b>Factom platform recognizes the role of the audit trail in fostering trust among stakeholders and wants to improve it.</b> Verification and auditing of the records created in business processes can be time consuming, inaccurate and vulnerable to failure. This stems from the inherent lack of trust in business dealings, prompting the companies to devote huge resources to perfecting record keeping and audit trail management. Factom promises to streamline this procedure by using a blockchain-based audit trail which is immutable, easy to verify and fast. Vital documentation, such as that relating to land deeds or medical records is often distributed between various parties and protection of their integrity is essential for many businesses to which the Factom offers its technology. </li><li><b>Records of all types can be notoriously hard to protect or synchronize, prompting the Factom team to offer blockchain architecture as a rock-solid platform for data storage.</b> Business data from various sources are often fragmented and distributed across countless systems which function independently.  The fact that these records are vulnerable to tampering and easy changing of its content (particularly the computer-based data) is yet another obstacle to making the data both resistant to manipulation and easy for synchronization. At the same time, keeping paper records is both expensive and demanding in terms of the storage footprint. As an answer to this issue, the Factom developers offer the platform which comes with a distributed mechanism for locking data from various sources and making it resistant to tampering.</li><li><b>Factom team wants its platform to improve what it describes as insufficient speed offered by the existing blockchain networks.</b>  With Bitcoin, for instance, blocks are recorded at roughly ten-minute intervals, meaning that it takes as much time to confirm a single transaction.  Since the full processing of transaction takes about six confirmations as a standard, this process can take about an hour at average. As the demands of modern-day business hardly allow for this process taking this long, Factom offers processing transaction in smaller increments and at shorter intervals.  Each ten minutes, a record is finalized on the Factom blockchain at the speed the user’s application is “comfortable” with.</li><li><b>Factom aims to bring down the transaction costs.</b> Prices of cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile and they can also increase the cost of transactions simultaneously. At the same time, their increased numbers also incur higher costs. Factom offers to adapt to handle a higher number of operations with proportionately lower fees which translate into cost savings. Its system of “Entry Credits” has a fixed cost which does not depend on the token price fluctuations.</li><li><b>Factom wants to reduce bloating and limited transaction throughput on the blockchain. </b> The “traffic” on the blockchain gets congested with the increasing number of applications that require storing information on it. With this, there comes a problem with the introduction of increased block sizes and concerns regarding the maintenance of decentralization. Instead of burdening blockchain with the increasing number of transactions which cause the bloat in the first place, the Factom system involves recording entries within their own dedicated structures or chains. </li></ul>
<h2 id="how-does-factom-approach-data-storage-with-blockchain?--">How Does Factom Approach Data Storage with Blockchain?  </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Factom’s peer-to-peer network is built upon secure and decentralized blockchain named Factom Chain. The technology is offered as part of the series of <a href="https://www.factom.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Factom products</a>, one of which includes the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchainasaservice-baas.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Blockchain-as-a-Service platform</a> named Factom Harmony. With it, the users can integrate Factom technology with their existing business system and applications via <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/calls.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">API calls</a>, without having cryptocurrency infrastructure or technical expertise.  </p>
<p>The Chain’s task to serve as the platform for the recording and maintenance of data obliges it to focus on privacy and immutability of those records. This level of protection is achieved by means of separation of the blockchain’s immutability concept from the cryptocurrency aspect it was originally designed to work with. Since Bitcoin’s blockchain, for example, was originally designed to support monetary transactions, the Factom team took from it only what worked best for the data storage segment (immutability and security), without wanting to force its clients to deal with its cryptocurrency aspect. </p>
<p>To achieve this separation, Factom has established its own autonomous distributed protocol which aims to be used for the data entries which prioritize long-term storage without the ability to be erased easily: </p>
<ul><li>Financial records, documents on investments and transactions</li><li>Documentation on real estate and mortgage, land deeds, home sale contracts etc.</li><li>Medical records and the records relating to citizenship, identity and credit records.</li></ul>
<p>Notwithstanding these target groups, Factom’s architecture aims to present  itself as a solution for any business which considers its centralized databases both insufficiently secure and private. </p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-fct-tokens?">What Are the FCT Tokens?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Relieving the Factom blockchain of the cryptocurrency “burden” does not mean that its network is not utilizing tokens as a means of running its system. These tokens are:</p>
<ul><li>Factoids</li><li>Entry Credits</li></ul>
<p>Factoids (FCT) are tokens that within the Factom ecosystem and are available for trade like the “standard” cryptocurrency tokens. Factoids perform three main roles on the Factom network:</p>
<ul><li>They serve as a shield against spamming and bloating of the platform by the users and promote decentralization at the same time</li><li>Factoids are used to enforce consensus by stimulating users to support the Factom protocol. Lack of consensus means that the tokens will start losing their value </li><li>They are also a key component in the reward-based system that exists to ensure basic functionality of the network</li></ul>
<p>The Factom network releases 73,000 FCT tokes on monthly basis at a fixed rate, irrespective of the market price they may have. These tokens serve as the incentive for the servers that run the Factom protocol, as well as the “fuel” which allows them to make data entries on the platform. Making entries on the platform must be validated as a transaction involving Factoids, and the failure to do so will result in Factom servers rejecting the entry in question. </p>
<p>As of December 2018, the FCT market cap stood at USD 71 million, while the total supply of the tokens is capped at 8,745,102 FCT. The tokens are available for trade on cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/poloniex/">Poloniex </a>and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bittrex/">Bittrex</a>. Once acquired, the tokens can be stored in the official <a href="https://docs.factom.com/#welcome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Enterprise wallet</a>, while the support for other solutions is underway. </p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c1/9130747f84.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c1/9130747f84.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c1/9130747f84.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c1/9130747f84.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c1/9130747f84.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c1/9130747f84.png 1210w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-factoms-entry-credit-system?">What is the Factom’s Entry Credit System?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Another key component of the Factom platform are its Entry Credit (EC) tokens which are available for purchase with the FTC via the Factom protocol. These tokens cannot be transferred to other public keys and their purpose is limited to the following: </p>
<ul><li>Paying for entries on the Factom network and preventing the data spam</li><li>Voting for the authority nodes.</li></ul>
<p>Regarding their primary role, the EC tokens need to be spent to actually be able to add data to the blockchain, with 1 Entry Credit allowing one to enter 1KB of data. Buying EC tokens with Factoids means that the FCT are removed from the Factom system, i.e. they are said to be “burned”. While Factoid tokens can be converted into Entry Credits, the reverse is not possible. Entry Credits are hardly usable apart from their function on the Factom network, meaning that users do not have to fear that they would be stolen from any environment they are stored in. </p>
<p>Factom allegedly wants to make its platform as accessible as possible. This means that storing data on it should be made possible even for the users who do not want to bother with learning the intricacies of the interplay between the Entry Credits and Factoid tokens. These users are presented with an option to purchase Entry Credits with any supported currency they prefer, provided that they have a public key for holding them. What the Factom system does in the background in this case is that it will simply buy FCT tokens from the available crypto market and burn them to ensure that the purchase is “covered”. </p>
<h2 id="how-does-factom-manage-audit-trail?">How Does Factom Manage Audit Trail?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Since making data-based entries in a secure and immutable environment is one of main selling points of Factom, easy management of audit trails is one of the key features of its design. The users order entries to be made and the Chain makes a record of them in form of an audit trail. </p>
<p>This is done by the system providing each processed entry with a chain ID. The ID serves as a cryptographic proof by which the system identifies the group which an entry belongs to, with the sequence of entries forming a single chain. What this chain does is to make note of the order in which the entries were made, thus creating an audit trail. Created chains can be thought of as folders, while the entries made with them can be imagined as files which are put into them. Each entry can have the maximum size of 10KB, with the possibility of making as many of them to handle large files. </p>
<h2 id="factoms-block-based-system">Factom’s Block-Based System</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p> </p>
<p>Factom platform features yet another organizational perk which ensures streamlined management of data entries &#8211; its block-based system which consists of:</p>
<ul><li>Entry blocks</li><li>Directory blocks</li></ul>
<p>One of the key advantages of this system is its reduced bandwidth demand for the purpose of auditing the recorded data. This system allows Factom to eliminate the need for going over the whole of blockchain history in order to validate a single transaction. </p>
<p>It all starts with a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hash.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hash </a>function which handles the encryption of data (documents, video, audio etc.) needed for the validation of processes taking place on the blockchain. Combined letters and numbers which are encrypted to be different from the original data are called hash and these play a role in the formation of the so-called entry blocks on the Factom chain. </p>
<p>Entry blocks are formed by the group of hashes involving all entries with a specific chain ID. These blocks feature only hashes and not concrete data which is made part of these entries. Closely related to them are directory blocks, which are created by the servers on a minute-by-minute basis. This process involves making groups consisting of entry block hashes created in a single minute. After ten directory blocks have been created within a 10-minute time span, the hashes contained in them are linked to the blockchain. This task is done by the so-called authority nodes which are selected randomly. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-consensus-model-on-the-factom-chain?">What is the Consensus Model on the Factom Chain?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Technical foundation of the Factom’s consensus system consists of the algorithm which resembles <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the Raft</a>, paired with three types of servers on the network:</p>
<ul><li>Federated servers</li><li>Follower servers</li><li>Audit servers </li></ul>
<p>Factom’s consensus system involves random selection of a “leader” among the federated servers which represent the core the Factom network runs on. Federated servers perform two main tasks:</p>
<ul><li>Writing data to the blockchain</li><li>Receiving rewards in form of Factoid tokens</li></ul>
<p>Federated servers need to confirm their existence and operational state to the follower servers in the network. In case their “signal” is missing, the follower servers can start the process of electing a new federated server to replace a non-existent one.  In addition to this, the follower servers forward the requests for entries to be anchored on the Factom blockchain to the federated servers. </p>
<p>Audit servers keep tabs on what the federated servers do. Federated server making a mistake is turned into an audit server, while an audit server gets promoted to a federated one. The Factom platform will not handle the auditing process for the initial entries, which is the task of each user prior to making them part of the system. </p>

<p>The Factom project started with the establishment of the Factom Inc., a Texas-based company dedicated to the innovations in the blockchain technology back in 2014. The initial version of the Factom platform was released in early 2015, followed by the token sale. </p>
<p>The key personnel behind the project includes the company’s founder and CEO Paul Snow who, assisted by his <a href="https://www.factom.com/company/team/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">team</a>, also led the development of the Factom architecture. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform running on the blockchain. The platform allows for encrypted storage of data on the cloud, with the blockchain ledger serving to verify transactions, contracts and stored assets.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5be/5b30de62aa.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5be/5b30de62aa.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5be/5b30de62aa.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5be/5b30de62aa.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5be/5b30de62aa.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5be/5b30de62aa.jpeg 1600w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://sia.tech/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sia </a>project started out as a cloud storage solution which implements blockchain technology and offers high-level decentralization. It is built around a P2P storage ecosystem which allows its users to rent out their hard drive space to others or store their data on someone else’s storage resources. In order to support the payment infrastructure for these operations, the platform uses Siacoin as the cryptocurrency which is used to pay for the transactions taking place on the network. </p>
<p>Sia platform is also a home to another digital asset in form of the siafund token. This token is used to give its holder the right to receive a portion of siacoins which are exchanged as part of the transaction whenever a contract on storage is executed on the Sia platform. Its aim is to have the holders focus on bringing new users to the network and improving the storage platform itself as the number of siacoins they receive depends on the value of contracted transactions. The number of siafunds is limited to 10,000 and they are indivisible. </p>
<p>Sia was designed in response to what its creators perceived as shortcomings of the dominant centralized cloud storage providers such as DropBox, Google Drive, Amazon Cloud, Microsoft Azure and others. Centralization of the storage services on these platforms is seen as their Achilles&#8217; heel, as their architecture has components whose failures can prevent an entire system from functioning properly. At the same time, cloud storage solutions which do not use blockchain host large amounts of unencrypted data which can be exposed to privacy breaches and manipulation by the parties seeking to profit from it. In addition to this, Sia seeks to reduce the storage fees and the waste of available but unused storage capacities the users can offer to each other by renting their spare hard drive space. </p>
<h2 id="centralized-cloud-storage-has-problems-sia-aims-to-solve">Centralized Cloud Storage Has Problems Sia Aims to Solve</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Sia’s business and technological model is supposed to create a global blockchain-powered storage server which will not be run by any single authority with the potential to jeopardize the free circulation of data in the cloud. In 2017, a <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/02/11/equifax-hack-exposed-extra-data/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hacking attack targeting the Equifax credit reporting agency</a> in the US exposed sensitive personal information on more 145 million Americans, including the details of their social security and driver license numbers, birthdays and addresses. In the same year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15962520/verizon-nice-systems-data-breach-exposes-millions-customer-records" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Verizon suffered a similar data breach</a> attack which led to the loss of information on 14 million of its customers. </p>
<p>While not being the only root cause for these attacks, centralized storage of data in a single location makes these data conglomerates particularly vulnerable to breaches. In the case of Verizon, the data storage business was outsourced to Nice Systems, a reportedly renowned provider of storage services in numerous countries.  Yet, despite its references and technical resources, the data stored at this company’s facility easily made it more susceptible of becoming a<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4351/single-point-of-failure-spof" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">single point of failure</a> (SPOF), meaning that making a single breach in its defenses can create the same domino-like effect for other components.  </p>
<p>Not only intentional attacks pose a danger to these services. In 2017, Amazon’s S3 cloud computing web service was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14792442/amazon-s3-outage-cause-typo-internet-server" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">exposed to a simple human coding error</a> which brought down several big-name websites such as Medium, Business Insider, and Giphy for several hours. </p>
<p>Another issue the Sia platform aims to change is the potential for the data stored in the cloud to be abused and misused by the parties which provide infrastructure for it. Centralization of big data the large companies such as Google and Facebook have control over allowed them to make profits from it or endanger them due to sheer negligence.  Media analytics company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/deep-root-analytics-sued-after-data-breach-2017-6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Deep Roots Analytics used the Amazon cloud server to store information about as much as 61% of the US population without password protection</a> for almost two weeks. These information included names, email and home addresses, telephone numbers, voter ID numbers etc. Despite all of these issues, all centralized cloud storage companies are in a position to charge premium fees for their services, which is another issue which the team behind Sia aims to resolve and provide an alternative to. </p>
<h2 id="sia-wants-to-be-a-secure-and-affordable-storage-alternative-">Sia Wants To Be a Secure and Affordable Storage Alternative </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The areas in which Sia plans to challenge traditional cloud storage providers are related to privacy, <a href="https://siastats.info/storage_pricing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">affordability</a> and security. For starters, all data stored on the Sia platform undergoes encryption. In addition to this, data is put behind a private key which restricts access only to the rightful owner or a person properly authorized by him or her. This means that Sia does not allow either its personnel or any third party to gain unauthorized access to the data stored on its servers, unlike what it is the current practice among the centralized cloud storage providers. </p>
<p>As a decentralized network, Sia platform does away with centralization by breaking apart the users’ files and distributing them across more than one <a href="https://lisk.io/academy/blockchain-basics/how-does-blockchain-work/nodes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">node</a>. If a node, theoretically, wants to access a stored file for any reason, it will be prevented from doing so by the private key only the user has access to. Even in the case that such a node manages to acquire this key by any means, it will be left with an access to only a portion of the file which is hardly of any use.  Distribution of files among multiple nodes arguably reduces the vulnerability of centralized storage as a single point of failure and secures uptime which may compete with what the centralized storage providers can offer.   </p>
<p>Another advantage of decentralized storage has to do with the closer proximity to the server which allows for faster access to the data. This refers both to the data which are stored on a website, or serve as recoverable files which are stored on hard drives of any user willing to offer their capacity. Decentralized cloud storage has no need for numerous physical facilities for holding data. In this manner, it can bring down the storage fees that would otherwise go for the maintenance of the staffing at centralized facilities. With the help of its blockchain, Sia aims to set up a storage marketplace in which the providers in form of storage space renters can compete for users with a wide array of available services. Paired with lower fees, this approach is supposed to make the storage pricing more flexible for both the renters and the end users who may be dissatisfied with being offered only lump-sum cloud storage packages. </p>

<h2 id="how-does-sia-platform-operate?">How Does Sia Platform Operate?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In order to make this possible, Sia platform had to come up with specific architecture that will support the utilization of spare HDD resources of its users with the help of a P2P storage system. This is supported by having the storage space providers on the platform play the role of the “hosts” on the network and their clients as the “users”. In exchange for Siacoins, the clients can lease storage capacities from the hosts who are free to determine their price for it. Together with the hosts, they can also set out procedures for correcting issues such as the loss of stored data. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the hosts are the only party on the network in charge of promoting their available storage resources and the level of the quality of the service they provide. They are also within the rights to refuse to rent storage to a particular client, if they consider the data to be too sensitive, ethnically unacceptable or downright illegal.  </p>
<p>In order to balance things out between the interests of the two main groups of users on its network, the clients who make use of the available storage space can protect their files by having them split and copied between various hosts. This helps them protect their availability and safety in case one host denies them access to their files or loses it unintentionally. Users can also pay their hosts beyond the regular storage fees in order to secure having preferential treatment, such as being provided with faster upload services or enjoying a favored status when their storage requests are being processed. </p>
<h2 id="file-contracts-keep-the-sia-network-going-">File Contracts Keep the Sia Network Going </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To makes lives of both groups of users on the Sia platform easier, the clients and storage providers have been given an option to draft individual contracts which set down the corrective measures to be taken against the hosts which intentionally deny access to data, or fail to provide the evidence of its proper storage. <a href="https://siawiki.tech/about/introduction_to_file_contracts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">These file contracts</a> may as well regulate all other technical and business aspects of the storage use on the Sia network.   </p>
<p>The file contracts remain valid for as long as the data are kept in storage. The documents regulating this arrangement are stored on the Sia blockchain&#8217;s public ledger. In order to ensure that all parties stick to their part of the agreement, the contracts are made immutable and verifiable as soon as they become part of the Sia platform. As such, these contracts also serve to improve the general level of security on the Sia platform, as they set out the length of contacts, the manner in which payments are to be made and the management of evidence on the proper handling of stored data.  </p>
<p>What the Sia ecosystem aims to achieve here is to maintain this additional level of security at no expense of the flexibility of entering file contracts. In other words, the contractual parties are free to determine the level of service they provide or use. For instance, some clients may have a limited budget, making them more likely to go after the storage providers that focus on affordable storage as opposed to offering advanced security. </p>
<p>Siacoins are at the heart of the transactional system on the Sia network. Users who want to avail themselves of available storage space upload an agreed amount of Siacoins and make it a part of the contract. The coins provide the basis for the payment balance from which a certain amount is deduced and sent to the storage provider whenever a file is uploaded for the storage. If users do not use up all of their available storage resources in line with the contract, the remaining funds are refunded to their wallets. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-proof-of-storage">What is Proof of Storage</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In order to minimize the risk of frauds, Sia network has implemented a mechanism called proof of storage. Based on it, the hosts are obliged to give evidence of having provided the storage on the Sia network as a precondition to receiving compensation in Siacoins. This evidence needs to be supplied within the predefined time intervals which are set out under the file contracts. Inability to provide the proof of provided storage within a set “deadline” prevents the payment from being sent to a valid proof address and the host in question may also receive penalties for this type of behavior. Repeated failure to provide proofs of storage type may lead to the contract termination. </p>
<h2 id="siacoin-availability-and-distribution-">Siacoin Availability and Distribution </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Siacoin were not offered as part of an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-an-ico.htm">ICO</a>. Instead, the funds in the amount of $1.25 million were raised by the Sia team from the independent sources. In November 2018, the coin’s market cap stood at the value of USD 227 million. The currency has reached its all-time high in early 2018, with the market cap going as high as three billion USD. </p>
<p>Siacoins have an unlimited supply, with more than 37 billion of them being in circulation in November 2018. The coin was launched after the mining of the genesis block, with the developers handling the first 100 blocks for the reward of 300,000 Siacoins. Sia team also introduced their own <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asic.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ASIC miner</a> for Siacoin named Obelisk. In October 2018, a hard fork for the platform was approved with the goal to allow only the miners armed with Obelisk hardware to mine Siacoins. </p>
<p>Siacoins are available for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bittrex/">Bittrex </a>and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>.  </p>
<h2 id="the-sia-team-">The Sia Team </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Sia storage project was launched in June 2015. It was devised by a team of developers from the Sia’s mother company Nebulous which is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The leading person behind the project is the company’s CEO David Vorick who led the development of the Sia Core platform. In addition to Vorick, the final design of the Sia platform resulted from the efforts of its programmers Luke Champine and Johnathan Howel. In 2017 Nebulous launched its Obelisk subsidiary which was tasked with manufacturing ASIC mining hardware.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/siacoin/">Siacoin</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-iota?-">What Is IOTA? </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Launched in June 2016, the <a href="https://www.iota.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA platform</a> betrays its main purpose in the name itself, with it being the short form for the “Internet of Things Application”. In short, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simple-explanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/#392546071d09" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the Internet of Things (IoT)</a> is the concept involving the extension of internet connectivity to include as many physical devices within a single ecosystem. As such, it is found at the heart of many hi-tech concepts such as smart homes and smart cities which feature connected devices capable of exchanging data with the purpose of achieving operational synergy.</p>
<p>Supported by its MIOTA token, the IOTA platform’s main task is to enable instantaneous and feeless transactions between devices which are parts of the IoT network, no matter how big or small it is. In addition to this, IOTA offers immutable data history tracking and computing resource sharing, with plans to eventually expand its role to become the payment settlement and data integrity layer of smart cities, energy grids, infrastructure, financial industry, etc. </p>
<p>The IOTA platform does not rely on the blockchain technology by virtue of its removal of blocks, central ledger and miners which would be otherwise required to run it. Instead of a blockchain, IOTA relies on its own distributed ledger solution called the Tangle, which is supposed to overcome the shortcomings of blockchain related to rising transaction fees and processing scalability. The platform emerged as the joint work of Sergey Ivancheglo, David Sontesbo, Serguei Popov and Dominik Schiener. </p>
<p><b>
<h2 id="what-is-iota-trying-to-achieve?-">What is IOTA Trying to Achieve? </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Despite being largely focused on the Internet of Things, the IOTA developers hope to see their platform aligned with some of the broader goals of the current generation of crypto technologies:   </p>
<ul><li><b>The Internet of Things is an emerging technology whose pairing with cryptocurrency such as IOTA should offers benefits to the global economy</b>. Making the machine-to-machine (M2M) transactions on the IOTA platform both automatic and more efficient should help with the adoption of the Internet of Things technology which is already a force to be reckoned with on a global scale. With more than <a href="https://safeatlast.co/blog/iot-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">26 billion IoT devices being in use as of 2019</a>, their everyday use becomes more prominent as various sensors and cameras are now being used to keep track of conditions in manufacturing and agricultural facilities, along the transport lines, roads and bridges as well as in stores and homes.  IOTA is designed to help these devices share their resources in a more efficient manner, thus optimizing their allocation. </li><li><b>IOTA’s new transaction model comes with a promise of free and fast transactions with a focus on micropayments, all functioning as the foundation of future “machine-based” economy</b>. The IOTA’s Tangle system theoretically allows for supporting faster and more numerous transactions. Yet, if these would come with the obligatory charging for transaction fees, this could lead to the situation in which the devices in the Internet of Things network would be often required to pay a fee which is higher than the amount of value which is being transferred. To counter this, IOTA takes the fee payments out of the equation altogether. Based on this, IOTA can promise that some micropayments, for example those relating to water and electricity bills can be paid instantly by individual devices, without relying on annual subscription models or middlemen. In this manner, both the individual users and devices would pay only for what they actually consume instead of focusing on when they need these resources.</li><li><b>With its transaction system, IOTA promises to resolve the issue of scalability and security which are often the scourge of various blockchain-based systems</b>. The computing power of the IOTA network is designed in a manner that it should increase with the larger number of devices that become parts of its ecosystem. All of the devices connected as parts of the IoT network require support for dozens of transactions they make in short intervals, as they are required to purchase stuff such as utilities, bandwidth or storage whenever these resources are required.  To support this, IOTA’s transactional chains are interconnected so that the more transactions take place on it the more the network should become equipped to deal with their increasing number. Also, constant internet connectivity is not a requirement to participate in the IOTA network, which should promote savings on costs of electricity or the internet.  The enormous amount of mutual verifications taking place on the Tangle is supposed to protect IOTA from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">double spending</a> and other security issues. </li></ul>
<figure style="max-width: 650px"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5cd/19a77de5f2.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 650px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5cd/19a77de5f2.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5cd/19a77de5f2.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5cd/19a77de5f2.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5cd/19a77de5f2.jpg 900w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p><b>
<h2 id="how-does-tangle-work?">How Does Tangle Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Instead of relying on blocks and chains found with the standard blockchain architecture, the IOTA’s unique take on the transaction processing is based on having the transactions streamed and “entangled” as part of its Tangle consensus-creating system. It works in the following manner: </p>
<ul><li>Instead of a global blockchain, IOTA uses the verification methodology known as <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5739/directed-acyclic-graph-dag" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a> or Tangle. Based on it, M2M transactions on the IOTA platform rely on a novel model of verification in which the submitted transaction depends on the verification of two other earlier transactions.</li><li>Transactions are issued by nodes and stored in the ledger called the tangle graph. The graphs consist of edges which are created by having a new transaction approve two previous transactions. </li><li>For each instance of approval, the verifier needs to connect the transactions in question into the general Tangle mesh. This means that consensus is reached based on a web of verifications. Over time, each transaction will become linked to both the transactions it verifies and the future transactions that will verify it. </li><li>Even if there is no direct edge between two transactions, transaction A can indirectly approve transaction B if there is at least a directed path leading from A to B. </li><li>The genesis transactions are approved directly or indirectly by all other transactions. When a tangle is created, there is an address with reference to the address with relevant tokens which are created as part of the genesis transaction. They are sent to other genesis addresses.  Based on this, IOTA wants to get rid of the need to create new tokens in the future, removing the reliance on mining from its mode of operation.  </li><li>All that is required for participation in the IOTA network is to have a user perform a symbolic amount of computing aimed at verifying two earlier transactions. Their reward is the future verification of their own transactions as part of an incoming transaction-based validation. </li></ul>
<p><b>
<h2 id="is-the-iota-project-financially-sustainable?---">Is the IOTA Project Financially Sustainable?   </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Considering the unique feeless system of transaction processing (with the only costs being those related to electricity), there is a legitimate question of how to make the IOTA project self-sustainable in the long run. </p>
<p>For starters, the IOTA platform runs on an open-source namesake protocol which is mainly tasked with ensuring transaction processing and data transfers in a secure and highly decentralized manner. Being of an open nature, the IOTA protocol is sometimes described by the developers as an equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a> for distributed and collaborative information systems at the heart of the modern internet. </p>
<p>This allowed the IOTA developers to claim that their protocol has no inherent profit model but that it rather functions as a set of rules for sharing common information and transferring value. The development of the protocol has been left in charge of the IOTA Foundation which is tasked with promoting its adoption and handling future development. Being a non-profit enterprise, the IOTA project had to rely on the IOTA community and its token donations. As the MIOTA supply shall remain fixed, the project will continue to be funded by relying on the tokens’ increased value over time, as well as on potential grants and contributions from companies and individuals. </p>

<p><b>
<h2 id="miota-availability-and-partnerships-">MIOTA Availability and Partnerships </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Considering that IOTA is built to service devices of diverse manufacturers by design, it’s no wonder that the project is big on building partnerships. Having received <a href="https://www.finextra.com/finextra-downloads/newsdocs/cio_insights_reflections_-_cryptocurrencies_and_blockchains_-_emea_-_client_ready.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">praise</a> from the likes of Deutsche Bank back in 2017, the IOTA team also managed to score a strategic <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/iota-surges-on-new-partnership-with-fujitsu-2518.htm">partnership with the Japanese electronics giant Fujitsu</a> back in 2018. The partnership involves the development of IOTA as a data storage medium, with a focus on its immutability, trust and data security across the supply chain. </p>
<p>In 2019, IOTA entered the partnership with yet another global player, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jaguar-land-rover-drives-iota-up-3765.htm">Jaguar Land Rover</a>, as part of the joint effort to test a service that will allow drivers to earn tokens and make payments on the move. Drivers will be able to earn credits by enabling their cars to automatically report road condition data, such as traffic congestion or pothole locations, to navigation service providers or local traffic authorities. As a reward, drivers will be able to use earned tokens to pay for coffee, tolls, parking fees or charging of electric vehicles. </p>
<p>As of May 2019, the token’s market cap stood at USD 823 million, down from its historic peak value of USD 14 billion which was reached in early 2018. Total supply of the tokens is capped at 2.5 billion units.</p>
<p>Acquired MIOTA tokens can be stored in the <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA wallet</a> which is recommended by the developers themselves, while the <a href="https://trinity.iota.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Trinity wallet</a> remains another popular option.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/iota/">IOTA</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aeternity is an open source blockchain platform trying to improve what blockchain can offer in terms of smart contract and dapp (decentralized app) scalability. It implements state channel technology with a focus on external data sources relating to smart contracts.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5be/1bd0d9ad74.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5be/1bd0d9ad74.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5be/1bd0d9ad74.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5be/1bd0d9ad74.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5be/1bd0d9ad74.png 900w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>The Aeternity platform was launched in 2017 as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contract</a> and dapps platform focused on correcting what its designers identified as scalability-related problems faced by these technologies. Upon the launch of its testnet and the Aeternity token back in 2017, the Aeternity project garnered enough attention of the crypto community to have it rank among the top 40 currencies by market capitalization as of November 2018. Its future, however, will arguably depend on what it manages to deliver on its promise to increase the scalability of smart contracts, connect them with the external data sources and reduce the mining requirements. </p>
<p>In order to achieve this, Aeternity plays the card of implementing an array of different technologies working towards its stated goals. These are its state channel technology as a solution for the scalability problem, a hybrid consensus model combining the <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Proof of Work and Proof of Stake</a> systems and a decentralized oracle-based system tasked with connecting real-world data with smart contracts. Let’s see how these work at individual level and which specific issues they aim to tackle. </p>
<h2 id="smart-contract-scaling-problem-aeternity-wants-to-bypass">Smart Contract Scaling Problem Aeternity Wants to Bypass</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Scalability is the issue that has plagued the blockchain since the outset and it only became more pronounced with its increased adoption. In the context of smart contracts, scalability refers to the ability of this technology to handle the growth in the number of its users and manage to offer satisfactory efficiency in the face of increased demand. </p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> platform which uses its blockchain to allow for the development and deployment of smart contracts. In its current version, each smart contract on the platform is assigned to each full node. If users want to interact with their smart contracts, these programs are executed on every full node they are deployed to and this happens throughout the network. The issue came to prominence with the increasing traffic rates on the network which went in parallel with the rising popularity of this platform. Not too long ago, Ethereum <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">faced a network-wide slowdown</a> brought about by a simple game involving breeding of virtual pets, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cryptokitties/">CryptoKitties</a>. </p>
<p>As the Ethereum blockchain developed, the size of its blocks grew in parallel. The reason for this lies with its architecture i.e. the fact that Ethereum runs on the node network, with each of them storing information on the whole of transaction history as well as the data on the state of smart contracts and account balances. Considering that the number of transactions rises with each new block in the interval of 10 to 12 seconds, it is easy to see how this limitation made the management and handling of transactions and smart contracts an increasingly complex and prolonged process which could take hours. The pool of users often includes businesses that carry out their transaction on the Ethereum network whose blockchain is also the home to various cryptocurrencies. Put together, all of these factors contributed to the drop in the transaction processing rates on the Ethereum blockchain which, in turn, endangered its capability to scale together with an increasing number of its users. At the same time, the same users increasingly demand at least the same level of functionality and efficiency they became used to when using popular online payment processing systems.   </p>
<h2 id="aeternity-moves-smart-contracts-off-chain">Aeternity Moves Smart Contracts Off Chain</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Initially, blockchain platforms tried to approach the problem of scalability by increasing the sizes of blocks on their networks. The goal was to allow for the execution of the higher number of transactions per second on each block, based on the knowledge that time period needed for block verification is largely dependent on the complexity of cryptographic computations involved in it. Yet, there were some issues with this approach. Making the blocks larger in order to have them handle more transactions meant putting more demands on the mining resources one needs to have to manage them. The centralization of power as a byproduct of this would mean the removal of the users who can verify transactions from the network, leaving the enlarged blocks in the few hands of large players (such as companies) that have sufficient resources to actually run them. </p>
<p>Instead of this, Aeternity platform opts for moving smart contracts off its blockchain and having them executed with the help of the state channel technology. This technology involves the use of the communication channels which run between the contracting parties. State channels are run off the Aeternity’s blockchain, meaning that they do not get involved with it, except in the cases which entail the need for the resolution of disputes or transfers of value. In case of disagreements related to smart contracts, the problems which need adjudication are handled by using the main blockchain to send the announcement on the last known commonly agreed interaction which took place off-chain. At the same time, the blockchain is invited to pass the judgment related to the contested issue, acting as an equivalent of an impartial judicial authority. This is further ensured by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">zero-knowledge proof</a> method in relation to the contents of the smart contract in question, thus protecting its privacy. </p>
<p>The procedure ends with the settlement and the closing of the contract which are both handled on the chain. Since all other procedures related to smart contracts are managed off-chain, the throughput capacity of the Aeternity remains largely unaffected by these standard operations. </p>
<p>At the same time, transactions themselves are processed in more expeditious manner since they do not take place on the blockchain. The state channels take care of the management of fast micropayment transactions, bringing down their cost and the drain on resources. The reason for this is the fact that only the parties to a smart contract or those who are involved in the transfer or value actually have access to the information on the particular transactions which take place between them. In addition to avoiding the burdening of the network resources with unneeded information, this approach also improves the level of privacy offered to the contracting parties. This is particularly important for corporations whose smart contract can contain confidential business data, as well as for regular users who need to manage their sensitive information on the Aeternity platform.  </p>
<h2 id="aeternity-applies-functional-approach-to-smart-contract-development">Aeternity Applies Functional Approach to Smart Contract Development</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Moving the communication segment of the smart contract management off the chain does not mean that Aeternity will have easier time facing what its competitors offer as their solutions to the problem of scalability. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zilliqa/">Zilliqa</a>, for example, opts for the implementation of the <a href="https://medium.com/@giottodf/zilliqa-a-novel-approach-to-sharding-d79249347a1f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sharding technology</a> as a response to this issue. Some of competitors such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/decred/">Decred </a>employ seemingly similar approach in handling transactions on tis network off-chain (via micropayment channels). Aeternity’s competitor Ethereum focuses on stateful programming as the basis for the development of smart contract applications. </p>
<p>“Stateful” here means that its platform will keep tabs on what happens with interactions relating to smart contracts (their “state”), as opposed to the “<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/stateless" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stateless</a>” approach which keeps no evidence of earlier interactions. In case of Aeternity, its “functional” approach means that only the contracting parties remain in charge of the state of their contract, in the sense that they create inputs for it and validate them upon their execution. In separating the stateful from the functional programming, Aeternity hopes to improve the smart contract scalability, while allowing for their easier coding and storage with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/chalang" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Chalang language</a> which is optimized for the state channels on blockchain.</p>
<p>Aeternity also competes with others as the decentralized application platform. Its dapps are called “aepps” and these are being developed as open source creations which serve as a preview of what the Aeternity platform is capable of ahead of the launch of its mainnet. Aepps developed on Aeternity focus on a <a href="https://blog.aeternity.com/%C3%A6pps-update-beginning-of-april-d38bf43be3b7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mobile-first approach</a> and streamlined mobile-desktop connection as part of the platform’s aim to drive its adoption based on broader accessibility. </p>

<h2 id="aeternitys-oracle-machine">Aeternity’s Oracle Machine</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Smart contracts built on the Aeternity platform are not designed to become closed or isolated systems. Instead of this, Aeternity provides technology which will allow them to receive inputs from the outside world. These can take the form of external data which can be relevant for the execution of a smart contract. The examples include checking the information on the prices of various products or goods, monitoring election results or keeping up to date with the weather conditions. </p>
<p>To that effect, Aeternity integrates <a href="https://blog.aeternity.com/blockchain-oracles-657f134ffbc0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">oracles </a>as agents that identify real-world events and forward information on them to the blockchain the smart contracts exist on. Machine oracles act as sensors that gather and forward digital information in the format which smart contracts can read, while user oracles confirm the veracity of these information or report their own data. Each user can ask questions related to what happens in the “external world” of smart contracts and the oracles provides them with an answer. Aeternity also uses <a href="https://medium.com/@argongroup/decentralized-prediction-markets-explained-d9f0425d331c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">prediction market</a> protocol which allows users to bet on the incoming data the oracles provide.</p>
<p>Since the oracles can request and be given access to the external data sources, they can pose a security risk to the blockchain and become a vulnerable point because of their central status in the data management. Aeternity attempts to avoid this pitfall by making the information contained in the oracle data feeds immutable as soon as they arrive on the Aeternity platform. </p>
<h2 id="hybrid-consensus-model">Hybrid Consensus Model</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To make centralized data streams such as oracles less of a security problem, it is also necessary to determine if the facts they supply are “true” or “false”. At the same time, malicious attacks can make the data sources give false values, making it necessary to implement a consensus mechanism that checks the oracles and activates in case there is a disagreement. In order to achieve this, Aeternity implemented a hybrid proof of work and proof of stake consensus mechanism on its platform. Proof of work handles the consensus on the platform while the proof of stake manages the governance. While those who mine the AE coins verify new blocks based on the PoW system, Aeternity has implemented its <a href="https://blog.aeternity.com/cuckoo-cycle-memory-bandwidth-bound-pow-mining-9aa5695a4c94" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cuckoo Cycle</a> variant which allows for better scalability in terms of dynamic RAM requirements of the system. The algorithm also offers better energy efficiency and instant verification. All of this points to Aeternity’s ambition to streamline mining on easily available devices such as mobile phones in the future. Owners of the AE tokens use these as proportionate stakes based on which they vote on proposals to change and further develop the platform. </p>
<h2 id="ae-token-availability">AE Token Availability</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As the Aeternity is still in the testnet stage (as of November 2018), its Aeon token was launched as an ERC-20 token running on Ethereum. After the launch of the mainnet, these tokens will be exchanged for Aeternity coins. The tokens are used to pay the fees for transactions which take place on the Aeternity platform as well for the settlement of its smart contracts, similar to Ethereum’s gas. <br/>
The initial coin offering (ICO) for the AE took place in mid-2017 and it eventually raised USD 24 million. The coin’s current market cap (November 2018) stands at USD 280 million, down from its historic high of just over one billion USD in May 2018. The number of tokens in circulation is 233,020,472 AE. The tokens are available for trading on crypto exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/hitbtc/">HitBTC</a>.  </p>
<h2 id="the-team-behind-aeternity">The Team behind Aeternity</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Aeternity project is based in Lichtenstein. The CEO and founder of Aeternity is Yanislav Malahov who describes himself as the <a href="https://medium.com/@yanislav/king-of-bitcoin-godfather-of-ethereum-a9af9ecf56d5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">godfather of Ethereum</a> due to his early collaboration with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a>, co-founder of Ethereum.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Basic Attention Token (BAT) is a utility token and an open-source ad exchange platform. It measures users’ attention while they interact with ads and compensates both users and publishers, to allow for balanced revenue sharing between participants.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5be/9a2314be31.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5be/9a2314be31.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5be/9a2314be31.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5be/9a2314be31.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5be/9a2314be31.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5be/9a2314be31.jpeg 1940w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>Basic Attention Token is a digital advertising token which runs on the Ethereum blockchain. The BAT ecosystem is a decentralized open-source platform for advertisers, publishers and users who feel that the modern-day digital advertising is rigged in favor of intermediaries and large players such as Facebook or Google. The BAT project was launched in response to what its creators saw as increasing monopolization of the advertising business which leaves publishers and users on the receiving end. </p>
<p>At the same time, it aims to correct others issues related to digital advertising, such as compromised user privacy and an increasing number of ad frauds. The BAT token aims to do this by allowing the users to be compensated for the “attention” they give to the ads shown online, while the publishers can have more direct access to their earnings with the removal of the intermediaries. The final piece in this chain are the advertisers within the BAT ecosystem which provides them with insightful analytical data for better management and targeting of their ad campaigns. </p>
<h2 id="bat-wants-to-change-current-digital-advertising-landscape-">BAT Wants to Change Current Digital Advertising Landscape </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Key issues with the digital advertising market the BAT aims to fix actually affect three main parties in this market. These are:  </p>
<p>•	Users <br/>
•	Advertisers<br/>
•	Publishers </p>
<p>In the case of the users, the main identified problem is the erosion of their privacy and unsolicited tracking of their activities online. The reason for this is the fact that intrusive ad placements had initially failed to deliver the goods when it comes to revenues. These ads kept annoying the users since they were frequently irrelevant to their interests and hard to avoid. As the numbers of clicks on these ads dropped together with the revenues, the businesses responded by starting to gather the users’ private data and checking their browsing histories without prior approval. </p>
<p>In addition to being borderline illegal, this approach led to an increase in the use of mobile data for ads and trackers, rise in tracking malware, longer loading times for mobile users and decreased phone battery life due to ads. All of this contributed to increasing resistance to this approach from the current generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_blindness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ad-blind</a> users who are now less likely to provide private data and frequently resort to installing ad blockers. </p>
<p>The state of modern day digital advertising can be described as hurtful for the content creators and publishers as well. Illegal tracking of data and excessive advertising has led them to face difficulties in using online ads to monetize their content. As the users try to avoid the ads that accompany content, they inadvertently hurt the sole source of income for many publishers. Revenues in this segment are now actually increased by <a href="https://blog.ezoic.com/removing-ads-website-improved-ad-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">having the ads removed</a>, while the market faces the long-term duopoly of Facebook and Google as the main middlemen in this process. Just in the UK, these giants are forecast to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/15/google-facebook-uk-online-ad-revenue" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">collect over 70% of the total digital advertising spending</a>. At the same time,<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ad-fraud-loss-plummets-to-6-5-billion-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">frauds involving ads caused USD 6.5 billion in damage in 2017 alone</a>. </p>
<h2 id="bat-tokens-integration-with-brave-browser">BAT Token’s Integration with Brave Browser</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To counter this, the Basic Attention Token platform was designed with a comprehensive approach in mind, aiming to help all the parties in the digital advertising industry chain. The process starts with the tracking of the level of engagement the users have while interacting with digital ads, and the storing of the related data in a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledgers.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">distributed ledger</a> on the BAT platform. The main unit of measurement here is the user’s mental engagement or “attention” invested in viewing digital advertising content. </p>
<p>To make the attention tracking possible, the initial stage of the BAT platform implementation involved its integration with the <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Brave browser</a> which was developed by the BAT team. Brave is an open source browser built with the primary goal of delivering advanced privacy and speed to its users. This is supposed to be achieved by having Brave automatically block all malware and unwanted trackers used by the advertising middlemen. Simply put, Brave will go above &amp; beyond the call of duty when it comes to ad and web tracker blocking, aiming to outperform even dedicated ad blockers with its zero-tolerance policy approach to ad filtering. In addition to this, Brave attempts to make each visited website use HTTPS protocol to provide the users with an even higher level of browsing security.  </p>
<p>Brave will still anonymously track the user’s engagement (i.e. attention) in an anonymous and secure manner with the help of blockchain, but this type of “tracking” will not involve leaking this data to third parties which seek to profit from it. Instead of this, the user’s private information and the data gathered on where their attention is spent the most will be kept on the user’s device only.  Brave is the first browser-based integration of the BAT technology, while the ultimate aim of the developers is to have the BAT system integrated with every mainstream browser such as Chrome or Firefox. </p>
<h2 id="bat-ads-ecosystem-aims-to-benefit-users-">BAT Ads Ecosystem Aims to Benefit Users </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The data which is stored locally plays a key role in the BAT system, particularly its component called the “BAT ads”. The BAT ads’ engine includes attention measurement and analytical systems as well as machine learning capabilities. These features allow for the measurement and evaluation of the “attention value” on the BAT platform. This value is calculated for each ad and it represents the measure of incremental time which the user spends in interacting with a particular ad, as well as the proportion of the visibility of the ad pixels compared to the content which is being viewed. </p>
<p>This is the point at which the browser’s machine learning algorithms can kick in, as they effectively “instruct” the Brave (or any other browser) to show only the advertisements which hold relevance to the users and customize their showing based on the stored data. At the same time, the ads can be displayed without the possibility to link them with the identity of any particular user. As this is done locally, i.e. on a single device, there is no need for the services of third-party tracking software which would forward private data to the advertising middlemen. </p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5be/9a24043c44.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5be/9a24043c44.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5be/9a24043c44.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5be/9a24043c44.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5be/9a24043c44.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5be/9a24043c44.png 1269w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<h2 id="how-can-bat-help-advertisers-and-publishers?-">How Can BAT Help Advertisers and Publishers? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Rather than acting as an intermediary, the BAT platform attempts to link the advertisers with users in an arrangement which has the potential to be mutually beneficial. Advertisers can use BAT tokens to buy advertising space and pay the users for their attention. The process starts by providing the interested advertisers with the opportunity to use the BAT’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contract</a> system to show ads which feature locked BAT token payment to the user. Whenever a user interacts with or views the ad, a portion of this token payment is distributed to them as compensation for the time they spend in viewing an ad. </p>
<p>In return, the advertisers can increase their return on investment by having access to the analytical data which are gathered by the BAT’s machine learning and attention measurement systems. Based on these data, the advertisers can have an impartial insight into the performance of the specific ads in the field. This allows them to tailor their campaigns more easily, as the data on the user’s attention can inform their approach to creating more personalized and user-tailored ads in the future. In addition to more streamlined targeting, the BAT platform aims to use this system to reduce ad-related frauds. </p>
<p>In addition to users and advertisers, another potential beneficiary in the BAT system are publishers or content producers which host ads. They can retain ad revenue in proportion to the user attention value they create. In fact, the more efficient a publisher’s content is in drawing constant attention from the users, the larger the allocated revenue will be. Based on the BAT’s profit-sharing model, <a href="https://brave.com/braves-response-to-the-naa-a-better-deal-for-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">up to 70% of ad revenue goes to the publishers</a>. At the same time, Brave keeps 15% and leaves the users with an option to keep their 15% share or donate it to their favorite publisher. In addition to receiving a larger piece of the advertising pie usually reserved for the middlemen, the publishers using the BAT platform would be incentivized to create more engaging content on diverse publishing platforms and thus secure access to a wider range of both advertisers and users. </p>
<p>Finally, the BAT gives them the opportunity to select the particular ads which will be shown alongside their content, helping them create and offer better user experience for the content consumers. The list of <a href="https://batgrowth.com/publishers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BAT’s verified publishers is growing</a>, with its system accepted by The Washington Post, Guardian, Vimeo, Vice and others.</p>
<h2 id="brave-payments-program">Brave Payments Program</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Integration with the Brave platform allows the BAT platform to implement an additional feature which is closely related to the functionality of its token.  Once fully implemented, the Brave Payments program will make it possible for the users to provide support to their favored content producers. This system works like this:  from the total balance of tokens they receive for their time spent on ads, the users will be able to set aside a specific amount of BAT tokens and send them to their favorite publishers, content creators or websites in form of a donation, similar to the system which is being used on Patreon. To make this possible, the BAT developers developed a BAT wallet which is embedded with the Brave browser in order to allow for the easy transfer of tokens for this purpose. </p>
<p>In addition to sending donations and tips, the BAT system allows the users to spend their tokens on the platform to gain access to the restricted content or premium products, or value-added features such as photos in high resolution or data services. Another planned implementation of the token transaction system on the BAT foresees using these tokens to pay for the selected quality comments on forums or voting for them. To keep track of these transactions, users will have access to the Brave Payments dashboard which will give them information on their account balance, incoming contributions and the overview of the websites or content creators they have “tipped” with their earned BAT tokens. </p>
<h2 id="bat-token-availability-and-development-history">BAT Token Availability and Development History</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Due to its highly specific purpose and use, BAT tokens cannot be mined. The tokens were offered as part of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-an-ico.htm">ICO </a>which took place in May 2017, with their total supply fixed at the amount of 1,500,000,000 BAT. One third of the tokens were kept by the BAT team to be used as grants for the promotion of the token and the development of the user growth pools. No more tokens will be created once these pools are exhausted. In February 2018, BAT team launched the referral scheme which rewards publishers with BAT tokens if they manage to bring new users to the platform. </p>
<p>As of November 2018, the BAT’s market cap has reached the value of USD 328 million, while the currency recorded its current all-time high in early 2018 when it had the value of USD 864 billion.  BAT can be bought through its partner Uphold.com or by using the Brave wallet to convert the BTC or ETH cryptocurrency to it. At the same time, BAT is an ERC-20 token which means that it can be stored in ERC20 compatible wallets.</p>
<p>BAT tokens are available for trading on crypto exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/poloniex/">Poloniex</a>.</p>
<p>The history of the BAT token starts with the Brave Software company which was established in 2014. The mastermind behind this project is Brendan Eich, founder of Mozilla and Firefox and the inventor of the JavaScript programming language. Other important team members are security engineer Yan Zhu and Marshall Rose, inventor of the Simple Network Management Protocol. The BAT team also features advisors who are household names in the crypto scene, such as Zooko Wilcox, founder and CEO of Zcash and Ankur Nandwani, Product Manager at Coinbase.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/basic-attention-token/">Basic Attention Token</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

<h2 id="<b>what-is-bytecoin-(bcn)?</b>&#8220;><b>What is Bytecoin (BCN)?</b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Started in July 2012, Bytecoin shares its history with Monero, another popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/search/articles.htm?q=privacy+coin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy coin</a> which came about as a fork of Bytecoin. Bytecoin mission is to develop <b>a new, improved and more efficient financial system</b> that provides better and more advanced services at a lesser cost for its users.</p>
<p>The Bytecoin network is said to be built on the following principles: </p>
<ul><li><b>Self-regulation.</b> The Bytecoin financial system is a decentralized network that allows self-control for the costs required in the operation of the currency. It enables the system to identify the most optimal state when the operating efficiency is the highest. </li><li><b>Openness.</b> Bytecoin runs an open development network, meaning that everyone who joins it uses the currency and supports the system. </li><li><b>Egalitarianism.</b> The network protocol is developed to display consistent efficiency on both specialized and non-specialized computers using the network.</li></ul>
<h2 id="<b>who-can-use-bytecoin?</b>&#8220;><b>Who can use Bytecoin?</b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Three primary market segments can benefit from Bytecoin solutions &#8211; customers, businesses, and investors.</p>
<p><b>Regular users</b> can use Bytecoin to store and manage their funds securely, send free and instant international payments, set up high anonymity for the transactions and support the network by mining the currency even on an average computer. The Bytecoin emission rate is decreasing with time, so the BCN coins have a higher probability of sustaining their value.</p>
<p><b>Businesses</b> can take advantage of Bytecoin’s enterprise solutions that promote fair and open business ideals. You can send and receive instant global money transfers without fees, enjoy the network&#8217;s resistance to hacks and protect the company’s and customers&#8217; private data. It’s important to note that the system prevents automatic chargebacks as a part of its fraud protection policy, although now and then it can be a double-edged sword.</p>
<p><b>Bytecoin investors</b> have the opportunity to store their funds safely, privately, and receive annual dividends in USD and BTC. Also, large investors are eligible for unique offers.</p>
<p><b>
<h2 id="how-does-bytecoin-work?">How Does Bytecoin Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>The Bytecoin network has been built entirely from scratch using <a href="https://cryptonote.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CryptoNote</a>, a powerful privacy-oriented open-source application layer protocol. Unlike many projects, it’s not related to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> in any way except that the team behind it strives to fix all the issues of Bitcoin, focusing on user-privacy, anonymity, and fee-less transactions.</p>
<p>Everyone can become a part of the Bytecoin ecosystem by either by mining it or buying BCN on crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>Other notable features of the network are <b>transactions, reliability, deflation,</b> and <b>emission</b>. </p>
<p><b>Bytecoin Transactions</b><br/>
All transactions in the Bytecoin network are fulfilled within 120 seconds. </p>
<p>Every BCN transfer is encrypted with secure cryptographic algorithms which prevent anyone from knowing who send and received it, and how much money was sent. The transactions are carried out through its blockchain, allowing users to skip intermediaries like banks, payment gateways, and other conventional systems. The only thing a user needs is an internet connection. </p>
<p>Most blockchains keep their transactions in a public ledger, allowing everyone to track transfers between wallets. Bytecoin transactions are untraceable, immutable and unlinkable. The network achieves this by using <b>one-time keypairs</b> and <b>one-time ring signatures</b>.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/92cd751be5.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/92cd751be5.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/92cd751be5.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/92cd751be5.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/92cd751be5.png 900w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>The one-time public keys solve the issue of address reuse. It mixes identifiable funds with others to conceal the trail to the original sender and receiver. The one-time ring signatures put your unique signature in a set of other randomly selected user signatures, making it impossible to distinguish your entry apart from other users whose keys are in the ring. </p>
<p>Bytecoin users can control their signatures level of secrecy. Naturally, the more anonymous you want a transaction to be, the more resources of the network it will use, leading to higher transaction fees.</p>
<p><b>Bytecoin Network Security</b><br/>
Like the most fully decentralized blockchains, the security of the network relies on the aggregate computational power of all the computers in the system. The more power, the better the security. In this regard, your funds stored in a Bytecoin wallet are automatically secured by the network.  </p>
<p>Bytecoin’s consensus algorithm is called <b>Egalitarian Proof-of-Work (PoW)</b>. It uses a large amount of memory and makes GPU mining less efficient compared with CPU. Such design was chosen intentionally to level the playing field between powerful GPU and ASIC miners and those who try to mine with less efficient CPUs. </p>
<p><b>Bytecoin’s Emission and Deflation</b><br/>
The emission of Bytecoins (BCN) is limited to 184 740 million. The current circulating supply is 184,066,828,814 BCN, meaning that more than 99% of coins have been mined already.</p>
<p>Everyone is free to participate in the emission of Bytecoins by becoming a miner. Miners confirm that all the transactions are processed correctly and shield the transaction and personal data. Despite that, the miners are still unable to access users’ financial information.</p>
<p>The number of Bytecoins released every 120 seconds is decreasing with every new block. Hence, the mining rewards take around four years to halve. Theoretically, the coin should gain more value as its emission is reduced over the years. However, there is a tendency that blockchains which cut their block rewards experience decline in computing power, which in turn makes the network more vulnerable. Bytecoin’s website claims it’s not a significant issue for its blockchain because it trims the emissions at the slow pace.</p>
<p><b>Bytecoin Mining</b><br/>
As noted above, Bytecoin is a CPU-mined cryptocurrency using <b>Egalitarian PoW mechanism</b>, making it easy to mine on every modern PC. The block rewards lower every 120 seconds and <b>99% of BCN coins</b> are already in circulation. Anyone can join the network to mine BCN. </p>
<p>Besides that, there are few other things you should note before mining Bytecoin:</p>
<ul><li><b>The mining difficulty</b> changes according to the network hashrate. It allows the network to keep a stable block rate regardless of fluctuations in the system traffic and the number of miners.</li><li><b>The transaction sizes</b> are unlimited, but the larger transactions require higher fees.</li><li>Every Bytecoin miner can set a soft limit for a preferred <b>size of the blocks</b>. The hard limit equates to a twice the median of the preceding blocks. </li><li>Each Bytecoin user can vote for the <b>size of the blockchain</b>. </li><li><b>There’s an excess size penalty</b> for creating too large blocks. It reduces the block reward for all the large blocks. </li></ul>
<h2 id="<b>bytecoin-controversies-</b>&#8220;><b>Bytecoin Controversies </b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Bytecoin project has been surrounded by controversy since its humble beginnings in 2012. </p>
<p>First, the network has faced repercussions due to 82% of BCN being pre-mined before the networks public release. In the words of <a href="https://twitter.com/fluffypony?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Riccardo Spagni</a>, the lead developer of Monero:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/92e0c2dadf.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/92e0c2dadf.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/92e0c2dadf.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/92e0c2dadf.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/92e0c2dadf.png 900w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>Such a high centralization means the coin could be prone to manipulation by the developers. Before BCN was listed on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Binance</b></a>, it also had questionably low trading volume, which seems to support the allegations. </p>
<p>The Binance listing didn’t go without controversy, too. All the major Bytecoin exchanges had to stop BCN transactions, deposits and withdrawals due to unusually high network load. It led to miniature BCN bubble on Binance while most investors were unable to cash out their BCN holdings. Not so long after, some investors had accused Bytecoin of market manipulation. </p>
<p>The year before the infamous Binance listing, the Bytecoin blockchain experienced another issue &#8211; <b>the infinite inflation bug</b>. Apparently, all CryptoNote-based cryptocurrencies shared a software glitch which allowed for an unlimited creation of coins in a way undetectable to anyone who has no knowledge of it. The next day 1 million new BCN coins were created exploiting the bug. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Within hours of privately disclosing to CryptoNote currencies, 693 billion BCN ($1 mil+) was artificially created. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://t.co/O8MOTKGfxi">pic.twitter.com/O8MOTKGfxi</a></p>&mdash; Riccardo Spagni (@fluffypony) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/865619303651053568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2017</a></blockquote>
[<script] async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Last but not least, the Bytecoin team is completely anonymous and shows no interest in revealing their identities. Although it makes sense that the original privacy coin development team keeps their identity secret, it certainly doesn’t help the project.  The only official company&#8217;s spokesperson is <a href="https://twitter.com/jnfgoldberg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jenny Goldberg</a>. She is also responsible for Bytecoin community management. </p>
<p>All the Bytecoin problems raise concern among the currency supporters and investors. Due to these issues, the original privacy coin has lost the leadership position to more trustworthy privacy coins like Monero and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zcash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zcash</a>. </p>
<h2 id="<b>current-state-of-the-project</b>&#8220;><b>Current State of the Project</b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In spite of controversies surrounding the project, the Bytecoin team continues to work. Recently, they announced many updates, plans, and new partnerships.</p>
<p>Bytecoin is already preparing to release v3.4.0 of its software. Besides, it has a fully functioning web, mobile and desktop wallets. Also, Bytecoin Daemons enable ecommerce merchants to accept BCN for their services.</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s blog is full of regular updates regarding the latest releases, partnerships, and guides &#8211; the latest news cover Android wallet release, Gate.io listing, and news about Bytecoin hardfork.</p>
<p>Recently, the team has released a roadmap update for Q4 2018 &#8211; Q1 2019.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/92f136e00f.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/92f136e00f.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/92f136e00f.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/92f136e00f.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/92f136e00f.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/92f136e00f.png 2048w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>At the moment, the network prepares to implement Amethyst update, which promises to introduce: </p>
<p><b>
<ul><li>HD wallets</li><li>New unlinkable addresses</li><li>A new design of the signature scheme</li><li>New minimal anonymity requirements</li><li>An improved P2P protocol</li><li>Auditable wallets. </li></ul></b></p>
<p>Regardless of the developments, the project is unable to rid of uncertainty. On October 8, 2018, it was delisted from Binance. A few days later it was delisted from OKEx, too. The exchange <a href="https://support.okex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018129711" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> the following reason for Bytecoin’s removal: </p>
<p><i>“Our regular monitoring of Bytecoin found that the project has been exposed to a critical technical issue that has been left unhandled. To protect the interests of our users, OKEx will delist all BCN trading pairs at 19:00 Oct 12, 2018 (HKT). All depositing and trading services of BCN will be terminated after the date.”</i></p>
<p>All in all, Bytecoin seems like a decent project with great technology. However, many incidents, allegations, and controversies should raise doubts about the anonymous developers behind the project, their motivations, and intentions. </p>
<h2 id="<b>where-to-buy-bytecoin?-</b>&#8220;><b>Where to Buy Bytecoin? </b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since its launch in 2016, Stratis has evolved from the blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) provider into a platform which supports the development of apps on private, enterprise-grade blockchains. The platform’s main currency is the Stratis token (STRAT).</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c2/6425f94ac0.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c2/6425f94ac0.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c2/6425f94ac0.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c2/6425f94ac0.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c2/6425f94ac0.png 900w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p>While the <a href="https://stratisplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Stratis</a> platform has changed its scope and tech over time, it never strayed too far from its main goal: helping the enterprises reap the benefits of the blockchain technology in a highly streamlined manner. The main idea is to combine the model of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cloud computing</a> with blockchain in order to reduce the pressure on the businesses to provide support for running a full-blown blockchain with their own resources. </p>
<p>Technologically, this is to be achieved by combining the cloud computing with the following tools:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://stratisplatform.com/files/Stratis_Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Lite clients</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bitcoinmining.com/sidechains-explained/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sidechains</a></li><li><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Application programming interfaces (APIs)</a> </li></ul>
<p>While Stratis started out as the platform for the provision of logistical support to the companies wanting to deploy blockchain, it soon shifted its focus on becoming a blockchain development network which allows for the speedy creation of custom blockchains and simplified development of apps on it. With this goal in mind, the Stratis team promises to resolve the following issues with the existing blockchain technology: </p>
<ul><li><b>Implementation of blockchain technology can be desirable and profitable for businesses, but it often comes with huge price tags relating to the deployment of infrastructure, maintenance and security.</b> Cloud-based blockchain services come at a lower cost as they are provided via web interfaces using remote infrastructure maintained by Stratis, instead of being maintained by the businesses which need those services. </li><li><b>Even when companies have access to the blockchain, tailoring it to the needs of individual businesses comes off as a demanding process which the Stratis wants to simplify.</b> With the Stratis platform, the organizations have an opportunity to get access to their own private chains which are customized based on their needs and available resources while being linked to the parent Stratis chain. </li><li><b>Running a blockchain means that businesses often do not have full control over its features and that they are unable to ensure continued development of appropriate apps on it.</b> With Stratis, the process of application development is simplified by allowing the use of C Sharp (C#) programming language, Microsoft .NET framework and other more frequently used systems compared to, for example, C++ in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Core" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bitcoin Core</a>. In addition to this, the Stratis personnel is available as a consultant in the process of building and hosting dApps and smart contracts with the help of the Stratis technology. </li></ul>
<h2 id="how-does-stratis-baas-model-work?-">How Does Stratis’ BaaS Model Work? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Stratis platform encompasses various components:  </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchainasaservice-baas.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Blockchain-as-a-Service</a> (BaaS) platform</li><li>Private chains</li><li>Stratis Smart Contract platform</li><li>One-Click Deployment system</li><li>ICO Platform</li><li>Stratis Identity solution</li></ul>
<p>Starting out as the BaaS platform gave Stratis enough time to align its implementation of blockchain with the features of the cloud computing model. Users who subscribe to its BaaS model, such as companies, are relieved of the need to maintain costly full client nodes if they need access to the blockchain. Instead of this, Stratis will be in charge of managing blockchain networks and distributed ledgers via cloud computing. This entails providing the company with access to: </p>
<p>a) Blockchain infrastructure<br/>
b) The platform it runs on<br/>
c) Software needed for its management.</p>
<p>The advantages of this approach supposedly lie in the fact that this approach allows the companies to refocus the time and resources they would spend on running blockchain on improving their daily business instead. At the same time, there is no need for them to hire expert personnel needed to run blockchain and pay attention to issues issues such as scalability. While the financial companies were the initial target group for its BaaS model, Stratis has since expanded its scope to target any business which wants Stratis to customize its ledger to its specific needs via APIs or lite clients.  In 2018, the Stratis solution was made available in the BaaS segment of the Microsoft Azure’s marketplace. </p>
<h2 id="how-can-stratis-private-chains-help-businesses?">How Can Stratis’ Private Chains Help Businesses?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Apart from offering blockchain as a service, Stratis aims to become the turnkey solution provider for businesses that want to create their own personalized blockchains or the sidechains. While these private blockchains are launched by third parties (companies, institutions or organizations) they are fully anchored to the main blockchain provided by Stratis. The sidechains are developed with the assistance provided by Stratis and the clients are able to access them via clients and APIs.</p>
<p>While the use cases for these private chains may vary, they should help the businesses with the following: </p>
<ul><li><b>Sidechains allow for the deployment of apps without the need for the maintenance of an entire network, as this option is often rather costly for businesses.</b> In addition to lower costs, this option lends itself as an arguably more secure and stable solution, since the sidechains are linked to the main Stratis chain. </li><li><b>Sidechains are presented as easy-to-use platforms for companies to test their applications running on the blockchain.</b> In addition to learning more about their creations’ performance and familiarizing themselves with the blockchain technology, the companies can shorten the time needed for their applications’ deployment.</li><li><b>Sidechains can have their own currencies.</b> These currencies can be used as a means to acquire gas which is used for running smart contracts. These assets can also be exchanged for the STRAT token with the help of the system which enables the withdrawal of deposits. </li><li><b>Sidechains are compatible among themselves,</b> making it easier to manage the transfer of assets and values between them.</li></ul>
<p>Whatever their specific implementation may be, all Stratis users will have an opportunity to customize various operational aspects of their sidechains. This includes changes to their block sizes (if a businesses need to process a higher volume of transactions, for example), methods of transaction management and approaches to the storage of the metadata.  While sidechains can operate almost independently, their security is derived from the Stratis parent chain as they run on the base code this chain was built on.  </p>
<p>Another important characteristic of the private chains is their autonomy from their counterparts, i.e. the Stratis platform makes it possible to introduce changes to one’s custom chain without this having impact on other chains on the same platform.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-one-click-deployment-system?">What is One-Click Deployment System?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In order to make the access to blockchain features easier and compete more efficiently with the likes of Ethereum, Lisk and Ark, Stratis had to implement a fast tool for the blockchain deployment, literally with a single click. The system named “one-click deployment” allows for the out-of-the-box functionality of deployed sidechains, together with the features of the Stratis parent chain. </p>
<p>With its one-click node provisioning system, the Stratis users can also deploy sidechains to other crypto platforms (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BitShares and Lisk) and get access to the features that are not part of the Stratis package. In fact, the Stratis team invites its users to test different platforms they want to combine with their own solution, with the goal of bringing their use in line with their specific business goals. Newcomers in this field are also invited by the Stratis to use its consultancy services to make this transition to the most appropriate blockchain as smooth as possible. </p>
<h2 id="stratis-as-the-smart-contract-and-ico-platform">Stratis as the Smart Contract and ICO Platform</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In addition to its focus on the blockchain and its business implementation, Stratis developers push their solution as a smart contract and ICO platform.</p>
<p>Smart contracts developed on the Stratis platform are primarily aimed at the users who want to deploy their own enterprise blockchain. These contracts are written in C# and present themselves as fully .NET framework compatible systems. Smart contract development with Stratis comes with the promise of the following benefits: </p>
<p>a) The Stratis’ use of sidechains is described as a means to prevent the bloating which takes place when the number of smart contracts on a single blockchain gets too high. <br/>
b) Security of smart contracts is also ensured by the separation of sidechains and the main blockchain which is protected from the various negative impacts a smart contract may have. <br/>
c) Smart Contracts in C# undergo comprehensive verification during their deployment and before they are activated on the blockchain. <br/>
d) Due to the fact that all tokens developed on sidechains are pegged to the Stratis token, the gas used for running smart contracts is provided by them. </p>
<p>The Stratis team has also created an ICO platform for launching initial coin offerings on its blockchain. This service is separated into various packages (the entry-level one is free to use) with customizable layouts and integration with the <a href="https://changelly.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Changelly exchange</a> for better currency support.   </p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-stratis-identity-app?">What Is the Stratis Identity App?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Another offshoot of the Stratis technology is the Stratis Identity app which is used for identity management and storage on the blockchain. The customers can use it to confirm their identities and verify personal information with the help of the blockchain.  The app is supposed to find the following business and non-business uses:</p>
<ul><li>Verification of identities prior to financial transactions</li><li>Checking employment history and records</li><li>Getting insight into the users’ identities prior to meeting them in person (for business or private reasons)</li></ul>
<h2 id="what-is-stratis-architecture-built-on?">What Is Stratis’ Architecture Built On?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The architecture of the Stratis platform runs on three main components: </p>
<ul><li><b>Stratis Bitcoin Full Node.</b> This segment is the “engine” of the platform and it runs its interface, infrastructure and node policy layers. It is also in charge of running the Proof-of-Stake algorithm which ensures the consensus on the Stratis network. Full Nodes on this platform hold a copy of the Stratis blockchain, with the support being provided for the Bitcoin blockchain as well. These nodes ensure autonomous validation of transactions and blocks on these two chains. The C# Full Node was launched in December 2018. </li><li><b>LibConsensus is the library in which the Bitcoin Core provides a portion of the Consensus Layer code.</b> In turn, the Consensus Layer manages the validation of blocks. </li><li><b>NBitcoin is part of both the Consensus Layer and the Network Layer on the Stratis network.</b> NBitcoin is a cross-platform Bitcoin implementation developed in C# which also uses Microsoft .NET framework. It is involved in the messaging between the nodes which exist as parts of the Network Layer.  </li></ul>
<figure style="max-width: 598px"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c2/6429f7b6ac.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 598px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c2/6429f7b6ac.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c2/6429f7b6ac.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c2/6429f7b6ac.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c2/6429f7b6ac.jpg 900w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<h2 id="how-does-stratis-approach-scalability?">How Does Stratis Approach Scalability?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Scalability is one of the frequently mentioned issues related to blockchain platforms. Stratis aims to address them in three main ways:   </p>
<ul><li>Private blockchains on the Stratis platform are configurable, which means that businesses and individual users can determine the size of its blocks based on their needs and resources.</li><li>Scalability should be more manageable based on the platform’s elimination of a single ledger and support for the deployment of individual ledgers on a host chain.</li><li>The proof-of-stake model is seen as balancing the interests of end-users and the full nodes in charge of securing the platform. </li></ul>
<h2 id="which-industries-may-profit-from-implementing-stratis?--">Which Industries May Profit from Implementing Stratis?  </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Stratis team has identified specific industries which may be the prime targets for the use of their technology. These are:</p>
<ul><li><b>Medicine.</b> This is primarily related to the medical research field, as the results of these endeavors will be stored in the databases as immutable records available for perusal by researchers, reviewers and publishers.</li><li><b>Product verification.</b> Here, the Stratis blockchain aims to become the platform for the storage of information on verified and authentic products, thus reducing the chance of them being counterfeited and helping with their tracking.  </li><li><b>Financial industry.</b> Stratis is seen as the technical foundation for the future fintech systems which would manage settlements, clearance, escrows, identities, know-your-customer practices etc. </li><li><b>Supply chains.</b> Verticals such as transport and tourism are increasingly relying on the Internet of Things which profits from fast and real-time consensus on their supply chain networks. Stratis is supposed to make these interactions less dependent on human interactions.</li></ul>
<h2 id="the-strat-token">The STRAT Token</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Stratis Token (STRAT) is the currency which ensures the transfer of value on the Stratis platform. The token holders reap rewards for staking the STRAT, provided that they have met the tier value required to run a node. The token also serves as the gas on the platform and is available as a means of payment for transactions on the network. In addition to this, the users can also invest in it by buying it on crypto exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bittrex/">Bittrex </a>and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/poloniex/">Poloniex</a>. The tokens can be stored in various ways, with the recommended one being the use of the <a href="https://stratisplatform.com/wallets/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">officially supported wallets</a> such as Stratis Core and Breeze Wallet.</p>
<p>The ICO for Stratis took place between June and July 2016, raising 915 Bitcoin in total or approximately USD 675,000. As of December 2018, its market cap stood at more than USD 147 million, down from the historic spike of just above USD 2 billion from early 2018. </p>
<h2 id="the-stratis-team">The Stratis Team</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p> </p>
<p>The Stratis project is the brainchild of Chris Trew, an IT industry veteran with a background in finances. He joined forces with Nicolas Dorier, a key developer behind the NBitcoin which was incorporated into the Stratis platform, and one of the developers of the Bitcoin Core. The team has headquarters in the UK, while its members reside in various parts of the world.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/stratis/">Stratis</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ark?-">What is ARK? </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Billed as the “All-in-One” blockchain solution, the <a href="https://ark.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ark platform</a> is all about linking various chains and customizing them for a broader range of use cases. To make this possible, its creators focused on creating a decentralized ecosystem focused on empowering its users to design and deploy their own blockchains without too much hassle. This is supposed to reflect the platform’s aim to become a flexible solution for the real-life problems which are solvable by blockchain, instead of “theoretical” ones.   Let’s see which features are promoted by the ARK team in response to this general goal:</p>
<ul><li><b>Full decentralization is a shortcut to bringing as many users to the blockchain as possible</b>. The ARK platform has implemented a modified <a href="https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake (DPoS)</a> consensus mechanism. It features a strictly limited number of delegates who are in charge of keeping the network operational in exchange for block rewards, resembling those received by miners with other cryptocurrencies.  The Ark’s DPoS version features an adaptive voting system and is said to incorporate some improvements over previous DPoS implementations.</li><li><b>The ARK team sees lacking speeds as yet another obstacle to implementing blockchain as a solution suitable for frequent transactions</b>. With its current 8-second block generation time, ARK aims to become one of the faster solutions in the crypto industry. According to its developers, shortening the time the users need to spend on transaction processing should bring the ARK closer to becoming a full-blown transaction platform.  </li><li><b>ARK wants to keep blockchain technology both “lean” and scalable with the help of its SmartBridge technology</b>. ARK’s Smart Bridges are a customized technology which supports offloading of the non-essential functions to other side-chains. In addition to keeping the ARK blockchain fast, this technology is supposed to resolve the issue of scalability i.e. the ability of blockchain to deal with the increasing size of its user base. </li><li><b>SmartBridge technology is also supposed to promote building connections among various blockchains which are in use today</b>. One of the features of the ARK project is to help with building an ecosystem consisting of as many interlinked blockchains as possible. Blockchains which are said to be “bridged” in this manner can establish communication and perform common tasks and advanced functions. In addition to incorporating various chains, ARK will offer support for a broader range of coding languages to be used with the platform.  </li><li><b>ARK platform seeks to enforce open source principles among its users: Recognizing that the needs for blockchain within individual projects may differ, ARK developers allowed the platform users to launch their own blockchains based off the Ark main net</b>. By being effectively “cloned” from the ARK model, these offshoot chains can be made compatible with the Ark’s SmartBridge technology for reaping additional benefits of using the platform. </li></ul>
<p><b>
<h2 id="how-does-ark-work?">How Does Ark Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Operation of the Ark platform is based on the implementation of three main components:</p>
<ul><li>SmartBridges</li><li>Support for alternative programming languages</li><li>Push button deployable blockchains</li></ul>
<p>With SmartBridges, the ARK team <a href="https://blog.ark.io/what-is-the-ark-smartbridge-and-how-does-it-work-1dd7fb1e17a0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">seeks</a> to unify features of various coins used across different chains, as well as make each application on them more accessible to a larger audience. The proposed advantages of this approach should be more significant compared to what could be achieved by relying on one chain alone. This is to be done by focusing on seamless communication between otherwise incompatible chains and enabling triggering of various events across them. To make it possible, the Ark’s SmartBridge model relies on the implementation of the <b>Encoded Listener</b> technology paired with data sets called <b>Vendor Fields</b>.</p>
<p><b>
<h2 id="what-are-the-arks-encoded-listeners?-">What Are the Ark’s Encoded Listeners? </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>An Encoded Listener node functions as a “listening post” for transactions taking place across multiple chains. They are created by inserting several lines of code into a single blockchain, allowing it to connect to the Ark blockchain as the hub and use listener nodes to track inputs on several blockchains. Their implementation should be easy as it is not supposed to have an impact on the regular operation of the blockchain. Chains involved in this type of collaboration allow their designated listener nodes to communicate with their counterparts via the Ark blockchain. </p>
<p>This is where the Vendor Fields come into play, as these specialized data sections contain information on tasks which a particular encoded listener nodes can perform. The nodes regularly check the vendor field data in order to find out what the can “do”, while the setting of a dedicated node remains an option for any party wanting to help the network run better. </p>
<p>The encoded listener nodes can be particularly beneficial for exchange platforms such as <a href="https://changelly.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Changelly</a> or <a href="https://shapeshift.io/#/coins" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Shapeshift</a>. In this case, the encoded listeners would help them identify a transaction type as the one involving exchange. In this case, these nodes effectively become intermediaries for transactions taking place with the help of SmartBridges, with the added opportunity for the exchanges to charge their regular transaction fees for exchange operations and maintenance of the data flow.</p>
<p><b>
<h2 id="how-could-smartbridge-work-in-practice?-">How Could SmartBridge Work in Practice? </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>While the SmartBridge technology is still in the early stages of its deployment, the Ark team has already offered support for some of the major chains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. In practice, its workflow may unfold along these lines:</p>
<ul><li>If the user wants to trigger an event on one blockchain by means of another one, the first thing to do is to verify if that chain is compatible with SmartBridge.</li><li>If everything checks out, the user can forward the SmartBridge transaction to any compatible blockchain with the help of the Ark wallet. For example, having a SmartBridge connecting Ethereum and Ark chains allows for the management and execution of the Ark-based transactions via the interface used to access Ethereum and vice versa.</li><li>In the case of exchanges, the SmartBridge would allow a user to send a certain amount of ARK tokens to the wallet they have with a particular exchange. At the same time, the exchange would identify the transaction and provide for automatic conversion of ARK tokens into the desired cryptocurrency before the funds end up in the user’s wallet.</li></ul>

<p><b>
<h2 id="how-can-ark-offer-better-accessibility?-">How Can Ark Offer Better Accessibility? </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Providing support for a wide range of programming languages is the approach by which the Ark platform hopes to reach a broader base of software developers. Included support for 18 mainstream and “alternative” languages, including Python, Elixer, RPC, Java,.NET and others, should make the Ark a more accessible solution not just for devs, but for the users who want to create their home-brew blockchains.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Ark team also hopes to work on a user-friendly interface, with which the deployment of blockchain can be reduced to interacting with a push button. In fact, Ark wants to support an easier development of individual projects by allowing its users to create their own blockchains which are, in essence, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">forked</a> from the Ark chain. Forks created in this manner should be a viable option for startups, since they would still offer the key features of the Ark “parent” chain, such as SmartBridge technology. </p>
<p><b>
<h2 id="arks-delegated-proof-of-stake">Ark’s Delegated Proof-of-Stake</h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>The Ark platform runs a modified Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. Instead of having miners secure both the transactions and the network they run on, the Ark achieves this by relying on delegates. While the number of prospective delegates is virtually limitless, only the holders of the ARK tokens are ultimately designated as such through the use of the voting system. <br/>
The number of active delegates who can be voted on is capped at 51. The 51 nodes which receive the highest number of votes become eligible to forge ARK blocks. This system is supposed to reduce the risk of having large ARK holders or organizations take over the network by constantly voting for their favored forging nodes. </p>
<p>The underlying system works as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Token holders can vote for a single delegate at a time only. There is a related voting fee to be paid in the amount of 1 ARK. The same fee applies to “unvoting” a delegate, whenever that right is exercised. The team behind the platform plans to further reduce the fees on the network. </li><li>While the Ark users are encouraged to vote regularly, not all votes are born equal: the more ARK tokens one possesses, the more weight his/her vote has. Registering as a delegate costs 25 ARK. </li><li>The blocks on the Ark network are forged every 8 seconds, with each delegate receiving 2 ARK tokens for the block they forge. Upon the launch, the Ark platform featured 125 million ARK tokens in the genesis block.  </li><li>Delegate candidates involved in the voting process can try to secure their election by preparing written proposals detailing their plan of operations and the ways im which the platform could be made more secure. </li><li>In addition to this, the delegates can try to secure votes by offering participation in profit sharing schemes. These are related to the rewards they get for forging new blocks, with potential voters being able to get their cut in forms of dividends which are distributed over time. </li><li>Another popular option for the delegates is to promise to fund a development project oriented towards promoting the better operation of the Ark platform. The voters may be offered an equity stake in the proposed project or given access to freely provided services. </li></ul>
<p><b>
<h2 id="how-does-delegate-voting-work-with-ark?-">How Does Delegate Voting Work with Ark? </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Voting for delegates as part of the Ark’s DPoS system is possible only after one picks out one of the available wallets for storing ARK tokens. The process encompasses several basic steps:</p>
<ul><li>First, one needs to set aside some tokens which are to be transferred. Tokens can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bittrex/">Bittrex</a>. The full list of exchanges trading in ARK is available <a href="https://ark.io/exchanges" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</li><li>Tokens purchased from an exchange are sent to the public address found with the user’s wallet. </li><li>One of the more practical wallet options is to use those offered on the Ark’s website.  They include a <a href="https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">desktop wallet</a>, <a href="https://arkecosystem.github.io/paper-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">paper wallet</a> and <a href="https://arkecosystem.github.io/ark-lite-wallet/app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">web lite wallet</a> together with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ark.wallet.mobile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Android wallet</a> and  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobile-ark/id1324625967?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">iOS wallet</a>. </li><li>Sending ARK is made possible based on the network’s existing <a href="https://blog.ark.io/towards-flexible-marketplace-with-ark-dynamic-fees-running-on-new-core-31f1aaf1e867" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dynamic fee system</a> which replaced the earlier one running on fixed fees.  Delegates can determine their own minimum acceptable fee involving various transaction types. Fees are paid to the forging delegate in charge of processing blocks which feature these fees. The larger the fee set by the user, the faster the inclusion of the transaction in a block will be.</li></ul>
<p>As of February 2019, more than 108 million ARK tokens were in circulation, out of 139 million of the total planned supply. In the same period, the currency itself had the market cap of USD 52 million, down from its historic high of USD 910 million in January 2018.</p>

<p>The current iteration of the Ark platform is capable of processing 18.75 transactions per second i.e. 150 transactions per block. For 2019, the team promises to offer support for four new transaction types, with these being: </p>
<ol type="1"><li>Timelock, as a simplified smart contract function that restricts the spending at particular addresses unless a particular time or block height requirement is met.</li><li>Multipayments, with its ability to combine payments with the goal of reducing the payload on the blockchain and handling larger transaction volumes.  </li><li>Delegate resignation, with the option for the delegate to resign their position and preventing the community to vote for the delegate in question.</li><li>IPFS, as the way to secure easier timestamping, verification and encryption of files via a dedicated interface. </li></ol>
<p>The ARK plans to control currency inflation from the outset, with planned reduction going from 6.31% in the first year to 4.02% percent in the tenth year of its launch. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NEM coin (XEM) is the cryptocurrency unit of its namesake platform. The platform aims to make the blockchain-based projects more flexible and easier to run by relying on its proof-of-importance algorithm and Smart Asset system.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-nem">What Is NEM</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>NEM is the coin powering the New Economy Movement (NEM), a blockchain-based platform. It started as a pet project of the Bitcointalk forum user going under the name of “UtopianFuture”. Initially, it was supposed to be built upon the <a href="https://nxtplatform.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nxt platform</a>, yet it was eventually built from scratch and launched in 2015. At the heart of NEM lies the Smart Asset System whose blockchain is used to manage transactions and develop apps on the network with the focus on customizability. This is achieved by the lack of need to use NEM software to run apps, as the platform allows for customization via API (application programming interface) calls. Thus, it becomes possible to control its features using any programming language. </p>
<p>Unlike its competitor <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> which places focus on the decentralization and transparency, the NEM platform goes for partial centralization. This allows its users to run private and public blockchains, like it does in the case of the <a href="https://nem.io/enterprise/mijin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mijin blockchain-building system</a>. This way, the users have more control over who can see the stored data and assets on the network. In addition to Ethereum, NEM will have to compete with the likes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/neo/">NEO</a> and Lisk which also play the card of promoting blockchain solutions for business. </p>
<p>Regarding assets, NEM uses the system of so-called mosaics which stand for any type of assets such as currency, coin, vote or signature. The assets are stored in the addresses and can be transferred and configured based on the individual user’s needs.  </p>
<p>The NEM platform uses the <a href="https://www.mycryptopedia.com/proof-of-importance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proof-of-importance</a> (PoI) consensus mechanism. In this case, the consensus is checked against the importance score assigned to each node. This is done with the help of XEM coins. The coins the users hold in their wallets are vested and will add to the importance of their accounts over time. Once they gather at least 10,000 XEM coins, their importance score will rise. In addition, the more transaction one makes on the network, the more “important” a participant can become. Finally, the score will be checked by the system to determine if a user can add blocks to the blockchain in the process called “harvesting.” </p>
<p>As of today (November 2018), 8.9 billion coins were created, with the market cap valued at USD 821 million. The coin reached its all-time high in early 2018, with its market cap reaching the value of USD 17 billion. </p>

<h2 id="what-is-veritaseum-(veri)?-">What is Veritaseum (VERI)? </h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Veritaseum is a blockchain-based fintech software company which delivers global access to peer-to-peer capital markets through its decentralized platform, digital asset research, and transfers. </p>
<p>At heart, the project seeks to level the economic playing field by creating software which enables participation in P2P capital markets without intermediates like banks, brokers, financial advisors, and other mediators. Anyone with an internet connection can sign up for these capital markets using Veritaseum.</p>
<p><b>The Difference Between Veritaseum and Veritas</b><br/>
Veritaseum is a software company, while Veritas (VERI; not to be confused with Veritas Mining or VeriCoin (VRC)) is a crypto token used to pay for Veritaseum’s products and services. </p>
<ul><li>The official ticker symbol for Veritaseum token: VERI</li><li>Token type: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/erc20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERC20</a></li><li>Total token supply: 100 million VERI</li><li>Circulating Supply: 2,036,645 VERI</li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2VyTD2UEyLTTERVNHFPY2x1b00/view" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Veritas Paper</a> &#8211; a brief introduction to Veritaseum products and services. </li></ul>
<p><b>
<h2 id="what-is-the-veritas-(veri)-token?">What Is The Veritas (VERI) Token?</h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>The Veritas (VERI) are ERC-20 tokens issued on Ethereum blockchain. They can be stored in any Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger Nano S, Trezor, Parity, etc.). It also implies that miners verify all VERI transactions, and token holders are protected by the advanced security of the Ethereum network. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Veritaseum’s website states that its products are not dependent on any particular blockchain and can be moved to different blockchains. Such a move would require some engineering efforts, but the company expects most new blockchains to be backward-compatible with most Ethereum applications.</p>
<p>The use case of VERI token is to redeem with Veritaseum software for advisory services, research and to gain entry into Veritaseum’s autonomous financial machines, P2P value trading system, and P2P letters of credit. </p>
<p>The company also warns users that Veritas tokens are not an investment, but rather an essential part of the software. However, the company cannot prevent token holders from speculating on its value.</p>
<h2 id="<b>how-veritas-(veri)-works?-</b>&#8220;><b>How Veritas (VERI) Works? </b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Veritaseum offers tools and software to participate in peer-to-peer capital markets. The platforms utility token VERI is used to purchase access to the platform&#8217;s products and services, which range from asset tokenization to financial research data and even self-custody escrow services.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company offers both centralized and decentralized solutions. </p>
<p><b>Veritaseum’s Centralized Solutions</b><br/>
The centralized Veritaseum’s solutions are for institutions which are not yet ready to take part in decentralized capital market systems. It runs on servers that are controlled by the client organization. The centralized services include:</p>
<ul><li>A digital exchange made for prime brokerages and exchanges. </li><li>Smart arbitrage system which provides cross-platform liquidity for trading digital assets. </li></ul>
<p>A simple example would be an institution like <a href="https://www.jamstockex.com/jamaica-stock-exchange-jse-blockchain-technology/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jamaican Stock Exchange</a>, which can utilize Veritaseum’s centralized solution for trading immutable digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p><b>Veritaseum’s Decentralized Solutions</b><br/>
Veritaseum’s decentralized software runs on top of Ethereum blockchain. It allows individuals and organizations to trade digital assets without expensive brokerages and intermediaries. </p>
<p>Veritaseum&#8217;s smart contracts enforce transactions on mutually agreed terms. Therefore, the agreements cannot be broken, and both parties are bound to deliver under all and any circumstances. Such use of blockchain technology enables Veritaseum’s users to deal at much lower costs compared with traditional financial services. </p>
<p>In total, six distinct products constitute Veritaseums distributed services: VeADIR, VeRent, VeResearch, VeExposure, VeManagement, VeTokenizaton and VeAssets.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/69b32c52ca.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/69b32c52ca.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/69b32c52ca.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/69b32c52ca.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/69b32c52ca.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/69b32c52ca.png 841w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p><b>VeADIR</b><br/>
VeADIR stands for Veritaseum Autonomous Distributed Interactive Research. It is the core component of the platform. It gives exposure to vetted research subjects and serves opportunities to grow its asset base through positive risk-adjusted returns. For instance, if someone wants to invest in an ICO and needs comprehensive information to weigh the risks, they can submit a query via VeADIR, pay with VERI and receive the requested information from Veritaseum. Research results then are fed back into the VeADIR system, and the cycle continues. All information is transmitted in machine learning language and needs to be translated to common vernacular using smart contracts.</p>
<p>Also, VeADIR allows purchases based on previous research. Everyone can purchase constructed model portfolios built on the research findings.  </p>
<p>Users can order entire research reports or choose to pay-per-query. Whenever you request information on the specific organization, VeADIR contacts it and compensates with VERI for the answers. This information exchange also works the other way around &#8211; any organization can request VeADIR to be analyzed and receive compensation in VERI, too.</p>
<p>At the moment, the application is still in beta. The future ambition is to make VeADIR 100% autonomous with AI, so it can handle user requests automatically instead of sending the queries to be verified by the Veritaseum team.</p>
<p>In order to use VeADIR you need to:</p>
<ol type="1"><li>Set up a MetaMask account using your browser (Chrome, Safari or Firefox).</li><li>Choose whether you want to sign up as an individual or entity. </li><li>Pass AML/KYC verification and get verified as a real person or organization. </li><li>Obtain VERI tokens to submit queries to VeADIR. </li></ol>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Business and not=for-profit entity level AML/KYC now available in the VeADIR. Now businesses can sign almost as quickly as individuals. Who is YOUR favorite, fully functional DAPP!!!

[<script] async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p><b>VeRent</b><br/>
VeRent is the platforms rent component for peer-to-peer, over-the-counter VERI token exchange. Here, exposure buyers and seekers can rent or acquire Veritas tokens if they want to use VeADIR software suite services. The platform creators stress the fact that VeRent is not an exchange nor a marketplace to buy or sell securities.  </p>
<p><b>VeExposure</b><br/>
According to the company’s website, WeExposure “offers direct access to VeADIR for users that are able to provide both VERI and Ether for an exposure.” In other words, it is a unique facility made for assisting people with available VeADIR access opportunities.</p>
<p><b>VeResearch</b></p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/69cc8088f8.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/69cc8088f8.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/69cc8088f8.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/69cc8088f8.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/69cc8088f8.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/69cc8088f8.png 1115w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p><sub><i>Source: Veritas.veritaseum.com</i></sub></p>
<p>VeResearch is the platforms human-made research counterpart to VeADIR. The team has a proven track record of fundamental, forensic and macro analysis and has been studying economics and valuation of distributed systems since 2013. VeResearch offers users a chance to obtain investment models for any crypto asset analyzed by the platform. These models are meant to supplement those built by VeADIR, but interested parties can also purchase the valuations separately.</p>
<p><b>VeManagement</b><br/>
VeManagement is Veritaseum’s portfolio management app and back-end administration tool for the VeADIR portfolio. Here, platform users can preview and manage the model portfolio made with VeResearch by signing them with their private keys.</p>
<p><b>VeTokenization </b><br/>
An automated system designed to create custom Veritas tokens with new assets, opportunities or exposures at VeADIR. It consists of an admin web app, asset configuration sheet, and an Ethereum registry contract.</p>
<p><b>VeAsset</b><br/>
VeAsset module is one of the latest developments in VeADIR’s ecosystem. It’s a module for transacting fully redeemable, secured and insured VeGold, VeSilver, and VeSTB tokens. Each of these tokens is 100% <a href="https://veritas.veritaseum.com/index.php/vegld-asset-backed-tokens" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">backed by their assets</a> (0.999% Gold, Silver, and a mixture of precious metals). These tokens represent the title to ownership of these assets and can be traded on the platform. </p>
<h2 id="<b>how-can-you-veritize-an-asset?</b>&#8220;><b>How Can You “Veritize” An Asset?</b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To “Veritize” an asset means assigning a customized VERI token to a particular asset. Think of token with unique properties which are bound to it via smart contract. That way you can Veritize almost any asset. For example, take a building lease, tokenize it and trade it on the digital asset exchange. </p>
<p>Here’s a more elaborate explanation of the process. </p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/69dbf6b9bb.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/1/5c0/69dbf6b9bb.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/2/5c0/69dbf6b9bb.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/3/5c0/69dbf6b9bb.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/4/5c0/69dbf6b9bb.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/coins-attachments/0/5c0/69dbf6b9bb.png 798w"  alt="" class="content-img" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p> </p>
<p><b>
<h2 id="token-sale-&amp;-controversy">Token Sale &amp; Controversy</h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Veritas token sale lasted from 25 April 2017 until 26 May 2017. During one month, the company has managed to raise from $6,480,882 to $12 million (varies per source) in Ether. 30 VERI were issued for 1 ETH. </p>
<p>However, the ICO didn’t go without blunders, as <a href="https://www.cointelligence.com/content/veritaseum-ico-loses-millions-after-getting-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hackers stole</a> more than 36,000 VERI. The tokens were taken out of the project team’s wallet, thus causing little harm to the ICO participants. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious point of discontent is VERI token supply. Out of 100 million issued tokens, only 2 million were distributed to the token sale participants. Together with the 36,000 stolen tokens, they make the total circulating supply of 2,036,645 VERI. The rest 97.9% sit in a wallet held by the CEO Reggie Middleton, causing an outstanding concentration of influence over the remainder of the tokens. Even the slightest token sell-off by the team could result in plummeting prices, which dissuades many seasoned crypto investors.</p>
<p>According to Reggie Middleton, most of the held Veritas tokens are for over-the-counter bulk purchases to private investors. Likewise, all the fees collected by VeADIR go back to the team’s wallet, too.</p>
<h2 id="<b>how-to-get-veritaseum?-</b>&#8220;><b>How to Get Veritaseum? </b></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As of 2018, Veritaseum trades on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/hitbtc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HitBTC</a>, Mercatox, EtherDelta (ForkDelta), LATOKEN, Fatbtc, and Tokenomy exchanges. </p>
<p>Besides, there is a possibility to rent VERI tokens via the VeRent app. At this moment it’s not possible to buy VERI tokens directly with fiat currencies</p>
<p><b>
<h2 id="current-state-of-the-project">Current State of the Project</h2><span class="replacer"></span></b></p>
<p>Veritaseum’s ever-growing team has developed a functioning <a href="https://dapp.veritaseum.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dApp</a>, although most of its components (except for VeResearch and VeManagement) are still in beta. Besides, the team has been on track with their roadmap, completing most of the scheduled tasks by the end of 2017. The remaining venture is a peer-to-peer OTC direct value trading, which is expected to launch in the 4th quarter of 2018. </p>
<p>In the most recent news, <a href="https://coinrivet.com/veritaseum-confirm-expansion-into-african-crypto-space/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Veritaseum has announced</a> the expansion to Africa continent and opened its operations in Lagos, Nigeria, and Kampala, the capital city of Uganda and seems to have ambitious plans for further Africa expansion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Veritaseum doesn’t have a complete whitepaper, so most users and interested parties have to gather information scattered throughout the project’s blog, website, <a href="https://twitter.com/ReggieMiddleton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BoomBustBlog/featured" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a> channel. Due to an unclear picture of how Veritaseum was conceived, its roadmap and code development progress reports, many people have developed skepticism towards the project. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br/>
Veritaseum is an ambitious project which has faced numerous scam allegations. It presents a unique opportunity to tokenize one&#8217;s assets (like real estate, precious metals or government bonds), buy and sell digital assets on the blockchain and gain exposure to various trading opportunities. Despite that, the public allegations and communication issues cast a shadow over the team’s efforts and progress.</p>
<p>VeADIR software suite is still in beta, but people can already try it, which can be a sign of more exciting things to come for Veritaseum. As with most blockchain projects, it has plenty of potential, but for now, it’s anybody’s guess what will come out of it. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The QTUM cryptocurrency runs on the namesake platform which was designed to bring out the best of both Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s technologies, combining them to make them more accessible to the corporate world.</p><p>The QTUM (pronounced “quantum”) project was launched in Singapore in 2017 based on a vision to unite the best segments of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> technologies on a unified hybrid platform. Members of the Qtum Foundation (Patrick Dai, Neil Mahi, Jordan Earls and others) running this project included individuals who were active in both of these crypto communities. By making it possible to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum, on QTUM’s own blockchain which was based on Bitcoin, the founders hoped to enable fast programming of smart contracts combined with the innate stability of this blockchain for the best results. </p>
<p>As QTUM primarily targeted businesses and institutions, this system aims to eventually improve the automation of entire <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contract technology</a> and bring down the costs associated with its use. To make these contracts faster to build as well as execute, QTUM platform comes together with a range of smart contract templates, pre-built contracts and tools for streamlined development of new decentralized apps (dapps). </p>
<p>These will allow companies to create their own coins for the products and services they offer, as well as automate management of their supply chains. The QTUM founders considered Ethereum platform as having unresolved stability issues, prompting them to combine its smart contract functionality with a more stable Bitcoin blockchain. To make these two work together, QTUM implemented the <a href="https://blog.qtum.org/qtums-account-abstraction-layer-aal-explanation-143cb06cf08" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Account Abstraction Layer</a> technology which allows for the conversion of its blockchain data into the account system used by Ethereum. </p>
<p>Instead of Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proof of work</a> mechanism, QTUM uses its <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proof of stake</a> consensus model paired with Bitcoin’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">UTXO (unspent transaction outputs)</a> system for verifying transactions. This allows it to process transactions simultaneously without being dependent on their sequence. Another benefit of the UTXO system for the QTUM is that it enabled it to run light client nodes on its network, which keep records of only the most recent or the most important blocks for the transaction verification. This made it possible to manage one’s smart contracts from mobile phones which often have to deal with slower connections or lower storage capacity.  </p>
<p>With its focus on making smart contracts “smarter” and more readily available, QTUM will arguably compete with the likes of Ethereum or NEO. Back in early 2018, its market value went over USD 7 billion, less than a year after its introduction. In November 2018, QTUM had a market cap value of USD 351 million. The total amount of coins in circulation at the time of writing is 89,015,652. </p>
<p>QTUM coins are available for trading for other cryptocurrencies on crypto exchanges such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance </a>or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bittrex/">Bittrex</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/qtum/">Qtum</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>
