<h2><strong>Reviewing the Top Offshore Online Casinos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In addition to regulation and safety, players should also explore bonuses, payout times, and customer service when choosing the best offshore casino. In the reviews to follow, we cover all of these metrics and more. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Mega Dice &#8211; Overall Best Regulated Offshore Casino (200% Deposit Bonus)  </strong></h3>
<p>Mega Dice is the best offshore casino to consider today and one of our overall <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best crypto casinos</a>. The casino has an excellent welcome bonus for new players, huge collection of games and a sportsbook, and utilizes Telegam to offer anonymous, secure, and instant accounts and crypto transfers.</p>
<p>The welcome bonus sees first-time players claim a 200% matched first deposit, up to 1 BTC, plus 50 free spins. The registration process at Mega Dice is instant via Telegram as the popular messaging app recognizes a user&#8217;s phone number as a unique reference to bypass KYC registration.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323833/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice best offshore casino site" /></figure>
<p>Telegram also allows for crypto to be deposited and withdrawn anonymously, with no fees or limits on transfers, making it great for decentralization &#8211; we also like that Mega Dice processes payments automatically and approved instantly.  </p>
<p>Mega Dice supports many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as some of the best meme coins, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The minimum deposit is just 0.0001 BTC, which will appeal to casual players. When it comes to games, Mega Dice supports every gambling product imaginable. </p>
<p>There are more than 5,000 slots provided by some of the top developers in the space such as Hacksawand Evolution. Mega Dice also supports provably fair games like crash, keno, and plinko, and also offers hundreds of virtual and live dealer tables for roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and craps &#8211; plenty of virtual and live poker games are also supported. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/323927/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice offshore casino slots" /></figure>
<p>This top-rated offshore casino also has a sports betting platform.

The Mega Dice sportsbook also covers in-play betting and offers bet builders and specials.</p>
<p>We should also mention that Mega Dice is a safe offshore casino and is available to players globally without a VPN. It is regulated by the <a href="https://www.kabinetvandegouverneur.org/nl/">Governor of Curaçao</a> and payout requests are always honored on time. Furthermore, deposits are made from the player&#8217;s private wallet, so Mega Dice doesn&#8217;t have access to the player&#8217;s payment details. We also like that players can protect their accounts with two-factor authentication. </p>

<h3><strong>9. Wild.io &#8211; Best Offshore Site for Slots</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wild.io/">Wild.io</a> is one of the best offshore casino sites for playing slot tournaments. Unlike other casino tournaments, Wild.io has fair terms and payouts. This is because tournament points are based on win multipliers rather than the amount being staked. As such, those staking small amounts have a fair chance of winning. </p>
<p>Currently, there is a weekly slot tournament on selected titles. The prize pot is 1,000 USDT and 1,000 free spins. The pot is split between the top 10 players, based on points. For instance, suppose a player bets $1 per spin and lands a 40x payout. This means the player adds 40 points to their tournament score. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-.jpg" alt="wild.io casino offshore site " /></figure>
<p>In addition to tournaments, Wild.io offers nearly 3,000 slot games. Not to mention hundreds of blackjack, roulette, and baccarat tables. Provably fair games from Spribe are also supported. The welcome package consists of four deposit bonuses, totaling 480%. Depending on the amount being deposited, Wild.io also throws in some free spins.  </p>

<h2><strong>What is an Offshore Casino?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When using an online gambling site based outside of the player&#8217;s home country, this is defined as an &#8216;offshore&#8217; casino. For example, suppose someone in France plays online slots with a Panama-based casino. As the casino is located outside of France, the player is using an offshore provider. </p>
<p>While there is often a negative spin on offshore casinos, most operate solid business models. The main concept is that offshore casinos accept players from most countries. This will appeal to players that do not have access to local casino sites. </p>
<p>This might be because online gambling is banned in the respective country. Or, perhaps the quality and service of domestic casino sites are sub-par. Some players use offshore casinos to obtain certain perks, such as enhanced bonuses or more competitive odds. Offshore casinos are also suitable for players who want to gamble anonymously. </p>
<p>But this is only the case when players deposit digital assets like Bitcoin. When using traditional payment methods, such as bank wires, offshore casinos must initiate a KYC process. Crucially, not all offshore casinos are legitimate. While platforms like Mega Dice and Lucky Block are regulated and safe, unlicensed offshore providers should be avoided. </p>
<h2><strong>How We Chose the Best Offshore Casinos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We reviewed the best offshore casinos on several key factors including their licensing and regulation, games provided, welcome bonuses on offer, and wagering requirements to achieve those bonuses. While all factors are outlined in detail below, it is also important that players do their own independent research before signing up to any overseas casino online.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety and Licensing: </strong>Most offshore casinos are regulated and legitimate providers. But players should still check the licensing status of the casino before proceeding. Regulated offshore casinos like Mega Dice and Lucky Block &#8211; which are both licensed in Curacao &#8211; displaying their licensing details at the bottom of their homepage. </li>
<li><strong>Software Providers: </strong>Just as important is the type of software providers that supply games to the offshore casino. We only consider offshore casinos that use regulated and reputable software developers. Examples include Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, Quickspin, and Hacksaw. This ensures that players are gambling in fair and random conditions. </li>
<li><strong>Supported Games: </strong>Players should also consider what casino games they want to play. We found that the best offshore online casinos support table games, slots, live dealers, and sports betting. Provably fair games are also worth exploring. </li>
<li><strong>Customer Support: </strong>Offshore casinos deal with players from all over the world, so 24/7 customer support should be expected. This is usually offered through live chat. This prevents the need for players to spend money calling a casino located thousands of miles away. </li>
<li><strong>Welcome Package and Ongoing Bonuses: </strong>The welcome package is also important when assessing the best offshore casino online. We like matched deposit bonuses with fair terms and conditions. Mega Dice and Lucky Block both offer a 200% deposit bonus to new players. We also like when offshore casinos offer ongoing bonuses for existing players, such as deposit reloads.  </li>
<li><strong>Payment Methods and Terms: </strong>We also explore what payment methods are accepted by offshore casinos. This often ranges from bank wires and debit/credit cards to e-wallets and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we check minimum deposit requirements, payout limits, and withdrawal times</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How Do Offshore Casinos Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Offshore casinos are usually located in countries that have favorable gambling laws. This is often in the Central American region, such as Curaçao, Panama, and the Cayman Islands. In turn, this enables offshore casinos to accept players from all over the world. </p>
<p>After choosing a suitable provider, players will need to open an account. Some platforms, such as Mega Dice, only require an email address, username, and password. In contrast, offshore casinos like BetOnline require much more information &#8211; including the player&#8217;s name, nationality, and residential address. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="table games selection" /></figure>
<p>After the account is opened, players can deposit some funds. The best offshore casinos accept debit/credit cards, e-wallets, bank wires, and cryptocurrencies. Depositing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is often the best option. This usually enables players to avoid a KYC process and have their withdrawals processed instantly. </p>
<p>Once the account is funded, players can begin gambling. Most offshore casinos support slots, blackjack, video poker, roulette, and other popular gambling games. These are usually provided by reputable software providers, such as Evolution, Pragmatic Play, and Microgaming. This ensures that each gambling game is fair and random. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Offshore casinos enable players to request a withdrawal at any time. If gambling with fiat money, withdrawals must be sent to the same payment that was used to deposit. This ensures that the offshore casino complies with anti-money regulations. Cryptocurrency payouts can be sent to any wallet address, providing lots of flexibility for players. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Safe?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The simple answer is yes &#8211; the vast majority of offshore casinos offer a safe gambling experience. This industry is largely based on trust and reputation, so offshore casinos must provide a satisfactory service to players. This means fair gambling conditions, transparent fees, and reasonable payout speeds. </p>
<p>However, it is important to remember that not all offshore casinos are legitimate. Just like any other industry, a small segment of offshore providers do not operate credible businesses. We found that the best offshore casinos are regulated. Many leading providers, such as Mega Dice, Lucky Block, BC.Game, and Metaspins, are licensed by the Governor of Curaçao. </p>
<p>Strict guidelines must be met by Curaçao-regulated casinos, ensuring that players can gamble safely and fairly. After all, the  <a href="https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/about-us">Curaçao Gaming Control Board</a> supervises its domestic casino sites, as it has done since 1999. </p>
<h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Legal?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those using an offshore casino for the first time might be concerned about the legality of this industry. The first point to consider is the location of the offshore provider. That is to say, the casino must comply with the regulations stipulated by the country it is based. This means that those holding a Curaçao gambling license are governed by Curaçao legislation. </p>
<p>Similarly, those based in the UK would need to hold a license with the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UK&#8217;s Gambling Commission</a>. There is more flexibility with European casinos, as providers can be regulated by any EU member. Most hold licenses with the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/">Malta Gaming Authority</a>. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice regulated offshore casino" /></figure>
<p>The second point to consider is the location of the player. For example, UK citizens are prohibited from using an online casino that isn&#8217;t regulated by the Gambling Commission. This is why some offshore casinos do not accept players from the UK. This is often the case with players from the US too. Crucially, the onus is on the offshore casino, not the players themselves. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Offshore casino laws are complex and difficult to enforce. Many offshore casinos do not have KYC processes, as permitted by their respective license issuer. This is the case when offshore casinos accept cryptocurrency payments, rather than debit/credit cards, bank wires, etc. In this instance, players are not asked for their country of residence when signing up. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Fair?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Most offshore casinos offer a fair gambling experience. This will be the case when using a regulated offshore provider like Mega Dice. For example, Mega Dice has an automated payment system, so deposits and withdrawals are processed instantly. This means players do not need to wait for payments to be approved manually by the casino. </p>
<p>In addition, regulated offshore casinos like Mega Dice offer games from licensed software providers. This includes the likes of NetEnt, Novomatic, Pragmatic Play, Hacksaw, Push Gaming, and Microgaming. All of these software providers must use <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/page/test-houses">regulated testing houses</a> when launching a new game. Put simply, this tests that the casino game is fair and random. </p>
<p>However, we also came across offshore casinos that use unlicensed software providers. These providers do not have their games audited by regulated third parties. This means that games are not tested before they are launched. Ultimately, the best practice is to stick with regulated offshore casinos that offer games from regulated and reputable software providers. </p>
<h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Offshore Casinos?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Offshore casinos do not develop their own games. On the contrary, games are supplied by software providers. This means that supported games will depend on <i>which</i> software providers the offshore casino has done deals with. </p>
<p>In most cases, the best offshore casino sites offer the following games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Table Games</strong>: All offshore providers supply table games, considering that this is the most popular casino product. At a minimum, this will include blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and video poker. To ensure players stay entertained, offshore casinos usually offer different variations of each table game. For instance, roulette can often be played with either the European or American rules.  </li>
<li><strong>Live Dealers</strong>: Offshore casinos also offer live dealers. This means that players are connected with a human dealer in real-time. For instance, suppose a player opts for live roulette. After placing their bets on-screen, the dealer will spin the roulette wheel &#8211; which is recorded live and shown to players. This offers an immersive offshore casino experience. </li>
<li><strong>Slots</strong>: The best offshore casinos also offer a comprehensive library of slot games. This often includes bonus buys, Mega ways, and classics. Some slots connect to progressive jackpot networks, offering 7-figure payouts. It&#8217;s best to stick with slots with a high <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/how-to-calculate-return-to-player-rtp">return-to-player (RTP)</a>. This reduces the house edge and increases the payout frequency.  </li>
<li><strong>Provably Fair</strong>: Provably fair games are relatively new in the offshore casino space. These are casino games backed by blockchain technology &#8211; ensuring transparency and fairness. Some of the most popular provably fair games include Aviator, plinko, keno, dice, and mines. </li>
<li><strong>Sports Betting</strong>: Some offshore casinos double as a sportsbook. Mega Dice, for example, offers competitive odds on American football, tennis, cricket, baseball, ice hockey, and many other sports. It also offers in-play betting, allowing players to gamble on sporting events that are still in progress. </li>
</ul>
<p>Players can check what games an offshore casino supports by visiting its website. </p>
<h2><strong>Offshore Casino Bonuses &amp; Promotions</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We found that the best offshore casinos offer lucrative bonuses when opening an account for the first time. This includes the following:</p>
<h3><strong>Matched Deposit Bonuses </strong> </h3>
<p>The matched deposit bonus is simple; the offshore casino will increase the initial payment made by the player. Each matched deposit bonus will come with a percentage amount and a limit. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, Mega Dice matches the first deposit by 200%, up to 1 BTC. </li>
<li>Lucky Block also matches the initial payment by 200%, but up to €10,000. </li>
</ul>
<p>Players will need to wager the bonus a minimum number of times before they can withdraw the funds. This prevents players from claiming a bonus just to cash it straight out. For instance, the Mega Dice matched deposit bonus comes with 40x wagering requirements. This means that $40 needs to be wagered for every $1 received in bonus funds. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players should also check the terms and conditions to see what games the bonus funds can be used on. Slots usually contribute 100% to the bonus target. Live dealer games often contribute just 10% &#8211; sometimes less. This will make the wagering requirements even more difficult to meet. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Free Spins </strong> </h3>
<p>Some offshore casinos offer slot-related bonuses, known as &#8216;free spins&#8217;. The player can use the free spins on selected slot games without using their own balance. So no risks need to be taken. </p>
<p>After using the free spins, winnings will need to be wagered. Once the wagering requirements have been met, players can withdraw their winnings. Mega Dice offers 50 free spins to new players that deposit €20 or more. The free spins can be used on Wanted Dead or a Wild and come with wagering requirements of 40x. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When claiming a free spins bonus, check the value of each spin. For example, suppose each spin is worth $2. If a free spin lands a multiplier of 50x, the player wins $100. But if the free spin is worth just $0.25, the 50x win is reduced to $12.50. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>No Deposit Bonuses </strong> </h3>
<p>Looking for an offshore casino no deposit bonus? The best option that we came across is BC.Game&#8217;s &#8216;Lucky Wheel&#8217; promotion. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="lucky wheel bc.game offshore casino" /></figure>
<p>After opening an account with BC.Game &#8211; which doesn&#8217;t require any personal information, players can spin the Lucky Wheel to win up to 5 BTC. In addition, BC.Game also offers a 180% matched deposit bonus of up to $20,000.  </p>
<h3><strong>VIP Club </strong> </h3>
<p>Some of the best offshore casino bonuses are offered to players that already have an account. These bonuses are often found in the VIP club, which rewards long-term players. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily or weekly deposit reload bonuses</li>
<li>Free spins</li>
<li>Cashback and rakeback </li>
<li>Cash prizes</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, VIP clubs also offer other perks, such as priority withdrawals and a personal account manager. There is rarely a need to apply &#8211; players are automatically enrolled.  </p>

<p>Bonus terms and conditions can change at a moment&#8217;s notice. As such, players should check this before claiming a bonus. </p>
<h2><strong>Payment &amp; Withdrawal Options at Offshore Casinos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Players should assess what payment method they wish to use before choosing an offshore casino. After all, deposits and withdrawals form an integral part of the online gambling experience. </p>
<h3><strong>Traditional Payment Methods</strong></h3>
<p>Most offshore casinos support traditional payment methods. This enables players to deposit funds in their domestic currency, such as euros or pounds. Debit/credit cards issued by Visa and MasterCard are usually accepted. Some offshore casinos also accept American Express and Discovery. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="offshore casino payment methods" /></figure>
<p>However, it is crucial to check what fees apply when using a debit/credit card. This is also the case with e-wallets. For example, 7bit Casino charges 2.5% on debit/credit cards, Skrill, and Neteller.  Withdrawal fees should also be considered. For instance, 7bit Casino charges 2.5% on bank wire payouts. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking for a chargeback offshore casino? It is important to note that initiating a chargeback on casino losses is illegal. Chargebacks should only be used if an unauthorized payment was taken by the offshore casino. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Cryptocurrency Payments </strong></h3>
<p>A much better alternative when funding an offshore casino account is cryptocurrencies. For example, Mega Dice offers fee-free cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it supports some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrencies</a>, like Dogecoin, BNB, and Cardano. </p>
<p>Moreover, Mega Dice offers KYC-free accounts when gambling with cryptocurrencies. Not to mention instant payouts. We also found that cryptocurrency payments come with lower minimums. For example, the minimum Bitcoin deposit at Lucky Block is just 0.0001 BTC, or about $3. </p>
<h2><strong>Offshore Casino Software Providers</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We mentioned earlier that offshore casinos use third-party software providers when building their gaming suites. So it&#8217;s important to check the reputation of each provider before proceeding. To offer some insight, Mega Dice, one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vpn-friendly-casinos.htm">best VPN-friendly casinos</a>, has partnerships with over 50 reputable software providers. This includes NetEnt, Hacksaw, Fantasma, Fugaso, Mascot Gaming, Evolution, Playson, Kalamba, and Pragmatic Play. </p>
<p>Most of these providers are regulated by tier-one gambling bodies like the Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority. This means gaming outcomes are fair and random. Plus, licensed software developers have their games audited &#8211; before <i>and</i> after they are launched.</p>
<h2><strong>New Offshore Casinos &#8211; What to Look for</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>New offshore casinos need to stand out in the market &#8211; so they often go above and beyond to attract players. This begins with the welcome package. New online offshore casinos will offer huge bonuses to new players, often as a matched deposit with free spins. </p>
<p>For example, Mega Dice is one of the best new offshore casinos. It offers a 200% deposit bonus and 50 free spins to first-time customers. However, while reputable market entrants like Mega Dice are regulated, many aren&#8217;t. We strongly suggest that players avoid unregulated offshore casinos &#8211; irrespective of whether they are new or established. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Play at an Offshore Casino</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In this section, we explain how to gamble online at an offshore casino. We guide beginners through the registration and deposit processes step-by-step. We also explain how to gamble and withdraw funds from an offshore provider. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Open an Account</strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice welcome bonus" /></figure>
<p>The first step is to open an account with the chosen offshore casino. We&#8217;ll use Mega Dice in this example, as this is one of the best regulated offshore casinos in the market. </p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice website</a> to begin the registration process. </li>
<li>Click &#8216;Sign Up&#8217; and type in an email address, username, and password.  </li>
<li>Read and agree to the terms and conditions, before clicking on &#8216;Sign Up &amp; Play&#8217;.</li>
<li>The Mega Dice account is now ready to fund. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Deposit Funds and Claim a 200% Bonus</strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323877/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice crypto deposits" /></figure>
<p>Players need to add funds to their offshore casino account before they can begin gambling. At Mega Dice, the minimum deposit depends on the payment type. Moreover, when depositing at least €20, Mega Dice will automatically boost the payment by 200%. It will also throw in 50 free spins. </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Click on the &#8216;Wallet&#8217; button, followed by &#8216;Deposit&#8217;. </li>
<li>Those depositing cryptocurrencies can choose their preferred digital asset. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies accepted by Mega Dice include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Dogecoin. Copy the unique wallet address and make the payment from a private wallet. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mega Dice also allows players to deposit funds with a debit/credit card. This will trigger a KYC process, so players will need to provide some personal information and upload some documents. For example, a government-issued ID and a recently issued bank statement or utility bill. Moreover, debit/credit card payments will be converted into cryptocurrencies. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Choose a Casino Game and Begin Playing </strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324146/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="wanted dead or a wild free spins" /></figure>
<p>Players can now begin gambling, ensuring that they do so responsibly. Mega Dice offers a wide range of casino games, including slots, baccarat, video poker, blackjack, and roulette. Live dealers, provably fair, and sports betting are also available. </p>
<ul>
<li>Players who deposited at least €20 can begin by using their 50 free spins. This needs to be used on the Wanted Dead or a Wild slot game. </li>
<li>After using the free spins, players can gamble with their bonus funds. Simply search for the preferred game and choose a bet size.</li>
<li>Mega Dice also allows players to bet with demo funds. This offers a risk-free gambling experience.  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Withdraw Funds  </strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324147/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice offshore crypto withdrawals" /></figure>
<p>Withdrawing funds from a regulated offshore casino is simple and hassle-free. At Mega Dice, players can begin the process by clicking on the &#8216;Wallet&#8217; button. </p>
<ul>
<li>Choose which cryptocurrency to withdraw from the drop-down list. This should already show the cryptocurrency that matches the player&#8217;s account balance. </li>
<li>Paste the wallet address that Mega Dice should transfer the cryptocurrencies. Ensure this is correct, as mistakes are irreversible. Next, type in the amount to withdraw. Click on &#8216;Max&#8217; to cash out the full account balance. </li>
<li>Finally, click on the &#8216;Withdraw&#8217; button. Players should receive their cryptocurrencies in a matter of minutes. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Best Offshore Casinos: Bottom Line</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In summary, reputable offshore casinos offer a superb gambling experience, not to mention fast payouts and generous bonuses. We rank Mega Dice as the overall best option as it is authorized and regulated by the Governor of Curaçao and available to players globally without a VPN.</p>
<p>Mega Dice offers a 200% deposit bonus to new players, up to 1 BTC, and also utilizes popular messaging app Telegram to facilitate instant, anonymous and secure account creation and crypto transfers &#8211; with deposits and withdrawals coming without fees or limits.</p>

The giveaway will be awarded to 5 entrants, each winner getting $10,000 worth of tokens. To enter the giveaway, entrants can follow the website and follow Wall Street Memes on social media.</p>
<p>While the $WSM token does not offer much utility, it has the backing of a large meme movement. Wall Street Memes has over 1 million followers, and $WSM will be a 100% community token. Half of the 2 billion token supply will be allocated for the presale, consisting of 30 rounds.</p>
<p>The price of $WSM will rise from $0.025 to $0.0337 by the final presale round. Currently, the token is priced at $0.0271. By the final stage, the price will increase to $0.0337. Another 30% of the token supply will be allocated as community rewards. Thus, members stand a chance to generate wealth by entering this crypto project.</p>

<p>A Public Wall is a meme-posting system implemented by the AiDoge community in which users can post their memes for all the members of the community to see. These members will vote on these memes and, depending on how many votes a meme gets, the winner will be rewarded with $AI Tokens.</p>
<h4>What is an $AI Token?</h4>
<p>An AI Token is an ERC-20 crypto asset that, in addition to being a reward token, can be used to buy credits to create memes. Other utilities of this token include.</p>
<ol>
<li>Voting on the various matters within the AiDoge ecosystem;</li>
<li>And, staking, a process through which users can earn APYs and other lucrative perks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The token has a total supply of 1 trillion, out of which 500 billion were listed for the presale. AiDoge managed to raise nearly $15 million through its presale round. Now, the token will be listed on crypto exchanges on June 19th, 2023.<br />

<h3>4. Tamadoge &#8211; Meme Coin Giving Away $1 Million and Hosting Frequent Competitions</h3>
<p>Meme coin <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge (TAMA)</a> is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn (P2E) crypto project</a> and one of the best NFT games out right now. It tokenizes in-game assets to make them easily tradable and verifiable. Many crypto enthusiasts have praised the project as being one of the best crypto games on the market thanks to its committed team and strong concept.</p>
<figure class="image"><a href="https://tamadoge.io/free-10/"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224043/tama-giveawy.jpg" alt="Tamadoge crypto project" /></a></figure>
<p>The Tamadoge game is built around a tailor-made Metaverse world commonly referred to as the Tamaverse. In this virtual land, players are able to train NFT-based pets. In order to rank up a pet, the player must interact with it and provide it with food, toys, and cosmetics, all of which are available from the in-game store.</p>
<p>When a player improves the ranking of their pet, they will receive Dogepoints. The more points a player has, the higher they will rank on the in-game leaderboard. As the highest-rated players will receive the greatest share of the rewards pool, there is a huge amount of incentive for people to level up their pets.</p>
<p>Synergizing perfectly with the leveling system, 5% of the revenue generated from the in-game store is burned. This means that by improving their pets by purchasing items from the store, a player also reduces the total supply of TAMA, helping to further boost their earnings.</p>
<p>Following one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best presales</a> of 2022, and having raised $19M, the TAMA token was recently listed on the OKX centralized exchange (CEX) and the OKX DEX (for US residents). To celebrate this achievement, the team has launched a $1 million competition with 100,000 prizes up for grabs. Just register with OKX, trade TAMA/USDT, and complete a few social actions to win $10 sent directly to a crypto wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224027/tama-okx-listing.jpg" alt="Tamadoge OKX listed" /></figure>
<p>Tamadoge is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-games.htm">best crypto games</a> available right now. The project has been enjoying huge demand and with the release of the Tamaverse and Tamadoge pets both slated for Q4 2022, we could see TAMA explode sooner rather than later. Additionally, it&#8217;s also considered a better alternative to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-faucets.htm">best crypto faucets</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Join the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram</a> to stay informed about the project&#8217;s latest updates.<br />

<h3>5. Battle Infinity &#8211; Popular P2E DeFi Ecosystem Rewarding its Supporters</h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity (IBAT)</a> is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new crypto project </a>that has been making waves in the industry thanks to its unique ecosystem comprising a fantasy sports platform, an NFT marketplace, a decentralized exchange, a staking platform, a collection of some of the best NFT games, and even a Metaverse arena.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224029/battle-infinity-game.jpg" alt="battle infinity crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The project has been performing well in recent months. After selling out its 16,500 BNB presale, beating expectations by 65-days, the IBAT token went on to climb by around 400% compared to its presale price after getting listed on PancakeSwap. With statistics like these, IBAT could be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> right now.,</p>
<p>Following the release of the IBAT staking platform, there has been a lot of focus on the Battle Infinity ecosystem, and for good reason. Out of all the crypto tokens on the market, IBAT is one of the top in terms of potential growth. As the project&#8217;s core features begin to release, we could see the token skyrocket.</p>
<p>To reward its supporters, Battle Infinity has been hosting giveaways on the <a href="https://t.me/battleinfinity">IBAT Telegram channel</a>. The prizes are typically worth between $10 to $500 and can usually be won by completely specific social actions (e.g. following the IBAT Twitter, sharing a post, etc). With new draws being periodically announced, it&#8217;s worth following the Telegram closely to maximize the chances of winning.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224030/ibat-staking-site.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity token staking" /></figure>
<p>Battle Infinity is an extremely interesting project that has the potential to grow exponentially in the coming months. The release of the project&#8217;s fantasy sports league as well as its other primary features will likely cause demand for the IBAT token to boom so it&#8217;s worth watching Battle Infinity closely and keeping an eye on the project&#8217;s Telegram in order to not miss the next best crypto giveaway.<br />

<h3>6. Lucky Block &#8211; NFT Competition Platform Hosting both Paid And Free Prize Draws</h3>
<p>Next on our list of the best crypto giveaways is <a href="https://luckyblock.com/">Lucky Block (LBLOCK)</a>, a crypto-powered platform created to provide a fair and simple way for people to enter NFT-based competitions with huge prizes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224032/lucky-block-website-new.jpg" alt="lucky block website" /></figure>
<p>Lucky Block has created a simple-to-use platform that allows anyone to enter a competition by purchasing an NFT from Launchpad.xyz. Each prize draw is linked to a specific NFT, with the price and available quantity of each proportional to the potential jackpot. Some of the most exciting prizes include $1 million in Bitcoin, a house, and a luxury vehicle.</p>
<p>Even after a competition has been concluded, Lucky Block NFT still provides its owner with the ability to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-earn-free-crypto.htm">earn free crypto</a> rewards every single day. This is a huge bonus and ensures that the collection remains valuable for the long term rather than being solely used to enter the prize draws.</p>
<p>In addition to the platform&#8217;s paid competitions, Lucky Block also gives back to its fans by hosting free crypto giveaways. The last giveaway hosted by Lucky Block had a grand prize of $2,500 and less than 2,500 entries, meaning participants had a far higher chance of winning compared to other giveaways.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224031/lblock-prizes.jpg" alt="lucky block prizes" /></figure>
<p>Lucky Block is in an interesting spot. Anticipation has been building surrounding the launch of the LBLOCK burn program (September 30th, 2022) and with the V1 to V2 token bridge that launched soon after (October 3rd, 2022), the price of LBLOCK could skyrocket. We&#8217;ve got a great <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lucky-block-price-prediction.htm">Lucky Block price prediction</a> article for investors interested in LBLOCK.<br />

Almost every few days, it seems that Binance has launched another competition, ranging in style from crypto airdrops to online lottery-style competitions. With Binance hosting crypto giveaways so frequently, it&#8217;s worth keeping an eye on its socials.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224033/binance-card-giveaway.jpg" alt="binance card giveaway" /></figure>
<p>We mentioned, Binance tends to host frequent free crypto giveaways. The exchange is currently rewarding users that order a Binance card with a 5 BUSD voucher. Even existing card holders can win a small kickback for transacting using the card. Furthermore, one lucky entrant will win a voucher for an entire Bitcoin, making the competition potentially rather lucrative.</p>
<p>With Binance being a favorite trading platform among crypto enthusiasts, there&#8217;s no real downside to joining in on the giveaways hosted by the exchange as many investors already have an account with the platform.<br />

<h3>8. KuCoin &#8211; Win Crypto by Creating KuCoin-Related Memes</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=rJTJSBJ">KuCoin </a>is another popular exchange that frequently rewards its users by hosting exclusive competitions with various prizes. The exchange has a huge user base consisting of more than 10 million investors and traders around the globe. As such, to ensure that each competition is fair, KuCoin will often host region-specific competitions reducing the difficulty of winning.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224035/kucoin-giveawy.jpg" alt="kucoin giveaway" /></figure>
<p>Out of all of the platforms we&#8217;ve looked at, KuCoin hosts perhaps the greatest quantity of giveaways. Currently, there are three active competitions. One rewards people for staking crypto on the exchange, another rewards users for trying futures trading, and the final KuCoin prize draw allows people to earn crypto by creating memes related to the exchange.</p>
<p>While the competitions KuCoin hosts tend to have more specific entry requirements than most, the platform more than makes up for this with the sheer quantity of prize draws it hosts. New competitions are typically announced on the news section of KuCoin or on the company&#8217;s socials so it&#8217;s worth keeping up to date with more.<br />

<p>In addition to being home to some of the best play-to-earn games on the market, <a href="https://gridglass43.co/box_22bd1e49e2a1930b89b533f5491fade3">Crypto.com</a> also hosts some of the best crypto giveaways in the industry.

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224036/crypto-com-giveawy.jpg" alt="crypto.com competition" /></figure>
<p>The most recent prize draw hosted by Crypto.com is related to the highly anticipated Ethereum merge. in order to support the upgrade of Ethereum, Crypto.com launched a trading competition with a sizable $10,000 prize pool. With so many investors and traders already buying and selling ETH because of the merge, this competition could be fairly passive for some people.</p>
<p>Overall, Crypto.com is up there with the world&#8217;s best-known centralized exchanges, and with the platform hosting a myriad of prize draws it&#8217;s easy to see why. For investors looking to stock up on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects while having the chance to win some awesome prizes, Crypto.com is worthy of consideration.<br />

<h2>How do Crypto Giveaways Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While the concept of the best crypto giveaway is simple, each competition tends to have slightly different prerequisites and potential prizes. As such, it can be a touch confusing to decipher how crypto giveaways work. Luckily, when the concept is explained clearly, it&#8217;s far easier to understand.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways a crypto giveaway works is by rewarding users for engaging with the brand on social media. It&#8217;s common for an entity in the crypto space to want to boost social engagement so these prize draws benefit both parties. There is a huge range of potential social actions that could be required but a couple of the most common include following an account or liking a post.</p>
<p>Another way it&#8217;s possible to enter the best crypto giveaway is by engaging in trading-related activities on a certain platform. The most common trading activity that an exchange will incentivize is futures (leveraged) trading. However, trading-based draws aren&#8217;t limited to futures. Some platforms will offer rewards for spot trading or even <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">staking coins</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, there is a multitude of different competition out there. However, they will all typically involve the entrant completing some sort of action beneficial to the host of the giveaway. As such, looking out for competitions that offer huge prizes with seemingly no incentive to the host and best avoided as they can end up being fake crypto giveaways.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Brand New Altcoin Introducing a Revolutionary Stake-to-Mine Model</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a> is a revolutionary new stake-to-mine cryptocurrency through which investors can earn cloud mining credits and mining power on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>For those looking to engage in mining activities without the high entry barrier, Bitcoin Minetrix offers a simple solution. The platform also offers a &#8216;minedrop&#8217; with rewards of $30k for early supporters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1319" height="640" class="aligncenter wp-image-133412" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png 1319w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1024x497.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-768x373.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1319px) 100vw, 1319px" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix will tokenize cloud mining by leveraging the $BTCMTX token. All one has to do is purchase $BTCMTX on the presale and stake their holdings. Bitcoin Minetrix has a 4 billion token supply, and has allocated 2.8 billion tokens across 39 presale rounds.</p>
<p>Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0119 per token &#8211; this price will rise with each successive stage.</p>
<p>The current staking APY (Annual Percentage Yield) on $BTCMTX is 130%, which will eventually reduce as more tokens are staked on the Ethereum-powered smart contract. Staked token holders will earn passive income in the form of cloud mining credits.</p>
<p>While these credits cannot be traded, investors can burn them on the ecosystem to earn Bitcoin cloud mining power. This allows one to get allocated mining time and a share of mining revenues. This is a cost-efficient solution to other cloud mining services due to the high costs of operations and the prevalent third-party scams.</p>

<p>By tokenizing the tokens, investors can join a decentralized platform that is secure to use. The presale requires investors to make just a $10 investment to get started &#8211; over $4.5 million has been raised in eight weeks since it launched.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" width="1240" height="672" class="aligncenter wp-image-133431" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale.png" alt="TG.Casino presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale.png 1240w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale-300x163.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale-1024x555.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale-768x416.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px" /></p>

<h3><strong>6. eTukTuk &#8211; Reduce Carbon Emissions in the Developing World</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/"><u>eTukTuk</u></a>, a new eco-friendly initiative based on the BSC blockchain, prepares for launch in Sri Lanka with a twofold mission &#8211; environmental protection and financial inclusion.</p>
<p>This project aims to replace traditional fossil fuel-reliant TukTuks with their electric counterparts, mitigating carbon emissions while offering economic advantages. The presale has already raised more than $275k with buyers able to earn 750% staking APY.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315137/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk EV crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Electric TukTuks bring significant cost reductions in operation and maintenance, potentially boosting driver income by an impressive 400%. Sri Lanka, home to a vast fleet of millions of TukTuks, can provide a solid base for eTukTuk’s journey to kick off.</p>
<p>With the strong backing of The Capital Maharaja Group, a significant conglomerate in Sri Lanka, eTukTuk&#8217;s goal of affordable and accessible electric vehicles and charging stations have become more feasible.</p>
<p>Incorporating blockchain tech, eTukTuk promotes financial inclusion by assigning digital identities, narrowing the economic divide. As per the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf?"><u>eTukTuk whitepaper</u></a>, It doubles as a socio-economic tool, aiming to make a mark beyond transportation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315136/etuktuk-staking.jpg" alt="eTukTuk power staking mechanics" /></figure>
<p>Token holders can support charging station operations by staking their tokens, earning annual yields in return. This unique staking method sets eTukTuk apart, further showing its innovative approach.</p>
<p>eTukTuk seeks to create a future where transportation and economic growth harmoniously coexist without affecting the planet&#8217;s health. You can join the <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>eTukTuk Telegram group</u></a> for the latest information.<br />

<h3><strong>7. Green Bitcoin &#8211; Crypto Presale Project That Rewards Accurate Bitcoin Price Predictions  </strong></h3>
<p>Although many cryptocurrency projects are developing innovative financial solutions, some projects are focused on rewarding users in a gamified way. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin</a> is such project where you buy $GBTC tokens, stake them and give Bitcoin price predictions. Depending on your prediction and staking duration, you&#8217;ll be rewarded.</p>
<p>The project is in its infancy, however. This means you can only buy $GBTC tokens now at a discounted price while you wait for the price prediction system to go live. This shouldn&#8217;t be bad, though, especially if you believe the project has a future. $GBTC sells at a lower price during the presale than what it could potentially trade post-presale. Moreover, you get to stake and earn rewards during the presale, giving you a chance to stack up before you start predicting Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-139682 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-768x434.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-150x85.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>To participate in the presale, you need ETH, USDT or a card, and an Ethereum-based wallet to complete the transaction. Token withdrawal will be enabled once the presale ends. While you wait, you can earn more $GBTC tokens.</p>
<p>The staking system is live and there&#8217;s a 700% APR at the moment of writing. This will change as more tokens get staked. With 67.5% of the total token supply dedicated to the presale and the staking rewards, according to <a href="https://www.greenbitcoin.xyz/whitepaper.pdf">Green Bitcoin&#8217;s whitepaper</a>, the majority of the tokens are likely to get distributed among early adopters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="651" class="alignnone wp-image-139687 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-768x556.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-150x109.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The token presale is the first phase in the project&#8217;s roadmap. After it ends, the token is going to be listed on A-tier exchanges. The gamified Bitcoin price prediction system comes next.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Scorpion Token (SCORP) &#8211; Earn Up To $10,000 in Daily Passive Staking</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN"><u>Scorpion Casino</u></a> is the future leading eGambling platform that lets users earn up to $10,000 USDT in daily passive staking, depending on the casino’s performance. The project is on a mission to build the number-one online social gambling platform that seeks to provide a fun and seamless gambling experience while simultaneously allowing everybody to earn.</p>
<p>Licensed and regulated by the Curacao EGaming licensing entity, Scorpion Casino can boast over 210 casino games, with an additional 160 live games. The platform hosts all the popular games you would expect from a major casino, including blackjack, roulette, poker, and slots. In addition, the games are highly polished as the casino is connected with all the major gaming providers, including Evolution, NetEnt, EGT, and AMATIC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/276950/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="scorpion casino presale" /></figure>
<p>In addition to the traditional table games, Scorpion Casino also hosts a sports betting section, allowing users to bet on the outcome of their favorite sports games. The sports section has all the major leagues integrated for popular sports such as soccer, tennis, golf, basketball, horse racing, boxing, and MMA.</p>
<p>The passive staking earnings are provided through a redistribution tax that’s baked into the smart contract for the token. A 2% tax is leveraged on all transactions, which is re-distributed to all SCORP holders. As a result, holders will see their token balance increase when holding the token as the casino gains more adoption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the token is actually deflationary due to the 1% burn tax that is levied on each transaction. Over time, the total supply for SCORP will continue to decrease, making the remaining tokens more scarce and valuable.</p>
<p>The project is currently hosting a presale for its native token, SCORP. The native token will be the exclusive payment method for the entire ecosystem and will be the default betting currency across the casino and sports gaming products. However, the casino also accepts major cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH, and BNB.</p>
<p>Investors who purchase more than $1,000 SCORP in the presale are automatically enrolled in the Elite Scorpion Members Club, which provides multiple benefits, including;</p>
<ul>
<li>A VIP service</li>
<li>Cashback on the casino</li>
<li>Extra staking rewards</li>
<li>Addition SCORP tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, those that use the exclusive bonus code Scorpion20 when making their purchase can get an extra 20% tokens on their investment &#8211; $2 million has now been raised in the presale.</p>
<p>The project has announced that it has already secured a top-tier centralized exchange listing for when the presale ends, which will be announced close to the conclusion of the presale.<br />

<p>Since there is also a tax on buying and selling the token, there is a possibility of lower volatility. A 7% selling tax will be implemented on $YPRED, out of which the fees will be used for marketing, development, and liquidity purposes.</p>
<p>$YPRED has a total supply of only 100 billion tokens. As the platform staking increases, the reduced supply can play a role in determining the future price. Currently, the token is priced at $0.11 during the ongoing presale. The price will jump 9% to $0.12 upon listing.</p>
<p>yPredict has now raised more than $5 million since the presale started. Read the <a href="https://docs.ypredict.ai/">yPredict whitepaper</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/ypredict">Telegram group</a> to stay informed about this project.<br />

<h3><strong>11. Sensei Inu &#8211; Trivia-Based Altcoin With Proof Of Value Consensus Mechanism &amp; 50 Million Airdrop</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/senseiinu/"><u>Sensei Inu ($SINU)</u></a> is a new type of altcoin that provides a proof of value consensus mechanism as opposed to the commonly used proof of stake consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>It is a trivia-based platform where users are rewarded for their knowledge and experience as opposed to holding and staking their coins &#8211; more than $550k has been raised in the presale so far.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/334438/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Sensei Inu crypto presale" /></figure>
<p>In this way, the project aims to remedy financial inequality. It’s easily possible for rich individuals and institutions to purchase a load of PoS tokens and reap the rewards without doing any work or contributing much value. But with Sensei Inu, rewards accrue depending on how much the student has learned.</p>
<p>There are trivia competitions with more rewards for the winners. The questions get progressively harder towards the end of each round. A user-friendly dashboard allows users to manage all of their operations including their targets and total rewards, as well as areas of improvement.</p>
<p>There are a total of 5 billion $SINU tokens with 2.5 billion available in the presale at a price of just $0.0007, though this will rise to $0.0008 in the next stage. This is a strong investment incentive, as the coin is likely to increase further as the presale continues.</p>
<p>There is also a 50 million token airdrop set to take place soon.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/334439/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Sensei proof-of-value mechanism" /></figure>
<p>With this new proof of value platform, the more that users play and learn, the more they get rewarded, as it is more connected to real-world value. A governance DAO also allows users to vote on important decisions within the wider ecosystem. The trivia questions are mainly related to Web3.</p>
<p>More information on this new proof of value ecosystem can be found on the <a href="https://media.senseiinu.com/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Sensei Inu Whitepaper</u></a> as well as the <a href="https://t.me/SenseiOfficialTG"><u>Telegram</u></a> account.<br />

<h3><strong>12. Ethereum &#8211; Largest Altcoin and Originator of Smart Contracts</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) is the king of altcoins. It&#8217;s the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, beaten only by Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ethereum fathered the ERC standard used by many of today&#8217;s best altcoins to watch. But <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">is Ethereum a good investment</a> right now?</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311549/ethereum-foundation.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Many investors consider Ethereum to be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy now</a> and for good reason. The project has consistently proven itself able to weather any bear market while still providing the same great service to its users.</p>
<p>A large portion of the most popular altcoins utilize the ERC standard and with the upcoming Ethereum update expected to improve throughput, this is unlikely to change anytime soon. It&#8217;s also considered to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-vr-crypto.htm">best VR cryptos</a> as it powers many of the new projects on the market.</p>
<p>With the amount of value the project offers, Ethereum is one of the best altcoins to buy and a worthy addition to any well-diversified portfolio.<br />
<div class="cta-content-button"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" rel="nofollow noindex noopener sponsored" >Visit ETH on eToro</a></div></p>
<h3><strong>13. Chainlink &#8211; Popular Project Bringing Off-chain Data On-Chain</strong></h3>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) is packed full of intrinsic value and is one of the most popular altcoins currently available.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s core value proposition is the ability to implement off-chain data sources into on-chain applications, something that has drastically increased the functionality of Web3 projects as well as other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311550/chainlink.jpg" alt="Chainlink web3 services platform" /></figure>
<p>Few of even the best altcoins to watch can compete with Chainlink in terms of industry partnerships. Due to the nature of the project, it&#8217;s in the interest of other cryptocurrencies to join Chainlink in order to improve their own offerings. This has resulted in Chainlink&#8217;s technology being incorporated in a range of high-profile projects like Aave.</p>
<p>Overall, Chainlink is one of the best altcoins to buy right now. Even during the current market downturn, it has remained strong and as it uses the ERC standard, the upcoming Ethereum merge will likely award LINK a slight boost in value.<br />
<div class="cta-content-button"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" rel="nofollow noindex noopener sponsored" >Visit LINK on eToro</a></div></p>
<h3><strong>14. XRP &#8211; Transactional Cryptocurrency Touted as being the Future of Currency Exchanges</strong></h3>
<p>XRP is a transactional cryptocurrency that many investors believe could be the future of banking. The token was created by David Shwartz as a more cost and energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin with Ripple Labs being created soon thereafter in order to create use cases for XRP.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311551/xrp-1505.jpg" alt="XRP offering utility for global economy" /></figure>
<p>While Ripple and XRP are currently in the midst of a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the unlicensed selling of securities, many speculate that XRP could explode following the suit&#8217;s conclusion. Like Chainlink, XRP has a huge number of partnerships with financial institutions and banks including the Bank of America, MoneyGram, and American Express.</p>
<p>Being launched in 2012, XRP cannot be counted alongside new altcoins but it remains one of the best altcoins to buy. With its partial win over the SEC in a long standing court trial, it can also be regarded as born anew.</p>
<p>The price certainly reflects this, trading at $0.71 at the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/xrp-surges-after-judge-delivers-a-huge-win-to-ripple-in-its-case-against-the-sec.html">rising sharply after the SEC court victory.</a><br />

<h3><strong>15. BNB &#8211; Cryptocurrency Powering the Binance Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>BNB sometimes referred to as Build and Build, is the propriety token of the world&#8217;s largest exchange (by volume), Binance.</p>
<p>Despite originally launching as a rather basic blockchain designed primarily to reduce fees on the Binance exchange, BNB has since expanded into the smart contract sector and is commonly used to power new altcoins like Battle Infinity.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311552/bnb-coin.jpg" alt="Binance trading fees" /></figure>
<p>The value of BNB absolutely exploded in early 2021 as investors everywhere were looking for the next project to rival Ethereum and with the BEP standard based on ERC, it was a clear contender. The release of the Binance Smart Chain also created immense demand for BNB as it&#8217;s used to fuel all transactions on the network. The majority of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-price-prediction.htm">BNB price predictions</a> suggest that this utility token could reach an ATH of $2,000 by the end of 2030.</p>
<p>All in all, BNB is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">best crypto to buy Reddit</a> and still offers massive upside potential. The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem is only growing as a result of its low costs and similarities with the ERC standard, making it one of the top new altcoins to invest in this year.<br />

<h2><strong>What is an Altcoin?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><strong>Altcoins are made up of a brought spectrum of projects and are not limited by category, consensus mechanism, or intended use. </strong></i></p></blockquote>
<p>Altcoin simply means alternative coin. As such, any alternative (to Bitcoin) can be considered an altcoin. In practice, this means that every cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin is classed as an altcoin.</p>
<h2><strong>Can Altcoins Make for a Good Investment?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With Altcoins being made up of such a large variety of projects, some will make for good investments while others will slowly fade into obscurity. Below, we&#8217;ve shared a few reasons why altcoins can make an excellent addition to a well-balanced portfolio.</p>
<h3><strong>Technology</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p><i><strong>One of the most interesting aspects of altcoins is the technology they possess. With cryptocurrency already being an emerging technology, altcoins can provide access to subsectors like decentralized finance, the Metaverse, and P2E gaming. </strong></i></p></blockquote>
<p>The best altcoins to buy will typically feature new and exciting features, making them an excellent way to get to the forefront of technology.</p>
<p>Among those listed here, Launchpad XYZ wants to create a gateway for mass adoption to Web3 while yPredict is utilizing artificial intelligence to help crypto traders and investors. XRP20 uses staking technology to enhance a regular &#8220;dumb&#8221; token into something that rewards users.</p>
<p>All these projects utilize blockchain technology in different ways to provide utility and a solution to a real-world issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Diversification</strong></h3>
<p>As we mentioned, there is a massive variety of different altcoins available and as such, they can make for an excellent diversification tool. With altcoins spanning every sector within cryptocurrency, regardless of how a portfolio is composed, there will be an altcoin able to reduce an investor&#8217;s exposure to a specific sector, effectively reducing risk.</p>
<h3><strong>Room for Growth</strong></h3>
<p>While Bitcoin is regarded as being a safer, blue-chip crypto, its larger size means it&#8217;s more difficult for the price to move substantially in either direction. However, altcoins will have lower market caps, meaning that less demand is required for them to be pushed upward or downward.</p>
<p>Meme coins can often show explosive growth, but investors have to be careful about which projects they choose. Not only do some meme coins have a very short shelf life, but many are also outright scams.</p>
<p>As such, altcoins can make for excellent growth vehicles, provided the proper due diligence is done prior to investing.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Altcoins to Buy</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With there being so many different altcoins on the market, an investor needs to narrow down their search criteria to find worthwhile projects. Sometimes you need more than just the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">best crypto signals</a> to know which crypto project is worth investing in. We&#8217;ll be sharing a few quick tips to help find the best altcoins to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Whitepaper &#8211; </strong>One of the most effective techniques to weed out lackluster projects is thoroughly reviewing a project&#8217;s whitepaper. The best altcoins to buy will always feature a well-written whitepaper that clearly explains exactly what the project does as well well as its plans for the future. If a cryptocurrency makes a lot of promises without explaining how they will be achieved, it&#8217;s best avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media &#8211; </strong>Taking a look at social media can be a great way to determine how investors feel about a project and whether it has a strong community. While stats like followers can be easily purchased online, it&#8217;s much harder to fake an active community consistently commenting and sharing so these are both factors to look out for when trying to find the best altcoins for 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Utility &#8211; </strong>While it&#8217;s possible for some projects to perform well and offer great returns through hype alone, it&#8217;ll never be conducive to long-term growth. Instead, it&#8217;s better to look out for utility-focused projects that provide a useful service or product. These altcoins will always have a demand regardless of hype or the market, making them far safer long-term investments.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Buy the Best Altcoin &#8211; Bitcoin ETF Token</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure that no investor is left unable to buy the best altcoin, we&#8217;ve detailed exactly how to buy $BTCETF tokens below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create Crypto Wallet &#8211; </strong>Before accessing the $BTCETF presale, investors can download a cryptocurrency wallet such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect.</li>
<li><strong>Buy ETH or USDT &#8211; </strong>An ERC-20 token, $BTCETF, can be swapped with similar assets such as ETH or USDT. Purchase Ethereum or USDT from a suitable crypto exchange and transfer the assets to the crypto wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Connect Wallet and Buy $BTCETF &#8211; </strong>Visit the Bitcoin ETF Token website and click on ‘Connect Wallet’. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. Afterwards, one can choose to buy $BTCETF with the available crypto options. Enter the amount to swap and confirm the purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Claim Tokens &#8211; </strong>Investors can claim the $BTCETF tokens after the presale ends. To do so, visit the presale website.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Where to Buy Other Altcoins</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Meme Kombat is the best new altcoin and an excellent all-around project, some investors will want to purchase another token from our list. To do this, they will require a top-of-the-line broker.</p>
<h3><strong>eToro &#8211; Buy the Top Altcoins with just 1% Commission</strong></h3>
<p>eToro was founded in 2007 and has since grown to become a leading broker for cryptocurrency and stocks thanks to its fantastic feature set. The broker is regulated by leading tier-1 bodies including the FCA, ASIC, and CySEC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/219146/etoro-crypto-site.jpg" alt="etoro crypto selection" /></figure>
<p>With security always a large area of concern for crypto investors, it&#8217;s crucial for a broker to protect its clients. eToro secures personal details before they&#8217;re sent to the server by using SSL encryption but that&#8217;s not all. The majority of client funds are stored offline and untouchable in cold storage, preventing the risk of clients losing funds due to eToro getting compromised.</p>
<p>While eToro is great for those employing a buy-and-hold strategy, it&#8217;s also a great broker for traders. It provides its users with a range of charting tools, useful when it comes to determining key price points and figuring out when to enter a trade. Furthermore, eToro allows users to set both limit and market orders, allowing users to fine-tune their entry points.</p>
<p>In addition to investing and manually trading, eToro supports social trading. This allows users to choose a trader they like and automatically mirror their trades, excellent for beginners trying to earn a profit or learn strategy.</p>
<p>Overall, eToro is an excellent platform for both beginners and more experienced investors. It offers a wide range of tools and through its various platforms, a great deal of customizability. As such, eToro is the number one broker for investors looking to stock up on altcoins.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong><u>Buy Crypto on eToro</u></strong></a></p>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We&#8217;ve taken a look at some of the best altcoins to buy, discussed the benefits of altcoins, and explained how to choose the find altcoins with the highest potential. However, throughout our research, we determined that one particular project boasts the most potential.</p>
<p>One of the top altcoins right now is $BTCETF, the native cryptocurrency of Bitcoin ETF Token. This new altcoin speculates on the arrival of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF. $BTCETF will burn 25% of its token supply upon the achievement of five predetermined milestones.</p>
<p>Token holders can stake the $BTCETF token to earn huge staking yields, which currently sit at 180%. $BTCETF can be purchased through the ongoing presale, which has raised more than $2 million in just three weeks.<br />

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137482" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701249390-bc-game-casino-1.jpg" alt="" width="1367" height="716" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701249390-bc-game-casino-1.jpg 1367w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701249390-bc-game-casino-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701249390-bc-game-casino-1-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701249390-bc-game-casino-1-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1367px) 100vw, 1367px" /></p>
<p>The BC.Game welcome bonus is awarded over 4 deposits. A player’s first deposit qualified them for an 80-180% deposit match worth up to $20,000. The second deposit earns a 100-200% match up to $40,000. The third earns 100-220% up to $60,000. Finally, the fourth deposit earns a match of 100-240% up to $100,000.</p>
<p>The match percentage for each bonus depends on the amount deposited, with larger deposits earning higher bonus tiers. All bonus funds are paid in BCD, BC.Game’s native cryptocurrency. 1 BCD is equal to 1 USDT and it can be easily swapped when players withdraw funds. Did you know that BC.Game is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoin-casino-sites.htm">best altcoin casinos</a> that also accepts a wide range of cryptos other than BTC?</p>
<p>To keep the bonus, players must meet a steep wagering requirement of 500X. Bonus funds are released with each wager, at a rate of 0.2% of each wager’s value in bonus funds.</p>

<h3>6. Metaspins &#8211; 100% Matched Bonus up to 1 BTC</h3>
<p>Metaspins has a deceptively standard welcome bonus of 100% matched up to 1BTC &#8211; until you look at it. This bonus has one of the lowest wagering reqirements of 25x.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88910/235409/metaspins-casino.jpg" alt="Metaspins rakeback rewards" /></figure>
<p>After the welcome bonus, players can earn points towards Metaspins loyalty program.

<h3>Jackbit &#8211; One of The Best New Casinos For Ongoing Deals</h3>
<p>Jackbit is in a unique spot on this list. You’ve seen that most casinos so far provide high welcome bonuses, ideally with low wagering requirements. However, Jackbit actually doesn’t have a single welcome bonus to its name.</p>
<p>This innovative casino started out in 2022, incorporating gamification elements wherever it could. This has led to it being one of the most interesting casinos of the year. Coupled with its brilliant visual style, it’s extremely intuitive, and one of the best crypto casinos for beginner gamblers.</p>
<p>In terms of games on offer, it provides over 6000 slots titles alone, and packs traditional casino games, live games, sports, and esports alongside them.</p>
<p>While there isn’t a specific welcome bonus per se, Jackbit does have ongoing deals for its users. If you’re a casual or beginner player looking for a casino that puts out regular tournaments, daily bonuses, and promotions, Jackbit might be perfect for you.</p>
<p>The casino currently has a 3+1 promotion on its sportsbook, giving you a free bet for every 3 you place.<br />

<h2>Types of Crypto Casino Welcome Bonuses</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are several common types of Bitcoin casino bonuses, each with their own advantages. Here, we’ll take a closer look at the different types of crypto casino bonuses and where players can find them.</p>
<h3>Deposit Match Bonuses</h3>
<p>Deposit match bonuses are by far the most common type of Bitcoin casino free bonuses available today. With a deposit bonus, the amount of bonus a player earns is proportional to the size of their deposit, up to a maximum bonus amount. Deposit match bonuses require that players make a deposit, unlike a Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus.</p>
<p>Here are the best Bitcoin deposit match bonus offers for 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/"><strong>BC.Game</strong></a> &#8211; Earn up to $220,000 over 4 deposits</li>
<li><a href="https://cloudbet.com/en/bitcoin-bonus?af_token=ae4254b0cbbf0760d3442112d77a6748&amp;aftm_campaign=cryptonews"><strong>Cloudbet </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 5 BTC with a 100% match</li>
<li><a href="https://refpa4903566.top///L?tag=b_1671237m_3425c_&amp;site=1671237&amp;ad=3425"><strong>1xBit </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 7 BTC over 4 deposits</li>
<li><a href="https://betflip.io/?refId=630f9b2a574c3d8d53f10986"><strong>BetFlip </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 5 BTC over 4 deposits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Free Spins Bonuses</h3>
<p>Free spins bonus offers give players free plays on a casino’s slot machines. They offer a fun way to try out popular slot games, and players have a chance to win big without risking any of their own money. The more free spins, the more chances a player has to win.</p>
<p>Some of the best free spins bonuses can be found at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mBit </strong>&#8211; Earn 300 free spins after first deposit</li>
<li><strong>Winz.io </strong>&#8211; Earn 300 free spins with no wagering requirement</li>
<li><strong>FortuneJack </strong>&#8211; Earn 250 free spins after first deposit</li>
<li><strong>Hell Spin </strong>&#8211; Earn 100 free spins with every reload</li>
</ul>
<h3>No Deposit Bonuses</h3>
<p>A Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus is a coveted type of bonus that can’t be found very often. In fact, none of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm"><u>Bitcoin casinos</u></a> we reviewed currently offer a Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus in 2023 for USA players.</p>
<p>A no deposit bonus gives a player free cash or free spins just for creating a casino account. There’s no deposit required and a player can start using the bonus funds right away to start playing slots and other casino games. If the player runs out of bonus funds, they can either make a deposit to keep playing or simply switch to a new casino.</p>
<p>Bitcoin casino USA no deposit bonus offers tend to be much smaller than deposit match bonuses when they can be found. For example, a $100 USA crypto casino no deposit bonus would be considered very large, while deposit match bonuses can exceed $100,000 in value.</p>
<h3>Reload Bonuses</h3>
<p>Reload bonuses are bonus offers targeted at returning players. They provide an incentive for players to make another deposit to their account after they’ve already played through the casino’s welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Reload bonuses can be quite generous. Here are some of the best offers for returning players:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hell Spin</strong> &#8211; 50% match up to $200 + 100 free spins</li>
<li><strong>Betflip </strong>&#8211; 100% match up to $1,500 on weekends</li>
<li><strong>BetOnline </strong>&#8211; 35% match up to $35</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loyalty Bonuses</h3>
<p>Some casinos also offer loyalty bonuses for returning players. These are distinct from reload bonuses because they don’t necessarily require players to make a new deposit. Instead, they offer players rewards based on the amount they’ve wagered or the frequency with which they visit a casino.</p>
<p>Some popular loyalty bonuses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1xBit</strong> &#8211; Promo code store for points-based promotions</li>
<li><strong>Thunderpick</strong> &#8211; Surprise bonus offers for returning players</li>
<li><strong>Metaspins </strong>&#8211; Earn up to 60% cashback on losses</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bitcoin Casino Bonus Codes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm"><u>Bitcoin gambling sites</u></a> require bonus codes in order to claim a welcome bonus or reload bonus. These promo codes are used to ensure that players are getting the latest bonus offer. They can also be used to track referrals or to enable players to choose between several different available bonus offers.</p>
<p>That said, many Bitcoin casinos choose to forgo bonus codes, especially for new players. In that case, a bonus is applied automatically whenever players qualify for it. This helps ensure that players never miss out on a bonus opportunity.</p>
<p>Here are the bonus codes for the best Bitcoin casino bonus offers:<br />

Bitcoin Casino Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions</p>
<p>Bitcoin casino bonuses come with a fair amount of fine print. It’s important to understand the restrictions on bonus offers and how bonus cash can be used. Here are some of the key terms and conditions to know:</p>
<h3>Wager Requirement</h3>
<p>The wager requirement is perhaps the most important condition every player should know about when using Bitcoin casino bonuses. This is the amount, relative to the amount of the bonus, that a player must bet in order to be able to withdraw their bonus funds.</p>
<p>As an example, say a $1,000 bonus has a wager requirement of 40X. That means that in order for the player to withdraw the bonus cash or any winnings earned by betting the bonus money, they must first wager at least $40,000 at the casino.</p>
<h3>Game Restrictions</h3>
<p>Some of the best crypto casino bonuses can be played on any games that a casino offers, but this isn’t usually the case. More frequently, bonus cash can only be used for certain types of games, like slots.</p>
<p>Many casinos restrict bonuses from being used on live dealer games. There may also be specific games or software providers for which bonus funds cannot be used.</p>
<h3>Valid Period</h3>
<p>Bonuses often don’t last forever. Casinos may require that players meet a bonus’s wagering requirement within a certain amount of time, like 30 or 60 days. This means that players have to be strategic about how large a bonus they claim based on how much they think they will wager in the days or weeks after signing up for a new casino site.</p>
<h3>Win Limits</h3>
<p>Some casinos place limits on the amount that players can win when using bonus funds. While this sounds a little underhanded, these limits are usually quite high. They’re mainly intended to prevent players from winning a massive jackpot while betting with bonus funds.<br />

<h3>Mobile Payment Method Restrictions</h3>
<p>Many of the best crypto casino bonuses are only available to players who deposit cryptocurrency. The crypto tokens accepted for bonus deposits vary from one casino to another, but most accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Many also accept Ethereum.</p>
<p>On top of that, most casinos have minimum deposit requirements that players must meet in order to qualify for the bonus offer.</p>
<p>Here are the key payment method restrictions for the 12 best Bitcoin casino bonuses: Bitcoin Casino Bonuses</p>

<h2>Top 5 Tips for Using Online Crypto Casino Bonuses</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To get the most out of crypto casino bonuses, it helps to have a few tricks. Here are our top tips for playing with crypto casino bonuses.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look for no deposit bonuses. </strong>No deposit casino bonus offers are tough to find, but they appear from time to time. The best USA Bitcoin casino with no deposit bonus lets players try out a casino without risking any of their own funds.</li>
<li><strong>Play eligible games.</strong> Players need to make sure that once they claim a bonus, they’re sticking to games that count towards the wager requirement. Most casinos only offer a limited amount of time to meet the wager requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Bet big.</strong> Bonus funds and free spins are use-it-or-lose-it in most cases. So, it’s worth betting big with a bonus rather than playing carefully and potentially missing out on bonus cash.</li>
<li><strong>Be strategic about reloads.</strong> Players can stretch their money a lot further by being strategic about how and when they deposit money into their account. Many casinos offer extra reload bonuses on specific days of the week.</li>
<li><strong>Loyalty pays off. </strong>While it can be tempting to claim casino bonuses at many different casinos, loyalty has its own rewards. Often, returning players receive surprise bonuses and perks that can be worth a lot of money.</li>

<h3><strong>2. MetaMask &#8211; Popular Decentralized Wallet for Storing ERC-20 Tokens and NFTs</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-wallet-review.htm">MetaMask</a> is one of the best DeFi crypto wallets for storing Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens. Used by <a href="https://metamask.io/">over 30 million people</a>, MetaMask is free to download. Users can choose from the mobile app for iOS and Android or a web browser extension. The latter includes Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox.</p>
<p>MetaMask provides users with a 12-word backup passphrase when creating a wallet. Only the user has access to the passphrase, ensuring that MetaMask remains decentralized at all times. The wallet is secured by a password, which needs to be entered when opening it.</p>
<p>While MetaMask supports a range of other networks, by default, it only connects to Ethereum. Other networks can be added manually. This includes Polygon, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. However, there is a lack of support for many notable blockchains. In addition to Bitcoin, this includes some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> &#8211; such as Cardano, Solana, and XRP.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-xrp-wallets.htm">popular XRP wallet</a> comes with an in-built staking tool that connects to Rocket Pool and Lido. Currently, these staking pools offer APYs of 3.8% and 4.3% on Ethereum deposits, respectively. For more options, MetaMask can be connected to decentralized applications. This can be done within the wallet interface or externally.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311615/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="MetaMask swap" /></figure>
<p>MetaMask also offers an in-built token-swapping tool. This enables users to trade tokens without going through a centralized exchange. All supported network standards are compatible. However, once again, better rates are often available when connecting to dApps like UniSwap or PancakeSwap.</p>
<p>MetaMask has also partnered with various third parties to process debit/credit card and e-wallet payments. This includes Sardine, MoonPey, PayPal, and Transak. Users are redirected to a supported payment provider based on their location and required cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h3><strong>4. OKX &#8211; Decentralized Wallet App With Aggregator Tool to Maximize Yields   </strong></h3>
<p>OKX is also one of the best decentralized crypto wallets to consider today. Backed by one of the world&#8217;s leading exchanges, OKX is compatible with iOS and Android devices. It is free to download and comes packed with features. At the forefront of this is its exchange aggregator tool.</p>
<p>In simple terms, OKX scrapes data from over 200 <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">DeFi exchanges</a>. This allows investors to find the highest APYs when earning interest via staking, yield farming, and crypto savings accounts. Best of all, there is no requirement to visit external DeFi exchanges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="539" class="alignnone wp-image-125638 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet.jpg" alt="OKX crypto wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Instead, the OKX aggregator tool allows users to complete their investments via the wallet interface. Moreover, the OKX wallet also supports in-built token swaps. Users will almost always secure the best exchange rates, considering the aggregator tool checks over 200 platforms.</p>
<p>In terms of fees, OKX adds a markup when swapping tokens or earning interest. While there is no fixed commission, fees are clearly displayed before confirming orders. Finally, OKX supports dozens of blockchain networks &#8211; including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. However, there is no support for Bitcoin.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Trezor &#8211; Self-Custody Hardware Wallet Aimed at Long-Term Crypto Investors    </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en">Trezor</a> is one of the best decentralized crypto wallets for security. Retailing from $69, the Trezor device allows investors to keep their cryptocurrencies in cold storage. In simple terms, this means that Trezor is never connected to live servers.</p>
<p>As such, the cryptocurrencies stored are kept away from remote hackers at all times. That said, Trezor will not appeal to those that actively trade or move cryptocurrencies. This is because to transfer tokens out of Trezor, users need access to the device.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="527" class="alignnone wp-image-125640 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3.jpg" alt="Trezor Safe 3" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3-768x450.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Only after entering the PIN on the Trezor device is the transaction authorized. Nonetheless, Trezor connects to its native app for iOS and Android. This allows users to view their cryptocurrency balances, with real-time valuations.</p>
<p>The Trezor app also allows users to buy cryptocurrencies with a debit/credit card and other fiat payment methods. However, watch out for fees, as fiat payments are processed by third parties. Finally, Trezor supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. This includes Bitcoin and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">best utility tokens</a>, such as Ethereum, Polygon, and XRP.</p>

<p>Coinbase Wallet is a decentralized wallet app for iOS and Android. This wallet is completely separate from the main Coinbase exchange &#8211; which is centralized. As such, Coinbase Wallet users have full control of their cryptocurrencies and private keys.</p>
<p>The wallet is free to download and ideal for beginners exploring <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-non-custodial-wallets.htm">non-custodial storage</a> for the first time. In fact, setting up the wallet takes seconds. Users simply need to choose a strong password and write down their backup passphrase.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311618/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Coinbase Wallet app" /></figure>

<p>Another security tool offered by Electrum is multi-signature permissions. This requires users to authorize outgoing transfers across two or more wallets. Like most decentralized wallets, Electrum is protected by a password.</p>
<p>If this is forgotten or the device is lost, damaged, or stolen &#8211; the wallet can be recovered with the backup passphrase. Finally, Electrum also offers a mobile app for Android smartphones. Unfortunately for Apple users, there are no plans to release an iOS version.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Crypto.com &#8211; Feature-Rich DeFi Wallet Supporting Interest Accounts   </strong></h3>
<p>Crypto.com is a leading crypto exchange that also offers a decentralized wallet. This is a non-custodial wallet app for iOS and Android. There is also a browser extension and desktop software for those that prefer using a laptop device.</p>
<p>Crypto.com supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies across 30+ network standards. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, and its own network &#8211; Crypto.org Chain. The wallet is protected by a password and backup passphrase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222672/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-57-06.jpg" alt="" /> <img decoding="async" width="900" height="658" class="alignnone wp-image-125642 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet.jpg" alt="Crypto.com wallet app" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet-768x561.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The latter &#8211; which consists of a 12, 18, or 24-word passphrase, is displayed when setting up the wallet. Crypto.com enables users to set their own <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/learn/defi/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees">GAS fees</a> when transferring funds. This supports efficient transactions based on real-time GAS prices.</p>
<p>That said, one of the best features of the Crypto.com wallet is its in-built support for interest accounts. This supports over 25 cryptocurrencies, including Cronos, Cosmos, and Dai. Alternatively, the Crypto.com wallet can also connect to dApps like MM Finance and VVS Finance.</p>

<h3><strong>9. BitAddress &#8211; Open-Sourced Paper Wallet Provider for Free Cold Storage     </strong></h3>
<p>BitAddress is the best decentralized crypto wallet for cost-effective cold storage. Unlike Trezor and Ledger Nano, BitAddress is completely free to use. This is because BitAddress is a &#8216;paper&#8217; wallet solution. Here&#8217;s how it works. First, users visit the BitAddress website to create a new wallet address.</p>
<p>Within seconds, BitAddress will display two unique barcodes. One represents the wallet address. The other is the wallet&#8217;s private keys. The user can then transfer Bitcoin to the wallet address and finally &#8211; print the two bar codes onto a sheet of paper and keep it somewhere safe.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Bitaddress.org Bitcoin wallet" /></figure>
<p>In doing so, the Bitcoin tokens remain offline at all times. If the user wants to transfer the tokens to another wallet, they can scan the private key QR code. This imports the wallet credentials to the next wallet location.</p>
<p>In terms of safety, BitAddress is an <a href="https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org">open-sourced provider</a> that merely creates Bitcoin wallet addresses and private keys. This means it is the user&#8217;s responsibility to keep their credentials safe. Finally, BitAddress only supports Bitcoin &#8211; so this option won&#8217;t be suitable for diversified portfolios.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a Decentralized Wallet?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Decentralized wallets give users full control of their crypto investments. Unlike centralized wallets, only the user has access to their private keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, decentralized wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrency tokens safely. This is because users control their private keys.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to centralized wallets, which are often provided by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> or brokers. This is because centralized wallets do not provide users with their private keys. This means users need to trust the centralized provider will keep their funds safe.</p>
<p>Importantly, when setting up a decentralized wallet, private keys are usually provided in a simplified form. This is often a 12-word passphrase that needs to be entered in the correct order. Nonetheless, the decentralized wallet provider will never have access to the private keys.</p>
<p>This means users are responsible for safeguarding their wallets. If the wallet is compromised or the private keys are misplaced &#8211; the provider cannot help recover the funds.</p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Using a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the core benefits provided by decentralized wallets include sole custody of the private keys, access to dApps, and faster transaction times.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still not sure if a decentralized wallet is the best option?</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of using a decentralized wallet for storing cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3><strong>Full Control of Crypto Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>The main attraction of decentralized wallets is that users control their funds. This is because only the user has access to their private keys.</p>
<p>As such, only the user can authorize outgoing transactions. Moreover, entities &#8211; whether that&#8217;s the wallet provider or the government, cannot access the crypto funds.</p>
<p>This allows users to store wealth outside of the conventional financial system. In other words, users do not need to trust decentralized wallet providers as they do with centralized exchanges.</p>
<h3><strong>Faster Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>The best decentralized crypto wallets offer much faster transaction times when compared to centralized options.</p>
<p>This is because there is no requirement to have the transaction authorized by a third party.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, consider the process involved when storing crypto tokens on a centralized exchange</li>
<li>First, the user would need to request a withdrawal from the exchange</li>
<li>The user would need to wait for the exchange to approve the transfer</li>
<li>This could take minutes, hours, or days &#8211; this can vary widely depending on the centralized exchange</li>
<li>Once approved, only then will the crypto tokens be transferred to the recipient</li>
</ul>
<p>In comparison, there is no third-party approval process with decentralized wallets. As such, the transaction will be executed on the blockchain as soon as it is verified by the wallet owner.</p>
<h3><strong>Store a Great Number of Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>When using a centralized wallet, the number of supported tokens will often be limited. This is because users can only store tokens that are supported by the exchange.</p>
<p>In comparison, the best DeFi wallets support thousands, sometimes <i>millions,</i> of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Take Trust Wallet as a prime example. We found that Trust Wallet is compatible with over 70 blockchain networks and 4.5 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This enables investors to store all of their digital assets in one safe place.</p>
<h3><strong>Access Web 3.0 dApps </strong></h3>
<p>The best decentralized crypto wallets provide seamless access to Web 3.0 dApps.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="DApps list" /></figure>
<p>Some of the most commonly supported dApps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>UniSwap</li>
<li>SushiSwap</li>
<li>PancakeSwap</li>
<li>OpenSea</li>
<li>Compound</li>
<li>Yearn.finance</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are hundreds more. Crucially, these dApps offer access to decentralized finance tools, such as token swaps, staking, yield farming, and dual investments.</p>
<h3><strong>Anonymity  </strong></h3>
<p>Another popular feature of decentralized crypto wallets is they offer complete anonymity. This means users can create a wallet without providing any personal information or contact details.</p>
<p>All users need to access their wallet is the respective password or private keys.</p>
<h2><strong>Centralized vs Decentralized Wallets</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The responsibility of &#8216;custodianship&#8217; is how DeFi and centralized wallets are differentiated. Centralized wallet providers are tasked with keeping the user&#8217;s cryptocurrencies safe. While DeFi wallets give users full control &#8211; meaning they are responsible for looking after their private keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeFi and centralized wallets both enable users to store their cryptocurrency tokens. The key difference is in who takes responsibility for safeguarding the wallet&#8217;s private keys.</p>
<p>In the case of centralized wallets, private keys are secured by the provider. This is often a crypto exchange or broker. As such, users do not have access to their private keys. In turn, if the custodian is hacked or goes bankrupt (like FTX), the user&#8217;s crypto funds are at risk.</p>
<p>DeFi crypto wallets, on the other hand, give users full control of their funds and private keys. This means that there is no reliance on a third-party custodian. Users can send and receive funds at any time without needing approval from another person or entity.</p>
<p>However, there is nowhere to turn if the DeFi wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys. Therefore, while DeFi wallets give users control of their wealth &#8211; appropriate security practices should be taken.</p>
<p>This means keeping the private keys offline at all times &#8211; preferably written down on a sheet of paper. In doing so, the user can recover their wallet if they forget their password or the device is lost or stolen.</p>
<h2><strong>Different Types of DeFi Wallets</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Now that we have established the difference between centralized and DeFi wallets, we can explore the different types available.</p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Most crypto investors opt for a software-based decentralized wallet. Software wallets are often referred to as &#8216;hot storage&#8217;. This is because the funds remain online at all times, increasing both convenience and risk.</p>
<p>Software wallets come in many forms, but mobile apps are particularly popular. Decentralized wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet both offer an app for iOS and Android. This enables users to secure their crypto funds with a PIN or fingerprint ID.</p>
<p>Mobile wallets are very convenient for actively managing crypto portfolios. At the click of a button, users can send, receive, and trade crypto right from their smartphones.</p>
<p>Software wallets also come as a browser extension. For example, MetaMask offers an extension for Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox browsers. This enables users to access the crypto markets whenever they are on their laptops.</p>
<p>Some decentralized wallets come as desktop software, but this is less common. One of the most popular desktop wallets is Electrum, which safely stores Bitcoin on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Hardware wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrencies on a device. The private keys are held on the device and kept offline at all times.</p>
<p>To transfer crypto to another wallet, users must enter a PIN on the hardware device. This offers an ultra-secure way to store large amounts of crypto.</p>
<p>Equally, hardware wallets are far from convenient for active crypto traders. This is because making last-minute trades is cumbersome, considering access to the hardware device is needed.</p>
<p>The leading hardware wallet providers are Trezor and Ledger Nano. Both are decentralized, as neither provider has access to the device&#8217;s private keys.</p>
<p>However, do remember that users will need to provide some personal and financial information when buying a hardware wallet online.</p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Paper wallets also offer a decentralized way to store crypto tokens. As we mentioned earlier, BitAddress allows users to instantly create a Bitcoin wallet address and private keys.</p>
<p>Both are represented by a QR code, which the user can print onto a sheet of paper. As long as the paper is kept somewhere safe and private, the crypto funds remain unhackable.</p>
<h2><strong>How Secure Are Decentralized Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
First and foremost, there is no requirement to trust a third party when using a decentralized wallet. After all, decentralized wallets merely provide a bridge between crypto transactions and the blockchain.</p>
<p>However, decentralized wallets will always be at risk from remote hacking attempts and theft. As such, users must ensure that they follow sensible security practices to keep their crypto funds safe.</p>
<p>For example, those using a mobile wallet should ensure that a suitable PIN is used. This should be in addition to a lock-screen password for the smartphone. If someone is able to bypass these security measures, they will have access to the wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet data" /></figure>
<p>This is also the case for desktop and browser extension wallets. Another way for hackers to access a decentralized wallet is through &#8216;links&#8217;. For example, a scammer might impersonate the wallet&#8217;s support team and send a link for the user to click.</p>
<p>Unwittingly, the link might install a virus or keylogger, enabling the scammer to access the wallet remotely. The safeguard here is to never click links from unknown sources &#8211; whether that&#8217;s on social media or emails.</p>
<p>The safest option is to keep the crypto wallet offline at all times. For example, consider installing the wallet on a cheap smartphone that is never connected to the internet. Similarly, users might also consider a paper wallet that is stored away from the risk of theft or damage,</p>
<p>Ultimately, decentralized wallets <i>are</i> safe, but users must also take responsibility too. Users also need to consider that increased convenience often leads to reduced security.</p>
<p>For example, while software wallets are convenient for actively trading and investing crypto, the private keys will always be vulnerable to hackers. As such, users should only keep small amounts of crypto in a software wallet.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Select the Best Decentralized Crypto Wallet?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Choosing a suitable wallet is a crucial part of the crypto investing process.</p>
<p>Therefore, this section highlights the most important factors to look for when choosing the best decentralized crypto wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p>Decentralized wallets provide users with their private keys, ensuring that wealth is built and maintained without third parties.</p>
<p>However, decentralized wallets are still vulnerable to hackers. As such, choosing the best decentralized wallet requires users to consider what security features are included.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask are secured by a PIN</li>
<li>Desktop and browser-based wallets are secured by a password</li>
<li>Hardware wallets are secured via cold storage. Plus, users need to enter a PIN on the device to transfer funds</li>
</ul>
<p>In comparison, centralized wallets offer additional security features. This can include device whitelisting, two-factor authentication, and even insurance.</p>
<h3><strong>Supported Networks</strong></h3>
<p>The number and type of blockchain networks supported by decentralized wallets will vary wildly. For example, Trust Wallet supports over 70 networks. This includes Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> &#8211; like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrencies list" /></figure>
<p>In contrast, Electrum only supports one cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin. Crucially, users should check which networks and cryptocurrencies are supported by choosing a decentralized wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Device Type</strong></h3>
<p>Consider the most convenient and secure device type to store the decentralized crypto wallet. Options include desktop software, browser extensions, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>For offline storage, consider a hardware or paper wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3>
<p>Another factor to consider is user-friendliness.</p>
<p>For instance, beginners should explore whether the chosen decentralized wallet is suitable for their skill set. Sending and receiving crypto should be simple, as should setting up and securing the wallet.</p>
<p>More experienced crypto investors might seek a crypto wallet with more advanced features. For example, Electrum offers multi-signature permissions. While this adds a great level of security to the wallet, this feature is not suitable for newbies.</p>
<h3><strong>Investment and Trading Features</strong></h3>
<p>The best decentralized wallets enable users to maximize their crypto investments. For example, OKX has an in-built aggregator tool that connects to over 200 dApps.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="Trending crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>Users can search for the crypto they currently hold in the OKX wallet and locate the highest APYs available. OKX also comes with an in-built token-swapping tool, not to mention a fully-fledged NFT marketplace.</p>
<p>In contrast, the likes of BitAddress and Electrum do not offer any such features.</p>
<h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Use a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Below, we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up an account and use our top decentralized wallet, Best Wallet, which should only take five minutes.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Download Best Wallet App</strong></h3>
<p>First, find the Best Wallet app, which is available on mobile for Android and iOS in the App Store and the Play Store and download it.</p>
<p>A desktop browser extension is currently in development and will be released soon.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" alt="Best Wallet mobile app" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Create an Account</strong></h3>
<p>As a leading self-custody, decentralized wallet, all that&#8217;s needed to create an account is an active email address.</p>
<p>There is no KYC requirements to fill in, allowing for anonymous storage and transfers.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Choose Security Settings</strong></h3>
<p>Next, choose the level of security you wish to attach to the account.</p>
<p>All accounts will require a four-digit passcode to be input and confirmed, while there is the option to add two-factor authentication and/or fingerprint ID.</p>
<p>Once that step is complete, an account will have been created, but users should head to the settings tab and note down their private key.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>An account has now been created and users will be redirected to Best Wallet dashboard, where they will be able to purchase or store crypto an trade on the built-in DEX.</p>
<p>As outlined above, some features are not yet live at the time of writing but will be launched in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/best-wallet-homescreen.jpg" alt="Best Wallet main wallet" /></figure>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In summary, decentralized wallets offer many benefits for crypto investors. This includes having full control of the wallet&#8217;s private keys, enabling investors to become their own bank.</p>
<p>Decentralized wallets are also ideal for connecting to Web3 applications, as well as remaining anonymous. That said, do remember that decentralized wallets also invite risk. If the wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys &#8211; the crypto funds will likely be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to choose wisely when selecting a decentralized wallet, with Best Wallet our top pick and an excellent choice. The self-custody wallet allows for accounts to be created in less than five minutes with no KYC verification needed, with users able to securely store crypto and trade tokens via built-in DEX.</p>
<p>It stands out ahead of its rivals because it is more than just a crypto wallet &#8211; its native token $BEST can be staked to earn rewards and holding it also grants other benefits such as early access to new projects and NFTS and reduced fees, while the platform will also offer unique insights and data on trending tokens.</p>
<p>$BEST is not yet live but will be airdropped to active users of the wallet in the near future.</p>

<p>Do you know a person who was born a great investor? Neither do we. Profitable investing often requires exceptional insight, luck, discipline, and experience. Most first-rate traders had lost money for weeks, months, or even years before they finally turned in profits. That’s one way to look at it &#8211; sometimes you have to lose some to learn how to make some. But it doesn’t necessarily have to be like this.</p>
<p>It’s a fact that the quickest way to learn something is by doing. However, you can’t just blindly jump into the fire without getting burned. That’s where a strategy comes in.</p>
<p>Having a strategy means combining some theory with your market analysis and putting it into practice. It is a powerful combination, especially if you know what you’re doing. Unfortunately, most beginning investors think they do, only to learn that they don’t.</p>
<p>That’s why a smart way to approach investing is by having someone to coach you. Having a mentor, a friend, a coach, or anyone else with the relevant experience can streamline your learning process without burning your portfolio via expensive trial and error experiments.</p>
<p>However, that’s easier said than done. Great mentors or coaches typically cost sums of money that aren’t available in just anyone’s pockets. Not every retail investor can afford a great investing coach.</p>
<p>Despite that, having someone to discuss the market and your decisions is still an invaluable experience &#8211; you have to surround yourself with people who can challenge your perceptions. As billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio puts it:</p>
<p><i>“I just want to be right—I don’t care if the right answer comes from me.”</i></p>
<p>That’s why one of the best places to kickstart your crypto investing career is a social trading platform that allows you to invest in cryptocurrencies. In this article, we review some of the best crypto social trading platforms in the market.</p>
<p>But first, what is crypto social trading?</p>
<h2>What is crypto social trading?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Social trading platforms are like social networks for traders. In most cases, they act as a broker and allow you to purchase various assets, CFDs, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Unlike regular trading platforms, social trading platforms let you connect with other traders trading the same markets or goods, copy their actions, share and discuss analyses and predictions, ask questions, grow your following and learn faster than you typically would.</p>
<p>Here, crypto social trading refers to social trading platforms that allow their clients to trade cryptocurrencies or crypto-based asset contracts.</p>
<p>So, which social trading platforms are the best for cryptocurrency enthusiasts in 2023?</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As both cryptocurrencies and social trading become increasingly popular, it is critical to remember that most retail traders (over 70%) tend to lose money. Therefore, having an expert help doesn’t always produce the desired outcomes, and you should be aware of the risks. Even the experts get things wrong.</p>
<p>However, if you’re willing to risk, you should expect some losses for the sake of learning. If you want to set off the right foot, starting to trade on a social trading crypto platform is an excellent starting point, especially if you know the risks.</p>

<h3>Buy XRP with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/">Coinbase</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase">Coinbase</a> is one of the oldest and most trustworthy cryptocurrency exchanges that offer you a quick and convenient way to buy Ripple’s XRP.</p>
<p>It operates in over 100 countries and is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase">extremely easy to use even for novice users</a>. The process is as simple as that:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase"><strong>Open an account.</strong></a> Getting started on Coinbase is easy, quick, and secure.</li>
<li><strong>Verify your identity.</strong> Have a photo of your identification document to confirm your identity.</li>
<li><strong>Buy Ripple (XRP).</strong> Coinbase allows you to buy XRP for as little as USD 25 using your debit card or bank account.</li>
</ol>
<p>The costs of the purchase vary according to your country, but in the vast majority of cases, you will pay either 3.99% for an instant credit/debit card buy or 1.49% for a standard buying operation. Deposits via bank transfers are generally free, except for the U.S. customers.</p>

<h3>Buy XRP on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitstamp/">Bitstamp</a></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5de/fb1a04310e.jpg" alt="buy xrp bitstamp" /></figure>
<p>Bitstamp is a reliable option to buy Ripple’s XRP with dollars (USD) and euros (EUR). As one of the oldest exchanges in the industry, it offers highly liquid markets and seamless trading experience without any distractions.</p>
<p>You may purchase XRP in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a credit/debit card (5% + card issuer’s fees)</li>
<li>Bank deposit: SEPA (free) or international wire transfer (0.05% fee, minimum 7.5 USD/EUR, max. 300 USD/EUR)</li>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), or Bitcoin Cash (BCH) deposit (free of charge)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you may deduce, Bitstamp is exceptionally convenient for European citizens who can make SEPA transfers, as they come free of charge. Such deposits arrive relatively quickly, too &#8211; within one or two business days.</p>
<p>If money is not an issue and time is of the essence, trades directly from your credit or debit card might make sense, too &#8211; but be careful and mind the fees before they sneak up on you.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitstamp/"><strong>Visit Bitstamp</strong></a></p>
<h3>Buy XRP on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bittrex">Bittrex</a></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5de/fb307d0a8a.jpg" alt="buy xrp ripple bittrex" /></figure>
<p>Bittrex is another U.S.-based exchange that lets you buy Ripple XRP cryptocurrency. Still, it is a rather slow option if you’re a new crypto user &#8211; the registration, verification, and filling in a banking application may take some time, and the exchange’s interface is designed for more experienced traders.</p>
<p>Regardless, Bittrex is still a great option, especially when it comes to fees &#8211; Bittrex won’t charge you extra for your USD deposits, so you will only pay 0.25% per trade.</p>
<p>To be eligible for USD deposits, you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be registered on the exchange.</li>
<li>Verify your account.</li>
<li>Get approved for fiat (USD) trading <a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000047992">by submitting an application here.</a></li>
<li>Whitelist your bank account in the account Holdings Tab.</li>
<li>Generate USD deposit code.</li>
<li>Send a wire transfer. Domestic wires typically take 24-48 to settle, while international wires can take 5-10 days to complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can deposit any Bittrex supported cryptocurrency and trade it to XRP &#8211; it is likely to save significant amounts of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bittrex/"><strong>Go to Bittrex</strong></a></p>
<h3>Buy XRP on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/">Binance</a></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5de/fb3e8e3440.jpg" alt="buy xrp on binance" /></figure>
<p>Binance is one of the world’s most popular exchanges whose meteoric rise to the top set an example for many less popular exchanges.</p>
<p>The rise of Binance was partially fueled by some of the lowest fees in the industry, as well as a great selection of altcoins &#8211; XRP included.</p>
<p>In fact, Ripple’s XRP is one of the base pairs in the exchange &#8211; making it easy to exchange it with other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Despite the convenience and low fees, the Binance does not support direct bank deposits, so you will have to use either a credit or debit card to make a purchase via <strong>Koinal</strong>.</p>
<p>The service comes with extra fees, too &#8211; the direct purchase will cost you 2.5% of the total transaction value and can take up to 20 minutes to process.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can deposit any of the 176 supported cryptocurrencies and exchange them for XRP.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/"><strong>Buy XRP on Binance</strong></a></p>
<h3>Buy XRP on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/">Kraken</a></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5de/fb4157da59.jpg" alt="buy xrp on kraken" /></figure>
<p>Kraken is a top exchange for starting cryptocurrency traders who are interested in buying XRP. It accepts deposits in five fiat currencies and supports dozens of different local deposit options &#8211; SWIFT transfers, FedWire’s, SEPA transfers, wire transfers, and even in-person cash deposits in Canada. However, you won’t be able to fund your account via credit or debit card &#8211; Kraken does not deal with those.</p>
<p>In any case, like most exchanges, it will ask you to verify your identity upon registration.</p>
<p>The five supported fiat currencies include U.S. dollars (USD), euros (EUR), Canadian dollars (CAD), Great Britain pounds (GBP), and Japanese yens (JPY). The fees and duration depend on the deposit option of your choice &#8211; expect to pay anything from “free” to 35 USD or EUR + 0.125%.</p>
<p>See the Kraken <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000381846-Fiat-currency-deposit-methods-fees-and-minimums">deposit options table</a> to learn more and find the best option for you.</p>
<p>Once you are through with your deposit, you will be able to buy XRP on one of Kraken’s markets for as little as 0.26% fee per trade.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken"><strong>Visit Kraken Exchange</strong></a></p>
<h3>How To Buy Ripple XRP Anonymously</h3>
<p>There is no easy way to buy Ripple XRP anonymously, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Perhaps the easiest way to do so is by asking someone in your local crypto community to sell you some XRP with cash.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can check the advertisements of the following peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/localbitcoins/">LocalBitcoins.</a></li>
<li>HodlHodl.</li>
<li>LocalCoinSwap</li>
<li>Paxful</li>
<li>Bisq.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before making a P2P trade, be it regular cash to crypto exchange or online, be sure to check the other party’s feedback and reputation.</p>
<h3>Get Ripple XRP Wallet</h3>
<p>Once you’ve managed to buy some XRP, <strong>do not leave it on the cryptocurrency exchange</strong>. Regardless of what the exchanges say, it has been proven many times that leaving XRP on an exchange is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-it-is-risky-to-leave-your-cryptocurrency-in-exchange.htm">a bad idea</a> &#8211; your funds might be lost in a hacking accident, or your account might be compromised.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to get a hold of a substantial amount of Ripple’s XRP, you should consider getting a private XRP wallet. The simplest self-custody option is to download, set up and install one of the following software wallets &#8211; <strong>Toast Wallet</strong>, <strong>Abra Wallet</strong>, <strong>Wirex</strong>, <strong>Rippex</strong>, <strong>Exarpy</strong>, or <strong>Cryptonator</strong>.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to hold more than a USD 1000 worth of XRP, it is recommended to set up “<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin-cold-storage.htm">cold storage.</a>” The easiest way to set up a cold wallet is by getting a hardware wallet &#8211; devices by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><strong>Ledger</strong></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><strong>Trezor Model T</strong></a> allow you to store XRP with cutting-edge security.</p>

<h3>5. Binance &#8211; Top Ethereum Wallet Linked to Leading CEX Binance</h3>
<p>The Binance wallet is a secure crypto wallet for Ethereum, Binance Beacon Chain and Binance Smart Chain. Its biggest strength is its inherent connection with the Binance crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Binance is the largest Bitcoin and altcoin crypto exchange in the world. It supports 385 different crypto assets and tokens on its platform. Binance’s reputation as the largest crypto exchange in the world allows users to trust its Ethereum wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271164/binance-wallet.jpg" alt="Binance crypto wallet" /></figure>

<p>It is user-friendly and allows users a wide range of crypto services. For example, users can send tokens through a QR code. This allows beginners to safely engage in crypto trading without making any costly errors.</p>
<p>The Binance wallet is also looking to launch a new swap feature. The swap feature will allow users to swap their tokens from the wallet without visiting any crypto exchange platforms. The swap feature would also employ DEX aggregators and market makers to ensure that the users can access tokens at low prices.</p>
<p>Due to the wallet’s link with the Binance exchange, users can instantaneously transfer their crypto funds from the wallet to the exchange and trade to maximize their profits. Users can also take advantage of Binance’s NFT marketplace and stake-to-earn service.</p>
<p>While the wallet’s connectivity to the Binance exchange has numerous advantages, it does make the wallet vulnerable to malicious activity.</p>

<h2>How Do Ethereum Wallets Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Beginner investors can easily choose the best Ethereum wallet from our list. However, it is imperative to understand how crypto wallets work to trust the allocation of your digital assets to them.</p>
<p>Ethereum wallets provide a secure, efficient and user-friendly mechanism to store ETH, NFTs and other crypto tokens and then later <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-can-you-buy-with-ethereum.htm">buy products with Ethereum</a> if they so wish.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets are not unlike regular cash wallets. They also allow users to digitally hold their assets, the key difference being that crypto assets are not physically stored in the wallet.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are bits of data that are located on a blockchain. The wallets essentially store the user’s proof of ownership of crypto assets.</p>
<p>ETH tokens are stored in Ethereum’s Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). Most Ethereum wallets allow users to generate a new Ethereum account. Traders do not need to use a previously generated Ethereum account.</p>
<p>Users operate their ETH tokens through two cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key. </p>
<p><strong>Public Key</strong>: A public key can be intuitively visualized as a bank account number. Users can transfer ETH tokens from to others using their public key. Public keys are named so because users can publicly distribute this key to receive crypto assets from others.</p>
<p><strong>Private Key</strong>: A private key is an alpha-numeric passcode that proves a user’s ownership of an Ethereum account. Every Ethereum EOA has an associated private key. As the name suggests, a private key needs to be protected at all costs. </p>
<p>If a malicious actor gets hold of the key, they can easily claim possession of all the crypto assets associated with it. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, in most cases, users cannot even recover their accounts.</p>
<p>A private key has another important use. Ethereum uses a user’s private key to cryptographically generate a digital signature. This digital signature is used to sign all outgoing crypto transactions. A malicious actor can use the private key to forge transactions.</p>
<p>A wallet is primarily responsible for protecting this private key. Furthermore, a wallet can also generate multiple public keys. A public key is cryptographically derived from a private key. While the public key can be distributed, it can be used to track certain details about a user such as transaction history and account balance. Therefore, modern wallets generate a new public key after every transaction to protect a user’s privacy.</p>
<p>A crypto wallet uses a seed phrase to authenticate the user’s ownership of the wallet. Therefore, it is imperative that users protect their seed phrases from ever being stolen. Users can also choose to store the phrase at multiple locations for surety. </p>
<h2>Types of Ethereum Wallet</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While all wallets generally perform the same set of functions, there can be several key differences between them. A beginner user needs to understand the tradeoffs involved in order to choose the best Ethereum wallet.</p>
<p>Based on the mode of availability, wallets are generally categorized into three categories: software wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets. </p>
<h3>Software Wallet</h3>
<p>A software wallet is an application that allows users to store their crypto assets by digitally securing their private keys.</p>
<p>A software wallet’s best feature is its accessibility. Users can access these applications on commonly used devices such as Android and iOS phones, personal computers and even web browsers. They do not require the purchase of any new equipment or device.</p>
<p>Software wallets are commonly referred to as hot wallets. While those terms may be used interchangeably, a hot wallet is technically referred to as any wallet that is connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Software wallets being connected to the internet results in a tradeoff between ease of use and security. Software wallets allow users to quickly purchase and sell crypto assets using their private keys. The<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm"> best crypto apps</a> can also often support a wider range of crypto tokens and provide seamless transactions. Furthermore, they provide a range of payment options such as credit/debit cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay and PayPal.</p>
<p>While software wallets provide a bevy of advantages, they are considered less secure than hardware wallets. The connectivity to the internet can allow hackers and other malicious actors to gain access to a user’s private key.</p>
<p>A software wallet can be further categorized into three categories: mobile wallets, desktop wallets and web wallets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Wallet</strong>: As the name suggests, mobile wallets are applications that users can run on their Android or iOS platforms. Best Ethereum wallets such as Best Wallet offer these applications on both Google Play Store and Apple app store.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Wallet</strong>: Desktop wallets are wallet interfaces that users can download on their personal computers. Desktop applications store the private key on the computer’s local storage. </li>
<li><strong>Web Wallet</strong>: Web wallets are one of the most popular kinds of software wallets. Users can usually search for these wallet services on the internet and add them as a web browser extension. While these wallets provide extremely user-friendly interfaces, they are considered the least secure. They can be subjected to keylogger hacks and distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Hardware Wallets</h3>
<p>Hardware wallets are considered one of the most secure forms of crypto storage. These wallets are physical pieces of equipment that secure the private-public key pair. Users need to connect the equipment to a device such as a personal computer to operate the wallet.</p>
<p>An Ethereum hardware wallet is also referred to as a cold wallet. Cold wallets are defined as any crypto storage device that does not connect to the internet. The lack of internet connection ensures that malicious actors cannot steal the confidential information of the users. Software wallets are as secure as the platform they are operating on while hardware wallets provide additional multiple layers of security for users.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd.jpg" alt="Crypto coins and a ledger wallet" /></figure>
<p>Hardware wallets can also provide additional security features. For example, modern cold wallets use security features such as a PIN code or a biometric scan that makes it impossible for a malicious actor to access the crypto tokens. Hardware wallets are also coming up with additional technology to replace seed phrases, thus eliminating the single point of failure.</p>
<p>While hardware wallets are secure, they also have some key disadvantages. Most importantly, hardware wallets are considered to be less user-friendly than software wallets. These wallets need to be connected to another device such as a desktop to operate.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are also considered significantly more expensive than software wallets &#8211; the price of a hardware wallet can usually range between $50 &#8211; $300 and can be a deal breaker for several users. </p>
<h3>Paper Wallets</h3>
<p>Ethereum paper wallet involves crypto asset holders writing down their private-public key pair on a piece of paper. This is an old method of storage that is rarely used with the advent of modern crypto wallet technology.</p>
<p>Paper wallets are a kind of cold wallet. However, unlike hardware wallets, they are considered unreliable and risky. Users with paper wallets require an interface to access the blockchain. Therefore, they often end up depending upon exchanges or software wallets, negating any advantage of cold storage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, paper wallets are a massive single point of failure risk. The private key can be lost, stolen or destroyed, making it impossible for the user to ever access their crypto assets. </p>
<h2>How to Find Safe Ethereum Wallets?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The primary function of an Ethereum wallet is to secure a user’s private key and the crypto assets allocated to it. </p>
<p>Investors, especially those just entering into crypto investment are always keen to know if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-cryptocurrency-safe.htm">cryptocurrency is safe to invest in</a> and wallets are a necessary feature of participating in the space. However, there are several factors that a user can consider to choose the most secure Ethereum wallet. </p>
<h3>Reputation of the Provider</h3>
<p>Due to the decentralized nature of crypto, scams and rug pulls are one of the biggest threats to the digital assets of a user. </p>
<p>Therefore, considering the reputation of a wallet provider is the easiest step a user can take to trust the authenticity of the wallet.</p>
<p>For example, a wallet that is regulated by a leading regulatory body can generally be trusted. Similarly, providers with a strong track record of traditional financing can also be trusted with their crypto products.</p>
<h3>Security Features</h3>
<p>A good understanding of the various security features offered by crypto wallets can help users select the best wallet.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are usually considered the most secure option. These wallets are not connected to the internet, preventing any malicious activity to access the user’s confidential data. They can also provide additional security features such as biometrics and a PIN code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a software wallet can also be trusted if it provides comprehensive security features.</p>
<h3>Testing the Wallet</h3>
<p>Testing the wallet may be the best way to develop trust. Users can send a small amount of crypto assets using the wallet before trusting it for significant amounts. A number of Ethereum wallets also allow users to try out the wallet on the testnet using fake crypto assets. </p>
<h2>How To Choose The Best Ethereum Wallet For You?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The choice for the best Ethereum wallet is a matter of personal choice and can differ from user to user. Here are the key factors that can help users make an informed choice. </p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>As we have already discussed, a wallet’s primary role is to ensure the security of a user’s crypto assets. Therefore, users need to consider security as their top priority while selecting the Ethereum wallet. Beginners need to choose a wallet that is reputed and is certified by a regulatory body.</p>
<p>Beginners are also susceptible to losing their private keys. Therefore, they need to choose a wallet with proper wallet recovery options such as seed phrase, two-factor authentication. </p>
<p>Remember, it is possible to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-avoid-crypto-taxes.htm">avoid paying tax on crypto</a> if you simply keep it in your wallet and don&#8217;t sell it, but you want peace of mind that it will still be there when you return.</p>
<h3>Supported Coins </h3>
<p>Beginners can be overwhelmed by the wide variety of assets available in the crypto market. A high-quality wallet supports a large number of crypto tokens, thus allowing users to diversify their portfolios.</p>
<p>Many top wallets are also universal in nature as they support more than one blockchain network.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Another important factor to consider is the fees required to purchase certain crypto assets through a wallet. Different wallets use different exchanges to allow users to purchase crypto tokens from the wallet interface. Hardware wallets can often partner with third-party services to offer crypto functionality to users.</p>
<p>Fees can be of various types such as processing fees, network fees, trading fees, withdrawal fees, etc. Hardware wallets also require users to purchase the device upfront which can be expensive.</p>
<h3>User-Friendliness</h3>
<p>Beginners need to consider that the wallet they choose is user-friendly. The idea of user-friendliness can differ from user to user. Beginner users may prioritize the ability to operate their Ethereum wallets from their mobile phones. Proper customer support and a broad ecosystem can also make wallets like Best Wallet user-friendly.</p>
<p>Most importantly, wallets must provide users with a clear user interface to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies. </p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Users may prioritize the availability of certain features in their wallets. For example, NFT enthusiasts may prioritize that the wallet provides NFT support. Seasoned investors may require staking, farming and yield functionality in their wallets. </p>
<h3>Type of Wallet and Mobile Availability</h3>
<p>Users need to make a careful choice between hardware wallets and software wallets. Most beginners prefer the availability of mobile wallets. Therefore, they need to ensure that the wallet of their choice provides Android or iOS support.</p>
<p>Seasoned investors may choose a multi-layered approach that involves both hot wallets and cold wallets. Such users usually store their assets in cold storage and transfer them to a hot wallet when they are looking to trade. </p>
<h2>How to Get &amp; Use A Ethereum Wallet &#8211; Step-by-Step</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>By now, a user has enough information to choose the best Ethereum wallet of their liking. Now, let’s go over how users can operate an Ethereum wallet seamlessly. We are taking the example of the Best Wallet due to its simplistic user interface.</p>

<p>The best crypto wallet in Australia provides numerous features, robust security measures, low fees, and in-wallet crypto trading capabilities.</p>
<p>This section evaluates the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia in 2023.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Best Wallet &#8211; Overall Best Crypto Wallet in Australia in 2023 with Multi-Chain Functionality, a DEX, and Enhanced Features</strong></h3>
<p>Topping our list of the best crypto wallets for Australia-based investors is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">Best Wallet</a>, a newly launched non-custodial software wallet that is available on Google and Android.</p>
<p>It allows users to securely store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies while offering several enhanced insights and features that target those interested in Web3 technologies.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/333486/best-wallet-1.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Homepage" /></figure>
<p>Best Wallet has multi-chain support, including Ethereum and the BNB Smart Chain. Not only does this mean users can store thousands of tokens hosted on these networks, but it also means these users can interact with all of the DeFi protocols built on the chains – providing limitless options for yield generation.</p>
<p>It even has its own built-in DEX, so although purchasing crypto with fiat is handled via trusted third-party app Wert, users can trade thousands of new and established cryptos directly on the platform. </p>
<p>It also offers insights such as information on new and trending cryptos and airdrops to help users get ahead of the competition, a feature other wallets don&#8217;t tend to offer.</p>
<p>Best Wallet also has full support for NFTs, making it ideal for those with a diversified digital asset portfolio &#8211; the development team plans to create an NFT gallery where users can view their collections seamlessly.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/333487/best-wallet-4.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Market Insights" /></figure>
<p>When it comes to security, Best Wallet leaves no stone unturned. The wallet deploys advanced cryptographic techniques to protect user holdings while implementing biometric identification to prevent bad actors. Users can also select two-factor authentication and fingerprint ID to enhance their security when creating an account.</p>
<p>On top of all these features, Best Wallet also has a native token called $BEST. $BEST holders will receive various perks, such as early access to presales, although those who opt to stake their tokens will also benefit from zero gas fees and exclusive voting rights. The token has not yet been launched but will be airdropped to regular users of the app, with 10% of the total supply to be distributed. </p>
<p>Overall, Best Wallet’s state-of-the-art technology, enhanced insights, focus on interoperability, and advanced security features &#8212; as well as the upcoming token airdrop &#8211; make it a fantastic option for Australian crypto investors.  </p>

<h3><strong>2. YouHodler &#8211; Leading Crypto Wallet With Up To 15% APY on Cryptocurrencies, Crypto Lending, And Multi-Chain Swaps</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/youhodler/">YouHodler</a> is a popular crypto wallet that lets you trade your cryptocurrencies, swap them for coins on various blockchains, or use your holdings in YouHodler&#8217;s yield earning program and earn up to 15% APY on select cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT come with up to 12% APY, which is one of the highest yields you can get on stablecoins.</p>
<p>However, to get this yield you need to advance your levels by trading or holding a certain amount of funds in your account. The Basic level APY is 7% for LTC and 6% for stablecoins. This is still competitive with other DeFi platforms.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/youhodl-yield.jpg" alt="Youhodler Popular Coins" /></figure>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to diversify your crypto assets without leaving your wallet, you can swap between multiple chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple and even less popular coins like ApeCoin and Decentraland.</p>
<p>Another rewarding feature is the Bitcoin Cloud Miner. The way it works is you complete weekly tasks and you earn sparks. You can then use the sparks in the Cloud Miner to earn BTC with up to 0.2 BTC per month.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/334452/cloud-miner.jpg" alt="Youhodler Cloud Miner" /></figure>
<p>Those who are strapped for liquidity can use their cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to get crypto or fiat currency loans like EUR, USD, CHF and GBP and instantly withdraw them. The loan-to-value is 90%, which is among the highest in the crypto space. </p>
<p>YouHodler is regulated in Switzerland and in Italy. The company uses Ledger Vault technology to secure its holdings with $150 million in pooled insurance. You can also secure your wallet with two-factor authentications and biometrics.</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supports multiple cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>Up to 15% yield on select cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>Can mine Bitcoin with Cloud Miner</li>
<li>Crypto loans with 90% LTV</li>
<li>Crypto to fiat exchange</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not available for US residents</li>
<li>$100 minimum crypto loan</li>

<h3><strong>3. Ledger – One of the Best Crypto Hardware Wallets With In-App Staking and Swapping</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/">Ledger</a> hardware wallet uses a military-grade secure chip to store the user’s private key. This is encrypted and offline, meaning fraudsters can&#8217;t see your seed phrase if they somehow hack your computer.</p>
<p>Aside from security, Ledger boasts a seamless user experience via the Ledger Live mobile and desktop app. From there, you can manage over 5500 tokens, including purchasing crypto with a card, swapping via decentralized exchanges, sending and receiving coins and tokens, as well as staking supported coins, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. The app also supports NFTs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/112160/334390/ledger-live.jpg" alt="Ledger Wallet Download" /></figure>
<p>Choose one of the three hardware wallets: Ledger Nano S Plus, Ledger Nano X and Ledger Stax. Nano X offers Bluetooth, which makes it an excellent addition for those who want to use the Ledger Live app on mobile. That&#8217;s because you won&#8217;t need cables to connect the two.</p>

<ul>
<li>Maximum security features</li>

<h3><strong>9. Coinbase &#8211; Simplified Wallet Experience for Crypto Newcomers</strong></h3>
<p>Coinbase Wallet is quickly gaining traction while striving to be one of the top crypto wallets in Australia. Coinbase is a good choice due to its simplicity and robust security measures. Whether you&#8217;re on the hunt for new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">cryptos to explode</a> or seeking to buy high market-cap cryptos, Coinbase offers a diverse range of cryptos.</p>
<p>As a U.S.-regulated exchange, Coinbase&#8217;s stock is publicly traded and highly regulated. As a result, it stores an impressive 98% of customer funds in secure cold wallets.</p>
<p>The platform offers high-security measures when purchasing Bitcoin or any other digital currency. Coinbase mandates that users activate 2FA, considerably enhancing the security of their digital holdings.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267303/hu.jpg" alt="Coinbase Wallet Download" /></figure>
<p>Coinbase provides a versatile custodial wallet accessible through your primary web account or Android or iOS mobile applications. This platform allows users to easily store, buy, and sell digital assets.</p>
<p>One downside to Coinbase is its relatively high fees. For instance, Coinbase fees range from 0.5% to 4.5%, depending on the transaction size and payment method.</p>
<p>As a result, Coinbase&#8217;s wallet is a better fit for long-term holding rather than regular trading. Nevertheless, Coinbase offers an exceptionally user-friendly experience, making it an ideal choice for beginners apprehensive about crypto investments.</p>
<p>Opening a Coinbase account is quick, requiring only a few minutes for verification. However, due to its streamlined design, Coinbase does not offer features such as copy trading services, cutting-edge technical indicators, or crypto savings accounts.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a Crypto Wallet?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A digital wallet allows users to store, manage, and perform transactions with cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. Crypto wallets are essential for interacting with the blockchain, which powers these digital currencies.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets can be categorized into two types: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial wallets involve a third-party service, like an exchange or a wallet provider, holding private keys on behalf of users. While they offer the convenience of easy access and management, users must trust the service to keep their keys secure, which can be risky.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/untitled-design-2-1.jpg" alt="Crypto Wallet Seed Phrase" /></figure>
<p>Non-custodial wallets give users complete control over their private keys, allowing them to store and manage their cryptocurrencies independently. This offers better security but requires users to take responsibility for safeguarding their private keys.</p>
<p>There are various types of custodial and non-custodial wallets, including software, hardware, paper, and web wallets. Each type has its unique features and security levels. To keep your crypto wallet safe, choose the right one based on your needs, take advantage of backup and recovery options, and use strong security measures such as encryption and two-factor authentication.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Crypto Investors Need a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto wallets are vital for investors looking to venture into the world of crypto. These digital wallets allow users to store, send, receive, and manage various digital assets securely and efficiently. Let&#8217;s see why crypto investors need a crypto wallet:</p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p>The primary function of a crypto wallet is to secure users&#8217; digital assets. Wallets use advanced cryptographic techniques to generate unique private keys that are required for accessing and managing cryptos.</p>
<p>For instance, hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor provide an additional layer of security by storing private keys offline, mitigating the risk of online hacks and thefts. Investors can also enable 2FA to further enhance their crypto wallets&#8217; security.</p>
<h3><strong>Control</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto wallets give investors complete control over their digital assets. Unlike leaving funds on exchanges, where users are vulnerable to hacks, wallet owners can manage their cryptocurrencies as they see fit. </p>
<p>For example, investors can quickly transfer funds between wallets or utilize DeFi platforms directly from their wallets, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Convenience</strong></h3>
<p>Best crypto wallets simplify the process of sending, receiving, and managing cryptos. They often come equipped with user-friendly interfaces and support multiple cryptos, allowing investors to manage all their digital assets from a single location. </p>
<p>Some wallets even offer built-in exchange features, enabling users to swap cryptos without using external platforms.</p>
<h3><strong>Interaction with dApps</strong></h3>
<p>Best crypto wallets, especially those compatible with Ethereum, enable users to interact with dApps and smart contracts. </p>
<p>For instance, MetaMask, a popular Ethereum-based wallet, allows users to directly access various DeFi applications and NFTs platforms, such as Uniswap and OpenSea, from the wallet interface.</p>
<h2><strong>How do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin wallets enable users to store, send, and receive digital assets seamlessly. A Bitcoin wallet comprises two critical elements: public and private keys. The public key, or wallet address, is an alphanumeric sequence that is the destination for sending and receiving Bitcoin. Sharing the public key poses no risk to security.</p>
<p>Conversely, the private key is a secret alphanumeric code providing access to the wallet&#8217;s funds. Safeguarding private keys is crucial, as misplacing them can lead to permanent fund loss while disclosing them exposes the wallet to theft.</p>
<h3><strong>The Transaction Process</strong></h3>
<p>To receive Bitcoin, share the wallet&#8217;s public address with the sender. The wallet relies on the private key to authorize the transaction to send Bitcoin. This transaction is then transmitted to the Bitcoin network, where it undergoes verification and is added to the blockchain.</p>
<h3><strong>Protecting Your Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Maintaining the security of a Bitcoin wallet is of utmost importance. Consider the following best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backups</strong>: Schedule regular wallet backups to prevent data loss from hardware malfunction or theft.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Signature</strong>: Opt for wallets necessitating multiple private keys for transactions, increasing security levels.</li>
<li><strong>2FA</strong>: Implement 2FA (two-factor authentication) to shield your wallet from unauthorized entry.</li>
<li><strong>Offline Storage of Private Keys</strong>: Keep private keys in an offline environment, minimizing exposure to hackers or malware.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before selecting a storage solution for their digital assets, investors should familiarize themselves with the different crypto wallets available in Australia. This knowledge will enable beginners to make informed decisions and choose the most suitable crypto wallet for their requirements.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the primary crypto wallet types:</p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Software wallets are digital wallets that store your crypto as software applications. They are further divided into two types: mobile wallets and desktop wallets.</p>
<h4><strong>Mobile Wallets</strong></h4>
<p>Mobile wallets are applications designed for smartphones and tablets. They provide users with easy access to their cryptos, allowing them to transact and manage their digital assets on the go.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Convenient and user-friendly, making it easy to manage cryptos.</li>
<li>QR code scanning simplifies sending and receiving transactions.</li>
<li>Many mobile wallets offer additional features like built-in exchanges and portfolio tracking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>May be susceptible to hacks and phishing attacks, as smartphones can be compromised.</li>
<li>Limited to the device, so if the phone is lost or damaged, access to the wallet may be lost.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Desktop Wallets</strong></h4>
<p>Desktop wallets are applications designed for personal computers and laptops. They offer a higher security level than mobile wallets, as they are less prone to hacks and viruses.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop wallets could often provide advanced features like coin staking and multi-signature support.</li>
<li>Better suited for long-term storage of cryptos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Less portable and convenient than mobile wallets.</li>
<li>Accessible only from the device it&#8217;s installed on, so if the device is lost or damaged, access to the wallet may be lost.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Hardware wallets are physical devices designed to store your crypto offline, known as cold storage. They provide an added layer of security by keeping private keys separate from internet-connected devices. Popular hardware wallets include Ledger Nano, Trezor, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers the highest level of security for storing cryptos.</li>
<li>Resistant to hacks and malware, as private keys are stored offline.</li>
<li>It supports multiple cryptos and integrates with various software wallets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More expensive than software wallets.</li>
<li>Less portable and convenient for everyday transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Paper wallets are physical documents that store your crypto&#8217;s private and public keys in QR codes. They provide a simple and inexpensive way to secure your digital assets offline. </p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure, as the keys are stored offline and cannot be hacked.</li>
<li>Inexpensive and easy to create.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prone to physical damage, such as fire or water, which can lead to the loss of assets.</li>
<li>Not user-friendly for everyday transactions and managing multiple cryptos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting the right crypto wallet depends on your preferences, usage, and security requirements. Evaluate your needs and choose the wallet type that best suits your requirements. Mobile and desktop wallets offer convenience and ease of use, while hardware and paper wallets provide heightened security for long-term storage.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Australia Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With the rise of cryptos, selecting the ideal wallet for your needs is crucial. The best Bitcoin wallet in Australia or any other region should be secure, user-friendly, and compatible with various currencies. This section will guide you through choosing the perfect crypto wallet for you and exploring the key factors to consider, such as security, private key ownership, supported coins, fees, mobile experience, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Prioritizing Security</strong></h3>
<p>Your crypto wallet&#8217;s security should be a top priority. When looking for the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, consider wallets with robust security measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA), biometric authentication, and encryption.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, are among the most secure options. These wallets store your private keys offline, making it difficult for hackers to access your funds. Examples of the best crypto hardware wallets include Ledger Nano and Trezor.</p>
<h3><strong>Ensuring Private Key Ownership</strong></h3>
<p>Owning your private keys is essential for maintaining control of your assets. You can choose a wallet that gives you full ownership of your private keys rather than entrusting them to a third party. Non-custodial wallets, such as MetaMask and OKX, grant you complete control over your private keys.</p>
<h3><strong>Considering Supported Coins</strong></h3>
<p>Different wallets support different cryptos, so make sure your wallet accommodates the coins you own or plan to invest in. The top crypto wallets in Australia, like Best Wallet, typically support many digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Ensure your wallet supports all the cryptos you want to avoid compatibility issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Evaluating Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Transaction fees vary depending on the wallet you choose. Some wallets, such as the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, offer competitive prices, while others may charge a premium for their services. </p>
<p>Research the costs associated with each wallet before deciding, and factor in the frequency of your transactions. Some wallets allow users to set custom fees, providing greater flexibility in terms of costs.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessing Mobile Experience</strong></h3>
<p>If you plan on managing your cryptos on the go, consider a wallet with a user-friendly mobile app. Some Australian crypto wallets offer seamless mobile experiences, allowing users to easily monitor their portfolios, trade, and transfer funds. Ensure the mobile app is compatible with your device&#8217;s operating system, whether iOS or Android.</p>
<h3><strong>Examining User Interface and Usability</strong></h3>
<p>A simple and intuitive user interface is vital, particularly for those new to cryptos. When evaluating the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, consider wallets that offer simple navigation and a clean layout. </p>
<p>Wallets like MetaMask and OKX are known for their user-friendly interfaces, making them suitable for beginners.</p>
<h3><strong>Preparing for Backup and Recovery</strong></h3>
<p>In case you lose access to your wallet, it&#8217;s crucial to have a backup and recovery plan in place. When comparing Australian crypto wallets, opt for wallets that provide a secure backup solution and clear instructions on recovering your funds in an emergency. Most wallets offer a recovery phrase or seed phrase, which can be used to restore your wallet on a new device.</p>
<h3><strong>Exploring Additional Features</strong></h3>
<p>Some wallets offer extra features that can enhance your overall experience. For instance, built-in exchanges allow you to trade cryptos directly within the wallet, while staking features enable you to earn passive income on your holdings. When choosing the top crypto wallets in Australia, consider the additional functionalities that could benefit your needs.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Get a Cryptocurrency Wallet in Australia</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Choosing the best Bitcoin app or wallet can significantly impact the ease of getting started in the world of digital currencies. This section will discuss installing Best Wallet, which we consider the best crypto wallet for Australian investors and newcomers.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Download Best Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Best Wallet is available as a mobile app on both Android or Google so head to the Play Store or the App Store and download it.</p>
<p>It should take less than a minute to complete. Although not yet available on desktop, a browser extension is expected to be launched in the coming months.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Create Account</strong></h3>
<p>Next, select an email address to use for the account by either inputting one and selecting &#8216;Continue&#8217; and following the steps, or selecting &#8216;Continue with Apple/Google&#8217; to select a linked account.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Select Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>Best Wallet has strong security features including a four-digit password, two-factor authentication and fingerprint ID.</p>
<p>However, the latter two are optional, so the quickest way to get started is to just choose and confirm a four-digit password. We would recommend adding 2FA and fingerprint ID for enhanced security.</p>

<h2>Reviewing the Best Bitcoin Wallets for Beginners</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/863917/number-crypto-coins-tokens/">Statista</a>, there were over 9,000 cryptocurrencies in existence in December 2023 – nearly double the number seen in February 2021, although it is estimated there could be many more given the vast numbers of new meme coins and projects sprouting up regularly.</p>
<p>This highlights the rapidly-growing nature of the crypto market, which has naturally increased the need for secure wallet options. So, without further ado, let’s dive in and take a closer look at the top cryptocurrency wallets for beginners:</p>
<h3>1. Best Wallet – Overall Best Crypto Wallet in 2023 With Multi-Chain Crypto Swaps and Built-In DEX</h3>
<p>Topping our list of the best crypto wallets in 2023 is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a>, which has only just launched but already shot to the top of our list because of its unique features.</p>
<p>This is a multi-chain crypto wallet designed to address some of the challenges present in many current wallet offerings – such as multiple wallets required for various blockchains, lack of crypto news within the wallet, network bridges and NFT marketplaces.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/333477/best-wallet-1.jpg" alt="Best Wallet crypto app" /></figure>
<p>To address this, the creators of Best Wallet have created a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem that covers every aspect of digital asset management.</p>
<p>The non-custodial software wallet, available as a mobile app,  allows users to interact with coins, tokens and NFTs from multiple chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB. This ensures users aren&#8217;t confined to a single chain, allowing them to access limitless digital assets.</p>
<p>It also has several unique features that place it above other wallets &#8211; that includes market insights on trending and upcoming tokens, details on token airdrops, and even a built-in decentralized exchange to allow users to trade any token. Best Wallet is shaping up to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges.htm">best no-KYC crypto exchanges</a> on the market.</p>
<p>Acting as the backbone of the ecosystem is the $BEST token, which is the utility and governance token. Holders who stake $BEST tokens will receive benefits, including access to advanced analysis tools, swaps without fees, early token launch access and NFT drops.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/333478/best-wallet-3.jpg" alt="Best wallet portfolio management feature" /></figure>
<p>The tokens are not yet available but regular users of the wallet are set to get a huge airdrop of tokens in the coming months &#8211; with a total of 10% of the supply will be distributed to active users.</p>
<p>All in all, Best Wallet aims to be more than just a crypto wallet, with the developers seeking to make it a comprehensive digital asset management solution for multiple blockchains.</p>

<h3>2. Coinbase Wallet – Beginner-Friendly Crypto Wallet with Biometric Verification</h3>

This exchange also offers a dedicated crypto wallet, free to use and available on smartphones, tablets, or as a Google Chrome extension.</p>
<p>Notably, the Coinbase wallet is a self-custody wallet – so users will have complete control over their crypto assets. The wallet supports over 100,000 coins/tokens, yet it also allows users to store their Ethereum and Polygon NFTs in the same place.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267115/coinbase.jpg" alt="Coinbase Wallet app" /></figure>
<p>Coinbase allows users to bolster the security level even more by enabling two-factor authentication and biometric verification. Aside from its security features, the wallet also excels since it essentially acts as a handheld crypto exchange. Users can instantly buy and sell coins/tokens using a credit/debit card and even withdraw funds to an external bank account.</p>
<p>Since the Coinbase wallet provides access to the decentralized web, users can also make the most of the universe of DeFi apps available to them. Several opportunities are available in this regard, such as using liquidity pools to generate a yield or even taking part in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</p>

<h3>3. YouHodler &#8211; An Excellent Crypto Wallet With Up To 15% APY on Popular Cryptocurrencies, Crypto Loans and Trading</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/youhodler/">YouHodler</a> is one of the leading crypto wallets because it offers multiple features, like staking and trading all through a single wallet.</p>

<p>Those who don&#8217;t want to trade can still earn yield on the tokens they hold. For example, Litecoin offers the highest annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 15%, while Solana has an APY of up to 13%, which is more than the 8% APY you can get by staking it on the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>Stablecoins have a solid APY of up to 12% for USDT and USDC. But to get this yield, you need to advance your levels by trading or holding a certain amount of funds in your account. The Basic level APY is 6% for stablecoins, which is still competitive with other DeFi services and enough to offset the yearly inflation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/youhodl-yield.jpg" alt="YouHodler crypto earn" /></figure>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334326/cloud-miner.jpg" alt="YouHodler BTC cloud mining feature" /></figure>

<h3>4. Ledger – One of the Best Crypto Hardware Wallets With High Security and Multi-Chain Functionality</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/%20">Ledger crypto wallet</a> is a hardware wallet widely considered one of the safest ways for investors to store their digital assets, whether that be cryptocurrencies or NFTs. This is because it uses &#8220;cold storage,&#8221; meaning users&#8217; private keys are kept offline and safe from threats.</p>
<p>Ledger comes with a mobile and desktop app called Ledger Live where you can monitor your crypto portfolio, regardless of which blockchain, you can buy crypto with fiat, stake your coins or exchange them. Each Ledger wallet supports over 5,500+ crypto assets.</p>
<p>The Ledger app also lets you connect with third-party services, such as 1inch DEX, MoonPay, Lido staking, YouHodler and more.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/334363/ledger-live.jpg" alt="Ledger Live apps" /></figure>
<p>To use the Ledger wallet, you need either the Ledger Nano X, Ledger Nano S Plus or the Ledger Stax. Nano X is particularly interesting since it doesn&#8217;t just boast USB functionality, but it can also connect to devices via Bluetooth. This means, you can safely execute transactions on your smartphone without connecting the Ledger wallet via cable.</p>
<p>Ledger even sells physical &#8220;chains&#8221; that allow crypto-savvy individuals to wear their Ledger wallet around their neck!</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267116/ledger.jpg" alt="Ledger hardware wallet devices" /></figure>

<h3><strong>5. Trezor – Security-Focused Hardware Wallet with Simple Functionality</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/">Trezor</a> is one of the most secure wallets in the whole market and for those looking for simple offline storage it is a go-to choice.</p>
<p>There are three Trezor wallets available: Model One, Trezor Safe 3, and the advanced Model T, which features a touch-screen that allows for two-factor authentication on the device itself.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/334365/trezor2.jpg" alt="Trezor hardware wallet devices" /></figure>
<p>Trezor&#8217;s added security also allows users to generate up to 16 recovery shares and store them in different places, meaning if one seed phrase is compromised then there are additional layers of protection.</p>
<p>It is also open source meaning its software is consistently reviewed and tested by third parties to keep its security transparent &#8211; main rival Ledger has closed-source firmware.</p>
<p>Trezor comes with its own desktop, mobile and browser app, called Trezor Suite. This lets you manage your coins by sending or receiving them, you can verify transactions or go incognito with Coinjoin. You can also directly purchase cryptocurrencies from within the app.</p>

<h3>6. OKX – User-Friendly Crypto Wallet with NFT Support &amp; DEX Aggregator</h3>
<p>Another hugely popular crypto wallet app suitable for beginners is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/">OKX</a> wallet. OKX describes its wallet as a &#8220;portal to Web3&#8221; since it contains various helpful features, including crypto asset storage, NFT support, and a decentralized exchange (DEX).</p>
<p>The great thing about the OKX wallet is its cross-chain support. At the time of writing, the wallet supports crypto assets from over 50 networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and OKTC. The OKX wallet’s interface is easy to navigate and doesn’t feature any complex jargon, making it suitable for beginners.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267110/okx-1.jpg" alt="OKX web3 wallet" /></figure>
<p>OKX’s wallet is also highly compatible with a range of devices. It can be downloaded for free on iOS and Android smartphones, although it’s also available on Windows and MacOS computers. The wallet’s features sync across all devices, so users can seamlessly transition from one to another.</p>
<p>This is also one of the top crypto wallets for those interested in NFT investing.

This platform features some of the world&#8217;s most sought-after collections – including DeGods and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).</p>

<p>Finally, the OKX wallet has a DEX and bridge aggregator that instantly lets users swap tokens across many top blockchains. Due to this and the features mentioned above, the OKX wallet is undoubtedly one of the best crypto wallets available right now.</p>

<h3>7. Binance – World’s Largest Exchange with Free Crypto Wallet App</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/">Binance</a> needs no introduction as it remains the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, facilitating daily trading volumes of over $6 billion. The exchange offers its own crypto wallet that links to the BNB Chain – Binance&#8217;s own blockchain network.</p>
<p>Unlike other top cryptocurrency wallets, the Binance wallet is structured as a browser extension, downloading on Google Chrome and other leading platforms. It&#8217;s free to download and use, enabling Binance users to store and manage their crypto holdings while interacting with other assets on the BNB Chain and Ethereum.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267112/binance.jpg" alt="Binance wallet mobile app" /></figure>
<p>Since the Binance wallet is inherently linked to the Binance exchange, users can instantly transfer their holdings from the latter to the former. The wallet supports over 380 cryptos and allows users to buy crypto instantly using a bank transfer or credit/debit card.</p>
<p>Those looking to explore the Binance ecosystem further can check out the exchange&#8217;s NFT marketplace and earnings protocols. Binance is also fantastic for active investors since it allows anyone to set up recurring buy orders to purchase specific assets at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Finally, the Binance crypto wallet enables users to send and receive crypto using QR codes instantly. This feature is essential for newcomers, as it mitigates the risk of using an incorrect wallet address and potentially losing funds forever.</p>

<h3>8. StrikeX Wallet &#8211; Investing Made Easy With a Simple, Secure, Multi Crypto DeFi Wallet</h3>
<p>Though not as well known as some of the other wallets on the market, <a href="https://tradestrike.io/strikex-wallet/"><u>StrikeX</u></a> could be quite the dark horse for those interested in security and ease of use. At the time of this writing, the StrikeX parent company (tradestrike.io) has an excellent <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/tradestrike.io"><u>4.8 star rating on Trustpilot</u></a>, and social reviews are often an accurate indicator of the quality of service. The StrikeX wallet app is available on both IOS and Android.</p>
<p>The simplicity of StrikeX is likely what has led to so many positive reviews. It has been built from the ground up to be easy to use, with clear instructions, an open interface, and excellent interoperability with other wallets. Users can build a wallet address list for easy transfer, so they don’t have to continually copy and paste long strings for repeat transactions.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/327034/screen-shot-2023-08-30-at.jpg" alt="StrikeX Wallet mobile app" /></figure>
<p>It’s also possible to buy crypto through the wallet with a credit or debit card. A cross-chain swap allows users to swap 15,000+ cryptocurrencies across twelve blockchains, and an in-app QR code allows for easy connection with Web3 websites and applications.</p>
<p>What StrikeX does really well is that it is simple and easy to use, but builds on this with advanced functions in a way that does not overwhelm new users. It allows users to track portfolio performance across multiple wallets with visual charting, and also provides an overall market overview.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/327035/screen-shot-2023-08-30-at.jpg" alt="StrikeX mobile app" /></figure>
<p>There are very few downsides associated with this simple yet powerful crypto wallet, and we were very impressed with the address list, a simple technique that few providers have adopted, but which greatly increases the convenience of the application, giving it a more familiar feel. It’s also a pure DeFi wallet &#8211; no personal identification is required to use it.</p>
<p>There are not many downsides with this wallet &#8211; but it only supports Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum &amp; Solana at the present time. Other than this, it is an ideal wallet for beginners who want to anonymously and securely send and receive their Web3 assets.</p>

<h3>11. Kraken – Highly-Trusted and Popular Crypto Exchange for Advanced Traders</h3>
<p>Kraken is a US-based crypto exchange that is rated as one of the most trustworthy in the market due to its reserve audit, large customer base and high liquidity.</p>
<p>The exchange offers almost 250 cryptos and has just celebrated 10 years in the market, having launched in September 2013 and is one of the best exchanges for advanced traders.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/332151/kraken.jpg" alt="Kraken mobile app" /></figure>
<p>Kraken is one of the most appealing centralized exchanges for advanced traders as it offers extremely competitive fees when trading Bitcoin, for example, and has a highly functional dedicated mobile app.</p>
<p>While instant buying of Bitcoin costs 1.5% and fees for beginners are about average, Kraken Pro users can take advantage of a maker-taker fee model, which ranges from just 0.00% to 0.26% depending on how often a user trades over a 30-day period.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say it is not a good choice for beginners, however, with Kraken having excellent security and storage for a hot wallet &#8211; with claims it holds 95% of its deposits offline, with enough in reserve so people can withdraw at will.</p>
<p>One downside over other exchanges is that Kraken offers no staking rewards for US customers, having had to previously pay a $30 million settlement to the SEC.</p>

<h2>Crypto Wallets Explained</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Now that we’ve identified the best crypto wallets for beginners, let’s take a closer look at what these wallets are. In simple terms, cryptocurrency wallets are software programs or hardware devices that allow users to store, manage, and transfer popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.</p>
<p>These wallets act as the holder&#8217;s &#8220;portal&#8221; to the crypto market, making it easy to hold crypto assets safely over the long term. Various types of wallets are on offer, such as &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets, which offer varying degrees of safety and functionality.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll explore these wallet types in more detail later, but it&#8217;s important to note that all wallets have a &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;private&#8221; key. These keys are essential since they prove asset ownership and enable wallet holders to send/receive funds.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/crypto-wallets-explained.jpg" alt="Ledger device among crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/">TripleA</a>, it’s estimated that over 420 million people worldwide own crypto. Most of these people are based in Asia and North America, although this figure is growing every month. Due to this vast customer base, the importance of using crypto wallets is more significant than ever – especially since the market is still relatively unregulated compared to &#8220;traditional&#8221; asset classes and hackers and scammers are extremely active.</p>
<p>Ultimately, crypto wallets act as a way to store crypto safely without keeping it on an exchange or brokerage account, giving an individual more power over their holdings.  Although there are various types of crypto wallets with specific features and security measures, all of them are designed to serve this purpose.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>How Do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Whether someone’s looking to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> or is more interested in well-established coins, it&#8217;s vital to understand how wallet storage works. Regardless of where the Bitcoin account is held, using a crypto wallet is critical for protecting crypto asset holdings from cyber attackers and other bad actors.</p>
<p>The simplest way of viewing crypto wallets is as a method for protecting an investor&#8217;s holdings, via access to their public and private keys. As noted above, these keys have essential use cases – but what do they do? Here&#8217;s a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Key</strong>: The public key can be considered the wallet&#8217;s &#8220;account number&#8221; and is used to receive funds from other individuals/businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Private Key</strong>: The private key is an alphanumeric code unique to each wallet and used to prove ownership of the crypto assets inside. In this sense, the private key is like a password – meaning it should never be shared with anyone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crypto wallets store and manage the private key – <i>not</i> the actual crypto assets. This is because the crypto assets are still held on the blockchain, meaning the private key simply provides <i>access</i> to them.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets are so important because they use advanced cryptographic techniques to protect the user&#8217;s private key, essentially a password. Different wallets have different approaches, but they can range from DDoS protection to biometric verification – and even 3D face scans.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/how-do-they-work.jpg" alt="eToro Money crypto wallet" /></figure>
<p>The best crypto wallets usually offer backup and recovery options that ensure users can’t lose access to their crypto. In the past, if a user lost their private key, their crypto assets could never be re-accessed. Nowadays, many wallet providers have recovery seed phrases and other features that can restore access, although it is important individuals also take great care not to share or lose those.</p>
<p>Whether a user opts for a crypto hardware wallet or a software wallet, partnering with a well-respected provider is essential. Moreover, it&#8217;s also vital that users follow security practices, like ensuring their private keys remain confidential and implementing a backup procedure.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Why Do You Need a Cryptocurrency Wallet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finding and using the best crypto wallet available is an integral part of the crypto-trading journey for beginners, especially if they plan to hold, trade or manage large sums of crypto. These wallets are essentially for safely storing, sending, and receiving digital currencies, making them like a &#8216;crypto bank account&#8217;.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve touched on earlier, traders need these crypto wallets since they keep the private key safe. The private key is the only way for someone to gain unauthorized access to the user&#8217;s funds – if this key is kept safe, the funds are inaccessible.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/why-do-you-need.jpg" alt="Crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-things-to-buy-with-bitcoin.htm">best things to buy with Bitcoin</a> can only be purchased by sending payment from a reputable wallet provider. Since crypto wallets make it easy to send crypto payments, they’re vital for buying goods/services online that are denominated in digital currencies.</p>
<p>Another critical feature of crypto wallets is that they allow users to have complete control over their crypto assets. Since cryptocurrencies are decentralized, they aren&#8217;t held by intermediaries like banks. Even holding on a centralized exchange comes with its own risk, as FTX customers previously found when the exchange collapsed leading to billions of dollars in investor losses, or if the exchange is hacked &#8211; like has been recently seen with Huobi Global, when $8 million was stolen in September 2023. Thus, having a self-custody crypto wallet will ensure that only the user &#8220;owns&#8221; the associated crypto assets.</p>
<p>Finally, crypto wallets are also important because they make it easy to access the crypto market. Most wallets allow users to instantly buy/sell crypto from within the wallet&#8217;s interface and many providers offer support for NFTs and DeFi protocols, significantly broadening the investment possibilities.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Types of Crypto Wallets &#8211; Hardware and Software, Hot and Cold, Paper</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Deciding to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-altcoins.htm">buy altcoins</a> or crypto tokens is a huge decision – yet choosing where to store them post-purchase is just as important.</p>
<p>We’ve already discussed what crypto wallets are, but there various types of wallets on offer with a litany of language that can leave beginners confused.</p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets (Hot Wallet)</strong></h3>
<p>Software wallets are the most popular type of storage solution for crypto assets, especially for beginners. These digital platforms allow users to store and manage cryptos in a user-friendly manner. The most important thing to note about these wallets is that they’re connected to the internet – which is in stark contrast to hardware wallets.</p>
<p>There are two main types of software wallets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile wallets</strong>: These are smartphone apps designed to provide on-the-go access to the user’s cryptos. Mobile wallets are often offered for free by many top exchanges, like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop wallets</strong>: These are applications that can be downloaded and installed on the user&#8217;s computer. Desktop wallets are slightly safer than mobile wallets since they store the user&#8217;s private key locally on the computer &#8211; MetaMask is one such is example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, these wallet types are considered &#8220;hot&#8221; since they&#8217;re connected to the internet. This makes them more susceptible to cyberattacks than &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets which have no connection to the internet.</p>
<h3>Hardware Wallets (Cold Wallet)</h3>
<p>Alternatively, crypto holders can store their assets in hardware wallets, which are also often referred to as cold wallets &#8211; think cold storage &#8211; as they are not connected to the internet until a user connects a physical device.</p>
<p>A Bitcoin hardware wallet is a physical device used to store the user&#8217;s private keys. These devices usually look like USB sticks and hold the private key offline – meaning hackers can&#8217;t access it.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/hardware-wallets.jpg" alt="Ledger Nano X device" /></figure>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-crypto-hardware-wallet">Kraken</a>, hardware wallets are one of the most effective ways for a user to protect their private key and are a must for investors or traders who are managing extremely large sums of crypto.</p>
<p>It is simply not safe to have huge holdings linked to the internet at all times.</p>
<p>However, these wallets must be connected to another device, such as a laptop or smartphone, to initiate transactions. So, although they have a much higher security level, hardware wallets aren&#8217;t as user-friendly as software wallets.</p>
<p>Another downside is that as they are physical devices they come with additional cost to purchase &#8211; Trezor&#8217;s latest Model T, for example, costs in excess of $200.</p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>The third wallet type is paper wallets. Unlike an online Bitcoin wallet, paper wallets are a type of “cold” storage that involves a user writing their public and private keys on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The user would then store this piece of paper somewhere safe where nobody else could access it &#8211; for example in a safe, safety deposit box or locker.</p>
<p>The downside to this approach is that those with paper wallets still eventually need to use a crypto wallet app to spend or transfer digital assets.</p>
<p>Thus, paper wallets are relatively impractical and considered less safe than the alternatives – hence why they aren’t widely used. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2>How to Find Safe Crypto Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finding the best Bitcoin wallet can be tricky – especially since so many options exist. However, we’ve identified three tactics that traders can employ to find safe crypto wallets effectively:</p>
<h3><strong>Use a Reputable Provider</strong></h3>
<p>The most important tactic to use is only choosing crypto wallets offered by reputable providers. It&#8217;s a good idea to read online reviews and check a potential provider&#8217;s track record before downloading the wallet that they offer. Many crypto wallet providers are even endorsed by high-profile individuals or businesses, which can boost credibility.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Many of the top providers listed in this guide have a long track record of success in the space and high security scores. However, even highly-trusted wallets can be susceptible to attacks &#8211; Atomic Wallet was one of the leading providers in the space before North Korean hacker group Lazarus stole more than $100 million of customer funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Consider the Wallet’s Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>When <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm">choosing a Bitcoin wallet</a>, it&#8217;s also essential to thoroughly research the wallet&#8217;s security features. We&#8217;ll explore this further in the next section, although it typically involves checking the type of encryption on offer and deciding whether to use a hot or a cold wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/consider-security-features.jpg" alt="eToro Money wallet features" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Test the Wallet Before Making Large Transfers</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, it may be best to test out a wallet with a small amount of crypto before fully committing. This minimizes the risk of catastrophic loss while allowing users to test the wallet&#8217;s functionality and security features. Assuming the wallet is up to the task, users can confidently transfer more significant amounts of crypto.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Much like when choosing between the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best AI crypto trading bots</a>, deciding which cryptocurrency wallet to use involves analyzing various factors and will also come down to user preference.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at six of the most important factors to consider:</p>
<h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>The single most important factor to review when choosing a crypto wallet is its security features. This includes the encryption technology it uses, how it manages the user&#8217;s private key and any backup options it has.</p>
<p>Many of the best Bitcoin wallets also offer two-factor authentication and biometric verification to enhance security further. There are even wallets that have multi-signature support, which means they have two private keys rather than one.</p>
<p>Cold wallets are automatically much safer than hot wallets &#8211; due to them not being connected to the internet, hackers cannot access those funds without having physical access to the hardware device.</p>
<h3><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Another important consideration is the type of wallet to use. This can be boiled down to using either one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-hot-wallets.htm">best hot wallets</a> or a cold wallet. As noted earlier, the former is connected to the internet, while the latter isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>A crypto hardware wallet is generally considered the safest way to store a trader&#8217;s private key. However, they can sometimes be impractical; if practicality is the primary concern, a software wallet may be more suitable.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Those trading crypto daily would likely prefer a hot wallet as they want fast and easy access to funds.</p>
<p>But users should always choose a cold wallet if they are holding large sums of crypto over an extended period of time, and only connect to the internet when they wish to make a specific transaction &#8211; buying, selling or transferring elsewhere &#8211; and then disconnect.</p>
<h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3>
<p>Navigating the market can be tricky for beginners, so user-friendliness is an important consideration. Users should review a wallet&#8217;s interface design and ease of setup, both of which are crucial for making the trading process accessible to beginners.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is whether the wallet comes with any help or support. Most prominent providers, like OKX, have dedicated help centers with answers to the most commonly-asked questions, which can be a blessing to newbie investors.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are not particularly difficult to use but add a another step compared to software wallets, with the likes of Trezor not having a mobile app on iOS also another thing to consider.</p>
<h3><strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the crypto market is now valued at over $1.08 trillion with tens of thousands of coins available.</p>
<p>Given the scale of the market, more new coins and tokens are springing up every week – so it’s a good idea to choose the best cryptocurrency wallet for asset selection.</p>
<p>Almost all crypto wallets will support the largest coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the top wallets also offer support for lesser-known tokens and stablecoins, which can be highly beneficial.</p>
<p>MetaMask is one of the best wallets for supported cryptos as it has multi-chain functionality and supports a massive range of tokens, as well as those new to the market.</p>
<h3><strong>Features &amp; Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>Users should also check out the wallet&#8217;s features and functionality. For example, if a user wishes to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-defi-coins.htm">best DeFi coins</a>, they should check whether the wallet provides access to the decentralized web.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/features-functionality.jpg" alt="NFT marketplace" /></figure>
<p>Many wallets also provide functionality for NFT storage alongside their crypto storage options. This can be a great benefit for investors interested in obtaining cryptos and NFTs to create a well-rounded portfolio of digital assets.</p>
<p>For NFTs specifically, investors who hold images from highly valuable collections should also consider placing them in cold storage and only connecting to the internet when carrying out a specific task such as selling.</p>
<h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, users should also consider the fees associated with using a crypto wallet. Most software wallets are free to download and use – the only fees to be aware of are network fees that occur during transfers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, those who choose to use a Bitcoin hardware wallet must be aware that these wallets have an up-front cost since they are physical devices.</p>
<p>The price of these devices can vary significantly, although it usually ranges between $50 and $300, depending on the provider and model.</p>
<h2>How to Get &amp; Use a Crypto Wallet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Before ending this guide on the best crypto wallets, let&#8217;s look at how to download and use one of these wallets. As noted earlier, our recommended crypto wallet app is offered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a>, which is free to download, simple to use, and available on iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p>Next, the app will ask you to use a current email address to create your account. Simply input your email address or select &#8216;Continue with Apple/Google&#8217; to quickly input an email address that&#8217;s already saved to your phone.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 – Confirm Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>Once an email address has been put in, the app will ask if you would like to add two-factor authentication (2FA), which means it will send you a six-digit code when you log in for added security.</p>
<p>This skep can be stepped, although it is not possible to skip the next step which is inputting and confirming a four-digit password.</p>
<p>There is also the additional security feature of enabling fingerprint login which, if chosen, will allow users to skip putting in a password each time and just continue instantly.</p>

<p>This all-encompassing Web3 app, which is a non-custodial software wallet, aims to be more than just a platform for storing cryptocurrencies – instead, offering a comprehensive solution that simplifies the management of various digital assets and provides crucial data and insights.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333506/best-wallet-1.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Homepage" /></figure>
<p>This means that users can store their coins, tokens, and NFTs on the Best Wallet mobile app, which has a clear focus on security. Alongside robust cryptographic methods, Best Wallet also boasts two-factor authentication and biometric identification, ensuring users’ digital assets are as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Another strength of Best Wallet is its dedication to cross-chain compatibility. The wallet supports assets on various blockchains, including Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, and uses trusted third-party app Wert to purchase cryptos with fiat, although Wert decides the fees.</p>
<p>As well as purchasing crypto with fiat, Best Wallet allows users to trade thousands of different tokens with a custom, built-in decentralized exchange.</p>
<p>Best Wallet will also provide unique data and insights into new, trending and upcoming tokens, and provide info on airdrops in the space, as well as offering NFT compatibility and an in-app NFT gallery, although these features are not yet live.</p>

<p>Underpinning all of these features is $BEST – Best Wallet&#8217;s native token. $BEST holders who stake their tokens will receive various benefits, including early access to crypto presales, staking rewards and more. Stakers will even benefit from zero gas fees when making transfers, which is ideal for active market participants.</p>
<p>Active participants on social media and active  Best Wallet users will receive a $BEST token airdrop in the coming months, with 10% of the overall supply distributed.</p>
<p>Finally, Best Wallet has been designed as a mobile-first application, available on iOS and Android. This ensures that managing digital assets is as easy as possible &#8211; however, those who prefer desktop/PC access will also be catered to, with a browser extension in development.</p>

<h3><strong>2. OKX &#8211; Leading UK-Regulated Crypto Wallet and Exchange</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://okx.sjv.io/c/2070067/1363788/15383">OKX</a> is a global crypto exchange with more than 20 million users around the world and has some of the lowest trading fees in the industry.</p>
<p>To make it easy for traders and investors on OKX to store their tokens securely, the exchange also has its own proprietary crypto wallet. The OKX wallet is available for iOS and Android devices and as a browser extension. It’s completely free to use.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="401" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-134246" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700565205-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-12-51.png" alt="OKX Crypto Exchange" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700565205-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-12-51.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700565205-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-12-51-300x134.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700565205-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-12-51-768x342.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The OKX wallet has a lot of features for traders and investors to like. First, it works with almost all major blockchains and makes it simple to swap tokens between them. So, users don’t have to worry about blockchain compatibility when exploring new projects. The OKX wallet also integrates seamlessly with the OKX exchange, making it easy to exchange one token for another at low rates.</p>
<p>On top of that, the OKX wallet has a built-in NFT marketplace. This is a huge advantage for crypto enthusiasts who are bullish on the NFT market, since they can manage their tokens and NFTs in a single location. </p>
<p>The OKX wallet also has a large and growing library of decentralized apps (dApps). dApps in the OKX marketplace cover DeFi, GameFi, and much more.</p>
<p>However, to comply with new regulations from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) &#8211; the UK regulator &#8211; OKX has recently had to remove dozens of trading pairs for high-risk tokens, reducing its offering to around 40 assets, and changed its marketing policies.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Binance &#8211; Web and Mobile Wallet for UK Crypto Traders</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=49241604">Binance </a>is the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange and naturally &#8211; it offers a safe way to store digital assets. This provider offers the best crypto wallet for UK traders that wish to actively buy and sell tokens. The platform is home to more than 600 crypto assets across 1,000 markets. Moreover, trading commissions are super-low. </p>
<p>For example, buying and selling crypto on Binance will cost just 0.1% in commission. This amounts to £1 for every £1,000 traded. Binance also supports GBP deposits via debit/credit cards at a reasonable fee of 1.8%. GBP payments are also supported via bank transfers at a flat fee of £1. After buying crypto on Binance, the tokens are stored in the user&#8217;s web wallet. </p>
<p>The web wallet is protected by a variety of safeguards, which is inclusive of two-factor authentication. Logging into the Binance wallet from a new device or IP address will trigger an additional security check. Binance has also implemented a safe asset fund for users (SAFU), which is designed to compensate investors in the event the exchange is hacked. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221411/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-08-22.jpg" alt="Binance Crypto Exchange" /></figure>
<p>The Binance wallet can also be downloaded as a mobile app for iOS and Android smartphones. This doubles up as a trading interface, so Binance users can buy and sell crypto on the move. Binance also offers DeFi services across some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a>. This includes yield farming, interest accounts, and staking. </p>
<p>Both the Binance web and mobile wallets are custodial, which means that users will not have access to their private keys. Those in the market for the best Bitcoin wallet in the UK for non-custodial storage might therefore consider Trust Wallet. </p>

<h3><strong>6. Coinbase &#8211; Popular Crypto Wallet for Beginners </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://gridglass43.co/box_22bd1e49e2a1930b89b533f5491fade3">Coinbase </a>is perhaps the best crypto wallet for UK investors with little to no experience in storing digital assets. The user-friendly interface and low account minimums available at Coinbase will therefore appeal to beginners. After buying crypto assets on the Coinbase platform, the tokens are automatically stored in the user&#8217;s web wallet. </p>
<p>Although this offers a convenient storage option, the Coinbase web wallet comes with a vast range of security protocols. This includes IP and device whitelisting, two-factor authentication, and cold storage. The latter means that 98% of the digital assets held in the Coinbase web wallet are kept offline at all times. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221412/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-09-39.jpg" alt="Get Started With Coinbase" /></figure>
<p>There is also a Coinbase mobile app that connects to the main account. This means that users can access the crypto assets purchased and stored in the Coinbase wallet on the move. Coinbase also supports instant crypto purchases with a debit/credit card, albeit, this attracts a fee of 3.99%. Trading commissions are high too at 1.49% per slide.    </p>

<p>Trust Wallet is perhaps the best crypto wallet in the UK for those seeking a non-custodial storage option. This means that by using Trust Wallet, investors in the UK will retain full control over their private keys. This is a big deal for some crypto traders, as it ensures that there is full ownership of the underlying tokens at all times. </p>
<p>In other words, Trust Wallet does not have access to the private keys. On the flip side, if the investor forgets their password and is unable to locate the private keys for the wallet, Trust Wallet will not be able to help regain access. Trust Wallet is backed by the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange &#8211; Binance. </p>

<p>It comes in the shape of a mobile app and is free to download and use. Trust Wallet claims to support more than 4.5+million digital assets across 65 blockchains. Therefore, for all intents and purposes, traders in the UK can use Trust Wallet to store their entire crypto portfolio. Trust Wallet also supports DeFi services from within the wallet app, which is inclusive of staking. </p>
<p>This means that Trust Wallet is the best crypto wallet for UK investors that wish to earn interest on their idle tokens. Another benefit of Trust Wallet is that it offers access to decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap. This exchange operates on the Binance Smart Chain and is known to list some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-low-cap-crypto.htm">best low-cap cryptocurrencies to invest in</a>.    </p>
<p>Trust Wallet also offers support NFTs &#8211; which include the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards. Although Trust Wallet is a decentralized wallet option, it has integrated support with a third-party payment processor. This means that it is possible to buy crypto in the UK with a debit/credit card &#8211; after going through a brief KYC process.  </p>

<h3><strong>9. Metamask &#8211; Top Crypto Wallet for Browser Extensions</strong> </h3>
<p>Metamask is a decentralized wallet that offers non-custodial storage. Although Metamask is also downloadable as a mobile app for iOS and Android, for the most seamless experience beginners will often opt for the browser extension. Metamask can be installed on multiple browser types &#8211; inclusive of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. </p>
<p>After installing the wallet, Metamask is initially compatible with the Ethereum network. However, other networks can be added manually &#8211; such as the Binance Smart Chain. Metamask offers a bare-bones service, insofar as it doesn&#8217;t allow users to buy, sell, or swap crypto. The wallet is, however, suitable for accessing decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap. </p>

<p>Metamask is also a popular option when it comes to accessing crypto presales. Although Metamask also supports NFTs, this is only available on the mobile app. There are no fees to download or use the Metamask wallet, other than when sending crypto. There is no markup on outgoing transactions as Metamask simply forwards on the respective network fee. </p>

<p>ZenGo is a crypto wallet that aims to offer the perfect balance between user-friendliness and security. The app &#8211; which is compatible with both Android and iOS devices, offers a unique security protocol called three-factor authentication &#8211; or 3FA.

<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="403" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-134261" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700565540-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-18-21-e1700565559765.png" alt="Zengo Secure Crypto Wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700565540-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-18-21-e1700565559765.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700565540-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-18-21-e1700565559765-300x134.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700565540-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-18-21-e1700565559765-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This consists of email confirmation, a face scan, and a recovery file stored on the cloud. This also means that should the user lose the smartphone where the ZenGo app is installed, access can be recovered remotely on another device. In total, ZenGo supports 76 digital assets.

<h2><strong>What is a Crypto Wallet?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>After buying crypto assets such as Bitcoin and BNB, the tokens need to be stored in a wallet. This ensures that the tokens remain safe at all times. This is not too dissimilar to how traditional money is stored in a regulated bank account. </p>
<p>At a minimum, crypto wallets enable investors to send and receive tokens. This is conducted on a wallet-to-wallet basis via a public address. A non-custodial crypto wallet is protected by private keys, which provide access to the digital assets remotely &#8211; often via a 12-word backup phrase. </p>
<p>However, custodial wallets &#8211; which are typically offered by crypto exchanges and brokers, do not enable users to access their private keys. Instead, the private keys will be safeguarded by the respective provider.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Crypto Investors Need a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto investors are advised to obtain a secure wallet with the view of keeping their digital assets safe and away from the wrong hands. Once again, this follows the same concept as depositing traditional money in a bank account for safekeeping and easy access to the funds. </p>
<p>In the case of a crypto wallet, access to the funds is often protected by a range of safeguards. For example, custodial wallet providers will keep the vast majority of client digital assets offline in cold storage. This ensures that the tokens cannot be accessed by a remote hacker.</p>
<p>Other security features include two/three-factor authentication, biometric and facial logins, and IP address whitelisting. Top crypto wallets in the UK will also make the process of sending and receiving funds seamless and convenient. </p>
<h2><strong>How do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The underlying mechanics of Bitcoin and crypto wallets will vary slightly depending on the chosen device type. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are a lot of similarities that most crypto wallets possess. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each crypto wallet will have its own public address. This is similar to an account number and sort code associated with UK banks. </li>
<li>As such, investors can receive funds by supplying the public address for their crypto wallet.</li>
<li>Similarly, when sending funds out of the wallet to another person, the public address will need to be entered </li>
<li>Once the transaction is confirmed, the person sending the funds will pay a blockchain  fee, which can vary depending on the network and broader market conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what a Bitcoin wallet address looks like:</p>
<p><strong>3FZbgi29cpjq2GjdwV8eyHuJJnkLtktZc5</strong></p>
<p>Although it is safe to give a crypto wallet address to other people, it is important to remember that digital assets operate on the blockchain ledger. </p>
<p>This means that by knowing somebody else&#8217;s public address, it is possible to see how much the wallet is storing, in addition to any previous transactions that have been conducted.  </p>
<h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3>
<p>All crypto wallets are backed and secured by private keys. This is similar to a password associated with an online banking account. In other words, those with access to the private key can log into the wallet and authorize transactions. </p>
<p>Therefore, it is crucial that wallet private keys are never shared with anyone. With that said, whether or not the user has access to the private keys will depend on the wallet type. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custodial wallets are controlled by third parties, such as crypto exchanges. This means that the user will not have access to the wallet&#8217;s private keys. However, if the user forgets their password, they can ask the third party for help regaining access to the wallet. </li>
<li>Non-custodial wallets, such as Best Wallet, provide users will full control over their digital assets and private keys. No third party can access the wallet without knowing the private keys. However, if the non-custodial wallet device is lost and the user cannot access their private keys, the digital assets will be unrecoverable.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Choosing the best crypto wallet in the UK is often a decision that needs to focus on the <i>type</i> of storage option. </p>
<p>Below, we cover the main types of crypto wallets available to UK investors.</p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong> </h3>
<p>Software wallets enable investors to access their crypto funds remotely. This is typically a choice between a mobile app, desktop software, a browser extension, or a centralized web wallet.</p>
<p>Either way, software wallets make it a convenient process when it comes to sending and receiving funds. </p>
<p>Moreover, some software providers support multiple device types that each connect to one another.</p>
<h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Hardware wallets come in the form of physical devices. Leaders in this space include Trezor and Ledger Nano &#8211; both of which we reviewed earlier. </p>
<p>Hardware wallets offer the highest level of security, but transferring funds can be cumbersome. </p>
<p>The reason for this is that the user must enter the wallet PIN on the hardware device itself in order to authorize the transfer. </p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Paper wallets offer a cost-effective way to store crypto assets offline and away from the threats of a remote hacking attempt. </p>
<p>The user will usually print the wallet&#8217;s private keys onto a sheet of paper via a QR code. Then, the paper will be stored somewhere safe. </p>
<p>If the user needs to send crypto out of the paper wallet, they can do this remotely from a mobile device by scanning the QR code. </p>
<p>This option, while cost-effective and safe, makes it extremely cumbersome to transfer funds.  </p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best UK Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In this section, we explore some of the most important considerations to make when selecting the best Bitcoin wallet in the UK. </p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>

<ul>

<li>Fingerprint ID</li>
<li>Cold storage on custodial wallets</li>
<li>IP address whitelisting</li>
<li>Device whitelisting</li>
<li>Notifications on outgoing transactions  </li>
</ul>

<p>There should be no markup on this, meaning that users simply pay the network fee charged by the underlying blockchain. </p>
<p>With that said, fees will also be charged if the wallet provider supports GBP deposits and crypto trading services. </p>
<h3><strong>User Experience</strong> </h3>
<p>The chosen crypto wallet should offer a suitable user experience that aligns with the objectives of the trader. </p>
<p>For example, a Bitcoin hardware wallet will likely offer superb security, sending and receiving funds can be cumbersome.</p>

<p>Yes, in the vast majority of cases, online Bitcoin wallets are free to download and maintain. With that said, sending Bitcoin out of the wallet will attract a blockchain mining fee. Moreover, opting for a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano will attract a fee, not least because it comes in the form of a physical device. </p>
<p><strong>How do I get a Bitcoin account in the UK?</strong></p>
<p>The easiest, safest, and most cost-effective way to get a verified Bitcoin account in the UK is to opt for a non-custodial software wallet such as Best Wallet, our top overall pick. Not only is it possible to safely and securely purchase BTC on the app, which is available on iOS and Android, but the app also has an in-built DEX &#8211; allowing for trades on thousands of tokens &#8211; and unique insights on new and trending tokens. It is also hosting an airdrop for its native token $BEST.</p>

<p>Since its humble beginnings in 2009, Bitcoin has grown from a fringe alternative currency worth pennies to a globally known asset, with a single Bitcoin now worth tens of thousands of dollars. Many in the investment space see continued growth in the Bitcoin market. If you’re a new investor who wants to learn how to buy Bitcoin, we’ll explain the best ways to get started.</p>
<p>This guide covers the basics of investing in Bitcoin, including the best places to buy Bitcoin. We’ll also explore ways to secure your Bitcoin investment with a crypto wallet and other strategies for Bitcoin investing.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin is a finite digital currency that allows people to store and transfer value to others without an intermediary. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, Bitcoin is independent and controlled by a decentralized worldwide community of node operators. To change the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin node operators accept any changes by choosing to install a new version of the Bitcoin Core software that implements the changes. If they don’t adopt the new version, the protocol does not change.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was founded by an anonymous person or team who using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>What started as a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a> outlining a proposed peer-to-peer money system and drafted during the great financial crisis in the late 2000s became a worldwide phenomenon, an alternative currency that ensured transactions could not be reversed and that balances could not be spent twice. This stood in stark contrast to what appeared at the time to be a deeply troubled traditional financial system.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin network itself is now distributed worldwide, with each full node hosting a copy of all blocks and transactions, checking each against the network’s consensus rules.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s appeal centers on critical characteristics, including a fixed supply and proof-of-work consensus. To date, there are about 19.54 million Bitcoin in existence, with a fixed cap of 21 million. The last bitcoin is expected to be mined in 2140. Scarcity drives Bitcoin’s value, but its consensus method also attracts sound-money fans. Bitcoin uses proof of work to validate transactions, a cost-intensive method of solving for a hash value when mining a new block of transactions. As new blocks are added to the blockchain, it becomes financially inviable to reverse a transaction that has already occurred.</p>
<p><div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"></p>
<h4>What is the Bitcoin Blockchain?</h4>
<p>Blockhains are ledgers, a record of balances and transactions. New transactions are grouped into a block and then each block is added to the chain.</p>
<p>In the Bitcoin protocol (set of rules) each block also references the previous block. This continuity, combined with Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus method to add new blocks to the chain, makes it prohibitively expensive to reverse a transaction in a previous block. After 60 minutes, the time it takes to add 6 blocks to the chain, transactions are considered permanent.</p>
<p>Its scarcity and resistance to changes make bitcoin an attractive option to today’s inflation-prone fiat currencies, including the USD, GPB, and others. But the market is still young. Bitcoin’s worldwide market capitalization is just north of $700 million, a fraction of gold’s nearly $13 trillion market cap and still smaller than silver’s $1.3 trillion market cap.</p>
<p></div></div></p>
<h2>Where to Buy Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In this guide, we’ll discuss how to buy Bitcoin, including the best places to buy BTC. The most common options include cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers. Exchanges provide a platform for traders to transact with each other – or with each other’s orders more accurately. Brokers transact with the trader directly. The end transaction, however, often looks very similar because both offer a way to buy or sell Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Best Places to Buy Bitcoin</h3>
<ol>
<li>MEXC: Best Crypto Exchange With 0% Spot Trading Fee and Over 1,000 Cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>OKX: Crypto Exchange With Trading Bots and Bot Marketplace, and 350+ Cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>Binance: World’s Largest Crypto Exchange With 350 Cryptocurrencies and Futures Trading</li>
<li>Coinbase: Publicly Traded Crypto Exchange With 250+ Cryptocurrencies and Advanced Trading</li>
<li>eToro: Low-Fee Broker With Copy Trading, Smart Portfolios, and 80+ Cryptocurrencies</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. MEXC: Best Crypto Exchange With 0% Spot Trading Fee and Over 1,000 Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="300" height="49" class="aligncenter wp-image-138430 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701440260-mexc-logo.jpg" alt="MEXC logo" /></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC</a> is the best crypto exchange not only to buy Bitcoin but to buy over 1,000 other cryptocurrencies that aren&#8217;t listed on other major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Buy or trade cryptocurrencies with a 0% spot trading fee and trade crypto futures with a 0% fee for limit orders and 0.02% fee for market order. This is by far the lowest fees you can find with a crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Moreover, MEXC offers advanced trading tools and charts, including integrated TradingView charts, as well as order book view, which should be more than enough to cater to seasoned crypto traders.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean that beginners aren&#8217;t welcome. On the contrary, beginners can easily buy Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency either via bank or SEPA transfer, depending on the country, or by purchasing crypto with card or Apple and Google Pay via third-party services like Moonpay and Mercuryo.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-138327 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage.jpg" alt="MEXC homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage-768x434.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Grow your crypto portfolio with MEXC Savings. This is similar to crypto staking where you lock your coins for a certain period of time to accrue interest in the form of more coins. For example, USDT has an APR of up to 8.8%, while Bitcoin has up to 1.8% APR. There are some amount limitations, though, such as you earn the maximum APR on amounts up to $300 for some coins. Make sure to read about them before you lock your coins.</p>
<p>Hands-off investors who don&#8217;t want to actively participate in the market and trade crypto themselves can use the copy trading feature where you can follow successful traders and let them trade your funds on your behalf. This could be a useful tool to potentially increase your portfolio in addition to buying and holding Bitcoin.</p>

<h3>2. OKX: Low-Fee Crypto Exchange With Trading Bots and Bot Marketplace, and 350+ Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="142" height="54" class="aligncenter wp-image-138858 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686992-okx-logo.jpg" alt="OKX logo" /></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/okx">OKX</a> is the second largest crypto exchange based on derivatives trading volume. This means that not only OKX is an excellent exchange to buy Bitcoin, but to trade Bitcoin and derivatives as well because of OKX&#8217;s low trading fees.</p>
<p>Those looking to buy Bitcoin can buy it directly on OKX with a card, Apple Pay or Google Pay once you open an account and verify it.</p>
<p>You can then hold it on the exchange and maybe even use OKX Earn where you lock your coins for a select period of time and earn rewards in the meantime. Currently, you can get up to 5% APR on Bitcoin with a flexible lock. This means you can unlock whenever you want.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="467" class="alignnone wp-image-138857 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange.jpg" alt="OKX crypto exchange" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange-300x156.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange-768x399.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701686971-okx-exchange-150x78.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>OKX is also one of the best exchanges for spot and derivatives trading as it comes with 0.08% spot trading fee for limit orders and 0.1% for market orders. If you hold OKB coins or have a certain amount of assets in USD, you can further lower the fees.</p>
<p>The exchange is also famous for its bot marketplace. This means you can subscribe to trading bots or build your own and sell it to subscribers to earn additional income.</p>

<h3>3. Binance: World’s Largest Crypto Exchange With 350 Cryptocurrencies and Futures Trading</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="492" height="130" class="aligncenter wp-image-131889" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069472-binance-logo.png" alt="binance logo" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069472-binance-logo.png 492w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069472-binance-logo-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p>The cheapest way to buy Bitcoin in this roundup is through the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance">Binance</a> exchange.</p>
<p>However, location plays an important role. In the US, traders can only access Binance.US, which has transitioned to a crypto-only exchange. To buy Bitcoin on Binance.US, you have to first load your account with USDT (a popular stablecoin valued at $1) through a third-party provider, which you can then trade for BTC (with zero trading fees). We priced this out, and the cost was close to $112 to buy $100 worth of USDT. Fees may vary based on region and network demand.</p>
<p>While Binance.US is easy to use, the extra step of buying crypto off-platform before you can buy Bitcoin makes it less attractive for US users than Coinbase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="411" class="aligncenter wp-image-131893" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard-1024x411.png" alt="binance.com crypto exchange" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard-1024x411.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard-300x121.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard-768x309.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700069628-binance-com-dashboard.png 1523w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>If there’s a downside to Binance’s Advanced Trade, it might be that there are too many advanced features if all you need to do is buy BTC. Advanced Trade is loaded with trading tools, including margin trading, so you can trade with leverage (borrowing against your investment capital). Other advanced features include trading bots, which can make trades for you automatically, and futures trading, which allows you to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin or other crypto assets.</p>
<p>But for power users, it isn’t easy to match the trading options available on Binance.com</p>

<h3>4. Coinbase: Publicly Traded Crypto Exchange With 250+ Cryptocurrencies and Advanced Trading</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="462" height="128" class="wp-image-131848 aligncenter" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066571-coinbase-logo.png" alt="coinbase logo" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066571-coinbase-logo.png 462w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066571-coinbase-logo-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" />With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/803531/number-of-coinbase-users/">100 million users worldwide</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase">Coinbase</a> is the largest publicly traded exchange on the planet. The company trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker COIN. Coinbase’s initial purchase offering (IPO) valued the company at $86 billion, helping to build a stable platform for trading and crypto-economy services, including crypto storage, lending, and staking services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="502" class="aligncenter wp-image-131851" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-1024x502.png" alt="coinbase crypto offerings" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700066766-coinbase-dashboard.png 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Being publicly traded brings benefits to users as well in the form of transparency and regulation.

Instead, you’re buying from or selling to eToro, which then interacts with its own market makers. While the process seems more complicated when described, it’s actually much easier for newer traders to get started with eToro compared to many exchanges.</p>
<p>There’s no need to learn the ins and outs of complicated trading tools. One easy-to-use trading box does everything you need, and trading fees are dead simple at 1% of your trade value. eToro was founded with the goal of making investing simple and transparent.</p>

<p>The platform also enables copy trading, an easy way to find successful traders and copy their trades automatically. With copy trading, you choose the investment amount for the trade and can also set a trigger to protect against larger losses if the market turns against the trade. Copy trading can eliminate the need for technical analysis, and the platform lets you view the historical performance of other traders before you choose who to copy.</p>

<h2>How To Buy Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Exchanges are the most common way to invest in Bitcoin, but you have several other options. Which is the best way to buy Bitcoin? The answer depends on your goals and how you plan to use your Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Centralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>A centralized exchange like Coinbase or Kraken offers a convenient onramp and offramp for crypto assets, allowing you to exchange cryptocurrencies for traditional currencies or trade crypto for crypto.</p>
<p>On a centralized exchange, you’re trading against an order book, which is a list of open buy and sell orders on the exchange. Your exchange acts as an intermediary in that it creates the trading environment and provides storage for your crypto after you make a trade.</p>
<h3>Decentralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap or Balancer offers a way to trade cryptocurrency without an intermediary. Your trades, typically called swaps, happen from your own crypto wallet, so you don’t have to deposit crypto with a third party to make a transaction. Decentralized exchanges use computer programs that run on the blockchain to execute transactions.</p>
<p>While decentralized exchanges don’t support Bitcoin natively, you’ll find wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on every popular DEX. WBTC is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that tracks its value and can be swapped 1:1 for BTC on many centralized exchanges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="334" class="aligncenter wp-image-131905" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-1024x334.png" alt="uniswap crypto exchange wbtc usdt swap" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-1024x334.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-300x98.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-768x250.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap-1536x501.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070719-uniswap-wbtc-swap.png 1892w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It’s helpful to have some trading experience and research the trading risks before using a DEX to build your Bitcoin investment.</p>
<h3>Brokerages</h3>
<p>A broker is a go-between. On a centralized exchange, you’re interacting with orders placed by other traders. Although the transaction looks similar in that you can buy or sell Bitcoin, in a brokerage transaction, you’re transacting with the broker rather than other traders.</p>
<p>The broker sources the assets for purchases and takes the inventory when you sell.</p>
<p>eToro, for example, is a broker, although the buying experience is very similar to what you’d find with a basic exchange platform. Robinhood is another example of a broker that offers Bitcoin and other cryptos.</p>
<h3>Payment Apps</h3>
<p>Many popular payment apps now offer crypto purchases. Some, like Cash App and Strike, only offer Bitcoin. Others, including PayPal and Venmo, offer several popular cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH, and Litecoin.</p>
<h3>Peer-to-Peer Exchanges</h3>
<p>You also can buy Bitcoin from other people directly. Several exchanges, including Gemini and Binance, offer peer-to-peer trading. Bisq, a popular open-source application, allows you to buy Bitcoin without using a centralized exchange.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="396" class="aligncenter wp-image-131906" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-1024x396.png" alt="peer-to-peer crypto exchanges" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-1024x396.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-300x116.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-768x297.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange-1536x594.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700070876-bisq-btc-peer-to-peer-exchange.png 1541w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Payment methods vary based on the preferences of the seller. Bisq uses BTC security deposits to help ensure safe trading between users.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin ATMs</h3>
<p>Almost as easy as using a vending machine, Bitcoin ATMS let you buy BTC with a debit card or cash. The operating network then sends Bitcoin to your Bitcoin wallet address. Buying fees for Bitcoin machines can be much higher than you’ll find with exchanges or brokers.</p>
<h3>Crypto Wallets</h3>
<p>Many crypto wallets offer ways to buy BTC or other cryptocurrencies through third-party providers. Exchanges and brokers typically provide a more cost-effective way to invest in Bitcoin, but the option is available with many hardware and software wallets. We’ll cover crypto wallets in just a bit.</p>
<h3>Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Depending on which method you choose when you buy Bitcoin, you may have several payment options available to you. Bitcoin ATMs take cash or debit cards, for example, whereas centralized exchanges usually support bank deposits, debit cards, and possibly credit cards.</p>
<p>You can buy Bitcoin with any of the following, depending on where you trade.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash: Local sellers on apps like Bisq may take cash. Bitcoin ATMs offer another way to buy BTC with cash.</li>
<li>Bank transfer: Centralized exchanges like Coinbase support bank transfers.</li>
<li>Debit card: Most leading centralized exchanges and brokers support debit cards. Read the fine print on debit card fees.</li>
<li>Credit card: Although not as common as debit cards, many exchanges also support credit card purchases. Again, check the fees before you confirm the transaction.</li>
<li>Wire transfer: You can wire money to an exchange or brokerage account in many cases.</li>
<li>PayPal: Coinbase and eToro both support PayPal for transactions.</li>
<li>Neteller/Skrill: In some regions, you can use other payment apps like Neteller to fund your trading account on an exchange or brokerage account.</li>
<li>Other cryptocurrencies: Crypto-only exchanges like Binance.US and decentralized exchanges require that you trade crypto for crypto.</li>
<li>Fiat currencies like USD and GPB aren’t supported directly, but you can use a third party to buy crypto with fiat or trade with crypto you already have.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"></p>
<h4>Choosing a Payment Option to Buy Bitcoin</h4>
<p>Additional payment options like PayPal are convenient for people who already use those payment apps. Freelancers, for example, often already have a PayPal balance they can use.</p>
<p>However, PayPal, debit cards, and credit cards often increase trading costs because some exchanges add a processing fee. These fees can range from 2% up to 5%, creating a headwind for your investment to overcome.</p>
<p>Generally, the cheapest way to fund your trading account is with a bank transfer because many exchanges don’t charge a deposit fee for bank transfers. Check the fine print before making a deposit to be sure the trade still works for you.</p>

<h2>Start Investing In Bitcoin Today With MEXC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the earlier parts of this guide, we discussed where to invest in Bitcoin. Now, let’s look at how to invest in Bitcoin. We’ll use MEXC in this example because the platform is easy to use, and MEXCs simple trading fees are 0% of your trade.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open an account with MEXC</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">Visit MEXC</a> to open a trading account. At this step, you can use an email or you can sign up with your MetaMask wallet, your Telegram or Google account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="442" class="alignnone wp-image-138363 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg" alt="MEXC signup" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-768x377.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Fund your account</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your country, you can buy Bitcoin with a SEPA bank transfer. You&#8217;ll need to verify your ID, however. If your country isn&#8217;t supported for such transfer, you can purchase Bitcoin with a credit card via third-party providers such as Mercuryo and Moonpay. You may have to pass an ID verification at these providers as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="541" class="alignnone wp-image-138349 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="MEXC buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Buy Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>Select Bitcoin from the dropdown menu and enter the amount of money you wish to spend. Select the provider with the best rate and click &#8220;Continue&#8221;. Follow the prompts and complete the transaction. Alternatively, you can buy &#8220;USDT&#8221; and then buy Bitcoin on the spot market with 0% fees.</p>
<h2>How Much Is Bitcoin Worth?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At press time, Bitcoin is worth about $37,000, meaning each coin has a value of nearly $40,000, considerably less than its <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/326707/bitcoin-price-index/">all-time high of over $65,000</a> in 2021. However, BTC has more than doubled in the past year, recovering from its lows.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s current market cap is over $700 billion, making it more valuable than Visa, which has a $512 billion market cap and nearly twice the size of Mastercard’s $375 billion market cap.</p>
<p>Don’t be intimidated by Bitcoin’s value when investing, however. Much like you can buy fractional shares in stocks, you can buy part of a Bitcoin. While the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin is a satoshi (1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin). Currently, one penny in USD equals 28 satoshis, making the smallest unit in Bitcoin much smaller than the smallest unit in US currency.</p>
<p>For one satoshi to reach the value of one penny, the price of one Bitcoin would have to rise to $991,172.</p>
<h2>How Much Bitcoin Should I Buy?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Because Bitcoin is divisible, you can buy small or larger amounts, depending on your budget.</p>
<p>To date, <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-as-legal-tender-5-countries-that-could-be-next-in-line-to-adopt-15228761.htm">Bitcoin is legal tender in two countries</a>, which makes it a speculative investment. Governments around the world could slow the growth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and in some countries, cryptocurrencies are illegal. For instance, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-where-bitcoin-legal-135148775.html">China banned cryptocurrency trading</a>.</p>
<p>All this is to say Bitcoin and other crypto assets are risky investments. However, they also might outperform other assets significantly.</p>
<p>Here’s how Bitcoin’s performance compares to the S&amp;P 500 index over the last ten years.</p>
<p><div class="su-table su-table-responsive su-table-alternate"></p>
<figure class="table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Compare</td>

<tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p></div></p>
<p>$1,000 invested in the S&amp;P in 2013 would be worth $2,460 ten years later. By comparison, the same $1,000 invested in Bitcoin in 2013 would be worth $84,050 after ten years.</p>
<p>Many in the industry see cryptocurrencies as a young asset class, one that will continue to grow, perhaps replacing some traditional assets. However, it’s important to match your investment to your budget and never invest in cryptocurrency unless you’re willing to risk losing your investment.</p>
<h2>Storing Your BTC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If you buy Bitcoin through an exchange like Coinbase or MEXC, the trading platform can hold your crypto for you, much like a bank holds your deposits.</p>
<p>However, there’s a big difference between banks and crypto exchanges. Crypto balances are not insured by the government and exchanges get much less oversight compared to banks. To safeguard your investment, you may want to move your larger balances to a self-custody crypto wallet.</p>
<p>As a digital asset, Bitcoin can’t be stored physically. Instead, your Bitcoin is held at a wallet address on the blockchain. A crypto wallet holds the private keys that control the assets at that address.</p>
<p>When an exchange holds your crypto for you, your crypto is still secured by a wallet, but the exchange has the keys. If the exchange becomes insolvent, as was the case with FTX, or your account login is compromised, your crypto is at risk. Instead, it’s often wiser to store your Bitcoin with a self-custody wallet like Electrum or Sparrow or even use a hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor wallet.</p>
<h3>Hot Wallets vs Cold Wallets</h3>
<p>Software crypto wallets like Electrum and Sparrow are also called hot wallets because the private keys for the wallet are generated on a device connected to the internet. If you’re a technical user, there is a way to build a cold wallet with Electrum, however.</p>
<p>A cold wallet means the private keys for the wallet are generated and stored on a device that’s not connected to the internet. Typically, this points to a hardware wallet, which is a device that generates the wallet’s private keys and stores them offline.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-hardware-wallets.htm">Hardware crypto wallets</a> either connect to another device via USB or Bluetooth, although some devices use airgap technology instead, using QR codes to approve or decline transactions. In both cases, hardware wallets act like a form of two-factor authentication, and no transactions for the wallet’s assets can be approved without confirming the transaction with the device.</p>
<h2>What Can You Buy With Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin is now a household name, and many merchants are more comfortable accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as payment for products and services.</p>
<p>If you find a willing retailer or service provider, you can use Bitcoin to buy any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cars</li>
<li>Jewelry</li>
<li>Video games</li>
<li>ElectronicsClothing</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Gift cards</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"></p>
<h4>Should You Spend Your Bitcoin?</h4>
<p>Bitcoin was invented as a peer-to-peer cash system, implying that it was meant to be spent or sent to others. The Bitcoin protocol excels at this task. However, there are some reasons you may want to hold your BTC.</p>
<p>Future price appreciation: For many, Bitcoin is seen as a store of value in an uncertain financial climate. Spending your Bitcoin could mean you miss out on future gains as more investors buy the asset.<br />
Tax considerations: Many governments around the world see Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies as property, which means that as you spend your Bitcoin or otherwise disposes of it, you may be responsible for capital gains taxes if the Bitcoin you spend has increased in value.</p>
<p></div></div></p>
<p>Some well-known merchants that accept Bitcoin for select products and services include:</p>

<h2>Should I Invest in Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The financial world still centers around traditional assets, but the growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is hard to ignore. Whether to invest in a speculative asset is an individual decision, and with a digital asset like Bitcoin that challenges traditional finance and government control of currencies, there’s reason to be cautious.</p>
<p>If you think Bitcoin deserves a place in your portfolio, match your investment to your budget, knowing there’s a possibility it all goes to zero. If you’re still ready to invest, you can use one of the exchanges we detailed earlier. But there are also some ways to invest in Bitcoin while still keeping two feet planted in the traditional investment world. Let’s look at some possibilities.</p>
<h3>Indirect Ownership of Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Owning stock in companies that hold Bitcoin makes you a Bitcoin owner. This strategy also allows you to diversify with one investment because the stock price is driven by both the value of the Bitcoin assets held by the company and the company’s performance.</p>
<p>Coinbase and MicroStrategy are two well-known companies with tall, wobbling stacks of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) holds over 158,000 Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Here are some companies with significant holdings.</p>

<p></div></p>
<h3>Bitcoin ETFs</h3>
<p>You may also be able to invest in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) depending on where you are in the world. Exchange-traded funds allow investors to trade in and out of assets by trading shares of the fund. For Bitcoin ETFs, that asset is Bitcoin. The fund buys and sells Bitcoin as investors buy and sell shares in the fund.</p>
<p>Early iterations of Bitcoin ETFs used the futures market to approximate the value of Bitcoin, but a new breed of ETFs will use the Bitcoin spot market to buy and sell the real asset rather than a derivative.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As the most widely traded cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is ubiquitous on trading platforms. Which platform you choose depends on what you need from the trading experience. Traders who need more tools like futures trading can choose a full-featured exchange like MEXC, Binance or Coinbase.</p>
<p>We recommend MEXC because it offers 0% spot trading fees and it has over 1,000 cryptocurrencies to choose from should you wish to diversify your crypto portfolio.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3>How do beginners buy Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Buying Bitcoin is similar across all platforms. To get started, open an account and verify your identity. Then, you can connect a funding source like a bank account or debit card, choose an investment amount, and make a purchase.</p>
<h3>How much do you need to start buying Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Platforms like Coinbase allow you to make trades as low as $2, but fees can be much higher as a percentage if you’re using the simple trading interface. Instead, you can use the advanced platform, where fees are lower, or choose a platform like MEXC, where spot market fees are fixed at 0%.</p>
<h3>How can I buy Bitcoin instantly?</h3>
<p>Many exchanges, such as MEXC, Binance and Coinbase let you buy Bitcoin directly with a card. But you will have to open an account and verify your ID first in most cases.</p>
<h3>Where is the best place to buy Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>The best place to buy Bitcoin depends on your preference mostly. Coinbase is an excellent choice for US citizens, while MEXC and Binance are best for buying Bitcoin in other regions.</p>
<h3>Should I buy Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Bitcoin is gaining acceptance beyond the core crypto community but remains a speculative asset. If you’re unsure about investing in Bitcoin, it may be safer to invest a small amount as you continue to learn about the asset and gauge its long-term potential.</p>
<h3>Is it safe to buy Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Buying Bitcoin brings both price risk and regulatory risk. In addition, exchange solvency risks should be considered. There are ways to mitigate many of these risks, however, including dollar-cost averaging to mitigate price risk and moving your Bitcoin off the exchange to address exchange-related risks.</p>

This means UAE investors can rest assured their cryptocurrency investments are safe. Moreover, the wallet is easily accessed via web browsers or the eToro app. </p>

<p>Another benefit of choosing eToro is that it offers 24/5 customer support. Investors simply need to log into the accounts to access the eToro live chat box. eToro also offers a staking tool that yields passive rewards. Three of the best staking coins are supported, including Ethereum, Tron, and Cardano. Staking rewards of up to 90% are offered, but this depends on the eToro account tier. </p>

<p>Designed for those who prioritize top-tier security, Ledger caters to a diverse audience, including investors in the UAE.</p>
<p>Ledger offers two primary models: the Ledger Nano S Plus and the Ledger Nano X. Both models serve the same purpose of cold storage but differ in additional features like Bluetooth compatibility, available in the Nano X.</p>
<p>These hardware wallets can be connected to your desktop or mobile device using a USB cable or Bluetooth, and they&#8217;re compatible with Ledger Live, Ledger&#8217;s dedicated app.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-.jpg" alt="Ledger Hardware Wallet Webpage" /></figure>
<p>It requires a PIN to confirm outgoing transactions, a feature only available on the device. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your computer or mobile, they cannot transact without the PIN.</p>
<p>Ledger also provides a 24-word passphrase, essentially your private key, and allows for an additional custom 25th word. </p>
<p>This extra layer of security ensures that even if someone knows your passphrase, they can&#8217;t access your assets without the 25th word. If your device is lost or stolen, it can be remotely recovered.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" alt="Ledger Hardware Wallet Shop" /></figure>
<p>With Ledger Live, you can monitor your crypto portfolio, buy assets, and interact with decentralized apps. It also supports NFTs.</p>
<p>Ledger supports over 5,500 cryptos across diverse networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Cardano.</p>
<p>Ledger provides options to suit different budgets and security needs. The Ledger Nano S Plus retails for $79, depending on your location.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Trezor &#8211; Emerging for UAE Investors With Large Exposure to Crypto   </strong></h3>
<p>Trezor is the Bitcoin hardware wallet for security. There is a wide range of safeguards that ensure the stored cryptocurrencies do not get into the wrong hands. First and foremost, Trezor is a cold wallet, so it&#8217;s never connected to the internet. </p>
<p>Rest assured, this removes the risk of the wallet being hacked remotely. Second, cryptocurrencies cannot leave the Trezor device unless the user&#8217;s PIN is entered. Third, Trezor transactions are authorized without needing to connect to a server. Instead, USB type A or C cables are used, <a href="https://trezor.io/compare">depending on the Trezor model purchased</a>. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312863/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" alt="Trezor Hardware Wallet Comparison" /></figure>
<p>The Trezor Model T costs $219 (about 800 AED) and comes with a digital touchscreen for confirming transactions. The Trezor Model One costs $69 (about 250 AED) and uses a more clunky two-pad button. That said, the Model One is just as secure as the advanced version. Moreover, both the Model One and T support over 1,000 coins, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.    </p>

<h3><strong>6. MetaMask &#8211; Popular Wallet for UAE Investors That Prefer Non-Custodial Storage  </strong></h3>
<p>Another option to consider is <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>, which is the best crypto wallet in the UAE for non-custodial storage. This means that users do not need to trust a third party when storing their cryptocurrency investments. MetaMask provides users with their private keys via a 12-word passphrase. The wallet provider cannot see the keys, as the information is encrypted. </p>
<p>But do remember that if the password and backup passphrase are misplaced, MetaMask cannot help recover the wallet. Moreover, MetaMask comes with limited security features. Nonetheless, we like that MetaMask is available as a browser extension or mobile app for Android and iOS. It is free to download and use, and no fees are charged when storing and receiving cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" alt="Metamask Wallet Homepage" /> </p>
<p>We also like that MetaMask doesn&#8217;t charge any additional fees for outgoing transfers. Instead, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/">GAS fees</a> are forwarded directed to the blockchain in real-time. In terms of supported cryptocurrencies, MetaMask comes pre-installed with an Ethereum wallet address. This accepts all ERC20 tokens, including Tether, USD Coin, and DAI. </p>
<p>Although Bitcoin is not supported, several other networks can be added to the MetaMask wallet manually. This includes Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Optimism. MetaMask also supports the best Arbitrum network tokens. Although MetaMask is free to use, it comes with several paid-for features. This includes token swaps, Ethereum 2.0 staking, and AED deposits.    </p>

<h3><strong>7. Binance &#8211; Hybrid Wallet and Exchange With Licensing From the FSRA    </strong> </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/">Binance</a> is a crypto wallet and exchange that is popular with short-term UAE traders. It holds a license with the <a href="https://www.adgm.com/financial-services-regulatory-authority">FSRA in Abu Dhabi</a> and directly accepts AED payments. The Binance wallet can be accessed by logging in with a username and password. Two-factor authentication and other security features are offered. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/looking-back-at-binances-2022-endofyear-report-1820343945198453383">Binance reports</a> that its Safe Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) is now valued at over $1 billion. This is used as an insurance fund in the event Binance is hacked. Moreover, the Binance wallet also comes with IP whitelisting. Should a user login from an unrecognized IP address, an additional two-factor authentication process is undertaken.    </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" alt="Binance Signup Page" /></figure>
<p>But the main attraction of the Binance wallet is having access to its exchange. The <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/">Binance exchange is the largest by trading volume,</a> and it supports hundreds of cryptocurrencies. UAE investors will pay just 0.1% when trading. Moreover, the Binance wallet also supports staking, yield farming, and savings accounts. APYs are very competitive, too. </p>
<p>For example, some staking pools are currently yielding almost 20%. While Binance savings accounts are offering APYs of over 30%. We also like that Binance offers advanced trading tools and complex crypto derivatives. The latter includes Bitcoin futures, options, and perpetual contracts. Binance also offers great customer support via live chat, 24/7. </p>

<h3><strong>8. Trust Wallet &#8211; Self-Custody Wallet Supporting Over 70 Blockchains  </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://trustwallet.com/">Trust Wallet</a> offers self-custody cryptocurrency storage on multiple device types. This includes a browser extension for Chrome and an Android and iOS app. The wallet is completely decentralized, and only the user has control of the private keys. Similar to MetaMask, Trust Wallet encrypts the private keys as a 12-word passphrase. </p>
<p>Trust Wallet comes with many in-built features, most of which are fee-free. For example, users can swap tokens across different blockchains without leaving the wallet. Trust Wallet also supports staking. We found that staking APYs are very competitive. For instance, Trust Wallet users can earn 10% on Kava and over 19% on Cosmos. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" alt="Trust Wallet Download Page" /></figure>
<p>Trust Wallet also has a fiat money facility that supports AED payments. However, this is provided by <a href="https://support.simplex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014078420-What-fees-do-you-charge-for-card-payments-">Simplex, so fees of up to 5%</a> will be charged. Trust Wallet is also the go-to option for accessing Web3 applications, like Uniswap, <a href="https://yearn.finance/">Yearn.finance</a>, or ApeSwap. The Trust Wallet balance can be used when accessing these decentralized platforms, making it simple to swap and earn. </p>
<p>Where Trust Wallet really stands out is its support for over 70 blockchain networks. This includes everything from Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum to Arbitrum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP. Therefore, Trust Wallet is the best crypto wallet in the UAE for diversified portfolios. </p>

<h3><strong>9. Exodus &#8211; One of the Best Desktop Crypto Wallets for Portfolio Management    </strong></h3>
<p>Many UAE investors prefer to manage their cryptocurrencies on a desktop device &#8211; and <a href="https://www.exodus.com/">Exodus</a> is one of the best Bitcoin wallets in this regard. The Exodus software is compatible with all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

<p>Exodus supports the most popular cryptocurrencies. It is compatible with over 50 blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, and Ethereum. If a particular cryptocurrency isn&#8217;t supported, users can add it to Exodus manually. Exodus comes with a very user-friendly interface that is great for managing portfolios. </p>

<h2><strong>Crypto Wallets Explained </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When investing in crypto in the UAE, the first step is to choose a suitable exchange to complete the purchase. The next step is to choose a wallet to store the purchased crypto assets. This is where things can get confusing, considering the sheer number of crypto wallets in the market.</p>
<p>To help clear the mist, a good starting point is to understand how crypto wallets actually work. </p>
<p>In basic terms, crypto wallets store digital currencies. Wallets usually come as software. For instance, desktop software for Windows and Mac or a mobile app for iOS and Android. That said, some wallets come as hardware devices, such as Trezor. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/bitcoin-3089728-1280.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Icon" /></figure>
<p>All wallets come with a unique address for each supported cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin will have its own wallet address, and this is required when <i>receiving</i> tokens. When <i>sending</i> tokens to another wallet, the receiver&#8217;s address will be needed. If using a mobile wallet, the sender can scan the receiver&#8217;s address via a QR code. If not, the wallet address can be pasted in. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike traditional bank wires, crypto transactions are sent on a wallet-to-wallet basis. This means they do not go through a third party. Instead, wallet-to-wallet transactions are processed by the blockchain network. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While storing, sending, and receiving tokens are the main functions of a crypto wallet, other features are often available. For example, the eToro wallet allows users to trade cryptocurrencies. It also supports staking and can directly accept AED payments. </p>
<h2><strong>How do Crypto Wallets Work? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a much more detailed look at how crypto wallets work. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with custodianship:</p>
<h3><strong>Wallet Custodianship</strong></h3>
<p>In order to choose the best crypto wallet in the UAE, investors must understand how custodianship works. This is important, as it determines <i>who</i> is responsible for looking after the cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>A simple analogy is to think about how traditional money is stored. </p>
<ul>
<li>When using a <i>custodial</i> storage option, the money would be deposited into a bank. The bank is then responsible for keeping the money secure. To access the money, permission needs to be granted by the bank. </li>
<li>Those who do not trust banks would need to consider a non-custodial option, such as keeping the money at home in a safe. This gives full control of the money, as no permission is needed to access it. But equally, this increases the risks of theft. </li>
</ul>
<p>The same concept is true for crypto wallets. </p>
<p>For example, custodial wallets like eToro and Binance are responsible for keeping client cryptocurrencies safe. They do not provide users with their private keys as a safety precaution. As licensed custodians, these wallet providers have institutional-grade security practices in place. </p>
<p>Alternatively, non-custodial wallets like Best Wallet give users their private keys when getting started. The wallet provider cannot access the private keys. Only the user can. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Choosing between a custodial or non-custodial wallet is ultimately down to the investor&#8217;s experience. While beginners will likely prefer a regulated custodian, experienced investors might feel more comfortable safeguarding their own wallets. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Wallet Addresses</strong></h3>
<p>In order to send and receive cryptocurrencies via the blockchain, wallet addresses are needed. Each blockchain will have its own wallet address format. </p>
<p>For example, this is what a Bitcoin wallet address looks like:</p>
<p><strong>1F34duy2eeMz5mSrvFepVzy7Y1rBsnAyWC</strong></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s an example of an Ethereum wallet address:</p>
<p><strong>0x868daB0b8E21EC0a48b726A1ccf25826c78C6d7F</strong></p>
<p>Both are equally long and complex. But crucially, no two wallet addresses can be the same. This is similar to a bank account number. </p>
<p>So, sending funds to another person requires the destination wallet address. And vice versa when receiving cryptocurrencies into the wallet. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Providing a wallet address to another person is not a security threat. Just like giving someone a bank account number, wallet addresses only allow people to send funds. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But do note that wallet addresses are <i>public</i>. This means anyone can view the wallet balance if they have the address. Data analytic websites like <a href="https://blockchain.com/">Blockchain.com</a> and <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/">BitInfoCharts</a> provide this information.  </p>
<h3><strong>Wallet Private Keys</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto wallets also come with a unique set of private keys. Similar to wallet addresses, they are complex in nature. Private keys provide access to wallets and the cryptocurrencies stored within them. This means that private keys should be protected at all costs. </p>
<p>For example, instance, private keys should never be stored on a device that can connect to the internet. If they are, they are at risk of being hacked remotely. The hacker would then be able to access the wallet and drain the cryptocurrencies stored. </p>
<ul>
<li>The best practice for securing private keys is to write them on a sheet of paper. </li>
<li>For added security, the private keys could be split and written down on multiple sheets. </li>
<li>This way, if someone comes across the sheet of paper, they would only have part of the private key &#8211; which wouldn&#8217;t provide them access to the wallet. </li>
</ul>
<p>But ultimately, safeguarding private keys can be intimidating for beginners. This is why custodial wallets are often the better option.  </p>
<h2><strong>Do You Need a Crypto Wallet? What to Consider  </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>According to a <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022">Crypto.com study</a>, there are 219 million Bitcoin holders globally. However, the number of people that use Bitcoin for transactions is very small. For example, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-activeaddresses.html">BitInfoCharts data</a> shows that in the prior 24 hours, there were just over 880,000 active Bitcoin addresses. </p>
<p>This means that the vast majority of people that own Bitcoin do not transact. Instead, Bitcoin is purchased as an investment. In practice, this means that UAE residents do not actually need a crypto wallet to invest in this space. </p>
<p>On the other hand, UAE investors wanting to send and receive cryptocurrencies will need a wallet. This will provide them with a unique wallet address and the ability to transfer funds without going through a third party.  </p>
<h2><strong>What are the Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We have covered custodianship, public addresses, and private keys in great detail. The next step for UAE investors is to learn about the different types of crypto wallets. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the most common type &#8211; software wallets.  </p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Software wallets allow investors to send and receive funds remotely. There are generally four options to choose from in this regard:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Wallet</strong>: Web wallets are offered by custodians like eToro and Binance. No software is actually required, as investors can access their web wallets by logging into their accounts.  </li>
<li><strong>Mobile Wallet</strong>: Mobile wallets like Best Wallet come as an app. They allow users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies no matter where they are located. This option is suitable for active traders that want full control of their cryptocurrencies. </li>
<li><strong>Desktop Wallet</strong>: Another option is to download a desktop wallet. Usually supported for Windows and Mac, this offers a more user-friendly experience when transacting. But desktop wallets are less convenient, and transactions can only be verified when the user has access to their device. </li>
<li><strong>Browser-Based Wallet</strong>: Some of the best crypto wallets in the UAE come as a browser extension. The wallet is installed in a browser like Chrome or Firefox. This makes it simple to trade cryptocurrencies online &#8211; especially on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">decentralized exchanges</a>.  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Hardware wallets do not allow investors to transact with the blockchain remotely. </p>
<p>Instead, they come as a hardware device, and the private keys are never exposed to the internet. To transact, a PIN needs to be entered on the hardware wallet. </p>
<p>We found that one of the best crypto hardware wallets for UAE investors is the Trezor Model One. This retails for just $69 or about 250 AED.    </p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>The less common option is a paper wallet. This is a cost-effective version of a hardware wallet, as the private keys are never connected to live servers. This is because the private keys are printed and kept somewhere secure and private &#8211; like in a safe. </p>
<p>Paper wallets will not appeal to UAE investors who want to regularly send, receive, or trade cryptocurrencies. </p>
<h2><strong>Tips for Selecting the Best UAE Bitcoin Wallet</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are many variables to consider when researching the best UAE Bitcoin wallets. Not only in terms of the wallet type and custodianship, but security, supporting coins, and core features. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what to consider when choosing a UAE crypto wallet:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custodianship</strong>: First, do some research on the pros and cons of both custodial and non-custodial wallets. As noted earlier, a great analogy is to consider how money is stored. Those that prefer to keep money in a bank can opt for a regulated custodial wallet. Those who prefer keeping money at home in a safe can opt for a non-custodial wallet. </li>
<li><strong>Device Type</strong>: The most popular wallets are available on multiple devices. For example, wallets come as mobile apps, browser extensions, and desktop software. Hardware wallets are another option. </li>
<li><strong>Supported Coins</strong>: The best crypto wallets in the UAE support many different coins and network standards. Best Wallet supports coins from various blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon and BNB, with Bitcoin blockchain planned for a future update. </li>
<li><strong>Fees</strong>: Hardware wallets must be purchased, so consider the costs before proceeding. Software wallets are free to download. Storing and receiving cryptocurrencies should also be free. Some wallets charge markups when sending cryptocurrencies. These wallets should be avoided.  </li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Security features will vary depending on the wallet type. Non-custodial hot wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask come with limited security features. Cold wallets like Trezor are super-secure.  </li>
<li><strong>User-Friendliness</strong>: UAE investors should also choose a crypto wallet that is suitable for their experience. The best user-friendly wallets are offered by eToro and Binance. On the other hand, OKX comes with many features, but it&#8217;s more suitable for experienced investors.  </li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: We like crypto wallets that come with extra features. For example, being able to buy crypto with AED or swap tokens without leaving the wallet. Staking and yield farming tools are handy for earning passive income. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Get and Use a Bitcoin Wallet in UAE</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>This section provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to set up the Best Wallet. </p>
<p>We found that Best Wallet offers the best crypto wallet app for UAE investors. Not only is it non-custodial, meaning you have full control over your funds, but the app allows users to send and receive funds via multiple blockchains. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Download the Best Wallet app</strong></h3>
<p>UAE investors must <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">download the Best Wallet app</a> from the App Store or Google Play, depending on the device.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/bw7.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Application Overview" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Open the Best Wallet App</strong></h3>
<p>When you open the app, you&#8217;ll be asked to verify your email address. The next step is to activate a two-factor authentication to improve the app&#8217;s security. However, you can skip this step and activate 2FA later on if you want to.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/bw4.jpg" alt="2FA Setup On Best Wallet" /></figure>
<p>Whether or not you activate 2FA, you&#8217;ll have to set up a four-digit password next. There&#8217;s an option to enable biometrics such as fingerprint or face ID if your device supports any of those features.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Your first wallet is on the Ethereum blockchain. You can now create multiple wallets, give them names, such as &#8220;Trading wallet&#8221; or &#8220;NFT storage&#8221; and select a background color. This is designed so that you can quickly identify each wallet. </p>
<p>Tap &#8220;Continue&#8221; when ready.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333561/bw3.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Account Name" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Now you can buy crypto with a card, receive coins from exchanges or other wallets and swap them. Active Best Wallet users may get $BEST tokens airdropped in Phase 6 of the development of this wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/bw1.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Main Account" /></figure>
<h2><strong>How Safe Are Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Each wallet type will come with its own level of security. Not only in terms of the device type, but whether it&#8217;s a custodial or non-custodial wallet. UAE investors should also consider whether the wallet offers hot or cold storage. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s break down the most important factors;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cold Wallets</strong>: Cold wallets offer the highest level of security. They are never connected to a live internet server, so this removes a major risk &#8211; remote hacking attempts. Hot wallets are usually non-custodial, such as Trezor. </li>
<li><strong>Hot Wallets</strong>: In contrast, hot wallets offer a much lower level of security, because they are always connected to a live internet server. Hot wallets come as both custodial and non-custodial options. For example, the Binance web wallet is custodial. While the Exodus wallet is non-custodial, as users are provided with their private keys. </li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a custodial or non-custodial wallet, assessing the security features is paramount. </p>
<p>For example, non-custodial wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask come with limited safety features. These wallets are only protected by a password. If the device that the wallet is stored on is compromised, the private keys would be hacked. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Custodial wallets like eToro offer many safety features &#8211; from two-factor authentication, regulation, and analytic behavior machine learning. On the flip side, investors are trusting a third party to look after their cryptocurrencies. This is much the same as trusting a bank to store money. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are many considerations to make when choosing the best crypto wallet for UAE investors. But overall, we found that the Best Wallet offers the ideal balance between safety, convenience, and features. </p>
<p>The Best Wallet can hold coins from multiple blockchains, it can swap them, and you can safely store your NFTs. With upcoming updates, you&#8217;ll get market insights and token analytics. Active Best Wallet users can get $BEST tokens airdropped in the future.  </p>

<h2><strong>Crypto Wallets Explained </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing a suitable crypto wallet is crucial. Investors will need to select a wallet that offers adequate security controls, a user-friendly interface, and convenient accessibility. In addition, investors will need to consider what features they seek from a wallet, such as being able to trade or stake tokens. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto wallets come with many different functions, but they are primarily used to store digital currencies. For example, consider an investor who buys Bitcoin from a crypto exchange in South Africa. Instead of trusting the exchange to keep the tokens safe, many investors will withdraw the funds to a private wallet. </p>
<p>In doing so, the investor can retain full control of their cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto wallets allow investors to send and receive funds. Transactions are conducted on a wallet-to-wallet basis and do not go through a centralized entity, such as a bank or e-wallet provider. Instead, wallet transactions are private and decentralized. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/bitcoin-3089728-1280.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Icon " /></figure>
<p>When sending funds to another person, the user will need the receiver&#8217;s wallet address. No two wallet addresses are the same. After confirming the transaction, it will be executed by the underlying network. </p>
<p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa come with additional features, allowing users to fully engage with the blockchain ecosystem. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, wallet providers like Best Wallet and Binance support trading. This means that users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies without leaving their wallet. </li>
<li>Providers like Trust Wallet and OKX come with staking tools, enabling users to earn passive income on their idle tokens. </li>
</ul>
<p>As we explain in more detail later, there are many different types of crypto wallets. For instance, non-custodial wallets provide users with their private keys. This means the user has full control of their crypto tokens. </p>
<p>Custodial wallets, on the other hand, remove the need to secure private keys. This is because the custodian will keep the crypto tokens safe on behalf of investors. Investors also need to consider their preferred device type, such as a mobile or desktop wallet. </p>
<h2><strong>Do You Need a Crypto Wallet? Key Reasons Explained </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are various reasons why a crypto wallet is crucial when investing in digital currencies. This is the case for both short and long-term traders. </p>
<p>Discussed below are the key benefits provided by the best crypto wallets in South Africa. </p>
<h3><strong>Safely Store Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are highly sought after by cybercriminals, due to their anonymous characteristics. Put otherwise, if an investor has their crypto tokens stolen remotely, the likelihood is that the funds will never be recovered. This is why wallets are so important, as they keep cryptocurrencies safe. </p>
<p>The level of security offered by a wallet will vary greatly. </p>
<p>For example, &#8216;cold&#8217; wallets are always offline, so offer the greatest security controls. &#8216;Hot&#8217; wallets are less secure as they are always connected to live servers. But hot wallets can still be protected by two-factor authentication and other security tools. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, crypto wallets allow South Africans to store wealth away from banks and other financial institutions. </p>
<h3><strong>Send and Receive Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>
<p>Wallets also allow users to transact, often without a centralized intermediary. Transactions are processed on a wallet-to-wallet basis via public addresses. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, suppose an investor wants to transfer some Bitcoin tokens to a family member. </li>
<li>After providing the receiver&#8217;s wallet address, the Bitcoin transaction should be confirmed by the blockchain in about 10 minutes. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the investor wishes to receive Bitcoin from another person, they would need to provide their unique wallet address. </p>
<h3><strong>Additional Features</strong></h3>
<p>The best crypto wallets for South African traders come with additional functionality. This removes the need to use third parties when engaging with the blockchain ecosystem. </p>
<ul>
<li>Some wallets allow users to swap tokens instantly. For example, swapping Bitcoin for Dogecoin without needing to use an exchange. </li>
<li>Earning passive income is also possible when using a top-rated wallet. The most common methods include staking and yield farming. </li>
<li>Many wallets are able to connect to Web3 applications. This includes decentralized exchange and lending platforms, offering a world of possibilities for South African investors. </li>
</ul>
<p>While security should be the main priority when choosing a wallet, investors should also explore what features are available. </p>

<p>Below, we rank and review the best crypto wallets in South Africa for 2023. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Best Wallet &#8211; The Overall Best Crypto Wallet for South African Traders and Investors</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">Best Wallet</a> is our top pick for the best crypto wallet in South Africa for 2023. This wallet offers multi-chain support, meaning you can hold tokens on the Ethereum, Polygon and BNB blockchains, and you can swap them between chains. The team plans to add Bitcoin blockchain in the future, which will make it the ultimate crypto wallet for storing your coins.</p>
<p>This solves one major issue for crypto investors. Instead of having multiple crypto wallets for each blockchain, you can store all your coins in one wallet. What&#8217;s more, the team will add NFT support, meaning you can hold your digital collectibles in your wallet or you can exchange them directly from your wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333531/best-wallet2.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Introduction" /></figure>
<p>Another useful feature is the Best DEX integration. This is a decentralized exchange that swaps your tokens. In addition, anyone with a crypto wallet can use the Best DEX as you don&#8217;t have to sign up. All it takes is to connect your wallet and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<p>Best Wallet and Best DEX users are eligible for the $BEST token drop, which is planned for Phase 6 of the wallet&#8217;s development.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333537/best-wallet-airdrop.jpg" alt="BEST Token Airdrop" /></figure>
<p>The $BEST token will be the ecosystem&#8217;s utility and governance token, meaning you can use it to vote in the Best Wallet governance or you can stake it to get benefits like feeless swaps.</p>
<p>You can now download the Best Wallet on your iOS and Android devices and use some of its features while new features are being built. In the future, the wallet will integrate market analysis, which comes with advanced price charts for the tokens you wish to trade. There will also be token analysis, where you can find trending tokens to buy or track investor sentiment for select tokens.</p>
<p>To put your mind at ease, Best Wallet comes with advanced security features such as two-factor authentication and PIN or biometrics unlocking, depending on your smartphone. So even if someone steals your phone, they won&#8217;t be able to access your crypto wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333538/bestwallet2.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Roadmap" /></figure>
<p>Overall, this is more than just a crypto wallet. It&#8217;s designed to be the ultimate Web3 hub where you can swap coins between chains, trade NFTs and monitor the crypto market all within a single mobile app.</p>
<p>Stay up-to-date with new information on the <a href="https://t.me/BestWeb3Official">Best Wallet Telegram</a> channel and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/BestWeb3_">Best Wallet on X</a> to get insights on feature releases and $BEST token airdrops. </p>

<h3><strong>3. eToro &#8211; Leading Crypto Wallet for South African Traders  </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/">eToro</a> covers all bases, including rock-solid security, usability, and a wide range of useful features. First and foremost, the eToro wallet is custodial. Put simply, this means that the provider keeps cryptocurrency tokens safe on behalf of South African investors. </p>
<p>eToro achieves this by keeping the majority of tokens in cold storage. Investors will need to set up two-factor authentication, ensuring that only the wallet owner has access to their Bitcoin account. What&#8217;s more, eToro is heavily regulated. It holds licenses in multiple jurisdictions, including the UK, the US, Australia, and Cyprus.  </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="343" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-134296" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1700567323-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-48-10.png" alt="eToro Money Crypto Wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1700567323-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-48-10.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1700567323-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-48-10-300x114.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1700567323-screen-shot-2023-11-21-at-11-48-10-768x293.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In addition to high security and regulation, eToro is the best crypto wallet for beginners. The wallet comes with a simple interface, and there is no requirement to safeguard private keys. The eToro wallet also makes it easy to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. This is because eToro doubles up as a regulated and low-cost exchange. </p>
<p>It supports more than 90 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and some of the best altcoins. This includes <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano, and BNB. The wallet connects directly to the eToro exchange, so there is no need to keep moving funds. eToro also supports fiat money payments, allowing South Africans to enter and exit the crypto markets with ease. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32.jpg" alt="eToro Daily Crypto Movers" /></figure>
<p>This includes support for local bank transfers, debit/credit cards, and a selection of e-wallets. South Africans are charged just 0.5% when depositing fiat money. This is an FX fee to convert ZAR to USD. eToro is also popular with long-term crypto investors that want to access the markets passively. </p>
<p>It supports copy trading, an innovative tool that allows users to replicate successful traders. For example, if the chosen trader buys Ethereum and sells a few days later at a 10% profit, the same position will be replicated in the user&#8217;s eToro wallet. It also supports smart portfolios, which consist of multiple cryptocurrencies that are handpicked and managed by the eToro team.       </p>

<p>In terms of accessibility, most traders use the eToro web wallet. It comes with all of the features discussed above and does not require any downloads or installations. eToro also offers a mobile wallet for iOS and Android. Users can transfer funds from the web wallet to the app at any time. This provides additional functionality, such as wallet-to-wallet transfers via the blockchain. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Ledger &#8211; Hardware Wallet for High Security and Flexibility Supporting 5500+ Cryptos</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger</u></a> stands out as a promising option for those prioritizing the highest level of security in crypto storage. </p>
<p>Started in 2014, it offers a range of hardware wallets designed to keep digital assets in cold storage, thus safeguarding them from online threats.</p>
<p>One of Ledger&#8217;s key strengths is its cold storage approach, which keeps your assets offline during transactions. </p>
<p>To initiate an outgoing transaction, you must confirm it on the Ledger device by entering a user-created PIN. A unique feature is the 24-word passphrase, which is your private key. Ledger also allows adding a 25th word, up to 100 characters, increasing security measures. </p>
<p>Even if someone gains access to your 24-word passphrase, they still can&#8217;t access your wallet without the 25th word. Moreover, the wallet can be remotely recovered if stolen.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-.jpg" alt="Ledger Hardware Wallet Webpage" /></figure>
<p>Ledger Live, the proprietary mobile and desktop app, improves user experience by providing an interface to monitor your crypto portfolio. </p>
<p>This application isn&#8217;t just a monitoring tool; it allows users to connect to third-party services like 1inch DEX, MoonPay, and Lido staking, among others, for better utility.</p>
<p>The Ledger wallet can connect to mobile and desktop devices via USB cable or Bluetooth. This is particularly significant in the case of the Ledger Nano X model, which offers Bluetooth connectivity, enabling transactions on smartphones without the need for cables.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" alt="Ledger Hardware Wallet Shop" /></figure>
<p>Ledger offers three primary products: Ledger Stax, Ledger Nano X, and Ledger Nano S Plus. Each product caters to different security needs and budget constraints. The Ledger Nano S Plus is the most affordable at $79.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has wide-ranging support for over 5,500 cryptos, covering networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, Monero, XRP, and Stellar.</p>
<p>Ledger also offers an extensive library of educational content, including tutorials and guides on staking coins, cloud mining, and more, making it a comprehensive platform for beginners and experienced crypto enthusiasts.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Trezor &#8211; Cold Wallet Device Aimed at Long-Term Crypto Investors   </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://trezor.io/">Trezor</a> is one of the best crypto wallets in South Africa for long-term investors. This is a cold wallet device that does not expose private keys to the internet. And hence, investors can rest assured that their cryptocurrencies cannot be hacked remotely. What&#8217;s more, even if the Trezor device is lost, damaged, or stolen &#8211; the funds can be recovered via the backup passphrase. </p>
<p>This is provided when the wallet is set up for the first time and should be written down and kept somewhere safe. Another safeguard is that cryptocurrencies can only leave the Trezor wallet when the PIN is entered on the device. Not only that but unlike its main competitor Ledger, the Trezor wallet is open source. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312863/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" alt="Compare Trezor Hardware Wallet Models" /></figure>
<p>This ensures that any potential vulnerabilities are made available to the crypto community. We also like that Trezor supports more than 1,200 cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchain standards. This includes everything from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Cardano to BNB. Trezor also allows investors to add custom tokens, as long as the underlying network is supported. </p>
<p>In terms of pricing, <a href="https://trezor.io/compare">there are two Trezor models to choose from</a>. The Trezor Model One costs $69 (about 1,300 ZAR), while the Model T retails for $219 (about 4,100 ZAR). The latter comes with additional features, such as an in-built staking tool and a more convenient touchscreen LCD pad. That said, the $69 model offers the same level of robust security as the premium version.       </p>

<h3><strong>6. Trust Wallet &#8211; Popular Non-Custodial Crypto Wallet Used by Over 60 Million People </strong></h3>
<p>Trust Wallet is popular with South Africans that prefer non-custodial storage. This means that only the wallet owner has access to the private keys. And hence, users can store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies without going through an intermediary. <a href="https://trustwallet.com/">Trust Wallet &#8211; which is used by over 60 million people</a>, is completely free to use. </p>
<p>It is available on multiple device types and operating systems. This includes a mobile app for Android and iOS, as well as a browser extension for Chrome and other web browsers.

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" alt="Trust Wallet Homepage" /></figure>

Trust Wallet also stores NFTs across multiple network standards. We also found that Trust Wallet is ideal for earning passive income on idle crypto tokens. </p>
<p>It comes with an in-built staking tool that supports many proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. This includes Tron, Tezos, Osmosis, Kava, and BNB. No staking fees are charged by Trust Wallet. Moreover, users can swap tokens via Trust Wallet without paying any fees.

<h3><strong>7. MetaMask &#8211; Top Decentralized Wallet for Storing ERC20 Tokens   </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> is an established crypto wallet used by over 30 million people globally. This is a decentralized wallet that will appeal to investors wanting to take custodianship over their cryptocurrencies. MetaMask does not ask for personal information, and it does not have access to the user&#8217;s password or private keys.</p>
<p>This allows South Africans to store their wealth away from centralized bodies. Although MetaMask does not support Bitcoin, it&#8217;s one of the best crypto wallets for storing ERC20 tokens. Any ERC20 token can be added to MetaMask via its unique contract address.

The Binance wallet is custodial, so users are not provided with their private keys. The wallet comes with a variety of security controls, including IP and device whitelisting. It also comes with two-factor authentication. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes,<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/how-and-why-assets-move-between-binance-wallets-4835275628753556476"> Binance operates both hot and cold wallets</a>. This provides an adequate balance between security and accessibility. Binance users can trade and store over 350 cryptocurrencies. This includes the most popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Cardano, Tether, USD Coin, and Solana. </p>

<p>There is no requirement to transfer funds from the wallet to access the Binance exchange. Thousands of trading markets are supported, with South African traders paying a commission of just 0.1%.

<h3><strong>9. OKX &#8211; Non-Custodial Wallet App Supporting Over 50 Blockchain Standards     </strong> </h3>
<p><a href="https://www.okx.com/web3">OKX</a> is a popular crypto exchange that also offers a non-custodial wallet. The wallet is decentralized and does not connect to the primary OKX wallet. There is no requirement to open an account, and only the wallet user has access to their private keys. The OKX wallet supports more than 50 blockchain standards. </p>
<p>This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. It also allows users to add custom tokens via the project&#8217;s contract address. In terms of security, users can activate <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/what-is-mpc/">MPC (Multi-Party Computation) security</a> via the OKX app. This means that there is no single point of failure, a major safeguard when keeping private keys secure.  </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315844/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-.jpg" alt="OKX Application Download" /></figure>
<p>Instead, the private keys are split into smaller segments and secured in multiple, unknown locations. This ensures that the OKX wallet remains safe against remote hacking attempts. The wallet is also secured with a backup passphrase. This will be needed if the user forgets their wallet PIN or the device is lost or stolen. </p>
<p>One of the best features of the OKX wallet is its bridge aggregator. This allows users to instantly swap tokens without leaving the wallet. It also allows users to earn income on idle tokens via staking and yield farming. These tools are integrated with over 200 decentralized exchanges, allowing OKX users to get the most competitive rates. </p>

<h3><strong>10. Coinbase &#8211; Global Crypto Exchange With a Secure Custodial Wallet     </strong> </h3>

It also offers premium security features. </p>
<p>For example, Coinbase accounts are protected by cold storage, two-factor authentication, and device whitelisting.

<h2><strong>Tips for Selecting the Best South Africa Bitcoin Wallet </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Investors should do lots of independent research when researching the best Bitcoin wallets in South Africa. This means assessing security, usability, supported coins, fees, and other important factors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still undecided on the best South Africa Bitcoin wallets? Read on for assistance on how to select the most suitable wallet in 2023. </p>
<h3><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>South African investors should consider the type of crypto wallet that is most preferable for their needs. </p>
<p>This begins with a choice between custodial or non-custodial storage. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custodial wallets</strong>: Investors have no access to their private keys. The <i>custodian</i> is responsible for keeping the crypto wallet safe.</li>
<li><strong>Non-custodial wallets</strong>: Private keys are provided when setting up the wallet. The <i>investor</i> is responsible for keeping the crypto wallet safe.  </li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s more, South Africans need to choose the device type to store their crypto wallet. </p>
<p>Mobile apps offer a great level of security and convenience. Another option is desktop or browser-based wallets. When opting for a software wallet, make sure the respective operating system is supported. </p>
<p>Those holding a large amount of cryptocurrencies might be more suited for a hardware or paper wallet. </p>
<h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3>
<p>Next, South Africans need to ensure their chosen cryptocurrencies are supported by the wallet. For example, while MetaMask is one of the best crypto wallets in South Africa &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t support Bitcoin, Cardano, or Solana. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315851/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-.jpg" alt="Crypto Tokens On eToro" /></figure>
<p>eToro, on the other hand, supports 90+ cryptocurrencies across many different networks. In addition to Bitcoin, Cardano, and Solana, this also includes Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, EOS, Dash, and Bitcoin Cash. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to choose a wallet that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and network standards. In doing so, investors can store their cryptocurrencies in the same place. </p>
<h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Most software wallets are free to use. This means there are no fees to store or receive cryptocurrencies. While GAS fees apply on outgoing transactions, the best crypto wallets in South Africa do not charge any markups. </p>
<p>Hardware wallets are not free. They must be purchased from the manufacturer, and prices will vary considerably. Investors should ensure that the cost price is justified, based on the value of their crypto portfolio. </p>
<p>For example, those investing very small amounts likely won&#8217;t want to buy the Trezor Model T &#8211; which retails for approximately 4,100 ZAR. </p>
<h3><strong>Extra Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa offer extra functionality, such as being able to trade tokens. This removes the need to use a third party when buying and selling cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>For example, the Best Wallet allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with a credit card, and they support multi-chain tokens. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333540/best-wallet.jpg" alt="Best Wallet App Download" /></figure>
<p>The Binance wallet is also great for additional features. It supports staking, savings accounts, yield farming, and leveraged trading. The latter includes futures and options. </p>
<p>We also like the OKX wallet, which bridges to over 200 exchanges. OKX users subsequently get the best interest rates when earning yields on idle tokens. </p>
<h3><strong>Security Controls</strong></h3>
<p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa offer a breakdown of what security controls are provided. </p>
<p>This might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP/Device Whitelisting</strong>: Additional security steps are needed when logging into the wallet from a new IP address or device. </li>
<li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication</strong>: The user will need to enter a unique code when logging in. This is either sent to the user via email or SMS. </li>
<li><strong>Cold Storage</strong>: Keeping cryptocurrencies in cold storage means the private keys remain away from live internet servers. This makes them practically impossible to hack remotely. </li>
<li><strong>Multi-Sig Permissions</strong>: Some crypto wallets offer multi-sig permissions. The user will need to verify outgoing transactions on multiple devices. </li>
<li><strong>MPC</strong>: MPC technology is offered by the OKX wallet. It splits the private key into multiple segments and stores each part in a unique location.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation</strong>: The best crypto wallets in South Africa are regulated. eToro holds licenses in multiple countries, including the US, the UK, Cyprus, and Australia. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How do Crypto Wallets Work? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking for some guidance on how crypto wallets <i>actually</i> work?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what South African investors need to know before getting started. </p>
<h3><strong>Wallet Addresses</strong></h3>
<p>Once a suitable wallet has been chosen, the investor will need to set it up. This will generate a new, unique wallet address. The wallet address allows the investor to receive cryptocurrencies from another location. </p>
<p>Think of it like an electronic funds transfer (EFT), which requires the sender to specify the receiver&#8217;s personal account number. The wallet address is safe to share with other people, as it simply allows the user to receive tokens via the blockchain. </p>
<p>Each blockchain network has its own wallet address standard. For example, <a href="https://ethereum.org/fi/guides/how-to-use-a-wallet/">Ethereum wallets always start with 0x</a>. Nevertheless, if the wrong wallet address is provided, the tokens will be sent to an incorrect location. This means the tokens will be unrecoverable. </p>
<h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3>
<p>If the investor opts for a non-custodial wallet, they will be provided with unique private keys when getting started. This is usually provided as a 12-word passphrase, but some wallets use a much longer combination. </p>
<p>Either way, private keys must never be shared with another person. Nor should they be kept on a device that connects to the internet. </p>
<p>If they end up in the wrong hands, the private keys will allow an unauthorized person to access the wallet. This is one of the most common reasons for crypto wallets being hacked remotely. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Custodial wallets do not provide users with their private keys. This is because the custodian is responsible for keeping the cryptocurrencies safe. Custodial wallets are popular with beginners, but investors should ensure the provider is regulated. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Wallet Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Software wallets are usually free to use. There are no fees to store or receive cryptocurrencies. But fees are charged when sending cryptocurrencies to another wallet. </p>
<p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa do not charge a markup on network fees. Instead, fees go directly to blockchain miners. </p>
<p>Fees are quoted in real-time and rise and fall based on network demand. </p>
<p>Crypto hardware wallets, however, are not free. Prices vary depending on the provider and model type. For example, Trezor charges $69 and $219 for its basic and advanced models. </p>
<h2><strong>What are the Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Once South African investors have chosen between a custodial or non-custodial wallet, the preferred device type should be considered. Wallets come as mobile apps, desktop software, browser extensions, and hardware devices. Investors should also consider whether they prefer a hot or cold wallet. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now discuss the main types of crypto wallets that are available to South Africans in 2023. </p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Some of the most popular crypto wallets in South Africa come as software. This includes desktop software for Windows, Max, and Linux. The software is installed on the desktop device and allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies via a laptop or PC. </p>
<p>Another option for desktop users is wallets that come as a browser extension. Some providers offer support for Chrome, Firefox, and other popular web browsers. </p>
<p>An even more convenient option is mobile wallet apps. This allows users to store cryptocurrencies on their smartphones. As such, this makes sending, receiving, and trading cryptocurrencies a breeze. </p>
<h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>A more secure option is to buy a Bitcoin hardware wallet. As noted above, prices will vary, with Trezor charging $69 for its basic device.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets come with the added benefit of cold storage. In simple terms, this means the cryptocurrencies and private keys are never exposed to live internet servers. </p>
<p>Safeguards are also in place to protect investors from physical theft. This is because cryptocurrencies can only leave the hardware wallet if the PIN is entered on the device itself.  </p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>We also found that paper wallets are increasingly becoming popular with South African investors. After generating a public address and private key, the user will print the credentials. </p>
<p>This keeps the wallet offline at all times. It is imperative that the paper wallet is kept somewhere safe. It is also important to ensure the paper wallet provider is legitimate and that private keys are encrypted when initially shown to the user. </p>
<p>Both paper and hardware wallets offer excellent security, but do make it cumbersome to send and trade cryptocurrencies.  </p>
<h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Get and Use a Bitcoin Wallet in South Africa</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We mentioned earlier that Best Wallet is the overall best crypto wallet in South Africa. In this section, we explain how to get started with this wallet in under five minutes. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Download the Best Wallet app</strong></h3>
<p>South African investors will first need to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">download the Best Wallet app</a> on the App Store or Google Play. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/bw7.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Application" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Open the Best Wallet App</strong></h3>
<p>First, you need to verify your email address. Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to secure your account with a two-factor authentication. If you want to, you can skip this step and activate this feature later.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/bw4.jpg" alt="Best Wallet 2FA Setup" /></figure>
<p>Whether you activate 2FA or not, you&#8217;ll be asked to set up a four-digit password. You can also enable biometrics to unlock your wallet if your smartphone supports this feature.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Now that we have secured the app, go ahead and create your first wallet. This will be your main wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. At this stage you can create multiple wallets and name them, for example, &#8220;Meme coin wallet&#8221; or &#8220;Storage&#8221; or whatever you want.</p>
<p>Choose a background color for each wallet. This will help you identify each wallet fast. </p>
<p>Tap &#8220;Continue&#8221; when ready.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333561/bw3.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Account Identifier" width="341" height="1921" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Your next step is to use the wallet to buy coins with a card or to send and receive tokens. You can swap the tokens you have as well. The more you use the wallet during this stage, the greater the odds of getting the $BEST token airdrop in Phase 6.</p>

<p>While varying levels of security are offered, crypto wallets are never 100% secure from hackers and scams. Moreover, investors need to take steps to protect their wallet credentials. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, custodial wallets remove the need for investors to secure their private keys. </li>
<li>But this isn&#8217;t to say that the wallet is immune to fraud. </li>
<li>On the contrary, investors should make use of two-factor authentication and any other safeguards offered by the custodian. </li>
<li>Coinbase, for instance, allows users to set up IP and device whitelisting. </li>
<li>This means an extra security step kicks in if the user attempts to access the wallet from a new IP address or device. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Security procedures will differ when opting for a non-custodial wallet. This is because there is no custodian to protect the investor&#8217;s cryptocurrencies. Instead, only the user has access to their private keys, meaning they must take full responsibility for keeping them safe. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-custodial wallets do not come with two-factor authentication or whitelisting. This is because there is no custodian sitting between the investor and their cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>That said, we like that the OKX wallet comes with MPC technology. This means that only a small segment of the private key is stored on the user&#8217;s device. The remaining segments are stored across multiple locations. </p>
<p>Some non-custodial wallets come with multi-sig permissions. This is a security tool that requires outgoing transfers to be confirmed on at least two devices. Just like MPC technology, this removes a single point of failure &#8211; making it challenging for remote hacks to succeed. </p>
<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Wallets ensure that South Africans can invest in the crypto market safely. While there are many crypto wallets in the market, we particularly like Best Wallet. </p>
<p>The Best Wallet can hold coins from various blockchains, it can seamlessly swap them, and you can store your NFTs in a single mobile app. Upcoming features include market insights and token analysis, which will make Best Wallet the ultimate Web3 crypto hub for your tokens. </p>

<h2>The Top Crypto Exchanges Reviewed</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We compared the best crypto exchanges, including features, pros and cons, and trading fees.</p>
<h3>1. MEXC &#8211; Overall Best Cryptocurrency Exchange With 0% Spot Fees and Over 1,000 Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC</a> is the overall best crypto exchange in 2023. With 0% spot trading fees and just 0.02% taker fee for futures trading (0% fee for limit orders), MEXC is ideal for crypto day traders. For comparison, Coinbase charges 0.4% maker and 0.6% taker fee for those with a 30-day trading volume of less than $10,000. This means that even if you trade $1,000 in a month, you&#8217;re saving $6 with MEXC, which you can use to buy more crypto.</p>
<p>Being a full-fledged crypto platform, you get advanced charting features with multiple indicators and drawing tools as well as order book view. You can also use TradingView charts if that&#8217;s what you prefer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-138327 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage.jpg" alt="MEXC homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage-768x434.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>That said, MEXC isn&#8217;t just focused on day traders and seasoned investors. Beginners are welcomed just as well. Aside from saving on fees, you can use the MEXC Savings feature to grow your crypto portfolio with low risk. For example, you can lock your USDT for up to 8.8% APR and your XRP for up to 6% APR.</p>
<p>This is similar to staking, meaning you lock your tokens for a certain period of time to earn rewards, except most of the coins on MEXC have a flexible lock, which you can unlock whenever you want.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="544" class="alignnone wp-image-138322 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701428720-mexc-savings.jpg" alt="MEXC savings" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701428720-mexc-savings.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701428720-mexc-savings-300x181.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701428720-mexc-savings-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Purchasing crypto with MEXC is easy; You can do so via bank transfer or SEPA, or you can use a credit and debit card. Alternatively, purchase crypto coins from someone else in a peer-to-peer manner. Some third-party payment processors like Moonpay and Mercuryo accept Google Pay and Apple Pay for direct crypto purchases.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the crypto space or how to trade, MEXC has a vast library of educational materials at your disposal. Aside from beginner guides, you can learn how to trade crypto futures and how to profit from it. And if you want professional traders to trade your funds, there&#8217;s copy trading feature available to MEXC customers.</p>

<h3>2. OKX &#8211; Best Crypto Exchange for Low Fees </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/en">OKK</a> offers many of the advanced features you’ll find on Binance but with even lower fees for limit orders. This could make OKX the best Bitcoin exchange if trading fees are your main consideration and you’re comfortable using an advanced trading platform. (OKX offers a demo account perfect for learning.) You’ll pay just 0.08% for limit orders while market orders parallel Binance’s trading fees at 0.1%. Also, like Binance, OKX has over 350 cryptocurrencies available, including BTC, ETH, and a host of newer tokens to discover.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="511" class="aligncenter wp-image-126912" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-1024x511.jpg" alt="okx bitcoin trading platform" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-1024x511.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-768x384.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced-1536x767.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019196-okx-advanced.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>One downside, however, is that OKX is not available in the US or Canada. Instead, traders in (northern) North America — and elsewhere — can use OKcoin, a sister exchange that serves over 190 countries and offers a simple trading interface. Trading fees on OKcoin come in slightly higher at 0.1% for limit orders and 0.2% for market orders, both of which are more affordable than Kraken or Coinbase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="415" height="502" class="aligncenter wp-image-126913" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019291-okcoin.jpg" alt="OKcoin buy bitcoin" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019291-okcoin.jpg 415w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019291-okcoin-248x300.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></p>
<p>The main exchange at OKX offers trading bots, which are programmable automated traders that buy and sell according to the rules you define. You’ll also find perpetual futures trading, a way to bet on the future price of a cryptocurrency without buying it, and a demo account so you can practice your trades or tune up your trading bots before you turn them loose in real-world trades.</p>

<h3>3. Binance &#8211; Best for Range of Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/binance/en">Binance</a> is the largest crypto exchange worldwide by trading volume, but whether you can use the platform depends on where you live in the world. US residents aren’t able to use the main exchange but can use Binance.US. Currently, Binance.US does not support bank deposits (crypto deposits only), which makes an otherwise easy-to-use exchange less beginner-friendly.</p>
<p>Traders from other areas of the world will find Binance.com offers basic trading with plenty of room to grow into advanced trading, including futures, leveraged trades, crypto loans, and much more. With over 350 cryptocurrencies available for trading, Binance offers one of the largest crypto selections in our roundup, giving you access to staples like BTC and ETH, as well as many lesser-known cryptocurrencies like RDNT or ARB.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-126909" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-1024x477.jpg" alt="binance trading chart BTC pair" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-1024x477.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-300x140.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-768x358.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade-1536x716.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019020-binance-advanced-trade.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>You’ll also find more trading on Binance pairs compared to many other exchanges. Above, you’ll see the RDNT/BTC trading pair. Many exchanges don’t offer smaller cryptocurrencies at all and BTC trading pairs are typically limited to very high-volume assets like UDST or ETH.</p>
<p>Binance offers more flexibility in trading, but like many other exchanges, much of the functionality revolves around the advanced trading platform rather than the instant buy boxes you’ll see throughout the site.</p>

<h3>4. Coinbase &#8211; Best Publicly Traded Crypto Exchange </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/en">Coinbase</a> dates back to 2012 and the exchange is currently the largest publicly traded exchange worldwide. Being a publicly traded company brings more transparency for users because Coinbase discloses its <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx"><u>SEC statements</u></a> and <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"><u>financial statements</u></a> to comply with regulatory requirements. Following the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/rise-fall-crypto-exchange-ftx-2022-11-10/"><u>collapse of FTX</u></a> in 2022, transparency has become more important than ever.</p>
<p>You’ll find over 250 cryptocurrencies available for trading on Coinbase, ranging from top assets like BTC and ETH to newly launched tokens. Coinbase is known for its user-friendly interface. However, Coinbase uses two trading platforms  — simple and advanced — which can add some complexity for newer traders. <img decoding="async" width="1024" height="486" class="aligncenter wp-image-126895" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-1024x486.jpg" alt="coinbase exchange trade crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-1024x486.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-768x364.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading-1536x729.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018593-coinbase-trading.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There’s also a third trading option called Coinbase One. With a $30 monthly subscription, traders can trade with no additional fees. Coinbase reports that subscribers save an average of $55 per month with Coinbase One.</p>
<p>Most new traders will gravitate toward Coinbase’s simple trades, which you can access through conveniently placed Buy &amp; Sell buttons throughout the site. While easy to use, it’s worth noting that simple trades come with higher fees, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/"><u>Coinbase’s fee structure</u></a> varies based on the amount of the trade as well as the funding source.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18.72px">5</span><span style="font-size: 16px">. eToro &#8211; Solid Crypto Brokerage For Social Trading </span></h3>
<p>Started in 2007 as a trading platform focused on transparency and ease of use, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> initially offered forex trading, letting users trade currencies easily. Over time, the platform added stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and then added cryptocurrency trading in 2017.</p>
<p>What started as a Bitcoin-only offering has grown to over 80 cryptocurrencies available for trading, including popular choices like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIBxM).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="631" class="aligncenter wp-image-126881" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview-1024x631.jpg" alt="etoro's crypto selection" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview-1024x631.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview-300x185.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview-768x474.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018071-etoro-overview.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>A simple search box at the top of the screen helps you discover new assets to trade, news stories, and posts from other traders, which leads to one of eToro’s strongest selling points: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/etoro/"><u>eToro Social Trading</u></a>.</p>
<p>You can follow posts from other investors (or share your own thoughts), but eToro also lets you copy the trades of other traders using their intuitively named Copy Trading. In the US, copy trading is currently limited to crypto trades (and cryptos supported in the US). Elsewhere in the world, you can copy trades for crypto, stocks, ETFs, and even commodities.</p>
<p>Just find a trader that interests you, and check their trading history — including long-term performance, risk level, and percentage of profitable weeks — and then click “copy.” You choose the investment amount for each copy trade, and you can also set a “stop loss” by choosing a level to exit the trade if the market turns south. <img decoding="async" width="634" height="704" class="aligncenter wp-image-126888" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018250-etoro-copy-trade.jpg" alt="etoro copytrading" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018250-etoro-copy-trade.jpg 634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018250-etoro-copy-trade-270x300.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></p>
<h4>eToro Trading Fees</h4>
<p>eToro uses a flat 1% trading fee for cryptocurrencies. Here’s how it works. For a $100 BTC purchase, you’ll pay $1 in trading fees. You’ll also pay 1% when you sell, which may be higher or lower than $1 based on the value when you close the position. For standard orders, you’ll buy at the ask price (and sell at the bid price), so you also pay a spread.</p>
<h4>Tradable Coins</h4>
<p>eToro offers over 80 cryptocurrencies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Shiba Inu (SHIBxM &#8211; SHIB in millions)</li>

<h3>6. Kraken &#8211; Best for Pro Trading Tools</h3>
<p>As one of the oldest crypto exchanges, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/en">Kraken</a> has earned a loyal following through transparency combined with low trading fees. Kraken was founded in 2011, just two years after Bitcoin came onto the scene as the first cryptocurrency. Now, this San Francisco-based exchange offers 200+ cryptocurrencies and provides trading services in nearly 200 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>This gives Kraken a wider footprint compared to Coinbase, which operates in just over 100 countries. Transparency has always been paramount with Kraken, and the company was the first to provide <a href="https://www.kraken.com/proof-of-reserves"><u>proof-of-reserves</u></a>, which is a blockchain-based method of proving that the company has the crypto it shows for your account. <img decoding="async" width="390" height="675" class="aligncenter wp-image-126900" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018809-kraken-simple-trade.jpg" alt="kraken exchange buy bitcoin" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018809-kraken-simple-trade.jpg 390w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018809-kraken-simple-trade-173x300.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" />  </p>
<p>Like Coinbase, Kraken offers both simple trades and advanced trading, with the latter being called Kraken Pro. Despite the Pro moniker, you can use Kraken’s advanced trading platform as a beginner or intermediate trader to enjoy lower fees and access advanced analytics at a glance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="496" class="aligncenter wp-image-126904" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-1024x496.jpg" alt="kraken pro trading dashboard" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-1024x496.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-300x145.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-768x372.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro-1536x744.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699018909-kraken-pro.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h4>Kraken Trading Fees</h4>
<p>Similar to Coinbase, Kraken offers two trading platforms. The simpler of these is called Instant Buy/Sell and brings higher trading costs. Instant Buy/Sell orders use a variable “display fee,” which you see on your details before you confirm, plus a spread that can vary based on market conditions. Like many simple buy boxes, it can be a pricier way to trade crypto.</p>
<p>The real trading-cost savings come from Kraken Pro, where you’ll pay just 0.26% for market orders and 0.16% for limit orders. This compares well against Coinbase Advanced where you’ll pay 0.8% or 0.6%, respectively. Watch out for higher fees on debit card transactions, however. <strong>Here are the fees we saw in sample trades for $100 worth of Bitcoin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instant Buy/Sell (bank transfer):</strong> $1.97</li>
<li><strong>Instant Buy/Sell (debit card):</strong> $5.42</li>
<li><strong>Kraken Pro (limit order): </strong>$0.16</li>
<li><strong>Kraken Pro (market order): </strong>$0.26</li>
</ul>
<p>Healthy trading volume combined with low fees help make Kraken one of the best bitcoin exchanges and crypto exchanges overall.</p>
<h4>Tradable Coins</h4>
<p>Kraken offers over 200 cryptocurrencies, including:</p>

<h3>7. Nexo &#8211; Popular for Crypto Lending &amp; Loans</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/nexo/en">Nexo</a> dates back to 2018. Since its launch, the Swiss-based crypto exchange has grown to over 6 million users in over 200 countries worldwide. With 60+ cryptocurrencies available for trading, you’ll find the most popular crypto assets, like BTC and ETH, as well as some that can be more difficult to find, like TRON (TRX)  and XRP. Nexo’s features parallel many of those you’re familiar with from banks.</p>
<p>In many regions (but not in the US), you can earn interest on your cryptocurrency held on the exchange. You can also easily borrow against your crypto holdings. Notably, Nexo also offers a credit/debit card you can use to access the value of your crypto.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="444" class="aligncenter wp-image-126939" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-1024x444.jpg" alt="nexo spot trading dashboard" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-1024x444.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-300x130.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-768x333.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro-1536x665.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019824-nexo-pro.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Fees are beginner-friendly, with no extra trading fees on Nexo’s main platform. Instead, Nexo uses a spread that’s included in the price. If you choose to use Nexo Pro, the advanced trading platform, you can buy without a spread with trading fees at 0.3% for limit orders, half the cost of Coinbase Advanced.</p>
<h4>Tradable Coins</h4>
<p>Nexo offers over 60 cryptocurrencies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>

<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>

<li>Avalanche (AVAX)</li>
<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>
<li>Apecoin (APE)</li>
<li>Basic Attention Token (BAT)</li>

<h3>8. Strike &#8211; Best Crypto App for No Trading Fees </h3>
<p>This one’s for the Bitcoin fans. With the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/strike/en">Strike</a> app, you can buy any crypto you want, as long as it’s Bitcoin. Built by Bitcoin HODLers for Bitcoin HODLers, Strike lets you put your BTC stacking on autopilot. Choose an investment amount and frequency and set up a payment method. Strike does the rest, delivering your Bitcoin to your Strike wallet on schedule with no fees. You can also buy BTC on demand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="500" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-126946" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019904-strike-buy-bitcoin-500x1024.jpg" alt="strike crypto exchange buy BTC" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019904-strike-buy-bitcoin-500x1024.jpg 500w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019904-strike-buy-bitcoin-146x300.jpg 146w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019904-strike-buy-bitcoin.jpg 706w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Like many other platforms, Strike makes its profit from the spread, but unlike on other platforms, there are no trading fees. You can even withdraw BTC from your Strike wallet to a self-custody Bitcoin wallet without network fees. Strike also functions as a payment app, letting you send money globally, but the Bitcoin network — and specifically Bitcoin’s Lightning network — is the wizardry behind the curtain.</p>
<p>The Lightning network is a second layer on the Bitcoin network that enables fast transactions for a fraction of the cost. Strike’s easy setup and no-fee structure might make it the best Bitcoin exchange for absolute beginners or Bitcoin-only investors. The downside, of course, is that if you want to buy other cryptos, like ETH, you have to look elsewhere. Strike is now <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/19/bitcoin-payments-app-strike-expands-to-65-countries-from-three/"><u>available in over 65 countries</u></a>.</p>

<h3>9. Bitstamp &#8211; No Fees for Low-Volume Traders</h3>
<p>Bitstamp’s fee structure makes it easy to get started with smaller investment amounts. If your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitstamp/en">Bitstamp</a> trading volume is under $1,000 per month, you’ll pay <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/fee-schedule/"><u>no trading fees</u></a> on the advanced platform. At $1,000 per month or less (based on trailing 30-day trading volume), limit order fees come in at 0.3%, which is lower than you’ll find on Coinbase Advanced, for example. Market orders in the same tier cost 0.40%.</p>
<p>There’s often a tradeoff to no-fee trades, and in this case, it’s withdrawal fees — which can get spendy. BTC withdrawal fees, for instance, are 0.005 BTC, or about $13 at today’s BTC price. If you’re taking advantage of Bitstamp’s no-fee trades at lower volume, it might be best to let your position build up before withdrawing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="967" height="754" class="aligncenter wp-image-126949" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019992-bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro.jpg" alt="bitstamp exchange welcome page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019992-bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro.jpg 967w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019992-bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro-300x234.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699019992-bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro-768x599.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></p>
<p>The platform offers both a simple interface and an advanced interface. Advanced trading gives you more control over your trade, whereas the simple interface offers a welcoming way to start buying crypto.</p>

<h3>10. Gemini &#8211; Well-Regulated Exchange with Perpetual Futures and Low Fees</h3>
<p>Founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/gemini/en">Gemini</a> has grown to become one of the top crypto exchanges due largely to its commitment to security. In addition to being a leading exchange, Gemini is also a leading crypto custody provider. The company was the first to earn both SOC 1 Type and SOC 2 Type 2 certifications, which are measures of financial reporting integrity and customer data security, respectively.</p>
<p>Like Coinbase and several other exchanges, you can choose from either a simple trading interface called Gemini or an advanced trading platform called Active Trader. Also like other exchanges, you’ll find the lowest trading fees on the advanced platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="470" class="aligncenter wp-image-126951" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020098-gemini-active-trader.png" alt="Gemini Active Trader" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020098-gemini-active-trader.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020098-gemini-active-trader-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020098-gemini-active-trader-768x353.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Trading fees on Gemini’s Active Trader platform are affordable and straightforward. Gemini Active Trader Fees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit order: 0.2%</li>
<li>Market order: 0.4%</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features include perpetual futures trading, which lets you speculate on the future price of key assets like BTC without owning the asset, and a peer-to-peer trading platform that lets you trade with other willing traders with no intermediary. Due to regulations, perpetual futures are not available in some markets, including the US.</p>
<h4>Tradable Coins</h4>
<p>Gemini offers over 100 cryptocurrencies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>

<h3>11. Crypto.com &#8211; Popular Mobile-First Exchange</h3>
<p><a href="https://crypto.com/">Crypto.com</a> lives up to its name by making 250+ cryptocurrencies available to trade on its platform. What’s different about Crypto.com is that it’s a mobile-first exchange. The web app offers only limited functionality and serves as a way to learn about the features of the mobile app, which has a Play Store user rating of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">4.5 out of 5 stars</a>.</p>

<h2>What is a Cryptocurrency Exchange?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A crypto exchange is a marketplace where you can buy cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, with traditional (fiat) currencies, like the USD or GBP. Exchanges work like on ramps, a way to convert your fiat money into crypto and back again if you decide to sell. A crypto exchange or platform also acts as an intermediary, a go-between that allows buyers and sellers to transact without ever meeting, much like a stock exchange.</p>
<p>Full-featured exchanges like Binance or OKX also allow you to trade one cryptocurrency for another using trading pairs (trade this for that). For instance, you may want to trade some ETH (Ether from the Ethereum blockchain) for BTC (Bitcoin).</p>
<p>If there’s a trading pair on the exchange, you can trade one for the other, adjusting your crypto portfolio in one trade. Some platforms don’t offer everything you’ll find on an exchange, however, meaning you may not be able to trade one crypto for another.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>Crypto Exchanges vs. Crypto Brokers</h4>
<p>Both crypto exchanges and crypto brokers provide a way to trade cryptocurrencies. There are differences going on behind the scenes, however. Exchanges use an order book, a list of open buy and sell orders. You’re buying and selling against existing orders placed by other traders or market makers. If you use an advanced trading platform on an exchange like Kraken, you can see these orders.</p>
<p>Crypto brokers, on the other hand, are intermediaries between traders and the market. Brokers are in the middle of the transaction and you’re really buying from or selling to the broker rather than other traders. The broker then fills the buy or sell order through market makers and orders placed by other traders.</p>
<p>Crypto trading platforms also offer basic crypto storage. The exchange or platform provides a built-in crypto wallet called a custodial wallet that you can access with your account login. The details above all refer to centralized exchanges, trading platforms run by a company and often regulated by local governments. There’s another type of exchange called a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm"><u>decentralized exchange</u></a> (DEX) run by computer programs on the blockchain.</p>
<p>DEXs let users swap crypto directly from their crypto wallets. We’ll focus on the best centralized exchanges in this guide. A third (and less common) type of crypto exchange, called a P2P or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm"><u>Peer-to-Peer exchange,</u></a> allows buyers and sellers to transact directly.</p>
</div></div>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Exchange Fees</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>You can often avoid deposit fees by linking a bank account and depositing to your trading account from your bank account. Debit card transactions often come with additional fees of up to 4%. But there are some other fees to understand as well.</p>
<h3>Trading Fees</h3>
<p>We’ll discuss fees for specific types of trades in more detail in a bit, but crypto trading fees can come in several forms, depending on the platform and the type of trade.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed fees and simple trading fees:</strong> Many exchanges and platforms use a specific fee structure for trades that use a simple buy/sell widget as opposed to an advanced trading platform. Often, you’ll pay a fixed fee, which varies based on the transaction amount. The fee schedule may convert to a percentage-based fee as the transaction value crosses a certain threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Maker and taker fees:</strong> Advanced trading platforms use a maker/taker fee schedule, with the fee percentage typically driven by your 30-day trading volume. Placing a fixed price limit order maker you a “maker” because you’re making a market for other traders. “Takers” take liquidity off the market by trading against existing limit orders with a (buy at) market order. Take orders usually cost more in trading fees compared to maker orders.</li>
<li><strong>Spread fees:</strong> The spread generally refers to the difference in price between the highest-priced limit buy order and the lowest-price limit sell order. Exchanges may use a spread fee as the trading fee itself or in addition to a simple trading fee.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Withdrawal Fees</h3>
<p>Like trading fees, withdrawal fees come in more than one type.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiat withdrawal fees:</strong> Some exchanges charge a fee to withdraw your money from the exchange. If the exchange uses a fixed dollar amount for a fee, waiting until you can withdraw a larger amount reduces the cost of the withdrawal fee as a percentage of the withdrawal amount.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto withdrawal fees:</strong> If you withdraw crypto from an exchange by sending it to another wallet, you’ll pay a network fee. These fees vary by cryptocurrency type and the network to which you withdraw. For example, withdrawing ETH on the Ethereum network may cost several dollars depending on network activity. However, if you withdraw ETH on the Abitrum network, you’ll pay pennies rather than dollars. The size of the transaction does not affect network fees, but some platforms may charge a fixed withdrawal fee for crypto transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do Crypto Trading Platforms Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We discussed crypto exchanges as a marketplace to buy crypto with fiat money, such as USD or GBP, for example. Larger exchanges typically attract more buyers and sellers, making the pricing for common cryptos like Bitcoin competitive with the price elsewhere. For creating this marketplace and transferring crypto between buyers and sellers, the exchange typically charges a fee on trades.</p>
<p>However, you may find some platforms that don’t charge a trading fee. Generally, those platforms make money on the spread instead, which we’ll discuss in a bit. To comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations, many exchanges also require proof of identity. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges.htm"><u>Some exchanges don’t require KYC</u></a>, however. Typically, these include decentralized and P2P exchanges.</p>
<h3>How Crypto Trades Work</h3>
<p>Mechanically, there’s a lot going on under the hood of a cryptocurrency trading platform. Beginner-friendly platforms like MEXC obscure the complicated mechanics, giving you a simple trading interface and fee structure, especially when purchasing crypto directly with a card or Apple and Google Pay.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="541" class="alignnone wp-image-138349 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="MEXC buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>On MEXC, you can buy crypto like Bitcoin with USD. The spot market on MEXC as well as on other exchanges, like OKX or Coinbase Advanced, show more of what’s going on behind the scenes, including the ever-changing order book and executed orders flashing in real time.</p>
<p>The order book is at the heart of any exchange. As the name suggests, it’s a list of open orders. You’ll see sell orders stacked on top and buy orders listed at the bottom. These are all limit orders, meaning the trader sets a fixed price for the order. These are also called “maker” orders because the traders are making a market with their orders. Without maker orders, there are no trades because there’s no one to buy from or sell to, at least not visibly. As the market-making heroes of the story, maker orders typically earn lower trading fees.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="844" class="aligncenter wp-image-126955" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-1024x844.jpg" alt="coinbase crypto order book spread" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-1024x844.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-300x247.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-768x633.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade-1536x1265.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020396-coinbase-advanced-trade.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In the screenshot of Coinbase Advanced above, you’ll also see the spread ($0.68) right above the limit buy orders and below the limit sell orders in the order book. Often, the spread on BTC is just $0.01 between the lowest-priced sell order (called the ask) and the highest-priced buy order (called the bid). However, spreads can be wider depending on which orders are open. On cryptocurrencies that don’t trade often or on low-volume exchanges, you can sometimes see much wider spreads.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>Spreads as Trading Fees</h4>
<p>Some platforms and exchanges use the spread as their fee, rather than charging a trading fee, while others might charge both a trading fee and a spread fee. Also, sometimes, a spread isn’t a spread as we described earlier.</p>
<p>Instead, the spread may be a fixed percentage fee, as seen with Coinbase’s simple trades. With Coinbase simple trades, you’ll pay a trading fee plus a 1% “spread.” Exchanges may use spread fees to lock in a price for your trade because ask prices can change quickly.</p>
</div></div>
<p>When you buy or sell without setting a price, it’s called a market order. You’re buying from or selling to other traders who placed limit orders on the exchange. Another name for a market order is a “taker” order because you’re taking liquidity provided by the maker orders in the order book. In the example below, if you wanted to buy 1 BTC, you could place a fixed-price limit order, which may or may not fill, or you could buy with a market order.</p>
<p>None of the existing orders offer one full BTC, however, so your order would fill from the bottom of the list and move up in price until you fill your order for 1 BTC. This is called slippage; the order slips into the next order in the order book, changing the average price for your order.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="1014" class="aligncenter wp-image-126956" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-1024x1014.jpg" alt="coinbase crypto order book slippage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-1024x1014.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-300x297.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book-768x761.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020495-coinbase-order-book.jpg 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>You’ll also pay a bit more for the market order on many exchanges due to higher fees for taker orders. For example, Coinbase Advanced charges 0.6% on maker orders but 0.8% on taker orders.</p>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>The Role of Market Makers in Crypto</h4>
<p>Odds are good that many of the orders you see in an exchange order book are from market makers rather than individual buyers and sellers. Market makers are people or companies that keep an inventory of an asset ready to sell (and cash ready to buy) while making a profit from the difference between the buy and sell price.</p>
<p>This parallels the role of market makers on stock exchanges, where they fill a similar role: reducing spreads and providing liquidity (making a ready trading market available). Typically, market makers earn a very small percentage on the asset they trade, making their profits from volume rather than margin.</p>
</div></div>
<h3>How Crypto Storage Works on Exchanges</h3>
<p>Once you’ve made your trade, the exchange holds your crypto for you. Technically, your crypto is in a crypto wallet controlled by the exchange called a custodial wallet. Crypto wallets work a lot like mailboxes.</p>
<p>You can send things from an address or receive things at an address. In this case, it’s crypto rather than bills and postcards. Unlike a mailbox, where your mail is hidden from view, the whole world can see the transactions in your crypto wallet, as shown in the transaction below from <a href="https://etherscan.io/"><u>Etherscan</u></a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="104" class="aligncenter wp-image-126960" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-1024x104.jpg" alt="etherscan history transaction hash" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-1024x104.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-300x31.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-768x78.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan-1536x156.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020582-etherscan.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The good news is that it’s unlikely that the average blockchain detective knows your wallet address belongs to you. For many traders, this custodial arrangement with exchanges works well. The exchange provides custody for your crypto and you use your login to access your account. As your crypto balance grows, however, or if you want to do things with your crypto, you may want to research the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm"><u>best crypto wallets</u></a> so you can self-custody your crypto.</p>
<h2>How to Choose the Best Crypto Exchange</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Whether you’re looking for the best crypto exchanges for beginners, the best bitcoin trading platform, or the best crypto trading platform for advanced traders, there are several factors to weigh. Features, fees, and safety all play important roles when choosing a platform that fits your trading needs and that won’t break the bank with surprise fees. Of course, it’s also essential to choose a platform that won’t disappear tomorrow, especially as your balance grows.</p>
<h3>Regulation/Licenses</h3>
<p>Much of the crypto industry remains unregulated, but some exchanges and trading platforms have taken steps to register with regulators and obtain licenses to operate in certain jurisdictions. For example, eToro operates in over 140 countries throughout the world and <a href="https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/regulation-license/"><u>is regulated in several larger trading markets</u></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>US: FINRA, SEC</li>
<li>UK: FCA</li>
<li>Australia: ASIC</li>
<li>Europe: CySEC</li>
</ul>
<p>Regulatory oversight offers an extra safeguard for investors that helps ensure cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto trading platforms follow regulations and conform to best practices. However, where each company is licensed or regulated matters. Exchanges often do business under different business units in various parts of the world. If you live in the UK, but the company is regulated in another country, UK safeguards may not apply. Ideally, look for exchanges that are regulated in your country or region.</p>
<p>Recently, the FCA named dozens of exchanges that it says are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-09/huobi-kucoin-among-crypto-firms-added-to-uk-fca-s-warning-list"><u>promoting financial services without the FCA’s permission</u></a>. While this, in itself, doesn’t make the named exchanges unsafe, it does illustrate regulatory risk. Exchanges that come under fire from regulators can be forced to change the business dramatically, as happened with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101"><u>Binance.US and the SEC</u></a>, or may even fall into insolvency, as happened with FTX (also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219"><u>charged by the SEC</u></a>).</p>
<h3>Available Cryptos</h3>
<p>Most exchanges offer BTC and ETH, which together represent about 70% of the total crypto market cap. Bitcoin alone represents about 50% of the market and often moves the rest of the market with its ebbs and flows. But you might not find the latest crypto that people are talking about on social media on some of the most popular exchanges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="623" class="alignnone wp-image-138356 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431984-mexc-spot-market.jpg" alt="MEXC spot market" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431984-mexc-spot-market.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431984-mexc-spot-market-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431984-mexc-spot-market-768x532.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>MEXC offers over 1,000 cryptos worldwide, whereas Binance and OKX offer over 350 each. If if you have your sights set on a particular cryptocurrency that’s only available at a few exchanges, that’s likely to drive your decision.</p>
<h3>Trading Fees and Additional Fees</h3>
<p>Many exchanges offer competitive fees if you use the advanced platform. However, the advanced platforms often look like a hacker’s terminal, with numbers flashing in green and red and trades whooshing by. It’s not a welcoming place for beginners. By contrast. simpler trading platforms often come with higher fees.</p>
<p>For example, using Coinbase’s simple trades will rack up $3.84 in fees to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin. By comparison, MEXC, costs $0 for the same $100 buying transaction on the spot market. Weigh trading fees in the context of how you’ll use the platform. Low fees for advanced trading don’t mean much if you think you’ll only use the simple trading interface.</p>
<h3>Crypto Wallet</h3>
<p>Centralized crypto exchanges and trading platforms offer a built-in crypto wallet, but it’s not always obvious. In short, the exchange holds your crypto in a crypto wallet that they control. You access your funds through your account login. Many exchanges also offer a separate wallet that allows you to send and receive supported cryptocurrencies or move cryptocurrencies off the platform. For example, Coinbase offers Coinbase Wallet, which supports Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs using a mobile app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="511" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-126965" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020789-coinbase-crypto-wallet-511x1024.jpg" alt="coinbase crypto wallet dashboard" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020789-coinbase-crypto-wallet-511x1024.jpg 511w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020789-coinbase-crypto-wallet-150x300.jpg 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699020789-coinbase-crypto-wallet.jpg 694w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" /></p>
<p>Coinbase Wallet can be more complicated to set up, though, compared to simpler wallets like eToro’s wallet, called eToro Money, or the Strike app, which serves as a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. Some traders never need or want a separate crypto wallet, although two benefits of crypto wallets merit consideration. Crypto wallets allow you to store your crypto in a wallet you control.</p>
<p>The custodial exchange wallets on FTX were controlled by FTX. Customers who held balances on the exchange are now <a href="https://time.com/6236610/ftx-account-holders-money-back/"><u>unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy process</u></a>. Crypto wallets allow you to put your crypto to use elsewhere. Crypto held on an exchange usually doesn&#8217;t do much. The price goes up and down, but you often can’t use it to earn a yield. However, ETH, for example, can be moved off the exchange and used in decentralized finance  (DeFi) applications like Lido or Balancer to earn yield with your crypto. The availability of a crypto wallet with the platform’s branding is of lesser importance than the ability to move your crypto off the platform to a crypto wallet of your choosing.</p>
<h3>Trading Tools &amp; Features</h3>
<p>Consider which tools you’re likely to use when trading. OKX and Binance both offer trading bots, for example, which are rules-driven digital traders that work for you 24-7. You may not need these digital gizmos, but you might want access to advanced charts like the customizable TradingView charts on MEXC. And there isn’t always one answer. You might use OKX for its trading bots or Strike for its Bitcoin DCA, while also using MEXC for its copy trading, which lets you copy money-making traders trade-for-trade.</p>
<h3>Available Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Sometimes, how you can pay for trades (and the fees for those payments) makes all the difference. MEXC supports bank deposits and cards. Coinbase also supports all these payment methods plus PayPal deposits. Generally, bank transfers are the cheapest way to fund your trading account.</p>
<h3>Reputation and Customer Service</h3>
<p>Overall, crypto exchanges have a pretty spotty record when it comes to customer service. Check a rating site like Trustpilot before you make a move. But bear in mind that, like the insurance industry and many other financial services, the crypto industry tends to garner low customer satisfaction ratings. Coinbase, for example, has a <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/coinbase.com"><u>1.5 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. Binance isn’t much higher with its <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/binance.com"><u>2.1 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. These are two of the largest crypto exchanges on the planet. eToro is the standout in this group with an impressive <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.etoro.com"><u>4.4 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. Also, look for ways you can reach out if you have a question or problem. Many platforms offer chat or email support. A handful, like Coinbase, offer a customer service phone number.</p>
<h3>Mobile App</h3>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/"><u>60% of internet traffic</u></a> happens on mobile devices now, so a full-featured mobile app becomes a must for many traders. Both MEXC and Coinbase offer mobile apps that closely match the trading experience you’ll find on the desktop app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="398" class="alignnone wp-image-138359 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432207-mexc-mobile-app.jpg" alt="MEXC mobile app" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432207-mexc-mobile-app.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432207-mexc-mobile-app-300x133.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432207-mexc-mobile-app-768x340.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Strike, on the other hand, is a mobile-first app, although there’s also a Chrome extension available. Check the App Store or Play Store ratings for the exchanges you’re considering if you think you’ll be accessing your trading account with a phone or tablet.</p>
<h2>Are Cryptocurrency Exchanges Legal?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto exchanges are legal in many parts of the world, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, but it’s important to note that they’re unregulated, meaning the chances of being covered by financial compensation schemes are very slim. However, centralized trading platforms are subject to certain regulations that share a common theme.</p>
<p>In the US, for example, exchanges fall under the scope of the <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html"><u>Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</u></a>, which focuses on anti-money laundering (AML) and similar financial crimes. If you’ve ever wondered why you need to prove your identity before you can trade, AML and KYC (<a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/meaning-kyc"><u>Know Your Customer)</u></a> banking standards are at the heart of this requirement.</p>
<h3>US Cryptocurrency Laws</h3>
<p>In the US, cryptocurrencies fall under the purview of the SEC if they are securities. A security refers to a financial instrument in which there is an investment of money and in which the expected profits are due to the actions of someone else. For example, if you buy TSLA stock, your expected returns are based on the actions of Tesla’s management and workers. TSLA is a security.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies don’t all share this third-party element, although the topic is a source of constant controversy with the SEC. The agency <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102"><u>sued Coinbase in 2023,</u></a> alleging the sale of unregistered securities, one of many such lawsuits. Complicating the crypto scene in the US further, each of the US states has its own laws and licensing requirements. As a result, many crypto exchanges that operate in the US don’t operate in all 50 states.</p>
<h3>UK Cryptocurrency Laws</h3>
<p>Trading crypto is legal in the UK, but <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-bill-2022-factsheets/fact-sheet-cryptoassets-technical"><u>exchanges that operate in the UK must register with the FCA</u></a> and comply with AML rules such as proof-of-identity requirements. The FCA also introduced <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-introduces-tough-new-rules-marketing-cryptoassets"><u>new rules regarding crypto marketing</u></a> designed to protect new investors.</p>
<h3>Australia Cryptocurrency Laws</h3>
<p>Crypto trading platforms operating in Australia <a href="https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/your-industry/digital-currency-cryptocurrency/digital-currency-exchange-providers"><u>must register with AUSTRAC</u></a>, the country’s anti-money laundering authority. This brings with it the familiar identity verification requirements we see on most centralized exchanges. Exchanges also fall under the purview of the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/"><u>Australian Securities and Investments Commission</u></a> (ASIC), Australia’s equivalent of the SEC in the US.</p>
<h3>Canada Cryptocurrency Laws</h3>
<p>In Canada, regulators see crypto assets as securities, a distinction still open to debate in the neighboring US. Like other securities, including stocks, cryptocurrencies are legal in Canada, although the country has enacted tougher rules regarding trading limits, prompting exchanges like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-will-proactively-withdraw-canada-2023-05-12/"><u>Binance to leave the Canadian market</u></a>. The <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/"><u>Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)</u></a> oversees crypto trading in Canada. While trading cryptocurrencies is legal in many countries, it’s prudent to stay up-to-date on the regulatory climate where you live, as well as which crypto exchanges may encounter trouble with local regulators. After the SEC sued Binance, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/banks-to-cut-off-binance-access-to-us-banking-system-exchange-says.html"><u>US-only exchange lost its banking partners</u></a>, causing temporary chaos in trading for USD-based trading pairs on the platform as there was no easy way to take USD off the exchange.</p>
<h2>Are Crypto Exchanges Safe to Use?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>No exchange or trading platform is 100% safe to use, but there are ways to reduce your risk. There’s also a possibility of outsized gains that might make the risk worth taking. Between 2011 and 2021, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-vastly-outperformed-gold-and-sp-500-over-the-past-decade"><u>Bitcoin rewarded investors with more than 437,000% returns</u></a>. First, it’s important to understand that there’s no government insurance available.</p>
<p>The exception is pass-through insurance available on cash balances on platforms like eToro and Coinbase. In both cases, US customers enjoy pass-through FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) on cash balances of up to $250,000. However, crypto assets are not covered by FDIC insurance or any similar program. This theme is carried throughout the crypto industry.</p>
<p>For example, eToro (UK) carries <a href="https://www.etoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Insurance-Disclosure-to-Clients-17.11.2020.docx.pdf"><u>Excess of Loss insurance</u></a>, which safeguards investors against broker insolvency. However, this policy excludes real cryptocurrencies. That doesn’t mean there’s no insurance at all. Coinbase carries a policy that <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured"><u>insures against platform breaches</u></a>. But generally, your crypto assets are uninsured. By choosing a platform that’s regulated in major markets, such as eToro, Coinbase, Kraken, or Bitstamp, you’ll have government regulators as allies, a set of well-trained eyes watching over the exchange.</p>
<p>You can also look for crypto trading platforms that offer proof-of-reserves (POR) to verify the platform has your crypto. Kraken and OKX both offer POR. Lastly, if you trade in size or as your account grows, you can consider moving your crypto to a self-custody wallet like MetaMask (Ethereum) or Electrum (Bitcoin). It comes down to the old adage about eggs and baskets. Moving some crypto off the exchange can reduce your risk if the exchange runs into trouble.</p>
<h2>Types of Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and brokers like eToro represent the most common way to buy crypto with traditional currencies. But what is a centralized exchange, and what is the alternative?</p>
<h3>Centralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>A centralized exchange (CEX) is a crypto trading platform run by a company that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Coinbase may be the most well-known example. When you trade on Coinbase, you’re not trading directly with another trader. Instead, you’re buying or selling against on order book, a list of open fixed-priced orders on the exchange.</p>
<p>Centralized exchanges offer a convenient way to convert fiat money, like USD or GBP, to cryptocurrency or to sell crypto for fiat currencies. But centralized exchanges also offer custodial storage, meaning they can hold your crypto for you on the exchange. Similarly, centralized exchanges typically offer ways for you to take your crypto off the exchange. Centralization makes is easier to establish fiat on-ramps and off-ramps.</p>
<p>In many cases, it also means the exchange may be subject to regulation in many jurisdictions. One potential downside, however, is that the exchange controls your crypto wallet on the exchange. They have the ability to pause or freeze withdrawals.</p>
<h3>Decentralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>Where centralized exchanges are run by management teams, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is run by software called smart contracts. A smart contract is a computer program on the blockchain that users can interact with to perform various transactions. Instead of an order book, decentralized exchanges typically use liquidity pools.</p>
<p>Crypto investors can deposit one or more types of crypto into a liquidity pool, and this pool and other traders use the pool to swap crypto A for crypto B. Decentralized exchanges let you trade from within your own crypto wallet, so you don’t have to deposit your crypto before making a swap. Swap fees typically come in low as well, often at 0.3% or lower. To make swaps on a decentralized exchange, though, you’ll need crypto to swap. In many cases, you can buy crypto through a third-party provider partnered with the DEX. Fees can be higher than using a centralized exchange, however.</p>
<p>Many traders buy on centralized exchanges and then transfer the crypto to a self-custody wallet where they can use their crypto for swaps, to provide liquidity (and earn trading fees), or in several other ways. The most popular decentralized exchanges, including Uniswap and Balancer, run on the Ethereum network. Many also support Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum or Polygon.</p>
<h2>Buy Crypto Within Cash and Payment Apps</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Sometimes, the best crypto exchanges aren’t exchanges at all. Several payment apps, including Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, provide a convenient way to buy popular cryptocurrencies. You won’t find a massive selection of hundreds of choices, however. But if you’re primarily interested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other cryptos, you may not need to learn a new platform. You can build your stack with an app you may already use daily.</p>
<h3>Cash App</h3>
<p>Cash App offers Bitcoin as its only crypto option, but the popular payment platform also offers over 1,800 stocks and exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin trading fees on Cash App come in higher than you’ll find on an advanced trading platform like Coinbase Advanced or Gemini Active Trader but compare well with user-friendly platforms like Coinbase’s simple trades. For example, to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Cash App, you’ll pay $2.25 in fees. Using Coinbase’s simple trades, you’d pay $3.84 for the same purchase amount. <a href="https://cash.app/help/3103-bitcoin-fees">Cash App Bitcoin fees</a> range from 0.75% to 3%, depending on the transaction amount. Cash App also provides a Bitcoin wallet, so you can send or spend your Bitcoin or move it to another crypto hardware wallet if needed.</p>
<h3>PayPal</h3>
<p>With a few more cryptocurrencies available, PayPal offers another way to buy popular crypto assets like Bitcoin. In total, PayPal offers five options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
<li>Bitcoin Cash</li>
<li>Ethereum</li>
<li>Litecoin</li>
<li>PayPal USD (PYUSD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Like Cash App, PayPal lets you withdraw your crypto to a separate crypto wallet. PayPal used a fixed fee schedule to purchase crypto in amounts of $200 and under. At the lowest tier (up to $4.99), you’ll pay $0.49. The cost to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin falls into the highest fixed fee tier at $2.49, or about 2.5%. Above $200, fees range from 1.5% to 1.8%. PayPal supports crypto purchases for personal accounts but disables the feature for business accounts.</p>
<h3>Venmo</h3>
<p>PayPal owns Venmo, and now both platforms offer the same lineup of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Crypto buying and selling fees parallel PayPal as well, with both platforms using a fixed fee schedule for purchases up to $200. A purchase for up $100 worth of Bitcoin costs $2.49 on Venmo. Similar to Cash App, you’ll need to use the mobile app to buy and sell crypto, however. The web app for both platforms offers limited functionality.</p>
<h2>How do Crypto Exchange Fees Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Earlier in the guide, we discussed limit orders, market orders, and spreads. Here’s how they all come together to determine crypto exchange fees.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commission:</strong> Brokers like eToro charge a commission, which is another name for a trading fee. The difference, in eToro’s case, for example, is that the commission is a fixed percentage of the order and does not change based on trading volume.</li>
<li><strong>Trading fees:</strong> Exchanges like OKX charge a trading fee based on the value of the trade and your trading volume (usually looking at a 30-day history). These trading fees might also differ depending on whether you place a market order or a limit order.</li>
<li><strong>Market orders</strong> (also called taker orders) mean you’re buying at market price from the existing orders in the order book. On many exchanges, you’ll pay a higher fee for market orders compared to limit orders (up next).</li>
<li><strong>Limit orders</strong> (also caller maker orders) mean you’re placing an order at a fixed price. These orders sit on the order book until there’s a match or a market order in the price range of your order. You’ll usually pay a lower fee for limit orders, but there’s also a chance that your buy or sell order might not be filled if the market price is too far away.</li>
<li><strong>Spreads: </strong>A spread refers to the price difference between the lowest price limit sell order and the highest price limit buy order. On busy exchanges and with high-volume cryptos like BTC, the spread is often just $0.01. However, we showed a screenshot earlier where the spread was $0.68. For BTC, which trades at over $26,000 currently, that $0.68 spread is still quite small, but for thinly traded cryptos, the spread can be much wider relative to the trading price, possibly causing a sub-optimal trade.</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<h4>How Display Fees Work</h4>
<p>There’s another type of fee structure you’ll see on Coinbase&#8217;s simple trades or Kraken’s simple trades, for example. These easy-to-use trading boxes can come with much higher fees and often use complicated schedules that assign a different fee based on the value of the order and the payment method. Kraken, for instance, calls this a display fee, meaning you’ll see it displayed before you make your trade.</p>
<p>Typically, trades with a display fee also bring an additional cost in the form of a spread. In this case, the spread may be much wider than you’ll see in order-book spreads. Usually, the spread is in the quoted price, so it’s not hidden, but it’s also not shown precisely. Always check the price for your trade — including spreads and fees — to be sure the trade still makes sense for you.</p>
</div></div>
<p>There are a few other fees to watch out for, but not all exchanges charge these fees. Consider the big picture in regard to costs when choosing the best crypto exchange for your needs. A cryptocurrency trading platform with low trading fees might charge other fees that make trading costlier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit fees</li>
<li>Withdrawal fees</li>
<li>Conversion fees</li>
<li>Inactivity fees</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let’s say you buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Bitstamp with no trading fee. If your balance stays at $100 and you want to withdraw, you’ll pay about $13 in withdrawal fees or about 13% of your investment’s value.</p>
<p>However, if you continue buying and your balance grows to $5,000, that same $13 fee drops to 0.26% of your investment’s value. Weigh how you’ll use the platform and how additional fees might affect your trading cost on each of the crypto trading platforms you’re considering.</p>
<h2>How to Use a Cryptocurrency Exchange &#8211; 4 Simple Steps</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When you’re ready to buy cryptocurrency, you can follow these 4 simple steps. We chose <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC</a> for this example because the onboarding process is smooth and crypto trading fees are a flat 0% on the spot market. This winning combination makes MEXC well-suited for all traders and investors.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Open an Account</h3>
<p>Visit <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc">MEXC.com</a> to open a trading account. You can signup with your MetaMask wallet, your Telegram or Google account. Or you you can use an email.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="442" class="alignnone wp-image-138363 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg" alt="MEXC signup " srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-768x377.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432510-mexc-signup-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3>Step 2: Fund your account</h3>
<p>If you use a SEPA bank deposit, you will have to verify your account via a KYC (know your customer) process. However, this option is not available in all countries, meaning you will have to use other deposit methods, including credit card purchases to fund your account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="541" class="alignnone wp-image-138349 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="MEXC buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701431772-mexc-buy-crypto-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3>Step 3: Buy the Cryptocurrency You Want</h3>
<p>Buying crypto directly with a card is limited to only a few options including Bitcoin. If you&#8217;re looking to buy other crypto coins, purchase USDT first and then use the spot market to buy the coins you want.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Make Your First Trade</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to buy DOGE. You will first need to purchase USDT coins and then go to the spot market. Look for DOGE in the search bar at the top of the page and select DOGE/USDT pair.</p>
<p>Enter the amount of DOGE you wish to buy and select the price. Click &#8220;Buy DOGE&#8221;. And you&#8217;re set.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="436" class="alignnone wp-image-138366 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge.jpg" alt="MEXC buy DOGE" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-300x145.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-768x372.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701432935-mexc-buy-doge-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to keep your coins on the exchange, simply go to your wallet section and withdraw your coins into your crypto wallet. Alternatively, visit MEXC Savings and stake your coins to earn annual percentage rate.</p>
<h2>Why Trust Us</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Our editors are committed to independent and fair reviews. Wherever possible, we use the products or services we review to bring you a real-world perspective on the pros and cons of each. For this exchange review, we made real trades with real money. This gives us the ability to speak knowledgeably about each aspect of the exchange and trading platforms reviewed from a user perspective. When appropriate, we used a data-driven ranking system to determine which exchanges and trading platforms earned a spot.</p>
<h2>Our Methodology</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We evaluated dozens of different exchanges, trading platforms, and crypto trading apps. The trading fees shown for each platform reflect the cost of trading at various volume tiers. Where possible, simple trading platforms and advanced trading platforms on the same exchange were also compared. Additionally, we compared the cost to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on each platform.</p>
<p>In this review of the best crypto exchanges, we looked for benefits that can help you save or make more money while also being mindful of features or limitations that may create a stumbling block for newer users. On each exchange, we used the advanced trading platform or simple trading platform, depending on which options were available, and compared the experiences. The best crypto exchange in a given area may not have earned a top pick overall. In ranking the top exchanges, we considered the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple trades:</strong> We evaluated both trading costs and ease of use for platforms that offered simple buy/sell widgets.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced trades</strong>: For platforms with advanced trading features, we weighed trading options as well as ease of use and charting ability.</li>
<li><strong>Available cryptocurrencies:</strong> Support for Bitcoin was mandatory, but we also evaluated the depth of available cryptocurrencies on each exchange and which other popular or trending cryptos were available.</li>
<li><strong>Overall trading costs:</strong> We considered other fees and expenses people may encounter, including deposit fees, withdrawal fees, inactivity fees, and spread costs.</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources for new investors:</strong> We weighed the educational content available on each platform as well as help tip placement near trading widgets that could be confusing for new users.</li>
<li><strong>Security features:</strong> We evaluated account security, custodial storage, and the ability to move crypto assets off the platform if needed. Regulation: Where applicable, we detailed the regulatory agencies that oversee each exchange in major markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There’s a trading platform available for nearly every trading style. Crypto trading platforms like Kraken and MEXC give you room to grow as a crypto trader with a vast library of educational resources, but they also cater to seasoned traders with advanced charting features and tools.</p>
<p>But one of the top features is copy trading, which lets you copy the trades of successful traders on the platform. This strategy can eliminate the need for technical analysis before making a trade. MEXC is one of the few exchanges that offers this feature. And when you want to invest by yourself, MEXC&#8217;s flat 0% spot trading fee will save you money in the long run. While MEXC is available in most countries, it&#8217;s not supported in the US at the moment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency investment is a rapidly evolving landscape, with investors constantly on the lookout for new coins that offer growth potential. One approach many investors adopt is exploring new cryptocurrencies with lower market caps and unit prices, hoping for higher returns.

<h2><b>How to Discover the Latest Cryptocurrencies</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In this section, we will explore various strategies that can help you identify new cryptocurrencies as they emerge. These methods will enable you to stay informed and make well-informed decisions regarding potential investments. Keep in mind that this article aims to provide information and suggestions, not financial advice.</p>
<h3><b>Investigate Cryptos in the Presale Phase</b></h3>
<p>Focusing on cryptocurrencies during their presale stage allows investors to enter at a lower price point compared to when they become available on major exchanges. Researching upcoming launches is an effective way to find promising new crypto coins while they are still in their early stages.</p>
<h3><b>Utilise Keyword Searches on Social Media Platforms</b></h3>
<p>With social media being a powerful tool for discovering new trends, platforms like Twitter and TikTok give users the ability to search for keywords such as #bestnewcrypto or #cryptopresales. You can even search for categories like #NFTgames and set up notifications for these keywords to stay updated on new cryptocurrency releases.</p>
<h3><b>Keep an Eye on New Tokens Listed on Crypto Exchanges</b></h3>
<p>Spotting new cryptocurrencies can be done through reputable platforms, as they are likely to vet projects for legitimacy before listing. Check popular exchanges and online brokers for newly listed tokens by applying filters on the platform to search for specific types of tokens.</p>
<h3><b>Stay Informed on Emerging Market Trends</b></h3>
<p>Following the broader market trends is crucial for staying up-to-date on developing trends in the cryptocurrency space. For instance, artificial intelligence (AI) tools have gained prominence in recent years, leading to a subsequent increase in AI-related cryptocurrencies. Similarly, Web3 gaming and NFT-related coins witnessed a significant surge in early 2022. Identifying and acting on upcoming trends can be a profitable approach.</p>
<p>Remember, staying informed about the latest developments and trends in the cryptocurrency market is essential for making well-informed decisions. Explore various sources, utilise available tools, and keep an open mind when it comes to new investment opportunities in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2><b>Selecting New Cryptocurrencies</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In this section, we&#8217;ll discuss key factors to consider when choosing new cryptocurrencies for investment without focusing on their historical performance.</p>
<h3><b>Functionality of the Crypto</b></h3>
<p>While evaluating new cryptocurrencies, it&#8217;s essential to examine their potential uses. For example, Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain underpins various decentralised finance applications, fostering its growth and scalability. Many cryptocurrencies with multiple use cases tend to have a better chance of long-term growth and sustainability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bitcoin was initially designed for payments but has evolved into a store of value. Thus, it&#8217;s crucial to assess the functionality of the cryptocurrency to determine its growth potential.</p>
<h3><b>Promising Development Plan</b></h3>
<p>A cryptocurrency with an engaging and well-defined roadmap demonstrates the team&#8217;s commitment to the project, making it more appealing to potential investors. Transparency in the development plan also contributes to building a strong community of supporters, which is vital for a cryptocurrency&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>With an interesting roadmap, investors feel more confident in the project&#8217;s direction and the team&#8217;s dedication, increasing the odds of the cryptocurrency thriving.</p>
<h3><b>Potential for Liquidity</b></h3>
<p>Liquidity is an essential factor for new cryptocurrencies as it allows investors to trade them when necessary. A cryptocurrency may not be an attractive investment option if it lacks significant trading volume. Keep an eye on new cryptocurrencies that have garnered substantial interest during early investment rounds, such as Love Hate Inu and DeeLance, as they may exhibit promising liquidity levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, when a cryptocurrency is preparing for listing on a prominent exchange, it can attract more investors and promote growth. Seek out new cryptocurrencies with the potential to be listed on major exchanges to boost your investment selection process.</p>
<p>Remember, this information serves to guide your understanding of the factors involved in selecting new cryptocurrencies and should not be perceived as financial advice. Always do your due diligence when considering any investment.</p>
<h2><b>Assessing New Cryptocurrencies as Investments</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><b>Gaining from Increased Popularity of Cryptos</b></h3>
<p>A potential advantage of investing in new cryptocurrencies is the possibility of making gains as they become more popular. New crypto coins often start on presale, offering early investors a chance to acquire tokens at a discounted price. As such, when the coin is eventually listed on an exchange, early investors could potentially realise an immediate upside. One example is TAMA, which saw a near 2,000% increase from its original presale price after it was listed on an exchange.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s crucial to conduct thorough research and remain aware of the inherent risks associated with investing in new cryptocurrencies. Notable red flags to watch out for include poorly written websites, incomplete roadmaps or whitepapers, and unverified project teams.</p>
<h3><b>Utilisation in In-Game Transactions</b></h3>
<p>Some of the latest cryptocurrencies are designed to function as a form of currency within a platform&#8217;s ecosystem, particularly in the development of play-to-earn (P2E) games. For instance, Tamadoge has released five arcade games in which players can earn TAMA as a reward and is currently developing an augmented reality app.</p>
<h3><b>Promotions and Giveaways of the Latest Cryptos</b></h3>
<p>To raise awareness of their projects, some new cryptocurrencies offer giveaways in the form of tokens or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As a result, investors might have the opportunity to win free tokens, which they can utilise for purchases within the platform or exchange for other digital assets.</p>
<p>That being said, decision-making should be based on thorough research and analysing of risk factors. As with all <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-invest-in-crypto/">speculative assets</a>, the potential benefits should be balanced against the risks involved. Additional features, such as staking, may also impact an individual&#8217;s decision whether to invest in a new cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>In summary, investing in new cryptocurrencies can be an attractive prospect for some, offering the potential for gains as they grow in popularity, usability within a platform&#8217;s ecosystem, and participation in promotions or giveaways. However, it&#8217;s crucial to approach this type of investment with caution and conduct comprehensive research to minimise risk.</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>In the cryptocurrency market, diversification is paramount. This strategy extends beyond merely spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies. It involves a deep understanding of the various technologies and innovations in the market. Key developments, such as the strategic burning of tokens to manage supply, can significantly influence a token&#8217;s value and demand, presenting unique opportunities and risks.</p>
<p>When considering cryptocurrency investments, thorough research and analysis are essential. High staking yields and new technologies are appealing but must be weighed against potential risks. Investors should aim to build portfolios that align with their financial goals, risk tolerance, and belief in blockchain technology. Navigating cryptocurrency&#8217;s dynamic and innovative world requires a balanced approach, blending excitement with a prudent investment strategy.</p>

<h2>The Best Crypto Hardware Wallets Reviews</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Here’s how our top picks for best hardware wallets compare.</p>
<h3>1. Ledger Nano X &#8211; Bluetooth-Enabled Hardware Wallet With Open-Source Software</h3>
<p>Building on the success of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/en">Ledger</a> Nano S and S Plus, the Ledger Nano X updates the iconic design of Ledger wallets and brings Bluetooth connectivity for crypto management without wires. Connect to your phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop to do your crypto thing at home or on the go. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015216913-Frequently-asked-questions">Bluetooth connectivity for desktops is in the works</a> and should become available with a future firmware update.</p>
<p>Ledger was the first hardware wallet maker to include a Secure Element chip in its devices. Designed to protect against known attacks and make the device tamper-resistant, this chip safely stores sensitive data. Ledger hardware wallets use the Secure Element to generate and store the private keys that control the assets in your wallet.</p>
<p>About the size and shape of a USB thumb drive, the Ledger Nano X is easy to carry. And with battery power and Bluetooth, it’s designed to go anywhere your crypto journey takes you. The wallet pairs with the Ledger Live mobile or desktop application. Send and receive crypto to your hardware wallet using the Ledger Live App.</p>
<p>Where the Ledger Nano X and most other mobile-friendly wallets disappoint is in their ability to connect to third-party wallet apps. If you want to connect to MetaMask’s mobile app, for example, there’s currently no way to do so. The companies are working together to build support for <a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-metamask-strengthen-partnership-ledger-nano-x-soon-compatible-with-metamask-mobile-app">Ledger Bluetooth-enabled devices paired with MetaMask</a>. In the interim, Ledger Live provides access to an assortment of built-in dApps, and MetaMask offers Ledger wallet support for its desktop browser extension.</p>

<p>Upmarket from the Ledger Nano X is the still-in-production Ledger Stax, which raises the bar higher with its innovative E-Ink touchscreen, Bluetooth, and roomy user interface. At press time, the Stax is available for preorder.</p>
<p>Ledger’s Nano X remains the flagship model for now and a top choice for the company’s over 5 million customers.</p>

<h3>2. Trezor Model T &#8211; Touchscreen Bitcoin Hardware Wallet With Support for Multiple Blockchains</h3>
<div>In 2014, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en">Trezor</a> made the world’s first hardware crypto wallet. Since that innovation, dozens of competing wallets have emerged. Yet, Trezor remains one of the most trusted wallets available today. Much of that trust centers around transparency. Trezor makes the entire device code open-source. Anyone can read the source code for both the firmware that powers the device itself as well as the software suite used to set up the device and explore the ecosystem.</div>

<p>The Trezor Model T is the company’s flagship product, boasting a 240&#215;240 touchscreen display combined with a slim, portable design.

This Trezor hardware wallet connects to a laptop or desktop.</p>
<p>With support for 1470+ tokens and coins, the Trezor Model T won’t recognize as many tokens natively as Ledger devices. However, you can still store ERC-20 tokens that aren’t specifically listed as supported. With new tokens launching daily, this issue is common to most wallets. As a workaround, you can view your Ethereum and Layer 2 portfolio using a frequently updated portfolio app, such as Debank, Zapper, or Zerion.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trezor.io/6-features-that-make-trezor-the-1-hardware-wallet-5e3bcbdb2c31">Trezor reports support for over 8,000 coins and tokens</a> using the Trezor Suite and (unnamed) third-party tools.</p>
<p>One standout feature of Trezor wallets is easy access to hidden wallets. You can build a standard wallet, keeping a small amount of crypto available while also keeping a hidden stash protected by a password. Build your hidden wallet using Trezor Suite, the open-source app that accompanies Trezor devices, allowing easy updates or even installation of custom firmware.</p>

<h3>3. Ledger Nano S Plus &#8211; Budget-Friendly Hardware Wallet With a Secure Element Chip</h3>
<p>As a lower-cost alternative to the Ledger Nano X, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/en">Ledger Nano S Plus</a> combines much of the same functionality and a familiar design language with a budget-friendly price tag. At $79, the Nano S Plus comes in $70 lower than the Nano X.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s missing versus the Nano X:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth connectivity</li>
<li>Battery-powered portability</li>
<li>Slightly larger screen on the Nano X</li>
</ul>
<p>The Nano S Plus gets its power from a supplied USB-A to USB-C cable. Optionally, you can connect with a USB-C to USB-C cable, allowing you to use your Nano S with USB-C-enabled mobile devices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="560" height="689" class="aligncenter wp-image-121249" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus.png" alt="ledger nano s plus" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus.png 560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus-244x300.png 244w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p>Like the slightly larger X, the S Plus supports up to 100 installed applications as well as 5,000 coins and tokens. Both devices share a similar design, diverging mainly on screen size and button placement. While the Nano X is sleeker in appearance, the Nano S Plus borrows from the legacy of the legendary Nano S, giving you a sturdy yet powerful device that can survive many of life’s mishaps.</p>
<p>While more affordable, the Nano S Plus doesn’t feel like a budget device. When compared to other popular lower-cost devices like the Trezor Model One, the S Plus is a smidgen heavier, but by no means heavy, and doesn’t exhibit any unexpected creaks or rattles.</p>
<p>The Nano S Plus also features the Secure Element chip found in all of Ledger’s lineup. The chip offers a tamper-resistant storage solution for your wallet’s private keys.</p>
<p>If you don’t need Bluetooth connectivity or battery-powered portability, the Nano S Plus provides a no-compromise solution with a lower price tag than the upmarket X.</p>

<h3>4. Trezor Model One &#8211; Low-Cost Open-Source Hardware Wallet With a Proven History</h3>
<p>No hardware wallet is more iconic than the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en">Trezor</a> Model One. Dating back to 2014, the Model One was the first crypto hardware wallet ever made, and it’s still a leading choice as a Bitcoin hardware wallet or multi-chain hardware crypto wallet for many in the crypto community.</p>
<p>There are no finicky touchscreens or wireless Bluetooth connection options. Instead, you get a battle-tested two-button hardware wallet that’s reliable and affordable.</p>
<p>As evidence of the Model One’s heritage, the device connects via a Micro USB cable. This legacy cable type is prone to wear, but you can use any data-enabled Micro USB cable with the wallet. Two pleasantly clicky buttons under a smallish but clear display allow you to navigate through transactions easily.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="493" class="aligncenter wp-image-121256" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-1024x493.png" alt="trezor model one" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-1024x493.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-768x370.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one.png 1226w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Like the Model T, everything about the Model One is transparent. The device is powered by open-source firmware, which you can wipe, which resets the device, or replace entirely. The device pairs with the open-source Trezor Suite, which enables setup and offers simple exchange or peer-to-peer trading.</p>
<p>Token support on the Model One is about a third lower than you’ll find on the Model T. Of note, Ripple (XRP) is not supported, but Model T devices with firmware version 2.08 or higher support the in-demand cryptocurrency. Similarly, Cardano (ADA) is not supported on the Model One but is supported on the Model T and the new Trezor Safe 3.</p>
<p>However, you’ll find support for widely traded cryptos like BTC and ETH, as well as ERC-20 tokens and NFTs</p>
<h4>What Are ERC-20 Tokens?</h4>
<p>The crypto economy is made up of both coins and tokens.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coins are the cryptocurrency specific to their own block chain. For example, Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin blockchain.</li>
<li>Tokens are crypto assets used on other blockchains. For example, WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin used on the Ethereum blockchain as well as several other blockchains. But there is no Wrapped Bitcoin blockchain. WBTC only exists on other blockchains.</li>
</ul>
<p>ERC-20 refers to a way to standardize tokens used on the Ethereum blockchain and other compatible blockchains. Many of the crypto assets you see traded on exchanges are actually tokens rather than coins, and many of these follow the ERC-20 token standard. In practical application, the ERC-20 standard means that each ERC-20 of the same type is the same as the next, much like each Bitcoin is the same as the next or each dollar is the same as the next dollar.</p>
<p>Expect a lengthy initial setup process on any Trezor device. However, each step leaves newer users with a better understanding of how crypto wallets work and how Trezor’s features help keep your crypto secure.</p>

<h3>5. Tangem &#8211; Slim, Credit-Card-Sized Hardware Wallet With NFC Support for Mobile Devices</h3>
<p>If you can make room in your wallet for one more credit-card-sized item, you can carry a secure crypto hardware wallet with you wherever you go. That’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tangem/en">Tangem</a>, a card-like crypto wallet powered by (near-field communication) NFC technology and designed to work with mobile devices.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever used tap to pay, you’ve used NFC.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" class="aligncenter wp-image-121277" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-1024x678.png" alt="tangem hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-1024x678.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-300x199.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-768x509.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Tangem, a Swiss-based company, launched the Tangem wallet in 2018 with the goal of making affordable, secure crypto storage available to everyone. The simple setup process takes just a few minutes, and the wallet costs less than $55 for a 2-card set.</p>
<p>Most crypto wallets use a seed phrase, a human-readable version of the wallet’s private key that lets you send or spend your crypto. Typically, these seed phrases are 12 or 24 words long and often difficult to remember. Tangem sidesteps this newbie-unfriendly aspect of crypto storage by doing away with the seed phrase. Instead, you can back up your wallet to a second Tangem wallet card, which is then protected by an access code.</p>
<p>While Tangem wallets are designed to be used without a seed phrase, the <a href="https://tangem.com/en/blog/post/new-tangem-wallet/">newest (version 2.0) cards support a seed-phrase option</a> using the companion mobile app.</p>
<p>The wallet really does resemble a credit card and uses an embedded NFC chip to communicate with a partner app installed on your NFC-enabled smartphone. Not all smartphones support NFC, so double-check compatibility before you make a purchase.</p>
<p>The brains of the operation are found in a 1 x 1 mm Samsung chip held inside the card itself. No batteries are needed, and the wallet is resistant to dust, water, X-rays, and even electromagnetic pulses.</p>

<h3>6. Ellipal Titan &#8211; Air-Gapped Crypto Hardware Wallet With a Large Touchscreen</h3>
<p>If credit-card-sized wallets are a bit too small for your tastes, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ellipal/en">Ellipal Titan</a> may be a better fit. As the name suggests, it’s big, nearly 6 inches tall and over 4 inches wide. The Titan’s larger dimensions translate to more real estate for the device’s responsive touchscreen display.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="493" class="aligncenter wp-image-121279" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-1024x493.png" alt="ellipal titan crypto wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-1024x493.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-768x370.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan.png 1138w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Ellipal’s Titan supports over 10,000 cryptocurrencies and is completely air-gapped. There’s no Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC, USB, or any other way for the wallet’s private keys to come anywhere near the internet. Instead, the Ellipal Titan uses QR codes to share information with the Ellipal mobile app. The wallet itself also has a camera to scan QR codes from the mobile app.</p>
<p>You can also send crypto to your Ellipal cryptocurrency hardware wallet from a crypto exchange like Coinbase. Using the Coinbase app, snap a pic of the QR code for your crypto wallet address shown on the Ellipal device. Coinbase and similar apps convert the QR code to an address, ensuring the crypto goes to the right address without the risk of typos.</p>

<h3>7. NGRAVE ZERO &#8211; Air-Gapped Crypto Hardware Wallet With Military-Grade Construction</h3>
<p>Similar to the Ellipal Titan, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ngrave/en">NGRAVE ZERO</a> is a completely air-gapped wallet. That means the wallet cannot connect to the internet at all. There’s no WiFi, NFC, USB, or Bluetooth support. Also like the Ellipal, the NGRAVE communicates via QR codes and cameras. The device uses these QR codes to communicate with the LIQUID companion app.</p>
<p>The internet-enabled mobile app is where you can view your balances. The ZERO device itself is used for signing transactions using its 480&#215;800 pixel touchscreen display.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="693" class="aligncenter wp-image-121285" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-1024x693.png" alt="ngrave zero hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-1024x693.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-300x203.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-768x519.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero.png 1075w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Security is job one with the NGRAVE. The ZERO comes with an EAL7 security-certified OS, the highest security certification available, and a first within the crypto hardware wallet space. The hardware wallet also features a fingerprint reader to help ensure secure access.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>What Are EAL Certifications?</h4>
<p>Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) ratings offer a way to compare the security of a product and use a scale from EAL1 to EAL7.</p>
<p>Crypto wallet hardware devices with a Secure Element chip often earn an EAL5 rating or higher. EAL ratings can also apply to operating systems as well, as shown with the NGRAVE ZERO’s EAL7-certified operating system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Private key generation on the NGRAVE uses a clever combination of techniques to aid randomness. A combination of a random number algorithm, your fingerprint, and the ambient light in the room all play a role when the ZERO creates your unique private key. These variable elements make reverse engineering of the private key improbable.</p>
<p>Although the ZERO is a pricier option at nearly $400, the investment may be worthwhile for those with more to protect.</p>
<div>
<h4>NGRAVE ZERO Pros and Cons</h4>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Randomized private key</li>

<h3>8. Safepal S1 Pro &#8211; Budget-Friendly Air-Gapped Hardware Wallet With a Secure Element Chip</h3>
<p>You could spend hundreds on an air-gapped crypto hardware wallet, but <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/safepal/en">Safepal</a> delivers air-gapped security for under $100 with two models: the S1 and the S1 Pro. The Pro offers longer battery life combined with a more durable housing made with aluminum alloy and tempered glass. If you’re making an investment in your long-term crypto security, the $90 S1 Pro may be a better value compared to the $50 Safepal S1.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="410" class="aligncenter wp-image-121288" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-1024x410.png" alt="safepal s1 cold wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-1024x410.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-768x307.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1.png 1094w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Otherwise, the devices deliver the same specs. Both come with a 1.3-inch color screen paired with a d-pad for navigation. Both devices are also air-gapped, meaning they can’t connect to the internet, and come with EAL5+ certified Secure Element chips.</p>
<p>Choose your level of security on demand with a choice of 12, 18, or 24 mnemonic seed phrases for your private key. Longer phrases are more secure. Shorter phrases may be easier to memorize. Then, secure your device with a PIN.</p>
<p>Like other air-gapped wallets, the Safepal communicates with a mobile app via QR codes.</p>

<h3>9. KeepKey &#8211; Affordable Hardware Wallet With Support for 7,000+ Cryptos and ShapeShift Integration</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/keepkey/en">KeepKey</a> app and wallet experience is reminiscent of using a Ledger wallet with the Ledger Live app. Both offer polished user experiences and high-quality devices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="414" class="aligncenter wp-image-121291" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-1024x414.png" alt="keepkey wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-1024x414.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-300x121.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-768x311.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There are two key differences, however. KeepKey does not support Bluetooth, a leading feature of the Ledger Nano X. Additionally, the KeepKey app features <a href="https://shapeshift.com/">ShapeShift</a>, a leading multichain trading platform. <a href="https://www.keepkey.com/faqs">KeepKey is currently owned by former ShapeShift team members</a> and contributes to the ShapeShift DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). You can also connect your KeepKey directly to the ShapeShift app.</p>
<p>KeepKey crypto wallets make setup easy, although the app itself is packed with features, including dApp integration. This lets you explore the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) from a trusted starting point.</p>
<p>Like Trezor devices, covered earlier, KeepKey uses open-source firmware. This brings the advantage of numbers. More people can view the code, making it possible to catch possible security concerns.</p>

<h2>What is a Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A crypto hardware wallet, also called a cold wallet, is a device that generates and stores the private keys for a crypto wallet offline. Some hardware wallets resemble a USB thumb drive, while others might be a touch screen device similar to a cell phone. A third type of wallet looks like a bank card and even contains an NFC chip that allows the wallet to communicate with a mobile app on an NFC-enabled smartphone.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>How Crypto Wallets Work</h4>
<p>A crypto wallet is a convenient way to describe what’s going on under the hood. We think of a wallet as a place to store money. That’s almost accurate. Instead, a wallet secures the assets held at an address, a digital location on the blockchain that can hold crypto assets. With the right key, anyone can control the assets at that address. That’s where a crypto wallet comes into the picture. The wallet holds the private keys that can control the crypto at that address or sign transactions related to that address.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin private key:</strong> L28FTDMPFVNrykyaWXDjRRH5u8eaTACKq63ApsZ6XWZB3g2m8AFE</li>
</ul>
<p>The private key above was generated using an online app. Hence, this Bitcoin wallet should be considered insecure. Does the online app store all the keys it generates? Are the browser and its extensions secure? Is the computer itself compromised?</p>
<p>If someone else has the same keys, you can both control the assets, a situation that could lead to the irrevocable loss of your crypto assets.</p>
<p>When you use an exchange to hold your crypto, the exchange controls the keys. Many exchanges provide you with a public address so you can send crypto to your account. However, you don’t have access to the private keys at all. You just have the exchange login credentials in most cases. The collapse of the FTX exchange is just one recent example of the risks involved with trusting someone else with your keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll discuss the importance of protecting private keys in more detail shortly, but a hardware wallet creates an additional layer of security by authorizing transactions on a device that you physically control. This reduces the risk of loss due to compromised private keys — or the seed phrase used to generate those keys. More on that in a bit.</p>
<h2>How do Hardware Wallets Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hardware wallets can be used to authorize crypto transactions by approving or declining the transaction from an offline device. The process works similarly to two-factor authentication (2FA), in which you use a device you control to authenticate a login to a bank account, for example.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you’re using MetaMask as your Ethereum wallet. MetaMask generates a seed phrase, a people-friendly way of encoding the private keys. Typically, seed phrases are 12-24 words long. MetaMask, however, is a hot wallet. The private keys are generated on an online device and stored on that same device used for online activities.</p>
<p>The keys from hot wallets can become compromised in a number of ways, ranging from software exploits to keyloggers that record your keystrokes. The wallet addresses generated by MetaMask are less secure compared to hardware wallet addresses because the private keys can be more easily compromised with hot wallets.</p>
<p>But MetaMask also supports popular hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. You can generate private keys offline using your hardware wallet and then import the public addresses from your hardware wallet to MetaMask. This lets you use MetaMask to see your assets and connect to decentralized applications (dApps) like Uniswap.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" class="aligncenter wp-image-121294" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-1024x531.png" alt="metamask connect to hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>However, if you need to authorize a transaction for the hard wallet addresses, you’ll need to connect your hardware wallet to accept or decline. MetaMask asks the device for authorization but never has access to the private keys in your hardware wallet.</p>
<p>If there is no input from the hardware wallet, the transaction can’t be authorized, and your crypto remains in your wallet.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of security, much like when your bank sends you an email or text to be sure it’s really you logging into your account.</p>
<h3>Wired or Wireless Connections</h3>
<p>Many hardware wallets use a USB connection to connect to your computer and accept or decline transactions. Newer models may use Bluetooth, which allows support for mobile use, or even an NFC chip that can connect to an NFC-enabled mobile device.</p>
<p>Regardless of which connection type a hardware wallet uses, there’s still an additional layer that requires input from a separate device you physically hold.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Hardware Crypto Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The advantages of hardware wallets compared to software wallets or exchange wallets center on security. You may have to sacrifice some convenience, but the goal is to protect your crypto. By keeping some or all of your crypto in a hardware wallet, you greatly reduce the risk of losses.</p>
<p>Hot wallets like MetaMask, Electrum, or Trust Wallet make crypto transactions more convenient. However, all hot wallets bring similar risks because the private keys are generated and stored on a device connected to the internet. Someone on the other side of the world can drain the wallet if they gain access to private keys (or the seed phrase).</p>
<p>By contrast, a hardware wallet forces the transaction to be approved or declined on a device you hold.</p>
<p>Hardware crypto wallets also allow you to split your stack for safety. Similar to traveling with pocket money while the rest of your money is safe in the bank, you can keep some crypto available in a convenient hot wallet while using your hardware wallet to safeguard the bulk of your holdings.</p>
<h3>Using a Hardware Wallet to Move Your Crypto Off Exchanges</h3>
<p>You don’t need to be active in the crypto ecosystem to benefit from a hardware wallet. One of the most common reasons to choose a hardware wallet is for the secure storage of cryptocurrencies you&#8217;re holding as an investment.</p>
<p>As a beginning investor, you might choose to keep your crypto on the exchange where you trade. Exchange wallets are called custodial wallets because the exchange has custody of your crypto. It’s convenient. And when your balances on the exchange are lower, your financial exposure is also lower.</p>
<p>As your balances grow, however, you’re at risk of losing much more. Using a self-custody crypto hardware wallet can protect you against exchange-related risks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your exchange login can be compromised.</strong> About a third of us use password managers that offer a way to create unique passwords for each website. Others may be re-using passwords or using insecure passwords. However, even a password manager can create risk, as the app itself or an online vault can be a target for exploits. LastPass, a popular password manager, has suffered <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/">more than one breach</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The exchange might freeze withdrawals.</strong> The collapse of crypto platforms like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bankrupt-crypto-lender-voyager-digital-predicts-35-customer-payout-2023-05-17/">Voyager</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/crypto-lender-celsius-sends-bankruptcy-plan-creditor-vote-2023-08-14/">Celsius</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/business/ftx-bankruptcy.html">FTX</a> — all of which declared bankruptcy — are examples of why it may be wiser to move your crypto off exchanges. Once you move some or all of your crypto to a hardware wallet, any insolvency issues pose less risk to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to keep a certain amount of crypto on the exchange for trading purposes, consider moving the rest to a hardware crypto wallet for safekeeping.</p>
<h2>Hardware Wallets vs Software Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Moving your crypto to a wallet you control is often the best move, but is a software wallet just as good a choice? Probably not.</p>
<p>A software wallet like MetaMask (Ethereum) or Electrum (Bitcoin) generates and stores the private keys on an internet-connected device. The private keys used to authorize transactions are on your device at all times. If multinational companies like Microsoft and Oracle have <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-215a">security vulnerabilities</a> in their applications, hot wallets developed by smaller teams may be at risk as well.</p>
<p>Conversely, hardware wallets store your private keys on a separate device not connected to the internet. Even when temporarily connected to a computer or mobile device, the hardware wallet’s firmware limits interaction with your wallet to accepting or declining a transaction by clicking a button or taking a similar action on the device in your possession.</p>
<p>Both types of wallets share some similar risks, however. Specifically, safeguarding the wallet’s seed phrase or private key is tantamount, but sometimes, they get out into the wild.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="478" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-121297" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase.png" alt="metamask recovery phrase" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase.png 478w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase-221x300.png 221w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone else has this seed phrase, also called a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase, they can create a duplicate of your wallet (and its keys) and send your crypto to another wallet you can’t access. Any compatible software wallet can be used to access a crypto wallet created by a hardware device if someone has the seed phase.</p>
<p>The seed phrase and private key look different, but either can be used to make a carbon copy of your wallet. They’re really just two ways of expressing the same value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="434" height="592" class="aligncenter wp-image-121298" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key.png" alt="metamask private key" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key.png 434w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key-220x300.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /></p>
<p>This concern applies to both hot and cold wallets because they both use seed phrases and private keys. Choose a secure way to store your seed phrase so you can recreate your wallet if needed while preventing someone else from making a copy of your wallet elsewhere.</p>
<p>Generally, avoid storing your seed phrase in cloud storage or leaving it somewhere where others can find it.</p>
<h2>How to Choose a Hardware Cryptocurrency Wallet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Which cryptocurrency hardware wallet is right for your needs depends on your risk profile and how you think you’ll use your wallet. Cost, transparency, security features, and even mobile support can all play a role in your purchase decision.</p>
<h3>Security Features</h3>
<p>Consider how you’ll use the wallet and which security features are most important to you.</p>
<p>Often, there’s a trade-off between security and convenience. The most secure wallets are air-gapped, meaning they can’t connect to the internet in any way. Instead, they typically use QR codes. You scan the QR code in an app or on the device itself and then approve or deny the transaction on the device. This may require more steps to complete transactions compared to a device that connects via Bluetooth or USB.</p>
<p>Also, consider security features like a Secure Element chip. But weigh the benefits against the trade-offs for this as well. For example, Ledger states it <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/11132311094813-Ledger-s-open-source-roadmap">can’t fully open-source its firmware due to the Secure Element chip</a>. Trezor, by contrast, does not use a Secure Element chip on the Model T or Model One and provides full transparency with open-source firmware for these devices.</p>
<h3>Supported Coins and Blockchains</h3>
<p>Many popular wallets support multiple blockchains. However, some wallets only support one blockchain, most commonly seen with Bitcoin-only wallets. Choose the best crypto hardware wallet for your overall needs while weighing which assets you think you’ll need to store. For example, if you’re considering a Trezor but need to store XRP, you’ll need to jump up to a Model T. Trezor’s Model One doesn’t support XRP.</p>
<p>Most multi-chain wallets support the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks at a minimum. Ethereum Layer 2 support may be limited, however. You may not see assets you hold on the Abitrum Layer 2 blockchain, for example, even though they are in your wallet. If needed, you can use a portfolio app like Debank or a blockchain explorer like <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> (for Ethereum) or <a href="https://arbiscan.io/">Arbiscan</a> (for Arbitrum) to verify transactions or tokens that don’t show in your hardware or software wallet.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>Software wallets are typically free to use. By comparison, you can expect to pay $50 to well over $200 for a hardware wallet, depending on which model you choose.</p>
<p>Cost is a consideration, but paying a lot doesn’t always translate to more secure storage. Plenty of people store large amounts of crypto on inexpensive yet reliable and well-supported devices like the Trezor Model One.</p>
<p>Also, it might not make sense to spend hundreds of dollars to protect a smaller amount of crypto. If you choose a less expensive device to start, you can always upgrade when you have more to protect.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>The top hardware wallets generally don’t charge an additional fee to use the wallet after you’ve purchased it. However, many wallets enable crypto swaps or purchases from within the wallet’s software app. In this case, you may encounter fees or other costs.</p>
<p>There are several ways to trade crypto, ranging from centralized crypto exchanges to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">decentralized exchanges</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm">peer-to-peer exchanges</a>. Ledger Live, for example, offers ways to buy crypto from within Ledger’s wallet software suite. Transaction fees vary depending on the provider you choose within the app.</p>
<p>In most cases, buying on an exchange will be less expensive compared to using your wallet’s app. But you may prefer to buy through your wallet app. If so, compare buying fees before choosing the best crypto hardware wallet for your use case.</p>
<h3>Mobile Experience</h3>
<p>Not too long ago, mobile and hardware wallets didn’t belong in the same sentence. Most cold wallets worked via a USB cable plugged into a computer. However, with Bluetooth connectivity available on some hardware wallets or even NFC support, as seen with the Tangem, crypto hardware wallets can go wherever you go.</p>
<p>Some models, like Ledger wallets, can connect to Android phones via an optional OTG cable that uses the USB-C port on your phone.</p>
<p>If you think you might need to use your hardware wallet on the go, consider models that work with a cell phone or tablet. Check the App Store or Play Store reviews for the mobile app that accompanies the wallet you’re considering. Ledger Live scores well here with a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ledger.live&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">4.8 out of 5-star rating</a> on Google Play Store.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may also be able to use the mobile wallet app as an on-the-go portfolio to track your investments.</p>
<h3>Open-Source or Closed-Source Software and Firmware</h3>
<p>Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was open-source, meaning the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">Bitcoin Core code was and is available online</a>. The alternative would be closed source, in which we don’t know what the software really does, what security flaws it may have, or if it phones home with sensitive transaction details. Many in the crypto community insist on open-source software for crypto wallets.</p>
<p>Crypto hardware wallets use two sets of code:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wallet firmware:</strong> You can think of firmware as software that lives on the hardware wallet device itself. Trezor, for example, makes the <a href="https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware">Trezor firmware available to view</a>. If so inclined, you could even modify the firmware and run a customized device. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/11132311094813-Ledger-s-open-source-roadmap">Ledger is taking steps to open-source its firmware</a> following a crypto-community kerfuffle over <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/24/ledgers-pr-struggle-reveals-uncomfortable-trade-offs-for-crypto-storage/">Ledger’s planned private key backup service</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Wallet software:</strong> The software suite is an important tool to interact with the wallet device, particularly during device setup and updates. The wallet software talks to the wallet’s firmware but often also brings other features, like charting, swaps, or the ability to connect with other apps. Both <a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live">Ledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite">Trezor</a> open-source their software suites.</li>
</ul>
<p>The big advantage of open-source software and firmware is transparency, but security can also benefit from open-source code. An army of coders around the world poring over the code may be more likely to identify a potential issue than a smaller development team.</p>
<p>Lastly, open-source code for firmware gives the community a way to keep older devices active even after the manufacturer ends support. If Trezor ends firmware support for the tried-and-true Model One at some point in the future, the community can fork the code and make updates as needed.</p>
<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
<p>Top hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor balance security with ease of use. Both wallets offer beginner-friendly software suites that make maintenance like firmware updates a breeze. By comparison, Ellipal requires you to update the device using an SD card (not included).</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>The Ledger Nano series of crypto wallets were tough to break. The same is true of the Trezor Model One. Newer devices with large touch screens, like the Ellipal Titan or Ledger Stax, are akin to a small smartphone and may not survive accidental drops on a tile floor well. Consider your use case and where you’ll use your device before making a choice.</p>
<h3>Your Risk Profile</h3>
<p>The best crypto hardware wallets can help protect any amount of crypto, large or small, but for smaller amounts of crypto, it may be more prudent to let your balance grow before buying the latest crypto wallet gizmo. For some, a hardware wallet is a must-have piece of gear. Others may be well-served with a software wallet as a starting point.</p>
<h2>Limitations of Hardware Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Using a hardware wallet is an important security measure, but it creates some extra steps, and there are still some risks. Using software wallets alone is much easier, and you aren’t tied to a physical device that’s probably safely stored at home. However, software wallets are also less secure.</p>
<p>Pairing a software wallet with a hardware wallet makes sense in many situations.</p>
<p>You’ll have to weigh some considerations before making a choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Form factor: Roughly the size of a thumb drive, Ledger Nano wallets are easily pocketable. Credit-card-sized Tangem wallets might be even easier to carry around. But devices like Ellipal or Ledger Stax might have a touchscreen as large as 4 inches, making them portable – but not always convenient to carry.</li>
<li>Wear and breakage: The internal batteries in hard wallet devices can fail, just like those in your phone or tablet. These batteries may not be replaceable. Simpler devices like the Trezor Model One don’t use a battery, instead powering on when connected via USB. But that’s also a consideration. The connector (micro USB in the case of the Model One) could fail. Or, the buttons might stop working. The screen could break. In short, there’s a useful lifetime for hardware wallets, after which you’ll likely have to replace the device. Software wallets don’t suffer the same issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the best crypto hardware wallets won’t make you 100% secure. You’ll still need to take steps on your own to secure the seed phrase. It’s also wise to conceal the hardware wallet itself. You may not want visitors or the occasional home repair worker to see your Bitcoin hardware wallet lying around.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The field of options continues to grow, making choosing the best crypto hardware wallets a bit more challenging. For most crypto investors and traders, well-established brands may still make the best choices. Wallet makers like Ledger and Trezor led the market and still make some of the most compelling products. We were particularly impressed with the Ledger Nano X due to its sturdy construction, convenient size, security features, and wireless connectivity option. As a lower-cost alternative, the Ledger Nano S Plus offers many of the same features, less Bluetooth support. Ledger offers a well-built and well-priced solution for most common uses.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3>What is a hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>A hardware wallet is a type of crypto wallet that generates and stores the wallet’s private keys on a device that’s not connected to the internet.</p>
<h3>Are hardware crypto wallets safe?</h3>
<p>Hardware crypto wallets offer a safer alternative to software wallets because they store the wallet’s private keys offline. Many hardware wallets also use a Secure Element chip, a specialized chip designed to be tamper-resistant and safely store sensitive information.</p>
<h3>What is the most secure crypto hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>Air-gapped wallets that cannot connect to the internet in any way — instead using QR codes to communicate with an external app — offer the most security.</p>
<h3>Should I put my crypto in a hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>Storing your crypto in a hardware wallet is the safest option to protect against compromised exchange logins, exchange hacks, or exchange insolvency.</p>
<h3>Does my crypto still grow in a hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>The value of the crypto in your wallet tracks the value of the same cryptocurrency traded on exchanges.</p>
<h3>Are hardware wallets worth it?</h3>
<p>Software wallets may offer enough security for smaller balances, but as your balances grow, a hardware wallet becomes a worthwhile investment due to its increased security.</p>
<h3>Can you put any crypto on a hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>Many of the best crypto hardware wallets support up to 10,000 cryptocurrencies, but you need to be sure your wallet supports the cryptocurrency you want to store and choose the correct wallet address before transferring crypto to your wallet.</p>

<h3><strong>4. WeathersBot &#8211; Get Localized Weather Updates in any City 24/7</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best Telegram bots for weather updates is WeathersBot. This completely free-to-use bot offers a user-friendly and reliable service around the clock. After joining the <a href="https://t.me/WeathersBot" rel="nofollow">WeathersBot Telegram chat</a>, the user will be asked to type in their location. This can be the city, town, postcode, etc. </p>
<p>Each weather update will cover various metrics, such as the temperature, wind speed, and precipitation estimate. This is in addition to a general overview of local weather conditions. Best of all, WeathersBot allows users to set up custom notifications. This will come through as a Telegram alert. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323011/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323011/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_938_1344.jpg 938w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323011/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1290.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323011/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1032.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323011/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_860.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323011/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_430.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - weathersbot" width="938" /></figure>
<p>Notifications can be set daily, or over a 5/10-day period. Moreover, we like that WeathersBot can be added to another Telegram group. For example, friends planning a trip can add the bot to a custom group, showing daily weather updates for their destination. </p>
<h3><strong>5. File Converter &#8211; Convert Various File Types Directly in the Telegram App</strong></h3>
<p>Another use case for Telegram bots is file conversions. Rather than needing to use a desktop device, files can now be converted directly in the Telegram app. One of the best Telegram bots for this purpose is <a href="https://t.me/newfileconverterbot">File Converter</a>. Not only does File Converter support images but videos and audio too. We like that users are not required to specify the type of file that they want to convert. </p>
<p>On the contrary, users can click on the attach button and upload the file to the chat box. File Convert will automatically detect the file type. Users will then be given a range of options for the output file. For example, after uploading a JPG image to File Converter, we can convert it to a JPEG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, TIF, TIFF, GIF, ICO, PDF, or OCR. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323012/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323012/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_926_1338.jpg 926w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323012/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1300.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323012/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1040.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323012/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_867.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323012/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_433.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - file converter" width="926" /></figure>
<p>Users can set their preferred file type by clicking on the respective button. After clicking on &#8216;PNG&#8217;, the Telegram bot got to work. In fact, it took less than five seconds for the file conversion to complete. We can then click on the &#8216;Download&#8217; button to download the new file directly to our smartphone device. </p>
<p>Although File Converter is free to use, it does come with usage limitations. For instance, all users start with 30 credits. 1 credit is required to convert a file. File Converter relies on donations to keep its bot operational. </p>
<h3><strong>6. Hangbot &#8211; Play Hangman Games With Friends on Telegram</strong></h3>
<p>Looking to play games with a bunch of friends on the Telegram app? If so, Hangbot is one of the best Telegram bots for groups. This Telegram bot replicates the popular Hangman game. Two or more players are required and the bot is completely free to use. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works; After joining the <a href="https://telegram.me/hangbot" rel="nofollow">Hangbot Telegram chat</a> and starting a new game, it will generate a secret word. For instance, suppose the word is &#8216;Enterprise&#8217;. Players will only see the word displayed like this; &#8216;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&#8216;. In other words, 10 blank spaces. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323015/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323015/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_726_1196.jpg 726w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323015/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_720_1186.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323015/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_600_988.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323015/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_300_494.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - hangbot" width="726" /></figure>
<p>Player 1 will then need to guess one letter from the secret word. We&#8217;ll say they opt for &#8216;E&#8217;. As the secret word contains the letter E, it will now look like this; &#8216;E&#8211;e&#8212;&#8211;e&#8217;. The player will then be given the opportunity to guess the complete word. </p>
<p>On Hangbot, players can type their guess and send it as a message. If correct, the player wins the game. If not, they lose a life. Lives are also lost if the player guesses a letter incorrectly. Hangbot is a free Telegram bot but it requires at least two players. </p>
<h3><strong>7. EspressoBot &#8211; Create a New Cryptocurrency in Minutes via Text Prompts </strong></h3>
<p>One of the most innovative <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-bot-tokens.htm">Telegram bot tokens</a> in the market is <a href="https://t.me/espressoTGbot" rel="nofollow">EspressoBot</a>. This bot allows complete novices to create their own cryptocurrency. Zero knowledge of coding or programming is needed. Instead, EspressoBot creates a new cryptocurrency based on text prompts. </p>
<p>For instance, the user will initially be asked for the name of their custom cryptocurrency. Additional questions will follow, such as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s ticker symbol, supply, burning mechanism, and tax structure. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323016/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323016/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_932_1334.jpg 932w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323016/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1288.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323016/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1031.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323016/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_859.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323016/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_429.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - espressobot" width="932" /></figure>
<p>After confirming the fundamentals, EspressoBot will then create the cryptocurrency, alongside its unique smart contract. EspressoBot cryptocurrencies are owned solely by the user. Moreover, the cryptocurrency will be an ERC20 token, meaning it operates on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum blockchain</a>.  </p>
<h3><strong>8. AirTrack &#8211; Find the Cheapest Flight Deals for Any Destination</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://t.me/airtrack_bot" rel="nofollow">AirTrack</a> is one of the best Telegram bots for travel. In a nutshell, this Telegram bot helps users to find the cheapest flight deals in the market. Everything is automated and updated in real-time. After joining the AirTrack Telegram chat, users will be asked for details of their itinerary. </p>
<p>Initially, this includes the departure and arrival airports, and whether it&#8217;s a single or return ticket. Users will then be asked for their preferred travel dates. A few seconds later, AirTrack will display the best-priced flights, alongside a link to where users can purchase tickets. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323017/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323017/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_938_1340.jpg 938w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323017/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1286.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323017/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1029.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323017/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_857.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323017/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_429.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - airtrack" width="938" /></figure>
<p>AirTrack comes with plenty of other innovative features. For example, after setting the flight parameters, users can click the &#8216;Track Prices&#8217; button. This will send a notification to the user when prices go up or down. </p>
<p>Users can set the frequency at which they receive alerts. For instance, hourly or daily. Although AirTrack is free to use, it also offers a premium service. This costs just $12 per year and includes alerts on the best flight deals. It also comes with 24/7 customer support. </p>
<h3><strong>9. Poker Bot &#8211; Play Live Poker With Over 670,000 Other Users </strong></h3>
<p>One of the best Telegram bots for playing poker is Poker Bot. This free-to-use Telegram bot specializes in Texas Hold &#8217;em games. After joining the <a href="https://telegram.me/PokerBot" rel="nofollow">Poker Bot Telegram</a> chat, users will be given 1,500 virtual chips. </p>
<p>These chips are used to place bets in live poker games. That said, Poker Bot lacks when it comes to interactiveness, as it uses emojis and text for each hand. Although this initially slows the pace of the game, the system works well once players understand how things work. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323019/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323019/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_940_1342.jpg 940w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323019/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1285.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323019/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1028.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323019/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_857.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323019/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_428.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - poker bot" width="940" /></figure>
<p>For example, after reviewing their hole cards, players can call, raise, or fold. The specific move is given as a text command. The bot will then ask the next player to make their move. Poker Bot also has a leaderboard that displays the best-performing players, based on their chip count. </p>
<p>Those looking to gamble with cryptocurrencies rather than virtual funds might consider Mega Dice, which is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-casinos.htm">best Telegram casinos</a> for 2023.  </p>
<h3><strong>10. Babelgram &#8211; Instantly Translate Telegram Messages Across Dozens of Languages </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://telegram.im/@babelgrambot" rel="nofollow">Babelgram</a> is one of the most popular Telegram bots around, with more than 60,000 people subscribed to its channel. Put simply, this is the best Telegram bot for translation services. Unlike other bots in this niche, Babelgram translates messages in real-time. </p>
<p>For example, suppose a German speaker joins a Telegram group that is denominated in English. After configuring their settings, all English messages will instantly be translated to German in real-time. Not only that, but Babelgram also works in reverse. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323022/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323022/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_940_1352.jpg 940w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323022/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1294.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323022/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1036.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323022/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_863.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323022/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_431.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - babelgram" width="940" /></figure>
<p>This means that when the German speaker sends a message in their native tongue, it will be posted to the Telegram group in English. Babelgram is completely free but users are required to join its main Telegram group to access the bot. </p>
<h3><strong>11. Taskobot &#8211; Streamline Tasks and Reminders via the Telegram App </strong></h3>
<p>Taskobot is one of the best Telegram apps for setting reminders. Users can ditch their diaries and instead input tasks directly on the Telegram app. After joining the <a href="https://t.me/tasko_bot">Taskobot Telegram chat</a>, users can click on the &#8216;New Personal Task&#8217; button. </p>
<p>Next, they can type in the task that they want to be reminded of. For instance, &#8216;Go for a Run&#8217;. Users can then set the time and date for the event. In doing so, Taskobot will log the request and send a notification when the specified time and date arrives. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323023/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323023/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_934_1338.jpg 934w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323023/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1289.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323023/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1031.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323023/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_860.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323023/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_430.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - taskobot" width="934" /></figure>
<p>Additionally, Taskobot is useful for teams. This is because the bot can be added to custom Telegram groups. Before getting starting, users should configure their preferred timezone, as the bot is unable to detect this automatically. </p>
<h3><strong>12. CryptoBot &#8211; Buy and Sell Crypto on Telegram Without Using an Exchange  </strong></h3>
<p>One of the best Telegram bots for cryptocurrency investors is CryptoBot. No longer do investors need to use an exchange to buy and sell tokens. Instead, CryptoBot brings the cryptocurrency markets to Telegram. </p>
<p>After joining the <a href="https://t.me/CryptoBot">CryptoBot Telegram</a> chat, users can click on the &#8216;Exchange&#8217; button, followed by &#8216;Exchange Now&#8217;. CryptoBot will then list a range of pairs, such as &#8216;ETH/USDT&#8217;, &#8216;BTC/USDT&#8217;, and &#8216;BUSD/USDT&#8217;. After clicking on the preferred pair, CryptoBot lists real-time order books.  </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323024/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323024/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_932_1344.jpg 932w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323024/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1298.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323024/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1038.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323024/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_865.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323024/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_433.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - cryptobot" width="932" /></figure>
<p>For each exchange rate, it displays the amount of liquidity available at that specific price point. Should the user want to proceed, they can swap tokens instantly. But first, users need to fund their CryptoBot wallet.</p>
<p>Users simply need to transfer cryptocurrency to their unique wallet address, which is provided by CryptoBot. The CryptoBot exchange service is completely decentralized. There is no requirement to open an account or provide any personal details. </p>
<h3><strong>13. Chess Exercises &#8211; Puzzle-Style Games for Chess Players   </strong></h3>
<p>Chess fans might find that <a href="https://t.me/chessexercisesbot" rel="nofollow">Chess Exercises</a> is the best Telegram bot for 2023. This is a puzzle-style game that can be played solo or with friends. The bot will initially post an image of a chessboard. This will be a screengrab from a game that is mid-way through. </p>
<p>Chess Exercises will then ask the user what move the player should make. While there isn&#8217;t a right or wrong decision per se, the most favorable move is determined by statistical probability. If the player guesses correctly on the first attempt, they will be awarded points. </p>

<p>The long-term objective is to accumulate points and climb the global leaderboard. Players will be given a second attempt if they guess incorrectly. Players can also ask for the solution if they aren&#8217;t sure &#8211; this will save the player from losing points.   </p>
<h3><strong>14. Quizarium &#8211; Multiplayer Telegram Quiz Game With Custom Topics    </strong></h3>
<p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-games.htm">best Telegram games</a> for quiz fans is <a href="https://telegram.me/QuizariumBot" rel="nofollow">Quizarium</a>. This free Telegram bot allows friends to play quiz games directly on the Telegram app. Players will first need to create a custom Telegram group and manually add the bot. </p>
<p>To start a new game, players need to instruct the bot on what topics they want to cover. For example, music or science. Players can also choose the number of questions in each round. The bot will then post questions as a Telegram message. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323026/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_934_1336.jpg 934w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1287.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1030.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_858.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_429.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - quizarium" width="934" /></figure>
<p>Players will need to reply to the message with their answer in the fastest time possible. Quizarium awards points for each correct answer. Players can also aim to make the global rankings board. This ranks players based on the number of correct answers on a daily and weekly basis. </p>
<h2><strong>What are Telegram Bots?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Telegram bots are increasingly becoming popular, but what exactly are they? In simple terms, Telegram bots are pre-programmed algorithms that replicate specific tasks. They are created by independent developers, rather than Telegram itself. Moreover, users engage with Telegram bots via a chat box.</p>
<p>Each Telegram bot will serve a certain purpose. For example, the Mega Dice Telegram bot facilitates online gambling. It&#8217;s a regulated casino that now offers its services on the Telegram app. So, those using the Mega Dice Telegram bot can gamble cryptocurrencies on casino games like blackjack and plinko. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323027/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323027/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_938_1348.jpg 938w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323027/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_900_1293.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323027/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_720_1035.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323027/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_600_862.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323027/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-___media_library_original_300_431.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - mega dice casino" width="938" /></figure>
<p>Then there&#8217;s  WeathersBot, which provides Telegram users with real-time weather updates. Users simply need to type in their location and WeathersBot offers a localized weather summary. In another example, File Convert is a Telegram bot that allows users to convert images, video, and audio. For instance, converting a JPEG file into a PNG.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Irrespective of the use case, Telegram bots operate autonomously. This means that the bot is not able to &#8216;think&#8217;, much like artificial intelligence. Instead, the Telegram bot can only follow the pre-defined conditions it has been programmed to follow. Nonetheless, Telegram bots are usually free to use, so there is no harm in seeing what&#8217;s out there. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Why Use Telegram Bots?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Telegram bots come in many different shapes and sizes. The use cases will vary widely depending on the individual&#8217;s requirements. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore why Telegram bots are becoming so popular. </p>
<h3><strong>Automation</strong></h3>
<p>One of the main benefits of Telegram bots is that they can automate manual tasks. The possibilities are endless in this regard. </p>
<p>Take Babelgram as a prime example. This Telegram bot allows users to chat on Telegram in any language of their choosing. Everything is automated, so there is no need to keep copying and pasting translations on a third-party website. </p>
<p>For instance, suppose the user speaks English but wants to join a Japanese Telegram group. If they type &#8216;Hello, Good Afternoon&#8217; into the group, the Babelgram bot will automatically translate the message into Japanese. And when users reply in Japanese, the Babelgram bot will show the message in English. </p>
<p>Similarly, File Converter automates the file conversion process. Once again, rather than using a third-party website, users can convert files within the Telegram app. For example, suppose the user has an MP3 file on their smartphone. By directly uploading it to File Converter, the user can instantly convert it to a WAV file. </p>
<h3><strong>Privacy and Anonymity </strong></h3>
<p>Privacy sits at the heart of the Telegram app. Unlike other social platforms like Facebook and Twitter, Telegram does not collect or sell user data. In fact, users are not even required to provide Telegram with their name. Instead, Telegram offers an anonymous service. </p>
<p>This means that the best Telegram bots can also be accessed anonymously. For example, the Mega Dice Telegram bot allows users to gamble without revealing their identity or needing to upload any KYC documents. This will appeal to those that want to gamble privately. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323032/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323032/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-___media_library_original_742_1178.jpg 742w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323032/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-___media_library_original_720_1143.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323032/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-___media_library_original_600_953.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323032/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-___media_library_original_300_476.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - mega dice deposit" width="742" /></figure>
<p>This is in stark contrast to traditional online casinos, which are legally required to collect a government-issued ID from players. But because Mega Dice only deals with cryptocurrencies on Telegram, players can avoid the KYC procedure completely. </p>
<h3><strong>Real-Time Information</strong></h3>
<p>Telegram bots are also useful for obtaining real-time information from the internet. This can be achieved without needing to manually search for data. Some Telegram bots even allow users to set their own preferences on which data to receive and when. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, AirTrack is one of the best Telegram bots for finding cheap flights. </li>
<li>Users can set their departure and arrival airports and the required flight dates. </li>
<li>Initially, AirTrack will scan the internet to find the lowest-priced seats available. </li>
<li>Users will also receive notifications if the price declines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Ordinarily, users would need to manually check flight prices frequently &#8211; so AirTrack simplifies the process.    </p>
<h3><strong>Socialization and Collaboration </strong></h3>
<p>Just like WhatsApp, Telegram is one of the best apps for staying in touch with friends and families. Many of the Telegram bots discussed today can be imported into group chats. This means that Telegram bots promote socialization. </p>
<p>For example, the Hangbot game can be played by two or more friends on Telegram. This is a simple Hangman-style game that requires players to guess hidden words. There are no time limits on Hangbot, so friends can make their move at their own pace. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Telegram bots also promote collaboration between colleagues and team members. For instance, Taskobot allows teams to streamline tasks and objectives through real-time reminders and notifications. The bot could be added to a work-related project to help team members stay on track.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Free-to-Use </strong></h3>
<p>The best Telegram bots are completely free to use. Most developers make bots for their own enjoyment. While some developers will ask for donations to help keep the bot operational, this isn&#8217;t mandatory. </p>
<p>As such, users can try as many Telegram bots as they want without needing to pay any money. We also like that Telegram bots do not display ads. This is usually the case when downloading a free app from the App Store or Google Play. </p>
<h2><strong>Types of Bots on Telegram</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are many different types of bots available on Telegram. As such, there is something to suit all requirements. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore the different types of Telegram bots in the market right now. </p>
<h3><strong>Gaming Bots</strong></h3>
<p>Some of the best Telegram bots are aimed at gamers. For instance, we discussed Hangbot earlier, which is a Hangman-style gaming bot. We also discussed Quizarium, which allows users to play quiz games with their friends. </p>
<p>That being said, Telegram group bots do come with their limitations. This is because most bots use text and emojis, which often means a sub-par gaming experience. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, Poker Bot is a free gaming bot that allows users to play poker. </li>
<li>But instead of hands being played in real-time, </li>
<li>Poker Bot uses a turn-based approach. Initially, the player will see their own cards as emojis. </li>
<li>They will then need to manually type their next move. </li>
<li>For instance, /raise or /fold. The game remains stagnant until the next player takes their turn. </li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless, Telegram bots are not designed to replace conventional gaming consoles. Instead, they offer a free and convenient way to enjoy games on the Telegram app, either solo or with friends. </p>
<h3><strong>Gambling Bots</strong></h3>
<p>Telegram bots look set to revolutionize the online gambling industry. Instead of opening an account with a regular online casino, players can now gamble on the Telegram app. </p>
<p>Put simply, Mega Dice is by far the best Telegram bot for gambling. As we mentioned earlier, Mega Dice is the only licensed casino bot on Telegram. It supports popular casino games like roulette and blackjack via a live pop-up window. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323029/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-___media_library_original_746_1186.jpg 746w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-___media_library_original_720_1145.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-___media_library_original_600_954.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323029/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-___media_library_original_300_477.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - blackjack" width="746" /></figure>
<p>As per the image above, the Mega Dice Telegram casino even supports human dealers. After choosing a table, users will place bets on the Telegram app and the dealer will action it in real-time. This offers a far more enjoyable gambling experience than playing with Telegram emojis.  </p>
<h3><strong>Trading Bots </strong></h3>
<p>Trading bots are also becoming popular on the Telegram app. A good example is CryptoBot. This Telegram bot allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without leaving the Telegram app. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, users join the CryptoBot Telegram chat to reveal their unique wallet address. </li>
<li>Users transfer cryptocurrencies to this address and wait a few minutes for the balance to update. CryptoBot will send a notification on Telegram when this happens. </li>
<li>Then, users can select the cryptocurrency that they want to buy. </li>
<li>After finalizing the request, CryptoBot will complete the swap on behalf of the user. </li>
</ul>
<p>Just like gambling bots, the appeal here is that users can trade cryptocurrencies privately. No accounts are required, so users don&#8217;t need to worry about a cumbersome <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-gb/glossary/kyc">KYC process</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>Information Bots</strong></h3>
<p>Some Telegram bots specialize in real-time information services. This removes the need for users to manually search the internet. </p>
<p>For example, we mentioned earlier that WeathersBot provides real-time weather updates to users. Once the local city is selected, users will receive daily forecasts directly on the Telegram app. Users can also set up notifications.   </p>
<p>Similarly, some Telegram bots alert users when their preferred news website publishes a new article. This enables users to remain up-to-date on specific niches and markets. </p>
<h3><strong>Educational Bots</strong></h3>
<p>Telegram bots can also be used for educational purposes. This is especially the case when learning a new language. </p>
<p>For example, PronunciationBot can instantly convert words into audio across dozens of languages. This helps users to learn the correct pronunciation of specific words and phrases. </p>
<p>Additionally, WordBot is great for understanding the meaning of words. By typing in a word, the Telegram bot instantly gives its definition. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Find Bots on Telegram</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>There are thousands of bots on Telegram across every niche imaginable. But finding the best Telegram bots requires a bit of legwork. There is no centralized database or filters on Telegram, so the only way to find a bot is by searching for its username. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some tips on how to find the best bots on Telegram. </p>
<h3><strong>Use Keywords to Manually Find Bots</strong></h3>
<p>Users with a specific requirement in place can try and find a suitable bot manually. First, open the Telegram app and click on the &#8216;Chat&#8217; icon.</p>
<p>Click on the &#8216;Search&#8217; icon and type in the required bot function. For example, in the image below, we have searched for &#8216;Weather&#8217;. It then shows us Telegram usernames related to our search. We can then see that WeathersBot is displayed, which is the weather forecast bot we discussed earlier. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323031/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323031/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_934_1354.jpg 934w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323031/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_1305.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323031/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_1044.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323031/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_870.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122048/323031/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_435.jpg 300w" alt="Best Telegram Bots - weather" width="934" /></figure>
<p>While this method sometimes works, it depends on how common the keyword is. For example, searching for &#8216;Games&#8217; will bring up a significant number of results. Being more specific will have a more effective outcome. For example, &#8216;Chess Game&#8217; or &#8216;Blackjack Game&#8217;.  </p>
<h3><strong>Join the /TelegramBots Subreddit </strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TelegramBots/">/TelegramBots Subreddit</a> is also worth exploring. With over 30,000 members, this Subreddit group is specifically aimed at Telegram bots. </p>
<p>For instance, when a developer has built a new bot, they will often let the group know. Group members can then test the bot out and leave some feedback. </p>
<h3><strong>Use Third-Party Websites </strong></h3>
<p>There are many third-party websites that offer a real-time directory of the best Telegram bots. <a href="https://telegramchannels.me/bots">TelegramChannels</a> is a great option in this regard. This website offers information on hundreds of Telegram bots. It also has filters so that users can find their preferred bot type. </p>
<p>For instance, users can choose to view bots related to betting, finance, marketing, games, and dozens of other metrics. Moreover, TelegramChannels allows users to rate each Telegram bot. This helps others assess whether or not the bot is worth trying. </p>
<h2><strong>Are Telegram Bots Safe?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Most Telegram bots offer a safe and private experience. Crucially, users are not required to hand over any personal information when using a Telegram bot. In fact, this is also the case when joining Telegram itself &#8211; as the app only requires a mobile number. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Telegram bots are generally free to use. So there isn&#8217;t a requirement to spend money on a bot before trying it. Nor is there a need to enter any sensitive financial details, like credit card or bank account numbers. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>While privacy is a hot commodity on Telegram, it also presents challenges. For example, scammers are prevalent on the Telegram app, not least because they can operate anonymously. So if a Telegram bot asks for personal information &#8211; delete it immediately. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, avoid clicking on any links when using a Telegram bot &#8211; they could be a virus. Restricting private messages from unknown users is also worth considering. This will prevent scammers from being able to make direct contact. This can be switched on in the Telegram settings.  </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In summary, we have discussed some of the best Telegram apps to try today. One of the top picks is TG.Casino, which is a fully licensed Telegram casino. Users do not need to complete any KYC registration, and can access this online casino directly through the Telegram app. </p>
<p>The casino has also just listed its native token, $TGC, on presale. The token is used to get exclusive access to casino games, and earned as rewards. $TGC is currently priced at $0.125 on presale.</p>

<h2><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334962/10-best-cold-wallets.jpg" alt="10 best cold wallets" width="854" /></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cold wallets, also known as hardware wallets, are one of the safest storage solutions for your cryptocurrencies. That’s because they store your wallet’s seed phrase offline while being encrypted. In other words, if a hacker compromises your computer, they won’t be able to see the seed phrase and steal your funds.</p>
<p>What’s more, hardware wallets require that you authorize each transaction by pressing physical buttons. So unless someone holds your hardware wallet and knows your PIN number to unlock it, they can never transfer funds out of your cold wallet. Given that over <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/01/tech/crypto-hacks-2022/index.html"><u>$3.8 billion worth of crypto was stolen in hacks in 2022</u></a>, having a cold wallet could have saved you from being in such a statistic.</p>

<h2><strong>The Best Cold Crypto Wallets Reviewed</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore the most popular cold storage wallets that crypto investors are using right now to secure their altcoin holdings. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Ledger Nano S Plus — Overall Best Cold Crypto Wallet, Supported By Live App</strong></h3>
<p>This is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger’s</u></a> entry-level wallet. But don’t let this fool you. Ledger Nano S Plus offers the same functionality as the more expensive Ledger Nano X. The main difference between the two is that the Ledger Nano X has Bluetooth and it feels like it’s made with higher-quality materials.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334939/ledger-nano-s-plus.jpg" alt="Ledger Nano S Plus" width="900" /></figure>
<p><br />The app that all Ledger devices use is called Ledger Live. This is both a mobile app and a desktop app. You can use it to buy coins with a credit card, swap them using decentralized exchanges like 1Inch and others, or stake your coins.</p>
<p>Ledger Nano S Plus supports over 5,500 coins, which is the same as the more expensive Nano X version, and you can also hold NFTs in your wallet.</p>
<p>Since it doesn’t support Bluetooth connectivity, you can connect your Ledger cold wallet via a USB-C cable with your smartphone or computer. This shouldn’t be a big deal if you mostly use your Ledger wallet for storing coins. If you plan to actively transfer coins or trade, the Ledger Nano X could be the better option due to its Bluetooth support.</p>
<p>Ledger’s support is top-notch. If something happens to your device, say it breaks or malfunctions, Ledger will send you a replacement free of charge. All this makes Ledger Nano S Plus the best cold wallet in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger Live mobile and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports staking, swapping and buying with a card</li>
<li>Over 5,500 coins and tokens supported</li>
<li>Multiple accessories to customize your Ledger</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Bluetooth</li>
<li>No wallet seed phrase backup recovery yet</li>

<h3><strong>2. Trezor Safe 3 — Obscure Transactions &amp; Restore Your Seed Phrase if Lost</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><u>Trezor Safe 3</u></a> is the best offering from Trezor because it offers the same functionality as the most expensive cold wallet but at an affordable price. Trezor Safe 3 comes with a monochromatic OLED screen where you can see the transaction information, and USB-C connectivity since it doesn’t have Bluetooth.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be a dealbreaker, though, as cold wallets are designed for long-term storage and not active trading.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334943/trezor-safe-3.jpg" alt="Trezor Safe 3" width="900" /></figure>
<p>Some of the safety features of this Trezor cold wallet include the Secure Element (EAL6+) and the passphrase to unlock your device, which makes it hard for hackers to steal your assets. Another feature of Trezor cold wallets is the Shamir Backup, which splits your seed phrase into up to 16 pieces to help you recover your seed phrase if you lose it, meaning if you lose one piece or it gets stolen, you can still recover your assets.</p>
<p>As a companion to this Trezor cold wallet is the Trezor Suite app available on mobile, desktop and browser. Via the app, you can send, receive and trade over 8,000 cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>Unlike most cold wallets, Trezor has open-source software, which can be examined by anyone to ensure it&#8217;s safe. Another interesting feature is that you can go incognito with Coinjoin, which lumps multiple transactions into one, thus obscuring your transactions, and you can protect your identity with Tor.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trezor Suite mobile, browser and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports sending, receiving and trading via the app</li>
<li>Affordable price</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Bluetooth</li>

<h3><strong>3. Ledger Stax — Store Over 5,000 Cryptocurrencies, Wireless Charging &amp; Bluetooth Connectivity</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger Stax</u></a> is one of the most innovative cold wallets you can find. It looks like a small ebook reader because of its curved E Ink touchscreen. Because of that, it is mostly designed for storing your NFT collections because you can put your favorite NFT on the screen like an ebook cover.</p>
<p>Aside from its interesting design, it supports wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and it’s highly customizable. This means you can connect your Stax with your Ledger Live mobile app and sign transactions without using cables.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334944/ledger-stax.jpg" alt="Ledger Stax" width="900" /></figure>
<p>As the name suggests, you can “stack” multiple Stax wallets one on top of the other, if you have multiple wallets. For example, one Stax could hold your Ethereum NFTs, a second one could store your Solana NFTs, and a third could store your coins.</p>
<p>Of course, one Stax is enough to hold all of the above. But if you want to have multiple Stax’s, say one for yourself, another for a family member, all with different screen images, you can easily do so.</p>
<p>Similar to the other two Ledgers, Stax uses the Ledger Live mobile and desktop app to swap coins, stake coins or buy them with a card. Also, the Ledger Live app is used to update your cold wallet’s firmware.</p>
<p>With all these features and functionality, Stax comes with an eye-watering price of around $279, which is on the higher end compared to other cold wallets. Despite that, if you are an NFT enthusiast and you can afford it, Stax is one of the best cold wallets you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger Live mobile and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports staking, swapping and buying with a card</li>
<li>Bluetooth and wireless charging</li>
<li>E Ink touchscreen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<li>More expensive than other cold wallets</li>

<h3><strong>4. Trezor Model T — Color Touchscreen Buttons &amp; Added Protection Via MicroSD Card Encrypted PIN</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><u>Trezor Model T</u></a> is Trezor’s premium model that comes with a color LCD touchscreen instead of physical buttons and a micro SD card slot. The first is mostly a design feature, while the second is a premium protection feature. The way it works is, if you enable it, <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/press/thoughtleadership/sd-memory-cards-secure-store-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-offline/"><i><u>a randomly generated secret is stored on the SD card that you can insert into your Trezor Model T for extra protection</u></i></a>.</p>
<p>Everything else is the same as with the other Trezor models. For example, you get access to a mobile, desktop and browser app called Trezor Suite. This comes with coin swapping and trading, as well as sending and receiving coins.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334945/trezor-model-t.jpg" alt="Trezor Model T" width="900" /></figure>
<p>If you want to obscure some of your transactions, you can do so with Coinjoin, which, as the name suggests, “joins” multiple transactions into one to make it hard for outsiders to tell which transaction was yours. This feature is available to the other Trezor models as well.</p>
<p>Some of its safety features include the Secure Element (EAL6+) and the passphrase to unlock your device, which makes it hard for hackers to steal your assets. Another safety feature of Trezor cold wallets is the Shamir Backup. This splits your seed phrase into multiple pieces and even if one piece gets lost or is stolen, you can still recover your assets with the remaining pieces.</p>

<ul>
<li>Trezor Suite mobile, browser and desktop app</li>

<li>LCD Touchscreen</li>
<li>Micro SD card protection</li>

<h3><strong>5. ELLIPAL Titan Cold Wallet — Fully Metal-Sealed With Auto-Self Destruct if Tampering is Detected</strong> </h3>
<p>ELLIPAL Titan Cold Wallet is one of the leading cold wallets due to its safety features and usability with an affordable price compared to similar cold wallets.</p>
<p>For starters, the Titan Cold Wallet is designed with 100% security in mind. It’s air-gapped, meaning there’s no Bluetooth, WiFi or cellular connection, and it uses anti-disassembly and anti-tamper technology that it “self-destructs” if it detects tampering. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334946/ellipal-titan.jpg" alt="ELLIPAL Titan Cold Wallet" width="900" /></figure>
<p>The wallet firmware is updated offline using micro SD cards, meaning you don’t need a US connection to update it. Also, you can activate two-factor authentication, PIN or password to unlock your device.</p>
<p>The wallet supports over 10,000 coins and NFTs without installing any apps as you need with other cold wallets.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-tampering removes your information from the device</li>
<li>10,000 coins and NFTs supported</li>
<li>Micro SD card protection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<h3><strong>6. KeepKey — Affordable Option With Native Thorchain Exchange Integration </strong></h3>
<p>KeepKey is an affordable cold wallet with integrated Thorchain exchange for seamless swapping of coins and a Dapp Store where you can connect to decentralized applications like OpenSea to exchange NFTs, Uniswap, Etherscan and 1inch exchange.</p>
<p>To access the Dapp Store, you need to download the KeepKey desktop app. Via the app, you can manage your crypto portfolio by exchanging or transacting over 2,500 supported coins and NFTs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334947/keepkey.jpg" alt="KeepKey" width="900" /></figure>
<p>To increase your wallet’s security, KeepKey supports a PIN number or two-factor authentication to access your device. This means even if someone steals your KeepKey wallet, they won’t be able to access it unless they can go through these two safety features.</p>
<p>Given the wallet costs around $79, there are no premium features like Bluetooth or wireless support. You’ll need to use a micro USB cable to connect to your computer to authorize transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Affordable price</li>
<li>2,500 coins and tokens supported</li>
<li>Desktop app</li>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>7. Blockstream Jade — Bitcoin-Only Crypto Cold Wallet With Multisig Technology</strong></h3>
<p>Blockstream Jade is a Bitcoin-only cold wallet that comes with several unique features, including a camera for scanning QR codes and multisig technology that requires multiple keys to send a transaction, which makes it even harder for hackers and scammers to steal your funds.</p>
<p>With multisig, there are two keys: the first key is held on your device, which is backed by your seed phrase, and the second key is held on the Blockstream Green servers, which are protected by two-factor authentication.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334948/blockstream-jade.jpg" alt="Blockstream Jade" width="900" /></figure>
<p>Blockstream Jade’s QR camera is another safety feature that allows you to scan QR codes and sign transactions without connecting to any other device like your computer or smartphone.</p>
<p>Despite that, this cold wallet also comes with Bluetooth and USB-C connectivity. To manage your crypto portfolio, there’s a wallet called Blockstream Green, which supports multisig security and Tor for privacy.</p>
<p>With all these features and a price of $64.99, this is a cold wallet worth considering especially if you only want to hold Bitcoin in your crypto portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Affordable price</li>

<li>Camera for scanning QR codes</li>

<h2><strong>What is a Cryptocurrency Cold Wallet?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A crypto cold storage wallet, also known as a hardware wallet, is a device with specifically designed hardware to encrypt and store your wallet’s seed phrase offline and in a safe environment. Hot wallets, on the other hand, store your seed phrase online. If a hacker has access to your computer, they can see your seed phrase and use it to steal your funds.</p>
<p>Cold wallets typically have physical buttons, or touchscreen buttons depending on the device, which are used for signing transactions on the blockchain. This makes it hard for scammers and hackers to steal your funds unless they physically hold the device. What’s more, each cold wallet is locked with a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA. The fraudsters will also need to know that to unlock your wallet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334952/ledger.jpg" alt="Ledged crypto app" width="900" /><br />Using a companion app, these wallets can store crypto assets including cryptocurrencies and NFTs. You can also trade, swap, stake and more with these apps, giving cold wallets the same functionality as hot wallets but with added security.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can connect your cold wallet to a hot wallet like MetaMask or Phantom, which makes connecting to DeFi applications seamless. For every transaction you make, you will have to sign it with the buttons on your device.</p>
<h2><strong>How do Cold Wallets Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>All cold storage crypto wallets have a seed phrase, consisting of 12 or 24 words, which you can use to restore your wallet and access your crypto funds in case something happens to your computer or smartphone. That’s because your crypto wallet and assets are stored on the blockchain. Using the seed phrase you actually prove that you own the wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Cold Wallets Store Your Seed Phrase Offline</strong></h3>
<p>Cold wallets generate and store the user’s private keys on the physical device. This means the seed phrase is never exposed on your computer screen while you’re connected to the Internet. This way, hackers can never see your seed phrase via your computer even if your computer is compromised.</p>
<p>If the user needs to restore a private key, they enter the seed phrase directly on the device itself, which is encrypted and offline.</p>
<h3><strong>You Need to Press a Button to Sign Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>Aside from keeping your seed phrase safe, cold wallets have another safety feature. You have to physically press buttons on the cold wallet to authorize transactions. This way, no one can authorize the transaction except the person who holds the cold wallet device.</p>
<p>To increase security, cold wallets use a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA to unlock the device. If someone manages to steal your hardware wallet, they would need to know your access codes to unlock it.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>Why Is The Seed Phrase Important?</strong></h3>
<p>The crypto wallet seed phrase, often made of 12 to 24 randomly generated words, is the backup key to your wallet. This sequence of words is linked to the private keys and acts as a mnemonic representation to retrieve access to the assets within the wallet.</p>
<p>For example, you create a crypto wallet and you don’t save the seed phrase. If you need to reinstall your operating system, someone steals your computer or your cold wallet breaks and you don’t know your wallet’s seed phrase, you won’t be able to access your digital wallet and your funds will be trapped.</p>
<p>To protect your seed phrase, you need to write it down on a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe. Some cold wallet providers, like Ledger, sell metal seed phrase protectors that can withstand fire and damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Advantages of Cold Crypto Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The main advantage of a cold wallet is enhanced security. Since you need to physically press buttons on the wallet, you are safe from remote access hacks. </p>
<h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>
<p>The best advantage of cold crypto wallets is their superior protection against online vulnerabilities. Cold wallets aren’t connected to the internet, making them immune to cyber attacks.</p>
<p>This includes protection from hacking attempts, phishing schemes, malware infections and other malicious activities. By storing private keys offline, cold wallets ensure that access to your funds is protected. </p>
<h3><strong>Unauthorized Access Protection</strong></h3>
<p>Cold wallets require that you physically press a button to sign a transaction. In the unfortunate event that a malicious actor has gained access to your computer accounts and companion cold wallet app, they can’t move your funds without you pressing the buttons.</p>
<p>This acts as a physical barrier against unauthorized access and theft, giving you peace of mind that your funds are protected even when you sleep.</p>
<h3><strong>Long-Term Safekeeping</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto cold wallets are designed for the long-term storing of your crypto assets. That’s because the safety feature of pressing buttons to authorize transactions can become a nuisance if you plan to use your cold wallet device for active trading. What’s more, active trading requires that you connect to multiple decentralized apps, which could potentially pose a threat if they’re hacked.</p>
<p>Unlike hot wallets, which are designed for frequent transactions and daily use, cold wallets are better suited for &#8220;hodling&#8221;, which is for keeping your assets safe long-term.</p>
<h3><strong>Immune to Platform Failures</strong></h3>
<p>Online platforms and exchanges are known to experience downtimes, glitches and even hacks. For example, <a href="https://decrypt.co/150669/defi-exchange-curve-finance-confirms-various-ethereum-pools-hacked"><u>DeFi exchange Curve Finance had various Ethereum pools hacked</u></a> where $52 million were stolen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/13/north-korean-attackers-linked-to-54m-coinex-hack-blockchain-data-suggests/"><u>CoinEx lost $54 million in a hack</u></a>. If you had funds in these two platforms or any other where the assets were compromised, you could have lost all your funds.</p>
<p>Cold wallets eliminate this risk because you have full control over your assets and how they move.</p>
<h2><strong>Cold Wallets vs Hot Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Both cold wallets and hot wallets are designed to store your digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But there are some differences between the two.</p>
<h3><strong>Assets Safety</strong></h3>
<p>One of the main differences between cold wallets and hot wallets is safety. Hot wallets provide you with a seed phrase visible on your computer screen or smartphone when you open a new wallet. Cold wallets, on the other hand, provide you with a seed phrase directly on the screen of the hardware wallet, which isn’t connected to the internet.</p>
<p>This means that unless someone looks directly at your hardware wallet’s screen when you read and write the 12 to 24 words, there is no way that they can know your seed phrase to steal your funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Transaction Execution</strong></h3>
<p>Another difference between these two types of wallets is how transactions are executed. You can sign transactions with one click using hot wallets, which makes it an excellent choice for frequent trading or using decentralized apps.</p>
<p>Cold wallets, however, have buttons that you have to physically press to sign the transaction. What’s more, you need to unlock your crypto cold wallet device with a PIN, a passphrase or 2FA. This makes signing transactions more complex but also safer.</p>
<h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Due to being safer, the best cold wallets are designed for long-term safekeeping. This means that once you buy your crypto assets, you send them to your cold wallet and you leave them there until you decide to sell.</p>
<p>Hot wallets are designed to be exploited daily. Connect your hot wallets to decentralized exchanges, yield farming protocols or NFT marketplaces and feel free to continuously sign transactions. You can always move your profits into your cold wallets for safekeeping.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose a Cold Cryptocurrency Wallet</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Choosing the best cold wallet is a decision that requires weighing in several factors, including security features, supported cryptocurrencies, mobile app experience as well as pricing.</p>
<h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>This is the main reason to get a cold wallet. But there are nuances that you have to consider as not all cold wallets are created equal. For example, some users prefer Bluetooth connectivity so they can easily sign transactions on their smartphones without using cables.</p>
<p>Other users may consider Bluetooth as a liability and prefer to have air-gapped devices, meaning they have no wireless contact of any kind that could compromise security.</p>
<p>Also, look for wallets that have a proven track record of security, like Ledger and Trezor, which employ strong encryption methods. Additionally, consider the wallet&#8217;s recovery options. In case the wallet is lost or damaged you will have to use your seed phrase to access your wallet.</p>
<p>But sometimes you could lose your seed phrase as well. Every Trezor cold wallet has a solution for this via something called Shamir Backup where you split your seed phrase into several pieces. If one piece is lost or stolen, you can still recover your wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334956/ledger-recover.jpg" alt="Ledger Recover" width="900" /></figure>
<p>Ledger has recently employed a similar <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/24/crypto-wallet-maker-ledger-officially-rolls-out-recover-unleashing-fresh-round-of-snark/"><u>wallet recovery feature called Ledger Recover</u></a>. This is a paid feature where you have to submit valid ID documents and a selfie recording. Once approved, your device will encrypt your seed phrase and split it into three fragments, which will be used to recover your seed phrase. Because your seed phrase is locked to your ID, you can be the only one who can request the recovery fragments.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>What is Shamir Backup?</strong></h3>
<p>Shamir Backup is a security standard that aims to protect your seed phrase. The way it works is your seed phrase is split up into pieces, called recovery shares, and you can store them at various places. If one of the pieces is lost or damaged, you can still recover your assets.</p>
<p>Recovery shares are sequences of 20 or 33 words that carry part of the cryptographic secret. When you combine the number of shares you create a master seed, which you can use to recover your wallet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3>
<p>Most crypto cold wallets support the most popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, but they also support thousands of other coins and tokens. However, some wallets, like Blockstream Jade, support only Bitcoin and no other coin.</p>
<p>That is why you have to consider what you really need before buying a cold wallet. If you only want to hold Bitcoin and sell it in 10 years, then Blockstream Jade could be a perfect wallet; it’s cheaper, it’s reliable and it’s safe. But if you want to store multiple coins and do multi-chain swaps, then Trezor or Ledger wallets are typically the way to go.</p>
<h3><strong>Companion Mobile App</strong></h3>
<p>Even though cold wallets are designed to be offline storage devices, most of them come with companion mobile apps that allow you to monitor your portfolio, to initiate transactions, to stake your idle coins, to use decentralized apps like Uniswap and 1inch exchange, and more.</p>
<p>That is why it’s important to consider cold storage wallets that meet your requirements. Ledger’s Ledger Live app is one of the best companion apps, where you can stake your idle coins. This feature isn’t available in most other cold wallet apps.</p>
<p>Another valuable app is the Trezor Suite, which has similar functionalities to Ledger Live, but it can also help obscure your transactions with Coinjoin.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334958/trezor-suite.jpg" alt="Trezor Suite" width="900" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Device Cost</strong></h3>
<p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/21/mark-cuban-lost-nearly-900000-dollars-to-crypto-hackers.html"><u>Mark Cuban lost nearly $900,000 to crypto hackers</u></a> by installing a fake MetaMask app. If this happened to him it could happen to everyone. That’s why it’s important to own a cold wallet and never share your seed phrase regardless of the device’s cost.</p>
<p>However, if two or more devices share a similar price point while offering the same functionality, you could spend the extra money investing in crypto. Compare the wallets you are willing to get and see whether paying a premium is worth it.</p>
<h2><strong>Limitations of Cold Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While cold wallets offer security advantages, there are some limitations to consider. Before opting for a cold wallet, weigh the benefits against the potential inconveniences associated with cold storage.</p>
<p>Susceptible to physical attacks. Someone could steal your hardware wallet or it could be damaged or lost. If you don’t have your seed phrase ready, you won’t be able to recover your assets.</p>
<p>Regular transactions. Cold wallets are designed for storage, which makes them inconvenient for everyday transaction signing. That’s because you have to physically press a button every time you wish to make a transaction. If you’re making hundreds of transactions each day, it could be tedious to approve them every time on your hardware wallet.</p>
<p>Cost. While hot wallets are free to use, cold wallets come with a purchase price. Of course, this is a small price to pay for the safety of your crypto assets. But you still have to weigh in whether you really need a cold wallet or not for your intended use cases.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The 10 best cold wallets for 2023 stand out not only for their robust security features but also for their user-friendly companion apps, a wide range of coin support and innovative functionalities. Whether you’re a beginner in the crypto space or a seasoned investor, buying a cold wallet is probably one of the most prudent investments you can make.</p>
<p>Consider one of the three Ledger devices to hold your crypto assets. These are some of the best on the market, with strong safety features and a mobile app that lets you stake your coins or trade them whenever you want.</p>
<p>Ledger S Plus supports over 5,500 coins for an affordable price. But if you’re looking for Bluetooth connectivity, Ledger Nano X could be a better option.</p>
