										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week in crypto: a lot! This a lot included Binance, CZ, Sam Altman, OpenAI, Kraken, Coinbase, lawsuits, banks, hacks…</p>
<p>First up: Binance! What a week for the exchange. Prosecutors were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-prosecutors-move-to-block-former-binance-ceo-cz-return-to-uae.htm">pressing a federal judge to prevent former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao from leaving the US</a> before his scheduled sentencing hearing, and then, CZ was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-cz-released-on-175-million-bond.htm">released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond after his guilty plea</a>, and as part of the settlement with the US DOJ, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">CZ resigned from Binance which agreed to pay a hefty $4.3 billion</a> in penalties. Binance wallets <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-wallets-move-approximately-4-billion-in-stablecoin-ahead-of-doj-settlement.htm">moved $3.9 billion worth of USDT</a> ahead of the settlement, CZ was reportedly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-still-worth-15-billion-despite-guilty-plea-forbes.htm">still worth $15 billion</a> despite pleading guilty to federal money laundering charges, and former Head of Regional Markets <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">Richard Teng took over as CEO</a>.</p>
<p>Per one report, Binance’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nansen-report-binances-total-asset-holdings-remain-stable-after-doj-settlement.htm">total asset holdings remained stable</a> after the DOJ settlement, another said the outflow was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptoquant-reports-decline-in-binances-bitcoin-reserves-as-retail-flow-shifts-to-coinbase.htm">shifting towards Coinbase</a>, JPMorgan said Binance’s settlement marked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-says-binances-record-4-3b-settlement-removes-systemic-risk-calls-it-positive.htm">a positive development for the company</a> and the broader cryptocurrency sector, Bernstein argued Binance will <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bernstein-report-binance-will-remain-the-top-global-crypto-exchange-despite-doj-settlement.htm">maintain its position as the dominant global exchange</a>, and Brian Armstrong stated the settlement is a chance for the industry <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-sees-binance-settlement-as-chance-for-industry-renewal.htm">to prioritize rule clarity to prevent regulators from slamming huge fines</a> on companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AltmanGate continued and became only weirder. Top management of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/openai-scrambles-to-prevent-staff-from-leaving-having-intense-discussions-report.htm">OpenAI was scrambling to “reunify” the organization</a> following the dramatic ousting of the co-founder Sam Altman, and WLD jumped amid the news that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoins-wld-gains-6-as-sam-altman-joins-microsoft-to-lead-its-new-ai-research-team.htm">Microsoft hired Altman and Greg Brockman</a>. But then a twist! Altman <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-altman-to-return-back-to-openai-whats-going-on.htm">will return back to run the company as the CEO</a> under a new board.</p>
<p>The US regulators weren’t done, though. The SEC came after Kraken again, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-faces-sec-charges-for-unlawful-crypto-trading-operations.htm">claiming securities law violations and internal control failures</a>, Jesse Powell called the US regulators <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm">masochists attacking America and extortionists chasing crypto companies</a> out of the country, and US Senator <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/senator-cynthia-lummis-slams-sec-for-its-ruling-by-enforcement-approach-following-kraken-lawsuit.htm">Cynthia Lummis slammed the SEC for its “ruling by enforcement” approach</a> following the Kraken lawsuit. Meanwhile, Coinbase again called on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-seeks-us-courts-assistance-to-compel-sec-on-crypto-rule-making.htm">the US justice system to persuade the SEC</a> to provide clear regulatory guidelines on crypto assets.</p>
<p>In other legal news, the judge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sbf-granted-post-trial-extension-in-new-signed-order.htm">granted an extension to Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers</a> to submit their post-trial motions on December 1, Apple faced <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/apple-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-blocking-p2p-payments-for-crypto-apps.htm">class action lawsuit over blocking P2P payments</a> for crypto apps, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/genesis-files-lawsuit-against-former-business-partner-gemini-trust-seeking-to-recover-689-million.htm">Genesis Global Capital sued Gemini Trust</a> in an attempt to reclaim over $689 million, the trial of the CEO of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trial-of-bithumb-operators-ceo-begins.htm">Bithumb’s parent company began in Seoul</a>, Mt. Gox creditors were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mt-gox-creditors-to-receive-bitcoin-payments-starting-2023-based-on-rehabilitation-plan.htm">informed of a repayment plan beginning in 2023</a>, and Steven Nerayoff’s attorney said they have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/steven-nerayoff-lawsuits-will-reveal-facts-supporting-claims-against-key-ethereum-figures-says-attorney.htm">ample evidence to back up the lawsuits against the US Government and private actors</a>, some of which will implicate major players in Ethereum’s early days. Meanwhile, the director of “47 Ronin” <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hollywood-meets-crypto-director-uses-netflix-funds-for-risky-dogecoin-bet.htm">took nearly $60 million that Netflix had given him for a sci-fi series to invest in crypto</a> and stocks.</p>

<p>As the tech world undergoes a paradigm shift from Web2 to Web3, developers and companies are navigating uncharted waters in a quest to transition smoothly into the future of decentralized internet &#8211; one of the champions leading this transition is <a href="https://blog.tenderly.co/author/bogdan-habic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bogdan Habic</a>, the Co-Founder and CTO of Tenderly, a <a href="https://tenderly.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-stack infrastructure solutions provider</a> powering Web3 development teams across the globe.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with CryptoNews.com, Bogdan delves deep into the intricacies of this transition, the pivotal role of infrastructure, and how Tenderly is pre-emptively addressing the scalability quandaries of the burgeoning blockchain universe.</p>
<h2><strong>From Web2 to Web3: Deciphering the Intricacies of a Paradigm Shift</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“Transitioning from Web2 to Web3 presents a unique set of challenges for developers,” begins <a href="https://github.com/BogdanHabic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bogdan</a>, shedding light on the intricate journey of evolving paradigms.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Web3, the veil of security through obscurity is lifted, introducing a new dimension of programmability of value, which can be quite daunting initially.</p>
<p>“Web3 operates in a more constrained runtime environment, which might resonate with embedded systems programmers but could be a hurdle for others who are used to more flexible environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where Tenderly’s “TX preview” or simulations come into play, providing a risk-free environment for both newcomers and seasoned experts to experiment, test, and <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/take-your-smart-contract-development-to-the-next-level-with-tenderly-5fe58d2fa7d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refine</a> their decentralized applications (dapps) and transactions,&#8221; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/bogdan-habic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bogdan</a> explains.</p>
<p>“Developers can gain insights into asset transfers, gas and resource consumption, transaction success probabilities, and much more, all without making any on-chain commitments.”</p>
<p>&#8220;This enhances the security and predictability of the dapps, significantly improving both the user and developer experience, and making the transition from Web2 to Web3 smoother and more intuitive.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Pillars of Progress: How Tenderly Infrastructure Is Shaping the Future of Decentralized Ecosystems</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124800" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698834540-1_gxrx7e3g729yiokaygtnxg.png" alt="" width="1212" height="572" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698834540-1_gxrx7e3g729yiokaygtnxg.png 1212w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698834540-1_gxrx7e3g729yiokaygtnxg-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698834540-1_gxrx7e3g729yiokaygtnxg-1024x483.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698834540-1_gxrx7e3g729yiokaygtnxg-768x362.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698834540-1_gxrx7e3g729yiokaygtnxg-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698834540-1_gxrx7e3g729yiokaygtnxg-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1212px) 100vw, 1212px" /></p>
<p>In the context of Tenderly’s impressive funding trajectory, which last year saw the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/02/blockchain-infra-startup-tenderly-raises-40m-after-seeing-500x-yoy-revenue-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firm raise $40m in funding amid 500% YoY</a> revenue growth, Bogdan emphasizes the intrinsic role of infrastructure in fostering expansive Web3 adoption against a backdrop of a general downtrend in Web3 start-up investments.</p>
<p>“Infrastructure plays a pivotal role in the evolution and adoption of Web3 technologies. It’s essential to have a solid foundation to support and nurture the growth of ground-breaking dApps,” he explains.</p>
<p>&#8221; It&#8217;s akin to a delicate balance, almost like the chicken and the egg dilemma &#8211; there is a transition happening slowly toward a dapp-centric focus. However, the innovation in dapps is heavily reliant on the robustness of the underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tenderly’s holistic platform integrates the best of Web2’s refined developer experiences with Web3’s innovative possibilities, acting as a bridge between the two worlds.</p>
<p>“Tools like our Simulations and TestNets embody this philosophy, offering something that isn&#8217;t possible in Web2 while being rooted in the best practices of both worlds,” Bogdan elaborates.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s almost like our Trojan horse, subtly introducing Web2 developers to the vast potentials of Web3, facilitating a smoother transition, and encouraging broader participation in the decentralized ecosystems.&#8221;</p>

Source: a video screenshot, NFT NYC / YouTube</figcaption></figure><p>Talking with <i>Cryptonews</i>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-role-could-nfts-play-in-e-commerce-10407.htm">Justin Banon</a>, Co-Founder of Web3&rsquo;s decentralized commerce layer <strong>Boson Protocol</strong>, discussed why legacy brands dress up Web2 into <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/republiks-6-million-funding-boosts-valuation-75-million-web3-quest-crypto-funding-making-comeback.htm">Web3</a>, and how the next bull run will separate &lsquo;fake&rsquo; from &lsquo;real&rsquo; Web3 solutions.</p><p>Commenting on crypto use cases and the potential for mass adoption, Banon opined that &ldquo;Web3 commerce is poised to be the next killer application for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain</a>, tapping into the multi-trillion-dollar market of real-world products and integrating them on chain.&rdquo;</p><p>The Web3 allure has been &ldquo;somewhat tarnished&rdquo; recently due to the unfavorable media attention towards <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-wrote-a-draft-twitter-thread-for-alameda-closure-two-months-before-ftx-collapse.htm"><strong>FTX</strong></a> and market downturns, he said.</p><p>Nonetheless, Web3 remains a revolutionary technology recognized by brands and consumers, and Web3-labeled innovations are still appealing to mainstream audiences.</p><p>Per Banon,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;As we transition from this bear market and approach a potential bull phase &mdash; anticipated to be driven by the forthcoming approval of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/etfs-are-inevitable-but-not-imminent-crypto-expert-argues.htm">Bitcoin ETFs</a>, and the influx of possibly hundreds of billions into cryptocurrency &mdash; it&#8217;s evident that crypto is poised to gain widespread acceptance. Brands are eager to tap into this emerging, affluent, and cool market.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2>True Web3 Companies Will Rise</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Web3 commerce is still in its infancy, Banon warned.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the applications we see are &ldquo;not authentic Web3&rdquo; &ndash; rather, brands have integrated blockchain technology, including non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tattoos-as-nfts-machine-paves-way-for-artist-royalties-heres-how-it-works-1.htm">NFTs</a>), but maintained the Web2 business models.</p><p>These implementations are missing the fundamental principles inherent to true Web3.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, &lsquo;Web3 Washing&rsquo; prevents brands from benefiting from &ldquo;some very special properties&rdquo; of Web3:</p><ul><li>assets with Web3 hard property rights are programmable, having rules encoded in the underlying substrate &#8211; &ldquo;think DeFi for commerce&rdquo; &#8211; which introduces features such as enforceable secondary royalties on physical products and seamless global settlements;</li><li>by utilizing open protocol standards on public blockchains, instead of private database proprietary formats, assets become interoperable, creating a global, digital marketplace for both on chain and real world assets;</li><li>by building with authentic Web3 technologies, applications can be plugged together like finance and commerce &lsquo;LEGO&rsquo;, with hard tokenized assets flowing reliably across an extended ecosystem &ndash; &ldquo;think DeFi across finance, commerce, and the whole Web3 economy.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>To consumers, Web3 commerce offers protection from economic exploitation, data misuse, and monopolistic practices, Banon argues.&nbsp;</p><p>He opined, however, that companies that are able to use the tech to its full potential will rise soon: the adoption of fake Web3 may continue short-term, but over time, he expects Web3 commerce to mature towards &ldquo;real Web3.&rdquo;</p><p>He argued that,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;As the next bull run unfolds, we will see the crypto community once again emerge as an affluent and financially active demographic.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>This demographic will choose real Web3 products as it understands and values the principles of Web3.</p><p>Subsequently, brands will be driven by their desire to access this crypto demographic and will implement real Web3 solutions.</p><h2>Emperor&#8217;s Web3 Clothes</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Current physical &#8216;Web3&#8217; commerce implementations largely operate in a Web2, centralized manner, Banon explained.</p><p>Sellers mint an NFT, selling it with a promise of redeeming it for a physical item, mirroring fiat banknotes&#8217; &#8220;I promise to pay the bearer on demand&#8221; pledge, he said, and added:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;This isn&#8217;t genuine Web3. These aren&#8217;t hard property rights; they resemble checks, payment cards, or vouchers. They&#8217;re vulnerable to rugpulls. If an issuer defaults, bearers face the legal system, which is slow, costly, and riskier than the automatic enforcement of Web3&#8217;s hard property rights.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Even recent proposals, like NFT marketplace <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-opensea-executive-entangled-anubisdao-rug-pull-allegations.htm"><strong>OpenSea</strong></a>&#8216;s &lsquo;<a href="https://opensea.io/blog/articles/redeemables-standard-roadmap">redeemable standard</a>&rsquo;, don&#8217;t address these issues, he said.</p><p>What we are seeing is not a new phenomenon. In his book &lsquo;The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma&rsquo;, Clayton Christensen writes that established companies often incorporate disruptive technologies into their existing business models &ndash; but they fail, as they overlook the changing needs of a rapidly growing user base and don&rsquo;t take advantage of the tech&rsquo;s competitive potential.</p><p>Brands are engaging in &lsquo;Web3 Washing&rsquo; for a variety of reasons:</p><ul><li>legacy sellers often do not understand the true values and benefits of authentic Web3 commerce &mdash; a disadvantage that has historically been fatal for incumbents;</li><li>a significant portion of current customers neither understand nor care about the nuances of authentic Web3 commerce;</li><li>many sellers are following commerce patterns established for NFTs, thus overlooking the fact that physical Web3 commerce has its own set of hard challenges not addressed by digital Web3 commerce patterns.</li></ul><p>And this is not all. According to Banon,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Compounding these issues, there&#8217;s a burgeoning industry of Web3 agencies, NFT consultants, software providers, and NFT marketplaces. These entities, under the guise of expertise, are essentially promoting Web2 business models dressed as Web3 commerce, providing brands with narratives that are easy to digest and sell.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Sellers &ndash; and this may be their biggest challenge &ndash; are not even capable of developing genuine solutions for physical Web3 commerce.</p><p>But, there is a solution: this challenge, Banon says, is surmountable through alliances with authentic Web3 protocols.</p>

In 24 hours, the presale price will increase and investors will have to pay more to secure their tokens.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The growing traffic to the presale hints that an early sell-out is on the horizon for SCORP, which has quickly become one of the most viral tokens of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The project has raised $1,250,000 in the presale so far.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">A new contender in GambleFi</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Online gambling is widely popular. The dynamic segment has been garnering a lot of attention due to its ease of access and instant payments. Online gambling sector within the Web3 sector, in particular, is fast-growing. Another play-to-earn sector within GambleFi that&rsquo;s attracting users is sports betting.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A blockchain foundation gives these projects transparency and fairness, unlike anything seen in the traditional or online spaces. Since all transactions on the blockchain are recorded on an immutable, decentralized ledger, nobody can tamper with them. Manipulations in favor of the houses are so common in the traditional gambling space that users have found a safe haven in blockchain-based online gambling platforms like Scorpion Casino.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The massive reception of Rollbit Coin, which went on to climb 5000% this year, is another example of the shifting trend. While Rollbit Coin has saturated due to its high market cap, Scorpion Casino is preparing to follow a higher trajectory.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Accessible, inclusive</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">According to recent reports, the online gambling market is poised to reach a staggering valuation of $145.6 billion by the year 2030. The industry presents a plethora of investment opportunities if you make it to the market at the right time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">But If you lack the financial resources and industry expertise, it&rsquo;s not for you. Furthermore, project launches often take up to a year to materialize. Time, capital, and technical barriers limit the entry to the market and confine it into the hands of a few.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While establishing a casino might seem like an elusive dream after going through these statistics, the truth is more optimistic. What we discussed above is only applicable to the traditional casino sector.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126085/332918/image1.jpg" srcset="" width="" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p style="text-align:justify;">The Web3 sector, being community-centric, offers a fresh perspective. Web3-based casinos take an inclusive approach when it comes to investments and participation. In other words, a platform like Scorpion Casino allows individuals to become investors with a budget as modest as $100.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Scorpion Casino opens doors to the thriving gambling sector for individuals from diverse financial and career backgrounds through SCORP. The native crypto plays a pivotal role in enabling various payments and rewarding activities within the ecosystem. It powers the accessibility and inclusivity of the platform.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Scorpion Casino has a rich ecosystem</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Scorpion Casino caters to the various preferences of its global user base. Within its virtual walls, you will find a wide range of thrilling casino, live betting, sports betting, and crash games.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To give you a better sense of the scale, Scorpion Casino delivers 30,000 betting opportunities each month. With SCORP tokens, you can access more than 210 casino games, spanning a wide spectrum from classic slots and blackjack to the excitement of roulette and poker.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126085/332919/image2.jpg" srcset="" width="" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p style="text-align:justify;">Being sourced from reputable gaming providers like Evolution, NetEnt, Play N Go, Novomatic, EGT, and AMATIC, they ensure the highest safety and user experience.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Sports enthusiasts, on the other hand, can access sports betting contests in 35 different sports. If you have spent countless hours watching sports channels, you can now put your knowledge to practical use and potentially earn attractive rewards doing so.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ready to up your online gambling game? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br><br>Presale: <a href="https://t.co/Ea4J2bfTi4">https://t.co/Ea4J2bfTi4</a><br><br>Scorpion Casino has your back with educational resources and expert strategies.

Clearly, utility and user bases are not enough to stabilize the price growth of a token. A vibrant ecosystem alone can&rsquo;t save a project when a market crash hits.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This is where deflationary tokenomics comes into play.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Scorpion Casino has introduced innovative burning and staking mechanisms as tools to mitigate the impact of the inevitable crashes that hit the market from time to time. But unlike most competitors, it doesn&#8217;t rely solely on tokenomics.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Scorpion Casino sets aside a portion of its daily profits to support both its stake-to-earn and burning mechanisms equally.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126085/332920/image5.jpg" srcset="" width="" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><h2 style="text-align:justify;">SCORP is set to go 10X in 2023</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Scorpion Casino stands out as a robust investment in the crowded crypto market, backed by a plethora of gambling utilities. Moreover, it maintains resilience against market fluctuations through its utility and dual deflationary mechanisms.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126085/332921/image4.jpg" srcset="" width="" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>A 10X value appreciation in 2023 is a realizable goal for SCORP on its launch. The grand reception of the presale is a preview of the coming bull runs. With more features and security standards, Rollbit is poised for an even more dynamic journey in the coming year.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/scorpion-casino/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">Check out Scorpion Casino</a></div></div>

And if a meaningful portion of the company&rsquo;s user base embraces its stablecoin for low-fee transactions, merchants will follow suit, pushing the stablecoin into mainstream adoption.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve seen many negative opinions about <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PYUSD&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PYUSD</a> (PayPal&#39;s stablecoin).<br><br>PayPal has 420 million users globally and spends $2.7 billion yearly on maintenance. <br><br>Stablecoins like PYUSD could cut costs significantly.

Without stablecoins, overall trading volume and liquidity in the crypto market would likely drop 75%.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Tether, with a market cap exceeding $80 billion, is the most traded cryptocurrency on earth and alone accounts for more than half of all cryptocurrency trading volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Within the top 100 traded cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are the most popular and highest-volume trading pair as they provide a stable medium of exchange, making it easier for traders to execute arbitrage opportunities.</p><p>In 2022, stablecoins executed $7.4 trillion worth of transactions, up from $6 trillion in 2021, according to data from CoinMetrics.</p><p>To put this into perspective, the stablecoin sector beat out top credit card companies including Mastercard with $2.2 trillion in volume, American Express with $1 trillion in volume, and Discover with $200 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Only Visa drove more volume than stable tokens, settling $12 trillion worth of transactions in 2022.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) In 2022, stablecoins settled over $11tn onchain, dwarfing the volumes processed by PayPal ($1.4tn), almost surpassing the payment volume of Visa ($11.6tn), and reaching 14% of the volume settled by ACH and over 1% the volume settled by Fedwire.</p>&mdash; Peter Johnson (@TheChicagoVC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheChicagoVC/status/1694001416354791576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>Tokenized Fiat is the Future</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Quigley said that tokenized fiat, either in the form of stablecoins or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), is one of the most significant developments in the history of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Few technology developments bring so many benefits with virtually no trade-offs,&#8221; the Tether co-founder said, predicting that three or four of the largest economies in the world will have tokenized their fiat within the next couple of years.</p><p>According to the Atlantic Council CBDC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">tracker</a>, 130 countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are currently exploring a CBDC, while 19 of the G20 countries are in the advanced stage of their CBDC development.</p><p>In total, 11 countries have fully launched a CBDC, which include&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shenzhen-china-36m-digital-yuan-wallets-opened-so-far-cbdc-pilot-gathers-pace.htm"><strong>China</strong></a>,&nbsp;<strong>The Bahamas</strong>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nigerian-central-bank-introduces-nfc-technology-boost-enaira-adoption.htm"><strong>Nigeria</strong></a>, <strong>Anguilla</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Jamaica</strong>, and seven&nbsp;<strong>Eastern Caribbean</strong>&nbsp;countries.</p><p>It is worth noting that the United States is among the few countries that have no confirmed plans to launch a digital currency.</p><p>However, the country has been still moving forward on a wholesale (bank-to-bank) CBDC.</p><p>&#8220;Within 10 years, most of the world&rsquo;s major economies will be using a tokenized central bank currency,&#8221; Quigley added, questioning whether the governments would allow private stablecoin&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;One question is whether in an age of sovereign issued stablecoins, private issued stablecoins like Tether will be permitted from a regulatory perspective.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

it merely states that the SEC did not meet the Court&rsquo;s standard for suitably explaining their reasons for rejection.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The appeal, however, could pressure the <strong>US Congress</strong> to work on digital asset regulations.</p><p>Without a Congressional mandate, the regulators are limited to enforcement actions such as those taken against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-files-amicus-brief-secs-binance-lawsuit-says-stablecoins-are-not-securities.htm"><strong>Binance</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-vs-sec-regulator-pushes-back-against-exchange.htm"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a>, discussion over product-specific rule changes, and issuing cautionary investor-protection educational materials, Eberle said.</p><h2>Kick-starting the Process</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Making crypto investments is much easier and safer today than it was as recently as 2021, according to the CIO, thanks to the rise of analogs to traditional financial services.</p><p>Investors, for example, can choose between several regulated custodian banks to hold their coins away from crypto &ldquo;exchanges&rdquo; such as the failed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/juror-unfamiliarity-of-cryptocurrency-poses-challenge-ftx-trial.htm"><strong>FTX</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;This provides a vital segregation of assets, rights, and responsibilities, which were often ambiguous earlier in the democratization of digital asset markets.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>There is still &ldquo;a great deal of work&rdquo; to be done in &ldquo;adding consistency and legal certainty&rdquo; to the digital asset markets.</p><p>Per Eberle,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The resolution of the spot-market ETF question and other regulatory changes in the US will kick-start this process by answering the threshold questions of which agency has responsibility for each market segment.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, the costs of trading, custody, and settlement are still high, but Castle Funds expects these to drop with the rise of specialist firms that will compete in a segregated market after the Coinbase and Binance enforcement actions are resolved.<br><br>Spot crypto ETFs will give investors &ldquo;a relatively cheap and secure way&rdquo; to gain crypto exposure in their existing brokerage accounts, Eberle said, providing a list of knock-on effects:</p><ul><li>previously unmet demand for the coins is satisfied by the ETF, and prices on the underlying tokens are driven higher;</li><li>if GBTC is offered a conversion path to ETF, it could result in selling pressure on BTC as leveraged traders seek to close out their positions and capture the arbitrage profit due to the historic discounts;</li><li>poorly designed ETFs could result in a splitting of the markets into &ldquo;clean&rdquo; BTC (from regulated sources) and &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; BTC (which can&rsquo;t be adequately traced to owners);</li><li>market volatility could cause problems with the liquidity of the ETF, as the ETF settles on a T+2 business day basis and the underlying BTC settles roughly every 15 minutes with no breaks.</li></ul><h2>USA&#8217;s &#8216;Significant&rsquo; Body of Law Can Quickly Shape Crypto Regulations</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Given their clarity, the EU&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto-Assets (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-sounds-warning-eus-mica-law-may-lead-stablecoin-removals-whats-going-on.htm">MiCA</a>) consultations are currently ahead of the US regulations, Eberle said.</p><p>The US is still in the process of splitting out the regulatory space (i.e., securities, commodities, payments and banking, etc.).</p><p>He stated that,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The MiCA &ldquo;clean sheet of paper&rdquo; approach, while consistent with general principles of sound financial regulation, may ultimately seem like a more direct path to regulated crypto asset service providers as it appears to be more tailored to the needs of digital asset service providers.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>But the US can still rise strong, Eberle argued, saying that,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The US has a significant body of securities and banking case law which will quickly shape the eventual regulations once the threshold questions of supervisory authority and overlap are resolved.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Eberle opined that any new financial regulation implementation is &ldquo;a substantial investment,&rdquo; which also requires &ldquo;some fortune-telling,&rdquo; as the regulations can change in scope and impact over time.</p><p>The US has a number of &ldquo;substantially regulated paths&rdquo; to crypto investment, and investors can be more informed in the choices if the can see the differences between regulated and unregulated markets, the CIO concluded.</p>

Fraud accounted for $7.6 million, making up the remaining 32.3%.</p><p>Christian Seifert, former Microsoft security lead and current researcher in Residence at the Forta Network, said the rise of end-user targeted scams is the biggest challenge in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Here we have a lot of criminal energy that is directed towards the new (we are all kinda new to this space) web3 user base in an environment that is incredibly complex with little built in protection layers,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Crypto Security Remains a Critical Concern</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Security has been one major barrier to the wider adoption of cryptocurrency, particularly among institutional investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Big investors demand robust security measures to safeguard their assets against theft or cyber threats, and the lack of such measures has been pushing away these investors from getting into the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>While crypto security is without a doubt a critical concern, the industry is still in its early stages when it comes to protecting digital assets, according to Vardanyan.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;With numerous hacks and exploits occurring, it&#8217;s evident that there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done to make the field safer.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Seifert highlighted that there is a lot of innovation happening in the crypto cybersecurity space.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the best options for those seeking extra security is Blockfence, which has created a browser extension that acts as a protective layer and guards against suspect transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Blockfence combines complex analysis with machine learning algorithms and data on hackers and vulnerabilities gathered by the Web3 community to safeguard users&rsquo; transactions.</p><p>It can prevent many kinds of attacks, including phishing attacks and malicious smart contracts.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2- BLOCKFENCE<br><br>You can never be too safe. <br><br>Blockfence is another security Snap that analyzes each transaction before it&#39;s signed. <br><br>By checking addresses and contracts, this Snap will flag an error message if it detects a fraudulent transaction. <a href="https://t.co/6QBpAmPorB">pic.twitter.com/6QBpAmPorB</a></p>&mdash; The Smart Ape <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@the_smart_ape) <a href="https://twitter.com/the_smart_ape/status/1703740905381826561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>However, Seifert noted that scammers are not sitting idle either.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We see them innovating and gaining expertise over time as well. If we leave them unchecked, it represents a serious risk to web3 as a whole.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>Best Practices for Improving Security in Crypto</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Cryptocurrency investors are not entirely defenseless against rampant security incidents.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, users can take certain security measures to make the most out of one of the fastest-growing industries globally without worrying about losing their hand-earned digital assets.</p><p>For individuals, Vardanyan recommends minimizing third-party risks by using cold storage solutions like hardware wallets and practicing good operational security.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Additionally, practicing good operational security (OpSec) is crucial; this includes using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious of phishing attempts. Keep your private keys secure, ideally in offline, physically-protected storage.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of establishing a robust security pipeline for organizations, including rigorous code review processes, regular security audits by reputable firms, and continuous vulnerability monitoring.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Seifert encouraged users to seek out security layers to protect their holdings, such as browser plugins and wallets with built-in security protections.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;If your wallet doesn&#8217;t have built in security protections, ask your provider why that is not the case; switch to a wallet, like Zengo, that does,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, in order for crypto to stay ahead of evolving threats, there is a need for collaboration between security experts and technology innovators.</p><p>&#8220;Collaboration between security experts and technology innovators is key to staying ahead in the ever-changing world of crypto security,&#8221; Vardanyan said.&nbsp;</p><p>For those entering the crypto space, it is recommended that they do extensive research before engaging with any cryptocurrency project or investment.&nbsp;</p><p>They need to verify a project&#8217;s security practices, team credentials, and track record.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, as the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve, it faces evolving cybersecurity challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>However, a proactive approach, continuous innovation, and collaboration between experts and industry stakeholders can help tackle this issue, safeguarding the future of cryptocurrency.</p>

We are buzzing as always. And today we have the one and only, Erica Kang, on the show, CEO and Founder of KryptoSeoul, a leading community-building team in South Korea. Erica leads the KryptoSeoul team to organize BUIDL Asia that is built with the Crypto Spelling, BUIDL Asia, the first Asian community-driven crypto conference. Erica also earned her master&#8217;s in international policy studies at the one and only Stanford University ever heard of it. And Erica previously served as the Korea Blockchain Association as an advisor. Erica, pumped to have you on. It&#8217;s been a hot minute. We finally got you on. Welcome to the show. How are you doing?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Hi Matt, great to be here. Thanks for having me. Doing very well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Great to have you on as well. You are currently in Singapore for Token2049. What is that like? I&#8217;d love to get over to that neck of the woods. Is it as good as everyone says it is?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I mean, actually, it kind of reminds me back to the 20, like, 2020, 2019 days where I was very, like, hyped up. Everyone was excited. And I think it&#8217;s just kind of gives me nostalgia. So I just feel really happy to be back. And you can see every type of team here possible. And so East meets West, definitely. I can see, like, people from the West coming over, from, of course, like Asians all over as well. So it&#8217;s a really nice mix. And so that kind of is a lot of noise, I mean, good and bad. But I mean, I think it&#8217;s great to have that buzz and everyone&#8217;s energized. So it&#8217;s really good to have, you know, this all this energy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>The last couple of years, crypto conferences, it has not been the same. I missed the 2020, 2021 bull market days when you could feel the palpable energy. You know what I mean? I feel like that&#8217;s been sort of non-existent the last year and a half at crypto conferences. Been getting better, mind you, but it&#8217;s good to see that the electric factory and crypto conferences is finally sort of back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>And I think a lot of teams from the West, for example, I don&#8217;t want to distinguish like this West and East, but it&#8217;s very global as much. But then, you know, people who are mainly based in the Western hemisphere, for example, I think a lot of teams feel the need to jump into Asian markets more so these days. So I think it&#8217;s really interesting to see that kind of a move. And so, yeah, it&#8217;s very energizing to be here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s a great theme that you brought up and I do want to jump into sort of how we can bridge the gap between the east and the west And obviously there&#8217;s such a need from everyone in the west wanting to do crypto with people from the East for obvious reasons and we&#8217;ll get into that. But before we do I would love to learn a little bit more about Erica the star of the show. Obviously looking at your bio you did your masters at Stanford that must have been a treat in half I got the absolute pleasure to tour Stanford a couple years ago What a campus? I mean like just outer-worldly for anyone who&#8217;s never been there definitely go take a tour. But tell me a little bit about yourself before you got into crypto. What did you do and why did you make the jump over to the big bad Web3?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, it was quite a story. I mean, it&#8217;s pretty random too. I think everyone has that kind of jump into the crypto, that kind of a story, very wild. So before I came into crypto, My first job in after graduating college was in banking. So I was an investment banker as MNA analyst. So that kind of led me into finance and I worked in trading as well for a few months. And I thought, okay, maybe I should do more studies before like jumping into my real career. So I pursued a degree in masters at Stanford, majoring in international policy, because my undergrad was in international relations. So I was doing more political economy focused. So I mean, kind of integrating finance because I was from finance for a little bit. And so I wanted to study more financial crises, basically like the downfall of the, in the current banking system. So back then, so I think it was very, this is kind of interesting narrative leading to crypto, if I think back, right? And so yeah, I wanted to do more studies. So I was actually pursuing an academia career. So I was to kind of do a PhD in political science. And then somehow like personal reasons, whatever reasons I got, okay, I decided to go back to Korea and do some actual corporate work. So I got hired by Korea Telecom, which is one of the big three telecom communications companies in Korea. And it&#8217;s very heavily government run. And so I was in the strategy team, I was the CEO, and which was a very good privilege to be learning about the corporate culture, also to learn the top down approach of like a typical Korean conglomerate company. So it was a very interesting experience. I think I got to learn like the Korean, like traditional corporate culture, which is great. I mean, I think it kind of gave me a really nice perspective on the local culture. And then I just kind of felt, okay, well, I did all the conservative careers, I think, the traditional like structured system. So I felt, okay, before I get older, maybe I should do something more adventurous and something more like challenging, more inspiring. So I was actually thinking of doing something in education, like educational startups back in the day, because I&#8217;m passionate about education in general. And so I was looking at other fields in like the tech, because tech fields are usually very dynamic, very challenging. So I was looking into some friends in tech and getting some advice from them. And surprisingly, I found a friend who recommended me to a seminar back in early 2017, I think it was March. And so he was like, okay, well, if you want some inspiration, why don&#8217;t you join this like rare seminar that I had invited to, and this was a crypto seminar, very rare back then. It barely existed. So I was like, okay, maybe I&#8217;ll just pay a hundred bucks and just see how it is. So I went there and I got really like, it was an eye-opening experience, honestly. I was like, okay, I don&#8217;t understand any of this, but it sounds interesting. And I met during the networking session, I met all the speakers and basically the founders who were trying to do like the ICO back then. And yeah, I think they did a aggressive ICO following in the following months. But technically I had to meet the entire scene of Korean crypto, very small back then, but I got to meet all the founders, builders, and so that kind of got me plugged in. And they wanted to hire me as like, they&#8217;re CMO and that kind of thing. So I didn&#8217;t take the job, but I got to learn more about it and got more plugged into the space there. So that&#8217;s how I got kind of trickled into the arbitral.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>And the rest is history. One of the main topics of the show that I&#8217;d love to really put a hammer into is Asia being a powerhouse for crypto. Obviously, with the massive population, the micro and macro economic impacts of crypto booming in Asia, it&#8217;s incredible for the whole world. We need this to happen. You are living in Asia, you run massive crypto conferences in Asia. If anyone were an expert on crypto in Asia, it would definitely be you. What are some of the themes we&#8217;re seeing right now, some of the trends, just the momentum as a whole? What&#8217;s going on in crypto in Asia as a whole at the moment?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s a very grand question because Asia cannot be generalized as a whole. First of all, there&#8217;s many differences in Asian regions. And I lived in Seoul for more than most of my life. And also I lived in Richmond City, Vietnam, for two years. So I think I&#8217;m most plugged in those ecosystems. Just kind of looking generally on the Asia aspect, I really think due to the US regulations, the things that are happening on the other side of the world, I think a lot of the interest has been coming to Asia in general. And I think Asia has been always buzzing. It&#8217;s just a matter of how the regulations have been shaping. I mean, some regulations are very fuzzy at the moment, even so. Even South Korea is still very, you know, it&#8217;s still nascent, it&#8217;s still in the making. And I think tax-related issues is becoming a little solid. But then I think other things are just still in the making. But Hong Kong is much more clear. But I think in general, regulations are being shaped. And also users, I think the sheer population of Asia, like the growing population of Southeast Asian regions, is definitely a big contributing factor to the potential of growth of crypto in Asia. Because I think the younger population and the growing population, the need to learn and also to openness to innovative technologies, I think that whole mentality is just there by default. And I think it&#8217;s really important to test the waters in Asia, basically. People are eager to try new things and people are eager to invest in new things. And I think South Korea, for example, I think the mature economy of South Korea has kind of made the younger generation want to invest in newer opportunities, especially the real estate market stagnated. It&#8217;s hard to invest as a young entrepreneur, for example. So they&#8217;re looking for alternative ways to invest and get bigger returns. So I think that&#8217;s the reason most young people are looking to crypto. They want to find new opportunities and they thought, OK, this is very innovative. This is so new that we can only get access to, for example. So I think as Asians are always constantly looking for new things to maybe reap some benefits, but also to learn, be inspired. I think that&#8217;s a really good environment to be in as a whole and sentiment as well. And so I mean, I cannot generalize everything, but I think just to kind of sum it all, I think that could be a good contributing factor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s a great point. I love your point about the real estate too. I mean, it&#8217;s very similar in North America in the sense that the markets cooling down and just the prices are so bloody expensive like when my parents and all of you know my my buddies parents when they bought homes 30 40 years ago If they were you know a classic two three bedroom home in Toronto where I live was $150,000 and now it&#8217;s $1.5 mil. I mean there&#8217;s I can&#8217;t see a world where myself and my peers my network has an opportunity to 10x you know their investment on their home, which is pretty wild. So just like you said and I haven&#8217;t really thought about this to be honest but everyone&#8217;s always looking for a solid investment and if you can&#8217;t get that 10x bagger on the home perhaps you look at crypto great point never really thought about that kudos there. Another point that you keep hammering home and it&#8217;s one that I love is bridging the gap between crypto communities more specifically the east and the west. We do need a lot more collaboration. It seems like I don&#8217;t want to say we&#8217;re divided per se. But it does seems there are definitely a lot of barriers. There&#8217;s a lot of roadblocks. What can we do to really help drive innovation and help that widespread adoption of crypto between the east and the west?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it&#8217;s always been a big challenge for me. And it&#8217;s my seventh year in crypto, but still, it&#8217;s really hard to camera that question. And I think that challenge is never ending, right? I think it will still ever exist. And I mean, there are many aspects to why this gap exists. I think most importantly, there is the language barrier, which is like a huge hurdle. And as Western Korea might be, for example, or Vietnam is trying to learn a lot of, the Vietnamese are really eager to learn English, for example, like the passion is just outstanding.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>What, why is that? Like why Vietnam over other countries?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, I think like Vietnamese, when I was living there, I just felt like they&#8217;re the passion to just learn in general. Like education, the fever is like kind of comfortable to South Korea. Like South Korean, like the parents are crazy. In general, it&#8217;s like, yeah, it&#8217;s really hard. And I was a result of that like passionate education system. But you know, I think the like sheer passion towards learning English is humongous. It&#8217;s huge. And so like the fact that I&#8217;m good at English, it&#8217;s very like commemorable. They love that, right? About me. But anyway, just back to the point, like even though we love to learn English, for example, we still favor our native language. You know what I mean? Like in terms of content, in terms of reading like accessible materials, we do favor communicating in our own native language. And also when it just feels uncomfortable to some natives, if they feel like, okay, we&#8217;re like giving all these English content, for example. I mean, most of the content in crypto are in English, right? I think that&#8217;s inevitable. And you know, we try to translate as much as possible the original content, but still I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s like comparable. It&#8217;s like the original content is always the best. And so even in the language area, so I think that contributes a huge hurdle to like communication as well. And so that creates like a cultural barrier as well. And I think both cultures, it&#8217;s hard to really like understand 100% about each of those cultures. And so we need a bridge to kind of, at least try to minimize the gap. And that&#8217;s where I exist, right? To kind of try to kind of minimize and create more mutual understanding amongst both cultures and make sure that both are not misunderstood, for example, in terms of like how you read between the lines or how you communicate like direct communication versus indirect communication is very different. And so like Koreans are very indirect. Yeah. So when you write an email or essay, for example, you just write the conclusion in the beginning for like US style, like North America style, I used to write very directly. On the other hand, Koreans write the conclusions at the end, way at the end. So it&#8217;s like this and this contributes to the result. So that&#8217;s the end. So which is like that really reflects how we think about everything and how we want to portray our opinion, for example. So I mean, even in that simple example, it really creates this gap in communication as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br>That&#8217;s such a great point there. We gotta go back, because I feel like you&#8217;re gonna have some fire stories for the question that I&#8217;m about to ask you. Your parents and other South Korean parents growing up, I saw the look on your face. I assume that you were absolutely pushed the limit in regards to being the smartest young version of Erica possible. Erica, you gotta give us some good stories of you as a kid and your parents pushing you. You can talk about your friends and their parents as well, but tell me more about the culture growing up in South Korea school-wise.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Okay, oh, this is, you know, there&#8217;s a K drama, a famous K drama called Sky Castle. There&#8217;s a very famous, so it&#8217;s like a typical example of like crazy like a Korean educational system. And I think a lot of people were shocked at like the portrayal in Sky Castle. They&#8217;re like, oh, this cannot be real. This is like crazy. And I&#8217;m like, I was looking at it, I was like, well, this is quite the life that I have, but I was younger. It was not a big surprise. And so, I mean, like, so I&#8217;m privileged in the sense that I used to live in the US back in elementary school. So I have a very like bilingual background. And so I think I got a much better, easier route than others actually. I got the privilege to go to the fast route, which is like the English fluent, you know, personnel, there&#8217;s a group for that. And so they, we get like a special treatment, which, you know, I&#8217;m very grateful for. If I weren&#8217;t that category, I would have been like more rigorous in my education. But I did prepare for the ordinary, the normal route, which is like the hardcore one. And so basically I went to a foreign language high school back in high school in Korea, which so the school was until 9 p.m. So I would do, the courses would end at three, but you have to study like extracurricular classes and do self-study until 9 at the school.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, wait, so you&#8217;re in school from nine to three, and then you&#8217;re in your own like home school from three to nine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, in the school. We&#8217;re in the classroom. And then we do, we eat dinner at the school. And then we do like after dinner like classes, and we just do self-studying until nine. And then we come back home at 10, right? And so we&#8217;re supposed to go to sleep. But we go to academies after we come back from school. So the classes start at 10 p.m. And so some of my classes would end at 2 a.m. And so I would,&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Wait, and how old are you staying up till 2 a.m.?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>So second grade of high school, for example, like I was like 16.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s wild.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>And so the academies would not run officially until 2am. So they would especially open the academy for us for our own group. And so they would pretend to be closed, but they would be internally, as you can secretly open for us. And so they&#8217;ll be caught by the police or something like that. They would open until 2am. So we would go there and like have a secret class until 2am and then come back home, sleep until 6, and then go back to school at 7ish, 7-8 or something like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>My goodness, that is absolutely wild. That is crazy. So much different in North America, which obviously you are very accustomed to sports dominates. I feel like in a lot of aspects, sports is more important than school, right? Like when you&#8217;re growing up, your identity isn&#8217;t so much like what subject are you good at in school or what do you want to be when you&#8217;re older? It&#8217;s like what sport do you play or, you know, perhaps if you&#8217;re a girl, do you dance or ballet or gymnastics or which again are sports as well? Whatever the case may be, crazy differences. Got to love how the world works. Erica, we got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor, the show that is PrimeXBT.

And now back to the show with Erica. Erica, let&#8217;s jump into the bread and butter KryptoSeoul. You run the show there. It is the best crypto conference in South Korea. Before we get into it, give me the TLDR, give me the elevator pitch. What exactly is KryptoSeoul and what exactly do you and the team do to move and groove over there?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>So KryptoSeoul is a community building team, and we&#8217;ve been here since 2017. And so we&#8217;ve been helping Layer1 projects, Layer2 projects to build their presence in Asia like a healthy way, which means like organic way, and try to get the connect to the right founders, builders, investors in this space, and just try to make the first impression good in the green market. And so yeah, I&#8217;ve been targeting mainly developers and builders and students as well. And so that&#8217;s why I founded BUIDL Asia Conference. It&#8217;s a platform agnostic technical conference. I think it&#8217;s like one of the first, and I think it is one of the best in terms of that, because I&#8217;m very proud of being platform agnostic, and just kind of like laying out all the Layer1s in the best technologies like, you know, fly out, and just kind of sharing what they&#8217;ve built over the past years. And even so that&#8217;s my kind of, you know, I think it&#8217;s really nice to kind of see them all together in one setting. And I&#8217;ve been running pretty strong for four years now. And yeah, it&#8217;s been growing ever since. And yeah, it&#8217;s a very community-friendly conference as well, so which is really, I&#8217;m really proud of that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>And how would this conference differ from some of the other Asian conferences, for example, like the one that&#8217;s going on right now, where you currently are, and that is obviously Token2049. What are some of the big differences just so people can get a bit of a lay of the land?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I would say that Token2049 is definitely huge in scale, which is definitely admirable. I really respect that. To run that big of a conference is a huge deal. I think BUIDL Asia is much more focused, and I think in terms of technology, research, achievements, and I think it&#8217;s just more content-curated. I really put a lot of focus on content curation, and also who I take as a sponsor, speaker, it&#8217;s all hand-picked and very much filtered, for example. And it&#8217;s hard to filter in my own standards, I know, but I think according to my standards, I think they&#8217;re definitely on the right level. And so it takes a year, a full year, to really plan out which projects are definitely worth comparing to or on the same line of speakers. And I try to put some narrative to it as well. I think narrative is very important in creating a conference. And so, I mean, the conference size may be smaller, but I think in terms of the quality, I really try to put a lot of story to it. And also, yeah, so content is definitely a key to my conference, yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Yeah, you definitely need fire content, especially when doing anything crypto conference related. Have you been to, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been to a bunch of crypto conferences over in the Middle East, more specifically in Dubai or in Europe and in North America. I&#8217;ve only been to a crypto conference in Dubai and a bunch in North America, never been to any in Europe, never been to any in Asia. What are some of the differences on that and like culturally speaking some of the perhaps smaller nuances. I&#8217;d love to dive into that just to get a lay of the land and try to put my feet in your shoes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, I think Middle Asia is a little different from the local Korean conferences, honestly, because I try to put the global standards to Korea. Like, that&#8217;s what I wanted to portray is basically bring global to Korea. That&#8217;s what I want to do so that the local Koreans can see like, oh, this is like a really nicely put event. And this is like what the global scene does, basically. And so I want to kind of give that. Yeah. And I think on my, I mean, according to my standards, I think I really respect what ETHGlobal is doing, for example, with like its progma and also ETHGlobal hackathons, because I&#8217;m also like very passionate about hackathons. And I think those are my favorite, you know, events that I always go to. Also, I love ETHDenver as well, which is also, ETH CCU you was in Paris was amazing. I went in July this year and it was absolutely amazing to see the European landscape. A lot of the teams based in Europe was, you know, definitely there. So that was a treat. And I&#8217;m not really like, I wasn&#8217;t really exposed to a lot of the European builders scene, but I was, it was really, you know, inspiring to me. And so I would love to bring that to the solo as well at one point. So yeah, I mean, like anything, you know, developer related is definitely my, you know, favorite event to go to. And I really like how they, you know, curate the content. I really see carefully like, okay, how they creatively, you know, try to not show the project, but basically showcase the project in which it is very like, has a very strong narrative and like to be creative. Yeah. I really respect that. And it, a lot of work goes into it. And so yeah, I think those are my favorites.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m gonna ask you a bit of a tough one here, but besides, of course, your own conference, KryptoSeoul, what is your favorite and most fun crypto conference you&#8217;ve ever been to? Besides KryptoSeoul, of course.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, my conferences are not fun for me because I&#8217;m in a place with a good point.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>You&#8217;re in the weeds 24 hours a day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Exactly. I rarely sleep, so it&#8217;s very nerve-wracking. The ones I enjoy going to. Honestly, ETHDenver was amazing. It has a quirky, very unique color to it, which I do respect. And I think it&#8217;s very difficult to mimic in Korea, for example. It&#8217;s very hard to have that culture. Very free-spirited, but Denver has a very strong color, right? In that own area. I really like going back to Denver every year. And the Buffy Corn character, I really like the Buffy Corn. I&#8217;m looking forward to going next February. That&#8217;s my favorite so far.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Never been gotta put that on the to-do list there, Erica. Yeah. It has to happen. Well, look, Erica, this is this has been an absolute treat. This has been lovely. My last question in regards to KryptoSeoul and BUIDL Asia, I&#8217;d love if you could let our listeners know how crazy and bananas it truly is during a conference of that size. I&#8217;ve helped out with a amount of precision, the amount of everything that goes into it. I don&#8217;t think people really truly appreciate, you know, you show up to the conference, you get the nice lights, the sound system, everything&#8217;s beautiful, everything&#8217;s organized. It is absolute nightmare fuel getting that done. I&#8217;d love if you could just tell a couple stories that have happened in your years of throwing these conferences and events, just anything to showcase how crazy the process truly is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Of course, it&#8217;s more crazy for me because I host at least three major events at the same time. So basically, I also host ETH Seoul. So ETH Seoul, BUIDL Asia, and Cosmos hackathon. I do it at one queue during one week. And I host three side events and three speaker dinners. And I also take care of all these nice speakers, which is like 50 speakers, for example. And so all of that into one person&#8217;s role is kind of mind-blowing. And I shouldn&#8217;t be doing this, I know. But I take care of all the agenda, all the invitations for speakers, sponsors, everything. So it&#8217;s a one-man show kind of. And so I feel like almost feel like I&#8217;m testing my limits at a certain point. And it&#8217;s my sixth year organizing events of this scale. So I feel like every year I&#8217;m touching my limits until how far I can go. But I&#8217;m getting the hang of it, but it&#8217;s just like physically, it&#8217;s just very consuming. And it&#8217;s just limiting. I can&#8217;t scale myself. So some people are joking, well, there&#8217;s Erika one in this venue, and there&#8217;s Erika two in the other venue. And Erika three is resting in her home, for example. So they&#8217;re just joking because I&#8217;m all everywhere, number one, and I&#8217;m not resting and I&#8217;m just not sleeping. So I&#8217;m always responding on telegram and I&#8217;m always like, I&#8217;m the present. So being on the radar, always being attentive to speakers, because speakers are my assets, I think. Speakers and my sponsors are my assets. Yeah, I have to elevate them. I have to highlight them. And I mean, personally, there&#8217;s like dear friends of mine as well. And so I want to make sure that they have a wonderful time in Korea, in my conference as well. And just I just want to take care of that. So I mean, it&#8217;s a personal treat, but an honor, but it&#8217;s really a lot of grueling work. And so, yeah, I just get like so nervous, like a one month tired to the whole like frenzy. So I rarely sleep, but I always try to get my exercise done. Just kind of like, you know, wind it out a little bit. But yeah, it&#8217;s really, it takes a lot of energy out of you. And especially my situation in which it&#8217;s like a, you know, comes from one brain and one body. So it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s definitely, it&#8217;s tough. And a lot of, I really care about the content as well, as I told you. So I really make sure double check, triple check, that the content is right and the speakers are in the right place, for example. So until the last minute, basically. So yeah, it&#8217;s very nerve-wracking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Thanks for the little sneak peek there. Erica, last time you&#8217;re in the show, hot take factory, you and I put our shit kicking boots on, jump in the Hot Take Factory, let a couple fly. You got to give us a couple Erica hot takes before we let you go, it doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto related, can be health, wealth, happiness, space, aliens, AI, you name it. But give us a couple Erica hot takes before we let you go today.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a hot take, but I think it&#8217;s the most important to keep the exercise going. I dance a lot, and so I think relieving stress is definitely mentally, I mean, it&#8217;s a test for me right now, actually. And so I try to like, I think like dancing or even just like, you know, I&#8217;m relieving to meditation. I think mental health and also physical health is the most important thing. I mean, alone from all the career building that we&#8217;re in it for, right? I think it&#8217;s really important. And number two, Korean food is the best. What should I say? It comes to Korea. Like, you know, Korean cuisine is like absolutely number one. I hosted. Top notch. I hosted just last week, I hosted a Korean barbecue and karaoke, like gathering full of founders and they loved it. And it&#8217;s like the legit way to like welcome people. And so that&#8217;s my hot take. I think it&#8217;s a commonly, you know, recognized take, I believe. And yeah. Oh, women builders are very underrated. That&#8217;s what I want to also stress as well. You know, I think a female women representation in crypto is definitely underestimated. I think it should be highlighted more. I haven&#8217;t spoken openly about this enough, but I think I should because I feel like a lot of, because I&#8217;m from a women&#8217;s university in South Korea, and, you know, these young students, they look up to me, they ask me questions about career building, also a balance between personal life and also like how I manage like work and also family, for example. And so I think I really am asked to be a mentor for a lot of these things. But yeah, I really think female builders should be more appreciated and also more supported as well. And so yeah, that&#8217;s also my other hot take.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. I agree with all three, especially the Korean food being absolutely fire. Korean barbecue, undefeated. Never forget the first time I had it, went with my parent. Oh my goodness, so freaking good. Love that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>You got to come to soul.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I know, when I need to get to that neck of the woods, when I do, I will definitely hit you up. But I really appreciate you coming on. This was truly a lovely episode and can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two. And hopefully I will be able to meet you and the team in person at one of your amazing conferences. But until then, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and KryptoSeoul and BUIDL Asia online and on socials.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, we have a website, buidl.asia. It&#8217;s very simple. So you can just type in there for the conference references for the past years. And also all the hypethons that we did, for example, and so you can find us there. Also on Twitter, I&#8217;m on @ekang426. 426 my birthday. It&#8217;s very evident. Yeah, I regret that. You should have done more cooler. I did not know it was going to be in crypto. So anyway, I&#8217;m there. And then I have a BUIDL Asia account, also KryptoSeoul so you can follow us there for more updates. Also have a YouTube channel, a very small one. But KryptoSeoul if you type in KryptoSeoul in English, you can find my YouTube channel. I have a huge array of interviews as well during COVID. And so maybe you can check that out. That&#8217;d be appreciated. Yeah, so please find me everywhere. I&#8217;m everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br>You got it. Erika, thanks again for coming on. Truly a blast and can&#8217;t wait for round two, wishing you and the team all the best and we&#8217;ll talk soon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Erica Kang</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thank you so much, Matt. Thank you, everybody.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an incredible episode with Erica Kang, CEO and Founder of KryptoSeoul and BUIDL Asia. She was dropping knowledge bombs left, right, and center. Anything Crypto and Asia related, Erica covered it. We love to see that huge shout out to her and the team for making this happen.

We are Buzzing as always. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab, coming in hot from Toronto as always. And today, my guest is coming in hot from the one and only Hong Kong. Super pump to have Rachel Lin on the show, CEO and Co-Founder of SynFutures, a decentralized derivatives trading platform. Rachel previously worked at Deutsche Bank, ever heard of them, specializing in derivatives and was part of the founding team at Matrixport. One of Asia&#8217;s largest crypto neobanks. Rachel&#8217;s Twitter is also absolute fire. We&#8217;ll plug that at the end of the show. But until then, super pumped to have you on, Rachel welcome to show my friend. How are you?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thank you, Matthew. Thanks for having me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Super pumped to have you. And I believe you&#8217;re the first guest to call me Matthew as well. That&#8217;s hilarious. I love that. Yeah, you&#8217;re more than welcome to do that. I mean, you know, growing up in, especially in Canada, which is a rather Catholic country, it just seems like, you know, if you have Catholic parents, you just, there&#8217;s like one of 10 names to choose from. So there&#8217;s a lot of Matthews. I had about three Matthews in every class growing up. And that&#8217;s why I sort of just switched to Matt, just to, you know, just to be a trailblazer. But hey, it shows about you not about me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>I stand out from the crowd.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Exactly. You stand out from the crowd. Let&#8217;s jump into it though. So you and the team have an incredible decentralized derivatives exchange, which enables anyone to list and trade futures and perps on any assets, which is huge, especially for the crypto industry, as we didn&#8217;t really have this until a couple of years ago. And we will get into this. But until then, let&#8217;s talk about your past. You have had some incredible companies. You are currently living in Hong Kong. Give us the TLDR on Rachel. Where do you go to school? Where&#8217;d you grow up? What are your passions? How&#8217;d you get into crypto? And then we&#8217;ll jump into SynFutures a little bit later on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. I was majoring in finance and then financial engineering sort of a little bit tech and coding for my university as well. But my first career was with a traditional finance institute, Deutsche Bank, in which I specialized in derivative sales and trading. After that, I joined a Fintech company called Alipay, if you heard about. And it was with Alipay when I led their first versions of blockchain platform and started to learn about blockchains and grow lots of interest into it. And later on, so I joined a Bitmain and Matrixport just now you mentioned, so one of the largest Asian crypto neobank and became one of the founding partners. But my interest has been always in the true Web3 decentralized wall, so that&#8217;s the reason why I started SynFutures, the decentralized exchange. Yeah. So all the way from traditional finance to Fintech to CFI to DeFi, sounds like all the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>100% know it totally does. And was it a no brainer for you to leave TradFi and start your own derivatives exchange? Like I&#8217;m sure your family, your friends were like, Rachel, what are you doing? That&#8217;s a huge risk. You had a cushy position at a world-class institution and then you decided to leave. Give me the story. What happened there?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. I think at that time, it was not very hard for me to make that decision. Although, yes, you&#8217;re right. My family is saying, hey, this is the same thing. I mean, you have like, I think it&#8217;s like 70% pay cut. And of all until he went into the Fintech space and drew like, Rachel on the blockchain, what is blockchains? There are lots of scammers out there. That&#8217;s the talk out there. But I kind of feel like, I mean, like there will be like three major driver. First of all, it&#8217;s to opt your macro environment-wise. You feel that the from the traditional investment banks been taking like a two far way. I was like training and lots of the cranky stuff like whatever. Interest rates, spreads, language, very structural derivatives that no one could understand. And I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the purpose of doing all of this. And it woke me up at night. So I feel like there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s not very interesting. There&#8217;s not hope. The whole industries and the, let&#8217;s say, the human being up to all right. So that&#8217;s the environment that I was at that time. And the other thing is that I think at that time, my first steps into a Fintech company because I saw those beautiful story where how technology could make a difference. and bring the change to those people that have no access to financial services. And when we did blockchain, we go and visit all those very poor house communities in Philippines and see how my simple solution could make change. So that&#8217;s very fascinating. And to be honest, the bottom line is that I was feeling that, hey, why not just trip these chunks and go on a journey after all. If you feel that you can&#8217;t, I mean, stand out. I mean, you can&#8217;t survive. You could always go back to investment banking. So that&#8217;s the bottom line. But I mean, like, it seems to me that many people will have finance and at least my friends, whoever left traditional finance enter into the cryptos never think about coming back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s a really good point and it&#8217;s so true everyone who does jump ship really wants to go back. It&#8217;s a fun world over here before we get into SynFutures I again, I always lurk my guest Twitter. I have to it&#8217;s part of the job. You had a very spicy take you had a hot take normally we save hot takes for the end. But we got to jump into it right away. I read your article I forget which website it was on my my apologies. But you had a bit of a hot take that FTX deserves a second chance and you are a believer that they can relaunch. Sort of rebrand but just with the power and prowess and obviously the capital that they had you think you still think that they have enough pizzazz to relaunch and actually be successful I&#8217;d love for you to get into that and tell us why FTX deserves a second chance and why you think that they could have a successful relaunch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure, I mean like for the greater benefits If it has a second chance, I think like there could be possibility for those who suffer from the FTX bankruptcies could get certain ties of let&#8217;s say recover rates and because it reminded me of the Bitfinex story where it got hacked and it launched the tokens to all those creditors and then pay out their revenues. To others people who suffer from the lost and later on I mean I make a good success story. So I mean like from under the goods for all those people who suffer from a lost I mean like although that it does not guarantee the FTX would do the same. But at least there is a chance so that&#8217;s for one part, but secondly, I do feel like Whether or not to relaunch the exchange is different from one. I mean like just give the pure same management team a second chance. I mean those who did things wrong have to get punished. So relaunch does not not means just a simple forgiveness of the existing, I mean, management. Those who are sort of like get things wrong should still, I mean, like go to jail, I&#8217;d say, and should still, I mean, like get punished. And let&#8217;s say that in the restructure, all those equity holders will still suffer from a loss from their capital investments. So that&#8217;s what an equity holder is entitled to. So let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m not too concerned about like the moral hazards that it might bring because all those people who need to get punished will have the penalty anyway. And certainly I would say that FTX does have something good in its exchange. We know that FTX has been running well. It is Alameda&#8217;s in the back door and everything that will long. People still enjoy the simple user experience, still enjoy the trading experience, and there&#8217;s some value into it. So if someone who could take it from here and inherit the Google parts of FTX and relaunch, and sort of like give a chance and compensate some of the existing, I mean, previous users, I would say that this is good for the industry after all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I agree with you. The only thing that could be really bad there is if the relaunch happens and they do the same shit, which I can&#8217;t see happening with how much scrutiny and publicity and how many eyes are on them. So I agree with you. This does seem like asymmetric upside. It seems like there&#8217;s only a lot to gain for FTX and everyone who is affected by FTX. But I mean, that would be crazy. Yeah, you should spearhead that. That&#8217;d be good news, good vibes. We could use that. Let&#8217;s jump into one of the trends that you are big on right now. And that is the recent trend of well known traditional finance players entering the crypto space. Obviously, everyone is extremely bullish on this. When you have an established financial institution that enters the space, you have increased validation and trust. It gives us more opportunity for wider institutional adoption. And just obviously the mainstream awareness of digital assets as a whole. We have obviously the Bitcoin ETF filings. We have stablecoins. We have PayPal getting involved. The Ethereum ETF as well. Great news. What&#8217;s going on in this regard at the moment? Give us the TLDR on everything related to big TradFi players entering the crypto space.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. I think like falling for ETF is nothing new, but what&#8217;s changed this time is that all those major players, all big names like BlackRocks and Fidalities, also joined again. And as well on the stablecoin France, we know PayPal is one of the largest Fintech companies in the world. Also, I mean, launched a stablecoin recently. And in Asia, you saw monetary authorities of Singapore release the response to stablecoins regulations and already, and like framework coming up and lots of respondents from all those traditional financial players as well. I mean, a lot has been happening and major players are in a game. But I would say what&#8217;s interesting to know is the timing. You think about it as what is particular about the timing right now. Number one, it is a bear market. I&#8217;m not sure what you remember that, but during the last bear cycle, all those traditional financial players, big investment banks were saying that they are orders the pot burns to trade cryptos when Bitcoin was on the rise, but suddenly just pull off and stop the efforts when Bitcoin price crashed. And this time again, it&#8217;s a bear market, but the efforts still there. So I would say that at least it indicates that crypto has formally been established and it&#8217;s being recognized as not a scam, not just a bubble that could just last for a few days, but recognized as a very formal asset class by the large institutional players. That might be because they also see a lot of interest from institutional players and their retail clients. So it was interesting to see that. I would say the other point to know is that it is during a time when lots of regulatory crackdowns happen, like the SEC one. So that might indicate that all those larger players are also seeing the regulation clarity on the way and feel positive about the future regulations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. You absolutely bang on there, Rachel. Absolutely bang on. Next topic I&#8217;d love to get into, the start of the show, SynFutures. Give us the TLDR, give us the elevator pitch, then we&#8217;ll get into all the fun stuff, the derivatives exchange, and of course the NFT derivatives as well, which is super cool. But give us the elevator pitch on SynFutures, why are you and the team created it, what it is today, what you have cooking, and then we&#8217;ll get into some of the nitty gritty.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. SynFutures is a derivative exchange that runs by, let&#8217;s say, Amazon type models. So anyone could lease and trade anything on the platforms in 30 seconds. So it could occur at any time. everything like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all those altcoins. And yes, you said NFT as well. It is until the one of the largest derivative exchange platform, and it was the largest derivative platforms on Polygons earlier. And it was also backed by groups of very renowned investors, including Polychains, Pantera, Framework, Dragonfly, and standard cryptos among others. The interesting thing about SynFutures is that we came into the space and from day one, we adopted a fully permissionless approach. So I mean, until today we are the first and the only one that&#8217;s providing the tools for everyone to create any pairs for derivatives in 30 seconds. We have enjoyed good success for the past two versions, 20 billion cumulative training volume already. But what&#8217;s exciting is they will launch in a new version 3. Just a little teaser that we&#8217;ll be launching a revolutionary model that will be able to unify concentrated liquidity that is range, with on chain order box. So stay tuned that we&#8217;ll be releasing information here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s wild. Let&#8217;s jump right into it.

Rachel, one thing that I always get asked from friends, family, network, you name it, when they finally start learning about DeFi, which obviously is what you and the team at SynFutures are, I always get asked, what makes DeFi better than TradFi? They obviously don&#8217;t use the words TradFi, but they go, why crypto, why DeFi, why should I get into DeFi? I keep hearing that it is more efficient. It helps me as I am underbanked or unbanked. It helps me get more power, ownership, control, transparency, you name it, yield farming, whole nine yards. But if someone like my parents or someone in my network were to go, Rachel, what are you doing? the advantages of DeFi over TradFi, what would you say to them?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, you&#8217;re right. Those both words about decentralization and transparencies, but the important thing is that what do they mean. Right? If I&#8217;m going to give the answer, I would say that I&#8217;ll just explain two words. One word is what is openness and permissionless. That&#8217;s what separates DeFi from TradFi nowadays. I mean, one of the most important parts. So what does it mean by openness? It meant that to your parents, the whole world&#8217;s financial services is open to you. You could enjoy JPMorgan private banks&#8217; products. You could use city banks&#8217; service prime services. You could ask Goldman Sachs to help you to sort of like doing MMA with very small toys or whatever small projects that you want, all the things are open to use. And what they call Metamask just simple what&#8217;s best is this, nobody will ever hold your assets. None of the institutions would hold your assets in DeFi. Just one simple wallet, it could go from like today in Citibank and in 10 seconds you could just go to whatever other services as you want and all are just in the hands of your keys. So that&#8217;s the good thing for the users for openness. And for, I mean like, but I think there&#8217;s another group that I might like to adjust just for us like the builders. So the good thing about openness for DeFi is that it&#8217;s significantly lower the barrier for developers and entrepreneurs. Think about the huge teams that you need to hire in order to start the business. But here in DeFi, I mean like you could, as what we said, you could just use Citibank&#8217;s accounts and if you like BlackRock&#8217;s custody services, you could just build things and innovate on top of this. And all those institutions who also provide proof to your customers that yes, you did move the customer funds through their account to enjoy the services. So openness is really something that&#8217;s amazing and powerful. I would make a comparisons to the Web2 world. It was like previously you could only read AOL or sums up to some of the, I mean ready make papers that everyone said, but right now you have YouTube, you have podcasts, you have Twitter&#8217;s and you get access to so many different types of information out there. But Web2 is just for information. But in Web3, you can enjoy the financial services as well. So that&#8217;s the first word about openness. If I were to explain the words of trustless, I think that&#8217;s the only accents of the blockchain&#8217;s trustless. What do you mean by trustless? Again, in Web2, trustless is just an exchange of information. So you are in Canada, right? If you ever do something bad to me via internet, I can do nothing, right? So if I don&#8217;t know, I mean, I could at most just say something bad about you so you cannot get punished. What happens is that in these cases, the cause of trust is so high that we have to believe in all those large players in the world. We believe in like Google or Facebook or all those large institutions in that, I mean, like that huge so they cannot bear their reputational race. And for some very small players, we can&#8217;t really rely on them, right? But in Web3, because assets are just on chain. So if Matt, you ever done something bad, I would just get hold of your assets immediately and you&#8217;ll get punished immediately because all those are written in smart contracts. So and it gives us a way to, I mean, really monitor all the activities that Matt, you have done and give us a way to punish you if you ever done something wrong. So you could see that like a two month curve projects could attract like billions of assets out there. And we don&#8217;t need to rely on very huge players out there to get the services. We could trust in the code. We could trust in the systems and we could see through everything transparently on what happened out there and get the services as we want. So this is very powerful in that it gives opportunity to so many providers in the world and everyone will have the opportunity to enjoy so many different services. We don&#8217;t need to, I mean, like giving lots of others benefits to those large players like Google or take all your data without paying anything. So that&#8217;s the beautiful thing about DeFi over TradFi, I would say.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said there. You and the team launched V3 and the again, the V2 of your DeFi derivatives platform has already surpassed one billion in cumulative trading volume, which is huge and obviously that&#8217;s all available and all the data is public and Dune, shut out Dune, incredible dashboards, best in the space. The V3 rollout has an updated AMM model, a dubbed oyster AMM, that sounds like a Rolex to me, very interesting, maybe it is, we&#8217;ll get into that. But walk me through everything that is new on the V3 rollout and then we&#8217;ll get into the last part, which is NFTures which is the NFT Futures slash derivatives platform, which is super cool, but we&#8217;ll save that for last before that, tell me more about the V3 rollout and what is new in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure, if you were on the decentralized exchange, while you were noted that I mean, there&#8217;s lots of debate over by simplicity and efficiency, right? AMM, I get people&#8217;s disemplacities, should lease assets, but the capital efficiency is being always a challenge. So in SynFutures V3, we solved this problem by bringing revolutionary models, the work of our PhDs for a very long time. It has several features. Number one, it offers concentrated liquidities for derivatives. By concentrated liquidity, you might refer to what we built on top of the blocks of units, what we built before, where you will be able to provide liquidity in certain range and boost the liquidity efficiency. But beyond that, it is still one that is designed for derivatives. So, I mean, we introduced lots of management and account management on top of the centralized concentrated liquidity. As well, I mean, like, we developed a model so that you could provide liquidity with one single token. So that is our concentrated liquidity model for derivatives system one. And secondly, we also introduced the audible features and what&#8217;s best, fully on chance. And I mean, like, it is, I mean, I would say among the first to have this all fully on chain so that you will be able to enjoy the capital efficiencies that&#8217;s very similar to CFI. The coolest thing above all is that all these are unified in one model. So, unified liquidity across all of them and so you have the best of both AMM and order book. It is a very significant leap from our previous versions and we&#8217;ll be releasing all those tech documents in the very coming days as I state to you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>We got to go over Dubbed Oyster. Was that a Rolex term? What&#8217;s the deal with that? What does that mean?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>So, yeah, because for our models, if you&#8217;re ever looking at XYK curve, actually did you read through all those like X, XY equals K, right? It is a curve. But with limit order, it&#8217;s like a pearl. Like all the sleekly is concentrated on certain points, so it&#8217;s like a pearl on the curve. So what oyster means is that number one, like throughout all those models, you&#8217;ll find all those oysters everywhere. And then for our models, it could support any type of assets. So unlimited possibilities out there for you. That&#8217;s the reason why we call it oyster.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So cool there. I love that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>You like it?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it&#8217;s great. One of the things you ought to walk me through is your guys tagline, which tagline slash Logan slash ethos, which is you as positioning yourselves as the Amazon of derivatives by creating an open and trustless derivatives market. Where does the whole Amazon thing come into play there? Is that just the fact that it&#8217;s a very open marketplace where anyone can come on through their products, i.e. coins and trading pairs on and you guys take care of the rest, something like that?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I always compare our platforms to like Amazon. So even I mean for DeFi compares to the e-commerce well, I mean in the old world, I mean you true with the traditional centralized exchange, it is the exchange who detects what you are able to trade right? And it&#8217;s the exchange who need to seek out a supplier. Which means market makers to provide the assets that you want but in our platform is a completely new Paradigm so anyone could come over to a platform just supplies one single token say 100 USDC and then I could create a Mac versus USDC trading pairs in 30 seconds as long as you have a price reference benchmark that definitely. So yeah, so far we have over 250 different pairs listed already I mean the largest numbers in decentralized as well and it&#8217;s the beauties of decentralized&nbsp; derivative it&#8217;s a very open market.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Of course and the last thing Rachel we need to get into the NFT Futures, NFTures. I believe it&#8217;s pronounced super cool obviously a couple companies happen to sell right now. This was very new I don&#8217;t believe that this was out back in 2022. I could be wrong. But again, we have it already but it was late 2022 NFTures are massive if the NFT market ever picks up. Who knows if it ever will but if it does futures will be massive. How much it&#8217;ll take to get this out to market obviously you guys have had some huge volume 15,000 signups in the first 24 hours. What&#8217;s going on with the NFTures platform right now?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, people love NFT Futures and we designed the way that is very fun to play what is a Tinder style game that you could just click on like and dislike and do a long and short. You don&#8217;t even need to use your keyboard to make a trade. So it attracts lots of users. And I think that&#8217;s also, I mean, I try lots of partners as well, because everyone is interested to learn about how we design NFTures and what it is in partnership, opportunities. And yeah, you enjoy lots of success, lots of uses. And although that I would say that, honestly, recently the volume season has high because the whole NFT market has been, I mean, in the bearer cycles, but we do expect the volumes to pick up quickly as the NFTures going into the next cycle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Rachel, this has been absolute treat. We have one more segment on the show. It is called the hot take factory. You and I jump in, we let a couple of hot takes fly. It doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto related. It can be health, wealth, happiness, aliens, AI, you name it. But give me a couple of Rachel hot takes before you let us go today.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel Lin</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. Since you mentioned AI, I actually believe that blockchain have its most user case and seen massive adoptions when AI come into play. The reason is that, I mean, why it simply just put backs in five years, you see a completely different cell phone from today&#8217;s. You don&#8217;t need to have that so many apps, right? What&#8217;s in there should be, what should be a digital version of yourself? A digital version of Matt would help you schedule everything and make the orders and compare the orders according to your preference and then select the best suppliers and then just remember, hey, Matt is time for a nice dinner and then you go, right? So you don&#8217;t really need to install that much different apps in your, and AI could help this. And in such a world, you know that you should have a type of payments system that is open enough to pay to whatever suppliers that come and go that could connect all the different apps out there, throughout all different corporates that&#8217;s not belong to just one single giant out there. And we do have a solution already, which is called blockchain and cryptocurrencies. And with the digital economy coming into place, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a blockchain employer in even larger role in our everyday life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Big AI fan. And of course, blockchain. We love that. Rachel, incredible episode. Thank you so much for coming on. Learned a ton. Had a blast. Would love to have you on for round two.
