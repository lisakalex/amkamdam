										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week in crypto: a lot! This a lot included Binance, CZ, Sam Altman, OpenAI, Kraken, Coinbase, lawsuits, banks, hacks…</p>
<p>First up: Binance! What a week for the exchange. Prosecutors were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-prosecutors-move-to-block-former-binance-ceo-cz-return-to-uae.htm">pressing a federal judge to prevent former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao from leaving the US</a> before his scheduled sentencing hearing, and then, CZ was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-cz-released-on-175-million-bond.htm">released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond after his guilty plea</a>, and as part of the settlement with the US DOJ, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">CZ resigned from Binance which agreed to pay a hefty $4.3 billion</a> in penalties. Binance wallets <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-wallets-move-approximately-4-billion-in-stablecoin-ahead-of-doj-settlement.htm">moved $3.9 billion worth of USDT</a> ahead of the settlement, CZ was reportedly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-still-worth-15-billion-despite-guilty-plea-forbes.htm">still worth $15 billion</a> despite pleading guilty to federal money laundering charges, and former Head of Regional Markets <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">Richard Teng took over as CEO</a>.</p>
<p>Per one report, Binance’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nansen-report-binances-total-asset-holdings-remain-stable-after-doj-settlement.htm">total asset holdings remained stable</a> after the DOJ settlement, another said the outflow was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptoquant-reports-decline-in-binances-bitcoin-reserves-as-retail-flow-shifts-to-coinbase.htm">shifting towards Coinbase</a>, JPMorgan said Binance’s settlement marked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-says-binances-record-4-3b-settlement-removes-systemic-risk-calls-it-positive.htm">a positive development for the company</a> and the broader cryptocurrency sector, Bernstein argued Binance will <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bernstein-report-binance-will-remain-the-top-global-crypto-exchange-despite-doj-settlement.htm">maintain its position as the dominant global exchange</a>, and Brian Armstrong stated the settlement is a chance for the industry <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-sees-binance-settlement-as-chance-for-industry-renewal.htm">to prioritize rule clarity to prevent regulators from slamming huge fines</a> on companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AltmanGate continued and became only weirder. Top management of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/openai-scrambles-to-prevent-staff-from-leaving-having-intense-discussions-report.htm">OpenAI was scrambling to “reunify” the organization</a> following the dramatic ousting of the co-founder Sam Altman, and WLD jumped amid the news that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoins-wld-gains-6-as-sam-altman-joins-microsoft-to-lead-its-new-ai-research-team.htm">Microsoft hired Altman and Greg Brockman</a>. But then a twist! Altman <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-altman-to-return-back-to-openai-whats-going-on.htm">will return back to run the company as the CEO</a> under a new board.</p>
<p>The US regulators weren’t done, though. The SEC came after Kraken again, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-faces-sec-charges-for-unlawful-crypto-trading-operations.htm">claiming securities law violations and internal control failures</a>, Jesse Powell called the US regulators <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm">masochists attacking America and extortionists chasing crypto companies</a> out of the country, and US Senator <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/senator-cynthia-lummis-slams-sec-for-its-ruling-by-enforcement-approach-following-kraken-lawsuit.htm">Cynthia Lummis slammed the SEC for its “ruling by enforcement” approach</a> following the Kraken lawsuit. Meanwhile, Coinbase again called on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-seeks-us-courts-assistance-to-compel-sec-on-crypto-rule-making.htm">the US justice system to persuade the SEC</a> to provide clear regulatory guidelines on crypto assets.</p>
<p>In other legal news, the judge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sbf-granted-post-trial-extension-in-new-signed-order.htm">granted an extension to Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers</a> to submit their post-trial motions on December 1, Apple faced <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/apple-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-blocking-p2p-payments-for-crypto-apps.htm">class action lawsuit over blocking P2P payments</a> for crypto apps, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/genesis-files-lawsuit-against-former-business-partner-gemini-trust-seeking-to-recover-689-million.htm">Genesis Global Capital sued Gemini Trust</a> in an attempt to reclaim over $689 million, the trial of the CEO of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trial-of-bithumb-operators-ceo-begins.htm">Bithumb’s parent company began in Seoul</a>, Mt. Gox creditors were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mt-gox-creditors-to-receive-bitcoin-payments-starting-2023-based-on-rehabilitation-plan.htm">informed of a repayment plan beginning in 2023</a>, and Steven Nerayoff’s attorney said they have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/steven-nerayoff-lawsuits-will-reveal-facts-supporting-claims-against-key-ethereum-figures-says-attorney.htm">ample evidence to back up the lawsuits against the US Government and private actors</a>, some of which will implicate major players in Ethereum’s early days. Meanwhile, the director of “47 Ronin” <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hollywood-meets-crypto-director-uses-netflix-funds-for-risky-dogecoin-bet.htm">took nearly $60 million that Netflix had given him for a sci-fi series to invest in crypto</a> and stocks.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show. This gentleman might have the nicest and best beard in all of the crypto sphere. We have Frederik Gregaard, coming in hot today, the CEO of the Cardano Foundation, a true leader in fintech and blockchain, who has a background in banking, and wealth management and asset management. He joined the Cardano Foundation in 2020 and leads work across the Foundation&#8217;s three core focus areas, operational resilience, education, and adoption. These focuses guide all of the Foundation&#8217;s activities, and his work has enabled expedited value creation for inclusive and equitable growth using Cardano with the overall goal of decentralized, efficient, and secure economic empowerment for all. Been waiting for this one for a hot minute. Super pumped to have this lad on. Fred, welcome to the show, my friend. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I&#8217;m doing excellent. Thank you for asking and thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you. I got to start with the beard. You have the most electric beard in all the crypto. How long have you been supporting that bad boy for?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a really good question. I don&#8217;t know, like eight, nine years probably, something like that. When I started losing my top hair, I was getting really frustrated. I thought, hey, what can I do? And it turns out I can grow a beard.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Have you ever, so it&#8217;s been eight years, even me. I mean, I think I&#8217;ve gone baby face, I want to say two or three times in the last three years. And every time I do, I&#8217;m always like, holy crap, you look so young, like you look so different. Have you ever put yourself in any of those like AI image generators to see what you look like without the beard?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
No, I haven&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ve been dappling into AI and also longevity treatments for quite a long time in terms of sort of projection also where society goes. So I put myself into one of these aging things, right? But not just an aging things in terms of, you know, an image of me looking really old, but also sort of like where you get into a virtual reality experience and you actually sort of experience based on some life choices, how you will be in your age, right? So in this case, it was a virtual reality experience where I was, I think, 115 years old and I was sitting in this flat and I was having problems moving. And that was definitely not the place I wanted to be, right? Because it was sort of like a two room apartment with no view and, you know, there was a microwave oven. It was not a lot of green and sustainable food, right? It was sort of packaged food I was supposed to eat and that came sort of elated to sort of mend me and treat me. And, you know, it opens a few eyes, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. No, I love how we started this. Before we get into Cardano Foundation and obviously your business past, I&#8217;d love to let myself and the listeners learn a little bit more about the guy who is running Cardano Foundation more on the personal life, some habits, some rituals, maybe even we can keep buzzin on the longevity aspect. Me myself, I&#8217;m a big sauna ice bath guy. I know everyone thinks it&#8217;s cheesy, but it makes me feel incredible. It&#8217;s an easy way to get the heart rate up. Whenever I get out of an ice bath, I feel like I&#8217;m Superman. It&#8217;s only time today. I feel like a superhero. The dopamine lasts for literally hours. Do you have any rituals or habits that really move the deal for you?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, I tried to get out in nature. So at the moment, I&#8217;m fortunately injured because I did some very big projects over the summer. But a couple of times a year, I go for a very long run in the mountains. And I learned a lot by being in nature, specifically in remote nature. And one of the things I use the most, sort of in my daily job, is the ability to ask for help. And sometimes you can be a kind of a proud person and you say, I know everything, I&#8217;m the CEO, and I&#8217;m supposed to be able to have all professions sort of catered into one personality. But that&#8217;s simply isn&#8217;t the case. So this ability to ask for help is very strong. And then the other part is the humility when you&#8217;re out in nature and you feel the vibrance and the sunlight and the ice going through the glacier seas and stuff like that. It&#8217;s just very cool.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s the absolute best. When you&#8217;re saying long runs, how long are we talking here?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
So I think the longest sort of recorded run I have is probably around 240 miles. So that&#8217;s quite a distance. And I tend to sort of be in the range of 100, 240 miles. And I do that maybe twice, three times a year. But it&#8217;s sort of always sort of special projects, you know, a special community where you can give something back. It&#8217;s always in the mountains. It&#8217;s sort of always tend to be sort of somewhere remote.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And it&#8217;s crazy the mental clarity you get from going on a long walk or a long run, just like all the clutter, all the nonsense, all the BS, I always find it just always goes away. I absolutely love that. Let&#8217;s jump into your past here before becoming CEO of Cardano Foundation. Fintech Background did a whole bunch. Walk me through a little bit about what you did, and then we&#8217;ll get into the Cardano and all the crypto fund stuff here.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Oh yeah, where should we start? Just before I, you know, Cardano was working for PWC and I built up two things with PWC. I built up what&#8217;s called the blockchain go to markets, including sort of the general strategy. So that includes advisory, audit and legal and so on. And then I built up and we call it an experience center. And many people went there to get exposure to emerging technology, whether there was sensors or AI or machine learning or blockchain. Or whatever that was. But the true nature of the experience center was actually using something called MG Taylor, which is a methodology made by an architect and a Montessori kindergarten teacher, which is about how you align a large group of people. So imagine if you could take 50 to 100 people into a room, lock them in for two days, and you don&#8217;t manipulate them, you don&#8217;t, you know, force and view down on them, you find a topic which they&#8217;re completely aligned on and you let them lose into a business. And that basically accelerates businesses incredible, right? Because, you know, you suddenly don&#8217;t have 100 individuals, you have like an army of change makers which you&#8217;re sending back into the business. So it uses a lot of elements from design thinking, from, you know, smells. So we already had several ovens in the facility in PWC. We&#8217;re always baking bread. So then when people came in, the sort of the sensors were opening up for that smell. We were playing music. We had a grand piano there. Of course, it was machine learning and AI enabled, but we had a grand piano. And if you have a large group of people, there&#8217;s always somebody who can play the piano and it&#8217;s very rare you can do that on a grand piano, right? So, you know, we use sort of different elements to basically open up people&#8217;s life and facades and take away those things and let them be humans interacting with humans and let them be motivated about the things they are motivated about and then basically get the business out of them and then send them back with a, you know, a plan and how they work together to enable large changes in organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. And this was developed by a kindergarten teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, an American kindergarten teacher and she uses a philosophical Montessori, which I think probably a lot of people have heard about. And then an architect, you know, a house architect basically thinking about buildings and you know, how should rooms be constructed? So they were looking at the world and they found that the world was sort of not really going in the direction where there was more love and more alignment and more sort of positive things coming out of humanity was more going in a direction where we saw that people were seeing more disaster, more macroeconomic disaster events, more, you know, evil centralization of power to the wrong persons, et cetera. And they said, you know, what can we do with the skillsets we had? And then they invented this called MG Taylor, which is now sort of a subgroup of people. It&#8217;s probably close to a thousand people worldwide working with this methodology. And it&#8217;s literally changing war zones today. So some of my colleagues has been working on stopping wars. Most other has been working with United Nations World Economic Forum. I spent some time both with the World Economic Forum but also with blockchain. That&#8217;s actually how I came in contact with Charles Hodgkinson was due to some of the work I did there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. And Fred, you just teed me up for my next question here. Taking this job must have been, again, you had multiple incredible jobs at very high level firms, obviously PWC, even the big four consulting firms as well. This must have been a bit of a headscratcher or perhaps I&#8217;m wrong. And it was a no brainer. But when you took this job and when you met Charles, what were sort of the key factors that made you be like, damn, I got to do this.I got to help take this thing to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I was probably my daughter. I was actually thinking I would go back into banking and build a bank for the actual users of the bank and really align the incentives because the thing banking has gone astray is not really helping the people who really need the expertise. So I was thinking and going back to banking and Cardano was one of my clients, you can say, in advisory, right? And then one day my daughter woke up and she had a nightmare and she came down to me and I had sort of basement office and she was asking, you know, crying and said, you know, what are you doing dad? And I was like, well, I&#8217;m helping some dude earn more money. You know, and she was like, why? And I was like, well, I actually don&#8217;t know because I already took the decision to leave PWC and I was sort of like, yeah, why am I actually sitting up at two o &#8216;clock messing with my, you know, a sleep schedule and, you know, away from my family to help somebody, you know, earn more money on an account. He was not really caring about anyway. So, you know, after she left and I talked to her in and she fell asleep, I was sort of thinking about, you know, maybe as an investment banker, there is another route I could do. So I started looking into my portfolio and, you know, I think I was always very impressed by Cardano, specifically the vision and the mission. The purpose of Cardano is so different than many of the other blockchains back then. So I thought, hey, this is actually a way where I can, you know, deploy my skill set and do something with the bank I normally can&#8217;t do. And that is to be a part of potentially, you know, I was about to say saving the world, but that sounds so big, right? But at least ensure that the world becomes a better place for every working day I have compared to just optimizing money in a pyramid scheme somewhere in another industry.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s wild. This is also a masterclass in storytelling. My goodness. I&#8217;ll be listening to this over and over again. This is an absolute masterclass. We just touched on Cardano and he talks about, you briefed on Cardano&#8217;s foundation and obviously not the Cardano foundation, but it&#8217;s foundational elements and three core focus areas, operational resilience, education and adoption. I absolutely love this. I think this needs to be injected into everyone&#8217;s veins in the crypto space and everyone who wants to learn more and jump in as well. I&#8217;d love if you could touch on these three core points, why they&#8217;re so important and how you and the team are moving the needle to bring the next million users into Web3.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Sure. So we have a concept in the Cardano Foundation called blockchain for good. And I think not knowing your listeners, I need to go one step back before we go to blockchain for good. So just keep that as an anchor point. But if you think about what truly makes a public permissionless blockchain special, is the ability that it does not cancel everybody out. It doesn&#8217;t belong to the canceled culture. It does not belong to the culture where you have to be born in a certain country to have a certain identity, to be able to get access to health care, to capital market services or just to vote or whatever that might be. And we have about two billion people around the world who actually don&#8217;t have an identity. And we have a huge digital divide between the people who has and the people who haven&#8217;t. So unfortunately, the way the world is structured at the moment is that everything is centered around this sort of centralized identity service, which you cannot create yourself where you&#8217;re depending on certain trust anchors or institutions who gives you the access permissions to be you, to be who you are. And that, of course, is very dangerous when you then come and say, no, everybody can gain value from Cardano. Everybody can contribute to Cardano and everybody can take something from Cardano and bring that back to your community. Because what it also does is it battles or dabbles with the control, you know, the enforcement control, which we built into society to ensure that people behave, right? And it also says, you know, we are not the one who polices the blockchain. The blockchain is a social good, is a utility. So when the Cardano Foundation speaks about blockchain for good, we mean it in two aspects. The first aspect is sort of an ESG aspect, right? What we&#8217;re saying, you know, if something is available for everybody to do and there is an information asymmetry, and I think about when the start of the internet came, there is a couple of use cases where it&#8217;s very frequently being used, so very few people benefit on behalf of the masses. So you&#8217;re actually saying you&#8217;re seeing a well skewing in the wrong direction, right? So we set forward to say, OK, what can we do? And how can we measure us externally to ensure that we can open up the eyes for what&#8217;s possible to add value to the global society or the spaceship we call Earth today to bring people more together and to show that blockchain can be used for social good? That&#8217;s why we did the tree planting project called Very Tree in Kenya where we got close to planting a million trees where every single tree is actually an NFT who lives on the blockchain. And you can verify who was the planter, and you can get data, so dynamic metadata on a quarterly basis that the tree actually exists and there&#8217;s no double counting. That means it doesn&#8217;t go into the normal greenwashing and all those things you see there. But it&#8217;s also the same rationality and why we work with United Nations, humanitarian crisis organizations and so on. So the idea here is really we&#8217;re taking, OK, if we are not policing the blockchain and we don&#8217;t have a view, we need an external framework to define what is good. And there we use United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. And there&#8217;s 17 of those and we say it has to take a few boxes, huh?  The other part of blockchain for good, sort of the double meaning of the word, is the longevity. So the Cardano Foundation is into the longevity of blockchain. This is a marathon, an ultramarathon. It&#8217;s not a sprint. So most blockchains, they are actually not economically sustainable. And that means that they will run out of juice or gas or funding or whatever you might call it over time, right? And what we&#8217;re really looking at is saying we need to get to a situation that the blockchain becomes immortal. If you want to get to a situation that the blockchain becomes immortal and truly fulfills the promises of being there for humanity across the generations and centuries to come, we need to get to a situation that when you go to a dinner party and you bring your own food to the dinner party, there&#8217;s always too much food because you have this mentality that you bring a little bit more than you can eat yourself. If you go to a centralized dinner party, if I&#8217;m cooking for you, right, you&#8217;ll probably eat all my meat and drink my red wine and you eat too much, really, because it was good, right? And we&#8217;re actually short of resources. So what I&#8217;m trying to say is that these blockchains to be immortal, we need transaction diversity at a scale who covers the incentives for the generations to come. And nearly no blockchain, if any at all, has solved that yet. Therefore, the Cardano Foundation set forward and said, if we look at those two use cases, those two hypothesis of how to enable that, what do we need to do? And the first thing we came to was saying, we have already over a thousand companies who&#8217;s deployed in Cardano. If you want to have business critical infrastructure or humanity critical infrastructure or identity on Cardano, operation resilience is very important. And as you probably know as being a blockchain affinato, the way the blockchain is structured is a complete different security architecture than what we know from the internet and other settings. And that means that for us, operation resilience is one of those things you cannot go down on. I&#8217;ve been quoted at the moment for saying, boring is good, right? So Cardano has actually been up since 2017. It never missed a beat and we processed over 78.3 million transactions or something like that, right? So it&#8217;s really a lot. And we have no downtime, knock on wood. And what we&#8217;re basically doing with the foundation is we have built a real-time network monitoring tool, including the ability to look into the networking stack and other things to ensure that when things are happening, we have a pre-warning, we have ideas about how to do disaster recovery in a decentralized distributed network. We have experts who understand this is again a little bit boring, sorry about that. What&#8217;s the key point when SOC 1 is, which is really these kind of risk mitigations you use when you run a central bank or if you run a hospital or if you run, you know, pacemakers and stuff like that. You cannot just produce a pacemaker and get a hospital to put it in. You need to go through a set of qualifications who allows you to do that. So that&#8217;s the operation resilience. We truly believe that if a blockchain is fast and brave, that&#8217;s probably not what you want if this is going to be the foundations of society forever, right? You want something who is peer-reviewed, academic, who has a very tough operation resilience, specifically when you know that the product to market fit is not a straight fit, right? So if you look around the blockchain and crypto world, we have all these discussions about the regulatory environment in the US and we have all these, you know, what is the use cases and maybe blockchain had over promised a bit. And what that basically tells you is that the actual huge use cases of blockchain in the future has not been there yet. They&#8217;re coming, huh? So you need a way also to adapt the code base to ensure that this product to market fit in the future will be there. Now how do you adapt the code base? Well you have to start thinking about who is going to tell you what features they need in order for them to use the blockchain. Secondly, do you pay them for it or do they do it because there&#8217;s business value? And therefore education actually became a very important part of us because when we looked into the education landscape, everybody speaks about tokenization, everybody speaks about CBDCs, everybody speaks about Bitcoin, people speaks about how Ethereum was able to replace Wall Street in capital assimilation. But they don&#8217;t speak about identity in Ethiopia for students. They don&#8217;t speak about supply chain for 100,000 bottles of wine from 22 different wineries signed off by the National Wine Agency in Georgia. They don&#8217;t speak about scattered random diamonds who can be injected in cancer medicine so you can track and ensure that that is the exact medicine. Now that&#8217;s what we are touching upon in the Cardano Foundation because we think this is actually what&#8217;s going to kickstart the blockchain revolution. So this part of having free available high quality education who can get business people to understand the magic what engineers and IT people already know so they can understand where does the use case fit and where doesn&#8217;t it fit is why education is so important. Secondly, by writing these scripts as the foundation has now done in public, where you can get that for free, you can translate it, you can build an app on it, you can do whatever you want with it, it&#8217;s under an open source or public source license. So that basically means that there&#8217;s a business model to be had to do it in Arabic or to do it in Japanese and do a learning platform. But we provide all the content for free because we want the whole world to understand blockchain, not just Cardano. And the other part of that is of course when you look into the regulatory space, which is difficult, right? Because as I told you in the start, when you have public permission as blockchains, you&#8217;re giving away enforcement power, right? What it really does is it opens up the opportunity to address the regulator and tell them about that blockchain is more than capital markets. The blockchain is more than a utility token or security token. The blockchain is value creation, is job creation, is changes democracy, it does a lot of things, right? So this ability for us to do that also led us to building a REC TEK tool. So I think we are the only Layer 1 blockchain we ever built a REC TEK tool for policy makers and regulators who basically takes down the pants of a blockchain and says, you know what? We are very open to talk to you about staking. We are open to talk to you about incentives. So let us tell you how exactly staking works in Cardano. And you will find there&#8217;s no slashing, there&#8217;s no login mechanism or period, there&#8217;s no ownership change. So if you look into current capital markets infrastructure, you can now see with your own eyes why we are different than many others. And not only can you see that, you can verify that all the way down to the actual blockchain and to the code, depending on your knowledge level. And then we took the educational content and we pushed that into that workflow diagram in our Explorer to show that. And we now been in contact in the last two, three months, I think, with close to 10 different regulators and enforcement agencies and showed them this. And they are just like completely excited. One of them said, you&#8217;re bringing trust back into blockchain, which I think is a very powerful statement, but also is a testament to where we as an industry might have misjudged the environment a little bit. So those two anchors into what we&#8217;re really trying to do with this adoption. So what you really need is you need a multitude of different use cases on the blockchain whether that&#8217;s Cardano&#8217;s blockchain or another one, is actually a little bit irrelevant. But you want to get as many people to live on the blockchain as possible, because specifically how Cardano works is that when you do a transaction on Cardano, the transaction fees is being rooted through the treasury into the incentive structure, and that basically pays the state pool operators for operating Cardano. So the more transactions you have, and the more diversity in transactions, and the more they use the blockchain for what it was meant to do, so smart contracts and native assets, the higher is the transaction fee is by the way the terministic fees in Cardano, so you can calculate that down to the cent, the more economic sustainable it becomes. So this anchors into this sort of idea about blockchain for good, right? That you need to have those components in place to allow the legacy world, the Web2 world, but also the legacy in real world, you know, the supply chain companies and commodity companies and supermarkets to go on a blockchain, you need to answer a few questions and you need to show that your technology stack is ready for that.</p>

I love that. Fred that was absolutely electric. I love the spiel there. So many points we can touch on. We do need to give our sponsor of the show a quick shout out. But before then, one of my favorite things that you just discussed in that little spiel was just one of the best things about Cardano and you said, it&#8217;s a little boring and it&#8217;s sexy. It&#8217;s a little boring and it&#8217;s a little unsexy. It does what needs to be done. It is a perfect layer for powering all these applications and projects that want to come on the blockchain and a shit ton, pardon my French, of real world applications. And that&#8217;s what we need for the blockchain to grow. It can&#8217;t just be, hey, we&#8217;re a coin, number go up, number go down. The financial incentives needs to go away. There needs to be some real world use cases and we are going to get into that in one second folks. But until then, huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime friends of the Cryptonews Podcast. You know who we&#8217;re talking about. That is PrimeXBT. They offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layout and widgets to best fit your trading style and take advantage of their highly reliable market data and performance. They are giving all of you guys a sweet promo code that will give you 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. The promo code is <strong>CRYPTONEWS50</strong>. That is CRYPTONEWS50, all one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with Fred. Fred, let&#8217;s jump into some of the recent projects that you and the team have done at Cardano Foundation. I am not going to lie. I love a good glass of vino every once in a while. Red, white, rose, you name it. When I was doing research for the show, I learned about the George and Wine partnership. That is so friggin&#8217; cool. You got to give us the TLDR. What happened there? How did you guys make this happen? I think this is absolutely brilliant and I would love for more of this to happen in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Wow, the truth of this is probably starting all the way back in the Soviet Union. So when the Soviet Union collapsed, something new happened. And that is what people don&#8217;t realize is that wine was most likely invented in Georgia. But under the Soviet Union, they were only allowed to market their product within the Soviet Union. So when the Italian wine and Spanish wine were sort of living on this marketing grace, you know, and building these strong for the world&#8217;s best wine, well, they had communism, right? But it means also that for them, wine is their identity. Every single family nearly has their own wine receipts and they work together with local vineyards and so on. So when we came in contact with the agricultural ministry there, what we learned was that the quality controls for their wine is extraordinary high. And they were talking about how do we export the Georgian culture and how do we show the world what Georgia is made of? You know, obviously they&#8217;re thinking about, you know, business opportunities, they&#8217;re thinking about tourism, they&#8217;re thinking about the country Georgia&#8217;s brand and what do they have to offer. And their wine was a big thing. So we were in competition with a couple of other blockchains, even a specific wine blockchain even, very specialized. And it turned out that due to us, you know, being who we are in terms of academic reviews and being able to answer those questions around disaster recovery and, you know, business continuity and all those kind of things, we were elected to do that. And we found a local partner in Switzerland because blockchain alone does not anchor into a physical product. So we worked together with a company called Scantrust who does high definition QR codes. And the first thing we did was authenticity. So the ability to authenticate that the wine you have is actually the real wine who comes from the fields. Right? So, you know, on the internet, you have all these sort of copycats and you never really know what you buy. And what I thought was, oh, hey, this is really good. This is engine room stuff. You know, this is about, you know, security and so on. But what it turns out was that this small winery was actually a female wine producer called Bayer. She got sold out of, you know, within for a year or something like that. So people in Norway and Korea was buying Georgian wine where there was never any commercials about Georgia at all. Because there&#8217;s a new generation on the internet with you and I probably belong to, which I think about as blockchain citizens. And we actually want to verify what we buy if that&#8217;s actually the right thing we buy, because we&#8217;ve been through the the treadmill of getting, you know, fake iPhones home or get, you know, Chinese copies or whatever it is. Right? And the other part was that she was able to very cheaply portray herself through the user experience. Right? So she could talk about her field and her history and those kind of things. And what we now done this year is we turned it from an authenticity solution into a track and trace solution. So we&#8217;re actually putting the right now just labeling it, but we&#8217;re talking about 100,000 bottles of wine from the region of Bolnisi. And what&#8217;s very interesting here is that the government of Georgia is signing every single bottle on the blockchain that has been through the export control, including customs are signing off when it leaves the country. And that means that you&#8217;re suddenly relying on something where this blockchain was made to do, but it&#8217;s very hard to do. And that&#8217;s something called verified credentials. So the ability to verify that you are the right trusted authority to sign this data on the blockchain. And you as a consumer will then be able, if it has a business value for you, to track every single one of those 100,000 bottles and get the story of the vineyard, including the fields and the grapes and the produce and all of that through the user experience. And you can then verify that with the, you know, national wine agency under the agricultural ministry. And you can, you know, see if it&#8217;s really true, right? So we do that together with Scantrust and the country of Georgia. And my hope is that here sort of in Q1 when they finish bottling, that&#8217;s going to be hitting, you know, worldwide. And everybody out there who buys a Bolnisi, one of those 100,000 bottles will be able to insight with the Cardano blockchain and understand a little bit better what blockchain actually can be used for, both in terms of exporting culture, but also in terms of verifying track and trace and authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. I&#8217;m not here in Mexico at the moment on the east coast. And I&#8217;m, I do know a couple people in the wine game. So I&#8217;m going to be hitting them up after the show and I&#8217;ll see if I can get my hands on one of those bottles. That would be absolutely incredible. Also, thanks for the history lesson there. I did not know that Georgia was like the sort of birthplace of wine. I would have guessed it was like you said, you know, one of the Spain, Italy or France or one of the like, but so cool. Another topic I&#8217;d love to get into Fred is obviously the global blockchain landscape. Do you guys are front runners and leaders and actually speaking with the big boys and the big gals at the top of the food chains in the regulatory space? What are some of the conversations that are happening right now? I know you obviously can&#8217;t spill all the beans. I mean, we&#8217;d love a nice little breaking news flash on the Cryptonews pod, but what are some of the policy developments going on in the blockchain space right now from a regulatory standpoint?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, so to be honest, right now the US is actually quite quiet. And I know this sounds a bit odd, right? Because obviously you see a lot of headlines and so on. But, you know, I think we&#8217;re going into election season there, right? And all they&#8217;re building up cases or they&#8217;re running cases, right? In Europe, the big thing is MiCA. MiCA is sort of the, let&#8217;s call it the stable coin and a couple of other things, regulation on cryptocurrencies, which is coming into force. And there is a sort of a grace period to be compliant there. And there&#8217;s a couple of things, sort of curve balls who are thrown into that mix. And I think in a certain way, this is sort of is very good policymaking from the European Union. Conceptually, I&#8217;m a little bit questioning a few points. And one of the points is, I think you should not hinder innovation. So they&#8217;re basically protecting the inner market of the European Union and ensuring that if you are having a stable coin, it actually needs to be issued by somebody under MiCA license. So, for instance, probably see Tether and USDC and others will, you know, very quickly need to figure out how they get, you know, a European issue. But we&#8217;re already in discussions with MiCA 2. And MiCA 2 is going to cover more than stable coins and then utility tokens is also going to go into most likely things like NFTs and yield farming and staking and other things. And that&#8217;s going to be very interesting. And I hope that more Layer 1s will start engaging in that. Out of Japan is really interesting. They&#8217;ve come up with some really good regulation. It&#8217;s very protective, but it&#8217;s very clear. And as you probably know, Cardano and ADA, our utility token has been whitelisted to the JBCA there for years. So we&#8217;re really ready to engage. And we just spent some time together with the Swiss regulator in a workshop, but also the European banking authorities and European security and market authorities sort of like equivalent to the SEC and the FCA in the UK and showed them the REC TEK tool I spoke to about earlier. And the two things that really starting to ask questions about which are really interesting, the first one is they start understanding they cannot be technology agnostic. Before they were like, OK, a blockchain is a blockchain. It has to be fair game if it&#8217;s a blockchain. It&#8217;s equal. But now they&#8217;re saying, well, there&#8217;s so big differences in terms of the blockchain. It&#8217;s not just if it&#8217;s, you know, a proof of stake or proof of work. It&#8217;s actually also if it&#8217;s a proof of relevant history, a proof of history. But it&#8217;s also is it multi-party computation or zero knowledge proof. And, you know, what is the incentives in there? You know, do you have like a slashing or do you only have positive reinforcements like Cardano? So they&#8217;re really asking very good and detailed questions. And they were very positive when we showed them the Cardano Explorer with these regulatory tooling in there where they can verify how Cardano is built. The other thing we sort of surprised me a bit was that they had a lot of questions on business continuity and a disaster recovery. And what that makes it means is that they are not just looking and saying, OK, I have a little use case, a little token on top of a blockchain. Well, they actually start looking at, OK, they have requests from large counterparties to move some of the infrastructure who normally would be in a centralized, you know, environment to a distributed, decentralized environment. So they had really deep questions around, you know, block propagation around centralization of staking or mining, how you monitor the network, how you flag certain actions, can you do front running in and those kind of aspects. And luckily, I&#8217;m sort of coming from a world of building banks and my chief legal officer is coming from the Swiss regulators and he has a specialty in distributed systems. So we were able to have these dialogues with them. And I think on one hand, this is scary and on the other hand, this is very positive. I look at it very positively because it means that we are getting into the place where blockchain is accepted much more. But we are still playing a finite window where we could end up with some not so good regulation in terms of really utilizing the value of blockchain. So there is definitely if I have one cry out for your listeners, is find as many non financial use cases you can on a blockchain. Doesn&#8217;t matter which one and start tweeting about it, start talking about it, speak to your friends, do your elevator pitch? Because the more people realize that the blockchain is not associated with capital markets and banking only, but it&#8217;s a worldwide industry optimization game, the better it is for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Very quickly, Fred, before we move on to our next question here, and I know we&#8217;re getting a little tight for time as well. The overall sentiment, though, from the regulators, there&#8217;s no way that it&#8217;s not better than what&#8217;s a couple of years ago. I feel like every couple of years, they become more educated. They learn more about blockchain as a whole and understand more potential use cases that are non-financial, incentive, and capital markets related. Would you say that that&#8217;s true?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I think that&#8217;s true for some regulators. So I mean, I was a little bit scared of highlighting people or pointing fingers, right? But I would say definitely the Swiss regulator, Luxembourg, FCA, MIS in Singapore, Hong Kong, has definitely taken, and the European Union has taken huge steps forward. I really truly feel that. I think I can agree with your sentiment there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. And last little thing, then we will wrap up here Fred, Cardano Foundation. You guys had an incredible year and obviously we are recording mid November. This episode will air mid to end ish November. You guys just did Cardano Summit 2023 in Dubai. That looked like an absolute bang or that looked like an incredible time. I&#8217;d love for you to touch on that. And then a little forward looking here, what&#8217;s on the docket for 2024? What do you have on the back burner? What are you in the plan? What are you and the team have planned for 2024? Can&#8217;t wait to see all this stuff pop off.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
That was a good question. Let&#8217;s see where we start. I think what was truly unique about the Cardano Summit in Dubai, and by the way, we did 30 different locations around the world at the same time as we did Dubai, so plus minus two weeks. So it&#8217;s not just Dubai is really around the world. I think what people really paid attention to was the fact that we had regulators and policymakers to a Layer 1 event present, but not just present like members of parliament in the actual crowd. We had them on the stage, really discussing and nearly brainstorming each other with how we do and how we can do better in enabling that. So a big thank you for the city of Dubai to basically host us there. The other part was the attendance. What a lot of people told me was, hey, this doesn&#8217;t feel like a crypto bro event. This feels like industry blockchain. We had the World Trade Organization there. We had the United Nations there. We had Fortune 500 companies. We had large industry companies like Trade Zones, who has 23,000 companies in their trade zone who was there. And that combined with all the engineers and the blockchain affinados who were sort of mixing together and finding out what works and doesn&#8217;t work and signing deals and doing things. So I think this dynamic where you really feel the blockchain is getting maturing in terms of the industry adoption, I think that was fantastic and really high quality content as well. If you miss some of it, some of the YouTube videos is now live. And specifically some of this stuff on the technical side, with side chains and interoperability, its identity is really key to understanding where blockchain is today. On your other question, so what&#8217;s happening next year? So Operation Resilience will continue. I think we will never stop there. So Operation Resilience, Mainnet Monitoring, Cybersecurity, Bug Bounty and those kind of aspects. I think this is truly important. As you&#8217;ve probably seen, Cardano is the large Layer 1 who has the most GitHub commits, right? So it basically means we are adding more and more code as more and more companies are relying on Cardano. And that obviously means that we need to be much more careful there and we need to get the right Q&amp;A and things in process. The other thing which you can expect as you&#8217;re going to see a lot more open source from us. So already this year we did Python libraries and Java libraries, but most importantly we did a project called Icon Boot Flap from the Foundation in full open source. And if you saw the adoption circle, so the amount of time it took to develop this in the true open source format and the amount of adoption, plus that it actually is 10 times faster and 10 times easier than the original smart contracting language on Cardano, you got to be wondering, isn&#8217;t that the future for solving the product to market fit on blockchain, right? I think this is like true amazing. So we&#8217;re going to build on this icon, which is called, on the learnings there and also our connections to the Linux Foundation and the Apache Foundation and what we learned and interacting in those ecosystems. And then we&#8217;re going to do a lot more in open source and not just sort of small things, but we&#8217;re really going to try and see if we can push the envelope there. Then Technical Enablers is still a big thing. So you saw our ledger sync came out this year, which is a database you can see. We did some changes to the command line interface and we did some changes to&#8230; a couple of other things. So what we&#8217;re hoping to get out with is what we call a metadata bus, which we already, actually, Bolnisi Wine is living on that. So think about a combination of how you structure metadata, identity and transaction building in a tool. So basically to lower the cost of operating on Cardano. So tooling and those kind of things is some of the things we really want to deliver, but tooling in a way that business architects can get full value of it. And then obviously we are, as you know, in Cardano, we are in the age of Voltaire, which is the governance era. So we&#8217;re going to, hopefully, we&#8217;ve been working very hard on that with the community. We had over 50 workshops around the world. We&#8217;re going to vote in the, what we call the Cardano Improvement Proposal, CIP 1694, which is the tooling for true decentralized governance. So it&#8217;s voting and PKI&#8217;s and a lot of beautiful things that really allows the community to take over the lead on decision making. And so that&#8217;s going to be really cool. And then there&#8217;s going to be a longer discussion and hopefully a finalization of what we think about as the guardrails for Cardano. Because when you have something as big as Cardano, what you want to do is you want to keep the essence of Cardano or make it very hard to change, but still you can change it, right? And then smaller things like transaction fees or, you know, other things, block sizes that you can very easily change that as sort of when you need to, right? So then these are different in terms of the democracy there and some safeguards around that. So that&#8217;s going to be one of the last work chunks we&#8217;re going to do next year as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Incredible. Fred what an episode you were a human electric factory today and very grateful and Incredibly pumped to have you on hopefully we can do this again in the future Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Cardano Foundation online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Sure. So, cardanofoundation.org is the best place to find the Cardano Foundation. We would like to have a new, more exciting webpage and we will have that in the future. cardano.org is a very good place to go, specifically the forum. In the forum there&#8217;s a lot of different threads, also in different languages, and the community is one of the biggest, if not the biggest and best community in the whole blockchain. So if you can&#8217;t find anything, just write help somewhere and the community is super helpful. There&#8217;s also a whole set of Discord channels and then there&#8217;s our developer portal. So if you go on our developer portal through cardano.org you can see use cases, containers, tooling and other things that can help get you started. And then we have a large sort of venture funding bootstrapping system called Catalyst. And on Catalyst you have the ability to look for funding or look for business partners and other things. So that&#8217;s also a cool place. I&#8217;m not so active on socials to be honest, but you can find me on Twitter and on LinkedIn under @F_Gregaard or Frederik Gregaard on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Amazing. Frederik, thank you so much, incredible episode. And hope to have you on for round two, wishing you and the team all the best moving forward. This was incredible. Thanks again, mate.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Thank you, it was very fun and looking forward to next time.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Folks, what an episode with Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation. Easily one of the best episodes we&#8217;ve ever had.

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always, still coming in hot from Mexico. And my guest was in Mexico last week as well. I had quite the issue on the food poisoning slash Salmonella. Charlie and I had to reschedule our pod. Charlie&#8217;s also battling through the same stuff. We&#8217;ll get into that. But before then, intro time, today we have Charlie Schumacher on the show today, VP of Corporate Communications at the one and only Marathon Digital Holdings, Ticker Mara. Mara is a digital asset technology company that mines cryptocurrencies with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets. From 2018 to 2021, Charlie worked at Gateway Investor Relations, first as an analyst and worked his way up to an associate, specializing in investor relations. In 2021, he joined Marathon Digital as the Director of Corporate Communications and then was promoted to VP of Corporate Comms. And in 2022, he also holds a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Economics from the one and only Boston University. I believe you guys are called the Terriers. My apologies if you are not. Huge shout out to Boston U. I&#8217;m a big hockey fan and they have a sake hockey program. Charlie, welcome to show my friend, Pump to have you on.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, thanks for having me, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s crazy, last week folks, just for the listeners who are tuning in, whether you&#8217;re watching on YouTube or for the few of you that still have a commute to the office, I assume a big chunk of our listeners are still commuting and as many podcast listeners throwing those headphones or throw it on Bluetooth and listen. Charlie and I had a bit of a battle last week. I was supposed to record with Charlie, we were supposed to record a week ago. And I woke up on Tuesday morning, actually not even Tuesday morning. It was a battle through the night from Monday to Tuesday went to, we&#8217;re not going to shout him out. No free ads. And we&#8217;re actually boycotting now, but currently in Mexico and went to my favorite jerk chicken spot. And I got Salmonella and for those who&#8217;ve never had it, highly recommended not getting it. It was an absolute battle. And fast forward a week later, Charlie was in Mexico city for a lovely wedding, had a couple street tacos as one has to, and, him and I are in the same boat and battling some Mexico stomach shit. What a story.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, what a nice thing to bond over, right? Yeah, it&#8217;s not been super pleasant, but fortunately I think I&#8217;m on like, you know, I&#8217;m below the trough. I&#8217;m moving up in the right direction, but yeah, I landed on Thursday in Mexico and I, for me, food is half of like why I travel, maybe more, it&#8217;s food in history pretty much. And so I landed and I immediately went out to get street tacos, cause obviously street food is the best food. And that was in hindsight, that turned out to be quite an aggressive move on my part. I think if I&#8217;d been in Mexico for one or two weeks, maybe I would have adjusted, I would have been okay, but I ended up spending, you know, all day Friday in bed or, you know, trapped in my room.<br />
I was there for a wedding and, there&#8217;s a chance I was a little tardy to the wedding and to the ceremony, but I did end up making it. I was able to rally, have a good time on the dance floor with some friends and was doing better. But yeah, it&#8217;s just, as you know, Matt, it kind of like comes and goes, right? So we&#8217;re working through it, but we&#8217;ll be good.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s crazy. Charlie the honestly the biggest and again folks we are gonna get into the crypto pod of course the crypto aspect of the show. This is not a gut health related pod or a health related pond mind you. But it was just funny that Charlie and I were in the same boat for a very short period of time unless the biggest takeaway for me on top of obviously boycotting the Jamaican jerk chicken restaurant was, we wake up every single day and it&#8217;s just like oh another day Matt feels good Charlie feels good. The whole last week I&#8217;ve been so friggin happy just because I felt normal not even like feeling better than normal Just feeling normal or even a little sub par has put the biggest smile on my face I&#8217;ve been journaling about it and I&#8217;m like you know what I&#8217;m gonna start I&#8217;m gonna stop being a little ungrateful, you know what and I&#8217;m gonna be more grateful so I don&#8217;t know about you But that was that was sort of my biggest takeaway from just being absolutely in the gutter for two or three days</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Totally. I&#8217;m not quite on your level yet. I&#8217;m not fully back to a gratitude, but I&#8217;m looking forward to getting there. But that&#8217;s absolutely what happens, right? We take everything for granted. And it&#8217;s when you lose things or don&#8217;t have access to them or things get worse that you realize how good your, quote unquote, normal, boring life can be. And so just feeling good, and I certainly take it for granted. I&#8217;m sure most people do. And health at the end of the day for me is one of the most important things, but I forget that sometimes, especially when I&#8217;m out in foreign country, having fun, eating street tacos and going to weddings and being silly, but yeah, it&#8217;s a good reminder, right? Every time I come back from a trip like that, I&#8217;m super motivated to get healthy again. And sometimes that works and sometimes that doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a motivation can be short lived.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Before we get into Marathon, and I guess I do need to disclose this, I am an investor in Marathon. This isn&#8217;t the reason why Charlie is on the show. The reason is because Charlie is a great guest and Marathon is an incredible company. But I do feel like that has to be said. Anytime a guest comes on, I do always disclose to the listeners when I am an investor. I got into Marathon way back in the day in 2020 for a multitude of reasons and we will get into those. But again, just wanted to be fully transparent and candid with all the listeners and everyone tuning in. But one thing that I am very curious about and not even so much Marathon related, but just on your job title and how important it is in anyone on the investor relations and corporate comm side of things, I have been fortunate enough to work with a couple of public traded companies in Canada who do actually have Bitcoin on their balance sheet as well. And people don&#8217;t really understand the importance of a corporate comm job or an investor relations job. And furthermore, how many companies totally drop the ball? Like you are on the media show and on the road show doing absolutely everything all the time, one of the faces of the company. But there are so many public traded companies, more specifically microcap ones, where it is like the IR team is just sort of non-existent. And the corporate comms are sort of non-existent. It is sort of wild to think about. But walk me through your day to day and exactly what it is and what a corporate comms VP does on a day to day basis.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, I appreciate you kind of teeing up some reverence for what I do. It makes me sound a little less self-important, I guess, when I started speaking about it. I agree with you, though, that people, it&#8217;s like, well, it&#8217;s the same thing we were just talking about. People take it for granted. We take for granted that we all speak and we can all tell stories, some better than others. And it just depends on where your focus is, right, as an individual. But human beings are both story creating and story-consuming machines. That&#8217;s basically what we are. And so narrative is close to everything. Obviously, if you think about it from the company&#8217;s perspective, you have to execute. If you don&#8217;t execute, a story will only go so far. But you need a good combination of both narrative and numbers for something to be compelling and for it to make sense to people. There&#8217;s a rational side of us and there&#8217;s an irrational side of us. And ideally, you&#8217;re capable of speaking to both of those. So my job, it&#8217;s funny, I changed this description depending on whom I&#8217;m speaking to. Because not everyone gets Bitcoin, not everyone gets Bitcoin Mining, right? So I typically will start if it&#8217;s a new person and tell them that my job is I&#8217;m a Bitcoin propagandist. And I kind of let that sit for a second. And then they&#8217;re like, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. And I&#8217;m like, well, let me explain what I do. And then once I&#8217;m done explaining, they&#8217;re like, yeah, okay, that made sense. I get it. So I run communications and marketing for Marathon currently. What that basically means is everything that we produce, that&#8217;s a word or a video or our marketing and branding, kind of all comes through my team and through me. So we are in ways responsible for the voice of the company, Fred, our CEO is our primary spokesperson and obviously sets the tone and pace of everything that we do. And so a lot of our job is working with him collaboratively and then kind of like echoing his sentiment. So it&#8217;s really, you know, I don&#8217;t know, I view my job in some ways as a teacher, as an educator. I love Marathon. I think Bitcoin Mining is really interesting. I wouldn&#8217;t be in this industry if I didn&#8217;t. And so the job that my team and I have is basically to educate people on what we do, to teach them about Marathon and the cool story we think that is the company, as well as to teach them about the industry and why we spend all of our time doing this and suffer a crisis every single week, as everyone does in the Bitcoin space. And so that&#8217;s kind of just a&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, no, your point in regards to the narratives is so, I mean, you&#8217;re at least as from your bio former actor and live in LA. So obviously you&#8217;re big with, you know, in tune with the Hollywood scene. And it&#8217;s like, why does every movie have such a powerful narrative and multiple character arcs and a villain and a love story? It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s just classic shit that humans can relate to. That&#8217;s all it is. And moving forward to publicly traded companies. A lot of us invest in companies because we hear from person A, B or C that number is going to go up or numbers going to go down. We look at the balance sheet, we look at the chart, all the charts at the bottom of the apex, it&#8217;s probably going to go up, but it&#8217;s like, a lot of us don&#8217;t know anything about the narrative of the company, right? Like besides just the one line or what exactly they do. So again, big fan of anyone in IR, I&#8217;ve had multiple ideas of how to jump into the IR space and move in grooves more specifically in Canada. Cause where I&#8217;m from, there&#8217;s so many different publicly traded companies with Bitcoin on the balance sheet that really don&#8217;t move the needle on the IR side of things. So super cool.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
If I could jump in on that Matt, something you said I thought was kind of interesting where you tend to look at the numbers and then don&#8217;t necessarily know the story of the company. So what you&#8217;re kind of doing there though is you&#8217;re forming your own narrative based on the information you&#8217;re getting. Because what people actually do is they make decisions with their emotions and then they rationalize their choices with their intellect more often than us. Not always like a very optimistic in people&#8217;s capacity for rationality, but I also believe that for the most part we&#8217;re quite emotional and intuitive creatures. So if you think about it, like you are also creating and telling yourself a story even if you&#8217;re just looking at the numbers of something. So the job of a good communicator from a company is kind of to get ahead of that. To make sure that you understand the story from the company&#8217;s perspective and what they believe is important before you&#8217;re able to create your own narrative yourself and interject it with your own thoughts or your own biases. And obviously we have our own as well, but that&#8217;s one of the important things of communications in any company is you wanna have influence over the narrative. Because even if you&#8217;re just looking at numbers, you&#8217;re not looking at it objectively as much as you might try.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, well said. One last question on the IR stuff and that and the comm stuff then we&#8217;ll get into Marathon and everything Bitcoin and Bitcoin Mining related AI I&#8217;ve been messing around with AI a shit ton just like every other human on the planet has. How have you been utilizing AI as someone who again is a wordsmith and a not just you know on the writing side but on the audio and visual side of things like I&#8217;m sure of all fields you and your team probably have a lot more wiggle room to utilize AI in some capacities because of the nature of the job, but then in others where it&#8217;s like you guys have to obviously you know make sure that all of the publicly related regulatory bodies, you know look over all your stuff no forward-looking statements. I bet that&#8217;s an absolute nightmare for you we won&#8217;t even get into that but how have you in the team been utilizing AI to make your lives a little easier?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
A lot of experimentation and a little bit of actual implementation, I&#8217;d say. So super interested in AI. I was on board the ChatGPT train early on. I remember like where I was in December when it got launched and everyone was talking about it. All of our minds were blown and why we were made was immediately calling contacts over at OpenAI and seeing they had, so it was, we&#8217;ve all really enjoyed experimenting with it. And to the point where it&#8217;s funny actually in the IR space, I thought that I actually almost, I considered starting little side projects related to I and investor relations. I actually bought the domain name AI IR, like air.io. Yep, nice. And I might do something with it. I haven&#8217;t yet. So if anyone wants to buy it from me, please let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No free ads on the pod, no free ads.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, I&#8217;d do myself for money like that. But my thesis behind that was a lot of investor relations work and public company finance work is quite formulaic. 10Ks and 10Qs are very formulaic. Press releases tend to be formulaic. If you&#8217;re not used to writing them, it may not seem that way. But there&#8217;s definitely a formula to structuring the way a press release is done.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
All of them are like pretty plug and play-ish.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yes, exactly. And so my thought was, well, but ChatGPT seems to be great at is taking an outline and then converting it into full sentences. And so if you can feed it a really good outline, then you can skip the drafting process, basically. You still have to do some editing, and there&#8217;s still a lot of the live work up front, so you have to do most of the critical thinking. But then you can leverage AI for the muscle, which would be the drafting process. And so I kind of had this idea of, well, maybe I could go around and create really good outlines for press releases or for scripts or 10Qs or whatnot, and then feed that into ChatGPT and get a quality press release out. And maybe that&#8217;s a service that might function well in the IR world. I don&#8217;t think it actually works super well as a company. I think that&#8217;s all going to get commoditized super fast, so that already has. But I do think people who understand how to leverage the tools can get more leverage out of themselves. We haven&#8217;t used it a ton. So again, we experiment with it, but we haven&#8217;t used it a ton, actually, on Marathon stuff. The primary reason is just sensitivity with public company information. Material non public information is obviously super sensitive and important topic. And I don&#8217;t fully know in what capacity we can use something like ChatGPT with information like that. So I&#8217;m very hesitant to use it, actually, and implement it effectively for our communications. But I do like using it as a brainstorming tool. I do find it really effective for that. So if I&#8217;m trying to&#8230; So for example, when you write press releases, you often end up saying the same thing over and over. Like every press release ends with the quote of the CEO saying, something about how he gets optimistic for the future, essentially. And excited about the company. If you have to write that multiple times a month or when I was working as an investor relations associate at a consulting firm, you&#8217;re writing that every single day. It can get a little dry and you have to kind of get creative and just saying the same thing in new ways. So I do find AI super helpful for that, for bouncing ideas off of, or if we&#8217;re trying to come up with a new name for a product or something like that, it&#8217;s a nice way to do that as well. So it&#8217;s a good brainstorming tool and it&#8217;s good for exporting some of the muscle. So we like to play with it, but just given sensitivities of public company, it&#8217;s a little hard to just like full&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I totally agree. Let&#8217;s get into the bread and butter of the show here. I&#8217;m gonna go with the cop out question and just to set the tone and stage for the listeners, give us the elevator pitch on Marathon and then we&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
So Marathon Digital Holdings is one of the largest Bitcoin Minerss in the world. I believe at this point, it&#8217;s basically the largest publicly traded one in North America. We have a little over 19x a hash of capacity online. We&#8217;re targeting to be about 26x a hash around the end of this year. So for reference, that puts us, I think, about 5% of the global Bitcoin network. Pretty sizable, especially given that the company is like what it&#8217;s, we&#8217;ve been doing this really at scale for three years. So it&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s been fast. It&#8217;s been a lot of growth. We&#8217;re also a very large holder of Bitcoin. So we hold over 13,000 BTC or a balance sheet, closer to 14 maybe now. So large holder of Bitcoin, large producer of Bitcoin. And we also, we&#8217;re a little different in the way that we mine and approach the industry. So we take, we&#8217;re really focused on technology and trying to find efficiency through vertically integrated technology and mining. So we&#8217;re actually pretty hands on with everything from the pool, which is the software layer that basically interacts between the miners and the Bitcoin protocol all the way down to the hardware, like the actual ASICs. A lot of people know that we&#8217;ve invested in a company called Auradine, which makes Bitcoin Mining machines, for example. So we&#8217;re really focused on technology. And then we&#8217;re also really focused on right now, on exploring some of the interesting things that Bitcoin Mining can do other than just mine Bitcoin. So we&#8217;re really interested in kind of the positive externalities that come off the mining, like leveraging heat, for example. What can you do with that? Capturing methane and using that. How are your miners? So we kind of say a little bit of a different approach, I think, from other folks, not just in terms of how big we are, how much Bitcoin we hold, but also just the way that we approach the industry. We&#8217;re always trying to do something a little different and trying to figure out, is there something more that we can do other than just grow hash rate, basically, even though that&#8217;s obviously our primary.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Charlie, we got to take a quick break and have a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. But when we get back, we are going to continue to talk about hash price, incentive strategies, other macro trends that will affect miners, and of course, the big bad question, the halving cycle, which I believe we are about five months if I&#8217;m correct away from. Until then, we got to give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50, all one word, to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Charlie, I would love to start with the not elephant in the room per se, but just the one sort of question that I&#8217;m sure you get asked the most, more specifically as we are getting closer and closer to the halving for someone like yourself, your company&#8217;s business that is so heavily reliable on obviously hash rates and the amount of Bitcoin that you guys can produce from all the Bitcoin Mining that you guys do. Everyone must be asking about sort of the Bitcoin halving impacts of the Bitcoin halving how you guys are working around that whole line yards.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah. So the Bitcoin halving is obviously a huge deal for the industry. Mining is a very weird business for many reasons. One is technically you don&#8217;t really have a customer. So that&#8217;s the weirdest business in the world already. The other is you don&#8217;t control your revenue. And as a business, the inability to control your revenue can be a very difficult thing to plan around and try to strategize for. That&#8217;s also one of the reasons though that I think people are gravitated towards this industry is it&#8217;s a very intellectually stimulating question to try to figure out how are you going to increase profitability, drive value for shareholders, or even for some people just survive as a business when you don&#8217;t necessarily know what the price of Bitcoin is going to be. Because obviously, we know that if Bitcoin prices can go up. and the halving occurs, then your revenues get cut in half. And I remember back in, I&#8217;d say the start of 2021, when institutional investors first got started being interested in Bitcoin Mining and hearing about Bitcoin, that was one of the big questions we got was, why would I invest in an industry where every four years your revenue gets cut in half? Great question. The reality, I mean, is I think there&#8217;s an element of hope and faith that you have to have to be in this industry. You have to believe that at some point, Bitcoin is going up in price. Otherwise, yes, why would you be in an industry where revenues are cut in half every four years? Historically, we&#8217;ve seen that around, having cycles, right? So the price of Bitcoin tends to go up post-halving. It kind of peaks, what, like 18 months, I think, or so after the halving, and then you get this crash, and you go sideways for a while, and it settles at a higher low, and everyone gets disenchanted. The rational route does awesome analysis on this stuff, by the way. But I think most people didn&#8217;t understand that. So for us, it&#8217;s interesting, there&#8217;s a lot of people who love Bitcoin and are very interested in Bitcoin, and we were talking about it this morning, actually, in a meeting. There&#8217;s some people in the room who are bullish and very much believe in the halving. There&#8217;s some people who don&#8217;t. Long-term, everyone obviously believes in Bitcoin. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re in the room. But we have differences of opinion on what&#8217;s gonna happen in the short term. So to be in Bitcoin, I think you have to have some degree of hope and faith to operate effectively as a company. Hope is not a strategy, and you have to plan for downside. So what we&#8217;ve been positioning Marathon to do is to hopefully be in a good spot where we are very well protected from downside, but also in a position where we can capitalize on the upside. So let me explain that a little further. We&#8217;ve recently retired about 56% of our long-term debt, which we got a little pushback on because it&#8217;s low interest debt, and some people were confused as to why we were retiring it early. But for us, we&#8217;re looking at it. We&#8217;ve seen other people in this industry get upside down because of they were overlevered. You don&#8217;t exactly know what&#8217;s gonna happen at the halving. And we had a pretty steep discount on the debt that we could take advantage of. So we went ahead and did that, cleaned up the balance sheet. As a result, we now have more cash and Bitcoin than we do debt first time in two years. Also, typically around having, there&#8217;s potential for acquisition opportunities. Some people struggle, some people got ahead of their skis, and so they&#8217;re not able to continue operating, and that can be a good buying opportunity. And if you&#8217;re looking for acquisitions, or you want that optionality, you have to have a strong balance sheet. So a lot of that&#8217;s being opportunistic. We&#8217;re also super focused on reducing costs to mine Bitcoin. I think we reduce our costs from Q2 to Q3. And then we&#8217;ve also been exploring a lot of interesting ways that you can get really cheap, or ideally someday, potentially free power. So we have a pilot project we just announced in Utah, where we&#8217;re using the methane that comes off of a landfill, and using that to mine to power our Bitcoin Miners. It&#8217;s super cool. Yeah, we can get into that as you want. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s a really, neat project. We&#8217;re excited about. Well, let me finish on the first topic before I get too off track, then we can come back maybe to the methane thing. But that is by far our cheapest operating site. Like the energy cost is so much lower than anywhere else. So we&#8217;re very much focused on costs, because you can control costs as a company. So you want to do that as best as you can. The other thing you can do as well though is put yourself in a position to capitalize on upside. So cleaning up the balance sheet is part of that. I talked about like for interested in acquisitions, we want to have a really good balance sheet. The other part of that is growing hash rate and getting hash rate online now. Because in Bitcoin Mining, if Bitcoin starts to take off, the most profitable time is typically like in that first 6 to 12 months. When the price of Bitcoin is much higher than the global hash rate, which expands your margins. And the reason that happens is there are real world constraints in mining where it takes time to go buy machines, find a place to plug them in. If you&#8217;re going to build a facility, you have to buy transformers, containers, there can be leads. It&#8217;s a lot, right? And it can take 6 to 12 months to get miners online once you make the decision to actually purchase them. So if you have hash rate, what you want is you want hash rate on before that happens. So that you can capitalize on them as much of that upside that typically might occur in that 6  to 12 month window post halving if you believe in historical halving cycles. So that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re seeing us both do these things like really focus on reducing our costs, clean up our balance sheet as well as grow hash rate simultaneously. I think we&#8217;re supposed to be close to 23 or 26x a hash at the end of this year. We said we&#8217;re going to grow another 30% in 2024. So we&#8217;re really focused on doing both sides of that. If I had to really quickly summarize it, you don&#8217;t control price of Bitcoin, you don&#8217;t control global hash rates. So do everything you can to control the other variables. Grow your own hash rate, reduce your costs as much as possible. I think every miner knows that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. One second, Charlie, before we get into the methane project or other cool things, how does, just as a bit of a primer, how does one increase their hash rate? Because that is one of the magic variables that really does truly move the needle. How does one improve hash rate?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
The very oversimplified answer is buy Bitcoin Mining machines and plug them in. Obviously, it&#8217;s more nuanced than that. You want the latest and greatest technology always in the industry. You want the most powerful equipment and the most energy efficient equipment. So we&#8217;re always really focused on that. The other thing though is when you&#8217;re at the scale that we are, it&#8217;s not as easy as plug machine into the wall and sit back and just watch it make Bitcoin. There&#8217;s a lot more that goes into it. Air-cooled machines, for example, have to be cleaned about every 30 days because they get dusty.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Really? Holy shit. I didn&#8217;t know that.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah. It&#8217;s pretty frequent. And that&#8217;s, by the way, that&#8217;s one of the reasons that we were super excited about our immersion project that we did in the UAE, which has now been built out into&#8230; It&#8217;s going to be 250 megawatts worth of Bitcoin Mining because we ran that immersion project in the worst environment possible for Bitcoin Mining. Super hot, super humid, and it ran for over 100 days without anyone having to touch it. So that&#8217;s another thing that&#8217;s really big for us is the way you can increase hash rate. Again, this is part of our focus on technology, is you want to reduce downtime. So anytime a machine is offline, whether that&#8217;s heat, maintenance, repair, maybe curtailment, which happens in Texas a lot, that&#8217;s all lost revenue. That&#8217;s opportunity cost. So we&#8217;re really focused on trying to maximize uptime. 100% is theoretical, not necessarily possible. But we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of that in Texas. One of our facilities, the site that&#8217;s in McKamey, Texas, it&#8217;s at a big wind farm. That one historically struggled with uptime and our team&#8217;s been spending a lot of time there working on everything from just repairing machines to network connectivity, stuff that&#8217;s not super sexy, but just comes with territory of Bitcoin Mining. And we&#8217;ve really seen performance improve there. So you want to try to do what you can to increase performance, but in very simple terms, it&#8217;s also just a matter of like, you have to have the capital to buy a lot of machines, and then you have to have somewhere to plug them in.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. Very quickly, walk me through, because we do have a couple, we are getting a little tight for time, and there are definitely a couple topics that I&#8217;d love to jump into, but very quickly run me through the methane project out of Utah.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Sure. Yeah. So it&#8217;s that we&#8217;re running a small number of miners at a landfill in Utah. We&#8217;re working with a company. They&#8217;re called Nodal Power. They&#8217;re great. We really like them. We check. There&#8217;s a couple of people in the space that have figured out how to do that. We really like those guys. They&#8217;re good operators. This is a small site. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s not going to make a dent in our hash rate, but it has the potential to really change the way that Bitcoin Mining is done. So as we were talking about around the halving earlier, everything you have to lower your energy costs. That is the one big variable that you do control. Miners have this very interesting economic incentive to go find right now it&#8217;s been cheap power. In the future, it&#8217;s got to be basically free power. What you&#8217;re looking for is because if you don&#8217;t have free power in two halving cycles, unless Bitcoin&#8217;s very high, it&#8217;s going to look bad. You&#8217;ve got to plan for that now. We think like six, eight years ahead. So we&#8217;re trying to go after places that there&#8217;s potential for energy that literally no one can use. Landfills are one really interesting example of this. So landfills emit quite a lot of methane. I forget the exact percentage. It might be like 14% of all the methane in the United States is from landfills. I may have that number wrong. It was in the press release we issued, which I should know. But I&#8217;ll cite that. People can check it out. Typically, that energy is wasted, not all of it. So really big landfills, they produce enough methane that it makes sense to them to basically capture that methane and put it into a pipeline. Then that methane can be sold elsewhere and utilized elsewhere. So there are people who use the methane off of landfills for power, but there are a lot of really small landfills out there where it does not make any economic sense to capture the methane or build a pipeline to it, which is super expensive. And so typically this methane is flared, which it&#8217;s burnt, right, and turned into CO2. Or it&#8217;s fented, which means that you are literally just letting methane go into the atmosphere. And it&#8217;s been estimated that methane is 80 times worse of a greenhouse gas than CO2 is. So it&#8217;s a big environmental problem, actually. So what miners can do if this does work, it seems to be going quite well actually so far, but the question is, can this work at big scale? Is can you capture all this methane that&#8217;s currently being just vented into the atmosphere and use it converted into electricity, basically clean it, burn it. So you produce CO2 as byproducts, and then you produce electricity and use that electricity to power your Bitcoin Miners. If you do that, you&#8217;re reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and you&#8217;re leveraging energy that no one else was using that already existed. So the energy to begin with is super cheap. You&#8217;re actually benefiting the environment, which is contrary to how most people think about Bitcoin Mining today. Certainly how the media tends to portray it. And you can actually, in addition, lower your costs because there&#8217;s potential for carbon credits or things like that. So it&#8217;s super exciting for those reasons. There&#8217;s another, and I know this is a little long-winded, but it&#8217;s cool, which is I think that this can make Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate much more decentralized. So with public companies coming on board, these sites have gotten really big. You&#8217;re talking hundreds of megawatts at some of these, 300 megawatts, 500 megawatts. And so you kind of get this concentration in hash rate, which as Bitcoiners, people love. Although, to be fair, it&#8217;s not huge percentages of the network. But what I think this is going to do is it&#8217;s going to take mining off grid, and it&#8217;s going to take it to much smaller sites. So I think long-term, if stuff like this works, you&#8217;re going to end up with mining that is much more decentralized and spread out all over the world, and leveraging stuff like methane as its source of power. So I think you&#8217;re going to get more decentralized hash rate. I think it&#8217;s going to get cheaper power, and I think it&#8217;s actually going to be cleaner all at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool. I love that. Such an interesting space and we barely scratched the surface. Another not elephant in the room per se, but another very sexy and trendy topic that absolutely everyone and perhaps even their grandmas are talking about is the Bitcoin ETF. A lot of people think it&#8217;s going to make Bitcoin absolutely rip. I don&#8217;t truly believe it will. Long term, I definitely think, I mean, how could it not help? I really don&#8217;t see any argument in regards to how it could not be a net positive in the future. But in the short term, I feel like it&#8217;s already somewhat priced in. What are your two cents on that? How&#8217;s the Bitcoin ETF? Couldn&#8217;t affect the price of Bitcoin? And will it have any effect on Marathon at all as well?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
I think yes to both. I think it, I don&#8217;t disagree with you that it&#8217;s getting priced in. I think this has been a large part of the, you know, the recent kind of rally in Bitcoin&#8217;s price is people are anticipating the approval of the ETF. I think for the industry, it&#8217;s super important. Bitcoin&#8217;s biggest problem, in my opinion, is that the user experience sucks. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s so bad.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s trash ass. It&#8217;s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yes. Like buying Bitcoin, holding Bitcoin, trading Bitcoin, selling it is all like very cumbersome. And honestly, it&#8217;s high risk. Like I know that most people who got into the space early, they love the idea of sovereignty over their money and over their assets. I&#8217;m one of those. I was like, I love the political and philosophical aspects of Bitcoin. But the reality is that the majority of people do not want to run the risk of being able to vaporize their net worth by forgetting their private keys. And so like custody, right? So like, it&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s real. Like, it&#8217;s scary. And so like custody is super important or some type of vehicle that makes it easy for people to get exposure without running that risk of vaporizing a ton of their assets is really important. So I think the ETF is a vehicle like that. It doesn&#8217;t solve all the problems, obviously. But it is a very familiar way for people to get direct to get exposure to Bitcoin, maybe not direct without having to worry about custody and the potential consequences of that much freedom. So I think it&#8217;s actually really good for the industry. I think it&#8217;ll pull new people in. What is it going to do to miners? Kind of remains to be seen. What we&#8217;ve seen so far is miners haven&#8217;t exactly been trading and locks up with Bitcoin. You know, historically, miners have held much higher beta to the underlying asset. And I do think like long term, that&#8217;s true. Gold miners tend to operate this way. Gold miners have higher beta to gold. So I and I think Bitcoin Miners will are very similar to that. But I think what you might see in the short term is kind of people move out of mining stocks and move into the ETF. Because previously, one of the primary thesis of mining stocks was that they were a an easy way to get exposure to Bitcoin. Now, I think people are going to look at them as yeah, so I think they&#8217;re still an easy way because they&#8217;re publicly traded stock. But I think people will now look at them more the way they look at gold miners. So there&#8217;s, you know, you can capture the cash flow from the company, but also it&#8217;s a levered play on Bitcoin. So I think it&#8217;s just going to change like the mix of investors and what people are interested in. But overall for Bitcoin adoption, I think it&#8217;s quite helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah. Amazingly said there. And again, I said I am an investor in Marathon. I never sold one share since I got in 2020. And why did I get in in 2020? I was like, in Canada, we have a TFSA, which is like, I believe your version of the, what&#8217;s it called? Oh geez, how am I forgetting this? What&#8217;s the retirement account again called?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Oh, IRAs. 401Ks.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Exactly, where you guys can invest tax free. That&#8217;s our version of tax free investing, TFSAs and RSPs. And I was like, okay, I already bought some regular Bitcoin. How can I do this and not get taxed when I want to sell? Oh, lovely. There&#8217;s a company like Marathon who has a shit ton of Bitcoin on their balance sheet and who&#8217;s doing great things in the space. It&#8217;s an absolute no brainer. So I totally agree with you. I still think companies like yourselves who do have other verticals as well, where it&#8217;s not just Bitcoin Mining. You guys are investing in a bunch of tech and other cool stuff. I think that&#8217;ll definitely move the needle. But we are getting tight for time here, Charlie. One last question, then we&#8217;ll wrap up. Hopefully knock on wood, fingers crossed, bull market incoming. If it is, how have you guys prepped yourselves to absolutely take advantage of this and make some shit happen?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, love that. The optimistic side, right? So one is getting a lot of hash rate online, which we&#8217;ve been doing a lot this year. We went from 7x of hash to 19, supposed to be 26 by the end of the year. So that&#8217;s been like a ton of growth. And obviously you want that online so that you can make Bitcoin if and when Bitcoin goes into a bull market. So keeping continuing to grow is a huge one. The other one, I think that we&#8217;ll come back to look really positive is the fact that we&#8217;ve cleaned up our balance sheet so much. So you really want to be in good position for acquisition opportunities or to buy a bunch of machines or to buy immersion tanks, whatever it is, when other people can&#8217;t because you want to move first. And that&#8217;s actually historically what Marathon&#8217;s done. In 2020, we bought machines before anyone else could. And as a result, we&#8217;re, you know, we kind of cornered the market for that. And that&#8217;s what allowed Marathon to grow so much so fast. So that&#8217;s still in our DNA. We still keep focus on that of trying to grow as much as possible. But we&#8217;re doing so in a much more controlled and intellectual manner these days.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />

Super pumped to have this lad on the show. Lars, welcome to the show, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Thanks very much. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you on. It&#8217;s crazy that you and I first met almost two years ago, almost two years ago to this day. Crazy to think back in Dubai, 2021 blockchain expo and you and I hit it off not so much for our love for crypto and blockchain, but our love for hockey and football, more specifically hockey. I absolutely love this. I think this is a super cool place to start. You got to tell me your hockey inception story. What made you fall in love with the sport and why do you love it so much?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I have a good friend that was running a Danish Hockey team and brought it out of bankruptcy about 10 years ago. And he reached out to me and said, do you want to be part of this and see if we can take it to the next level? And I went to see a couple of matches and said, okay, let&#8217;s give it a shot. Before that, I wasn&#8217;t sort of a regular every weekend Hockey go or just watch the big matches on TV. But since then, I&#8217;ve spent a lot more time with hockey and we actually proceeded to win the Danish Championship a couple of times over the last four or five years. So it&#8217;s been quite good. This year&#8217;s a little dodgy, but we don&#8217;t know to the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. It&#8217;s crazy. A lot of Danes are playing in the NHL now. It seems like every year you guys have a couple more guys come to the NHL. I mean, the most famous Dane at least in my eyes, not league wide, but as a Toronto guy, is Frederick Anderson, you know, big goalie. He used to play for us. We used to love him. He was great for us. He&#8217;d always sort of choking the playoffs, but cest la vie. But it&#8217;s just such a good sport. It is true that there&#8217;s nothing like hockey. Like, and it&#8217;s tough because the game could grow so globally, but the barrier to entry is so bloody high, and the rules are just very difficult to understand. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Yeah, and I think I&#8217;m actually quite surprised also that we have that many players in any cell and other leagues because the sport is not big in Denmark. I would say we&#8217;ve probably got about 1500, 2000 serious players, but we actually seem to have some really great talent occasionally. And the national team, of course, has been a regular in Ruby for the last 15 years or so. We&#8217;re punching a little bit above our weight there compared to the times with this sport, but it&#8217;s very enjoyable. And I love going up to the hockey hall. It&#8217;s more like a family atmosphere than when you go to the big football.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, I love that. That&#8217;s awesome. Let&#8217;s jump into the business side of things here Lars. You co-founded Saxo Bank and that is obviously an incredible story. The barrier to entry of creating a bank is just absurdly high. And then let alone having a bank that succeeds is also just absurd. You and the team did it. Absolutely incredible. What are some of the biggest lessons that you learned, you know, perhaps some of your leadership or management styles? Like how did you and the team grow a bank from a small little thing to one of the biggest in the world? Because that&#8217;s again, you&#8217;re literally only a handful of people in the planet who&#8217;ve ever done that. What are some of the biggest lessons, key takeaways or perhaps even better stories that you have along the 30 years of growing it?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I think there&#8217;s some interesting parallels to the blockchain industry because what really gave us our opportunity was being very early adopters of the internet back in the day. While we found it as a tiny company in 1992, when we were not a bank at the time that came later, we embraced the internet that was in the very early states in the mid 90s, obviously, and brought out one of the first trading platforms in 1997, which was extremely early days for online trading. So it was really the early adoption of a new transformative technology that I think enabled us to find a good place there. That has always been the focus of the bank. We are a bank, but there&#8217;s a lot of banking things we don&#8217;t do, right? So we&#8217;re more of an investment facilitating bank and have this trading platform that we then, over the years, continue to develop. So today it&#8217;s a very broad platform where you can basically trade tens of thousands of assets. And if you have a macro approach, you can cover most of that on this platform if not everything. So the internet was the key to that. And just like back in those days when we were fascinated by a new technology, which was, at that time, by no means a given. I had many conversations with top TradFi guys that said, you&#8217;re wasting your time with this internet people. Always want to speak with a dealer on the phone and stuff. We said, maybe, but we got to give it a shot. And I experienced a little bit of the same here. You have another transformative technology, which also is fairly early station and around, which is also low skepticism. So I think some of those learnings from back in the day with the internet comes in quite handy now and gives you confidence that we will eventually get with broad adoption of blockchain because it makes a lot of sense just like the internet did.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Was there a specific moment back in 1997? And again, that&#8217;s wild. I can&#8217;t even, I mean, I was born in 1995. So obviously I don&#8217;t remember, you know, anything that early on, but 1997, that you guys must have been one of the first trading platforms in the whole world. Like how did you even develop a trading platform that early on in the internet days?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Yeah, I think for our sort of area, which at the time was mostly foreign exchange and derivatives, I think we were probably number two or three in the world realistically, right? And then, of course, it&#8217;s like everything else, like with the blockchain industry, you know, you start small in an area where, you know, the one-eyed is leading the buying, right? So, a little bit more very basic platform that we developed with a handful of engineers. And we just started it, you know, and nobody else was doing it, certainly none of the big banks. And, and to me, I mean, I&#8217;m not part of the same company anymore. I sold out my last years, about five years ago. But today there&#8217;s like a thousand engineers there. So, so we started very small, but very simple. I remember sitting designing, you know, we&#8217;re like a buy button here and we&#8217;d like a sell button there, B-scroll bill. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of competition back in those days. And actually, there wasn&#8217;t a lot of customers embracing it either the first few years, because it was just too different, you know? So as the first two or three years, we even ourselves sort of doubted it sometimes because we saw it was so obvious that it was a lot better than sitting with phones and dealers. And but, still, it took a few years to really gain traction. And I think that&#8217;s the story of new technology, no matter how value adding they are.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Oh, such a cool story. One last question on the good old days, then we&#8217;ll get into crypto and blockchain, DeFi and all the fun stuff like that. I wanna get into Lars for a second. You worked your tail off for so long, you still do, but how did you manage, and again, I would love for my feet to be in your shoes one day, how did you manage to pursue so many passions and fun projects on the side, sports teams, charities, you name it, while grinding so hard at the bank? Like it just seems like that&#8217;s an impossible feet. I&#8217;m doing one 100 of what you&#8217;re doing, and I&#8217;m having trouble with the work-life balance and grinding and making everything work. How the heck did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Well, I guess, I just, I&#8217;m sort of quite emotional. And if I find something I like. I like to get involved in it. Obviously, the success of Saxo Bank and the subsequent sales have also given me some financial possibilities that I didn&#8217;t have back in the early days. But sometimes I also actually believe I bite off more than I can chew, to be honest, because some of my projects probably deserve a little bit more time and love than I have available for them. But particularly in later years, I&#8217;ve very much taken the focus at, you know, you&#8217;ve got to do stuff that you really enjoy, that you really love being part of. And not necessarily the monetary return for all of this. It&#8217;s nice to have a few things here and there that work out well financially, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be all about financial return. And so I got two wonderful restaurants. They&#8217;re not going to be the next Saxo Banks, but it&#8217;s a great joy. I got the Ice Hockey Club, I got the Football Club and a whole range of other activities. And also just keeping engaged in stuff that I really enjoy being part of, you know. And it&#8217;s a combination of like hardcore business things and stuff that are a little bit more less orientated where you make a lot of people happy because you give them experiences, etc. And then there&#8217;s a sort of third category of things that I would like to understand better. So I might make an investment just to force myself to understand it better, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Some skin in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Yeah, exactly. Because if you have a stake in a business, you&#8217;re kind of naturally inclined to keep at least an eye on it. And that would spread to like lab based meats and stuff that I think will be very important in the future, but where I find it interesting to have a reason to follow it. You know, and I have a number of examples in that category as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s incredible. Lars, you gotta give me some gold mines here. Walk me through some morning rituals, nighttime rituals, daily routines? Like, how do you stay locked in, dialed in for such a long period of time and be so bloody efficient?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m that efficient, but I&#8217;m not sort of a big&#8230; I don&#8217;t dream about going and be a pensioner, or sit on a beach or anything like that. I do like to have fun, you know? But I actually, you know, one of the things that people talk a lot about is this life-work balance word, which I hate because it&#8217;s kind of implying that life is one thing and work is another, right? And for me, work is a very significant part of life because I think that&#8217;s where you live out your own, you know, your own potential and your own ambitions. So for me, that&#8217;s a very important part. So I don&#8217;t have that distinguishment between some of the time I don&#8217;t have to work. Of course, I do stuff that&#8217;s not directly work-related, but most of my day is involved in some kind of work activity. I&#8217;m quite, in a way, quite happy to not be with the bank anymore because now I can put it exactly when I want. A lot of it is like here over Zoom or Teams or whatever. And you can basically be anywhere in the world. You can schedule your time as you please. You probably get to do a lot of hours, but you do them on your own sort of schedule, right? And then I can only recommend drinking a fair bit of good red wine. That&#8217;s good for keeping your energy levels on.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Hey, we&#8217;re down in Mexico. I&#8217;m currently down in Mexico now too. The one thing that&#8217;s lovely down here is the tequila. I mean some nice sipping tequila every once in a while. That&#8217;s lovely. It&#8217;s hard to get a good bottle of red down here. My friends and I have found, but the tequila is plentiful. The mezcal is plentiful and it&#8217;s nice. It&#8217;s not like back home where tequila, you know, runs in arm and a leg here. It&#8217;s a pennies on the dollar and you get some really quality stuff. So I feel it.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
You&#8217;re not going to run out to Tequila, Mexico City. That&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, 100%. It&#8217;s nice at night sometimes when you put in a good shift at work and you want to get the creative juices flowing, put a couple of words on paper, now put a couple of words on the computer, but you get what I mean here. Let&#8217;s jump into crypto and the fun stuff for a second. One of the big underlying narratives at Concordium and yourself is that DeFi is paving the way for a more inclusive financial future. 10 minutes ago in the pod, you just discussed the parallels you saw back in 1997 with the internet revolutionizing the finance industry and just all industries in the whole. On present day in the 2020s, we have blockchain, which hopefully and most likely will do the same thing. There are 1.4 billion people that are currently unbanked, which is absolutely bananas. What is there 8 billion people in the world, right? That&#8217;s just a crazy amount of people that are unbanked. DeFi has the ability to give everyone a bank. I&#8217;d love if you could, before we get into some more nitty gritty stuff and some more Concordium related stuff, just give me your thoughts on what exactly is the future of DeFi and how it will empower so many people and bank the unbanked.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I think technology in general has a democratizing effect. And again, if we take the parallel from back in the day, I was a foreign exchange dealer prior to Saxo Bank, where literally you have to deal with people on the phone. You could have two, let&#8217;s say four phones, if you were four phones in your hands sufficiently, and you could sort of speak to four people at the same time. When we did our platform in Saxo Bank we could do for tens, for hundreds, for thousands, for tens of thousands of people simultaneously, right? Which also meant that we could bring down the barriers to be part of the financial industry, right? So it has a strongly democratizing effect. And I think it&#8217;s the same here, the traditional way of doing things is somewhat exclusive. It&#8217;s not necessarily because of bad will from the banks, but it&#8217;s simply that the systems are so costly and so complicated that it&#8217;s very hard for them to justify bringing on very small clients. It&#8217;s simply gonna be losing business. And it&#8217;s a total order to demand from a bank that it should lose tons of money on doing essentially the right thing, right? So it has a lot to do with the old technology and not being very suitable for banking smaller clients, basically, as opposed to a heavy regulatory aspect, which doesn&#8217;t make it easier. So some of the regulatory hurdles that you can, albeit on or as you can fulfill in Western Europe or the States or this part of the world, very hard to meet in some of the emerging markets where some people don&#8217;t even have an ID or unable to verify the necessary information for KYC purposes, et cetera. So we shouldn&#8217;t think that this is sort of conspiracy to keep people out of the market, but I don&#8217;t think it is. I think genuinely banks like to have customers, but the combination of old school technology, that&#8217;s very clunky and high requirements for ID KYC makes it very difficult for the traditional sector to bank this 1.4 billion people now. Blockchain and the internet, to some extent, of course, are solving one side of that issue, which is we now have a technology that actually makes it fairly easy to get people involved in the financial system that hasn&#8217;t solved the regulatory aspect. And I think that&#8217;s the next concern here. How do we find a way to comfortably integrate all these unbanked people into the financial system to a degree that&#8217;s acceptable to regulators? Because if you can&#8217;t do that in a way that is acceptable to regulators, well, then you&#8217;re gonna have to be on the borderline all the time and perhaps across the borderline of legality. And that&#8217;s, of course, what we&#8217;re already seeing, that some of these things while being very efficient, blockchain, DeFi, et cetera, are efficient and engaging people, but definitely borderline from a legal point of view and sometimes worse than that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very true. How do you even go about the whole regulatory aspect though? Because again, you nailed it on the head. We have the infrastructure and we have the tech, i.e. DeFi, crypto, blockchain. In order for the unbanked people, using an example of the many people in Africa who don&#8217;t have access to this technology, they can do this. There is an opportunity for them to get internet, but then just like you said, there&#8217;s the regulatory shit show. No banks want to come in and build their own infrastructure because it&#8217;s not profitable. At the end of our profit business, they&#8217;re not a non for profit, they&#8217;re not a charity. How do we get all the countries involved to at least talk to each other, to at least take down some of these walls, take down some of these barriers for the regulatory shit show to finally end?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I think there&#8217;s a general consensus among most people in the world that we want to not make it too easy to be a criminal. We don&#8217;t want terror financing. We don&#8217;t want money laundering, et cetera. And that&#8217;s why you have these requirements for our ID and for know your customer rules, et cetera. So I think the idea is fundamental, but I think part of this technology as we&#8217;ve already seen now, as in yesterday, that you now say we&#8217;re going to have an ID for all citizens in the EU, there&#8217;s a number of also technology enabled ID solutions in a lot of emerging markets coming up. And I think that&#8217;s another thing that this makes easier than it would be to go around and issue physical passports and stuff like that. I&#8217;m heading down to Nigeria day after tomorrow, where I believe around 80 million people don&#8217;t have an ID. But then now you, you finally enough, most of them have a smartphone, right? So then now you&#8217;re linking the ownership of a smartphone subscription to the new national ID. And these things are essential because very hard for anyone to say I am willing to enter into a financial transaction, having no idea who you are, no idea what the money comes from, et cetera. That&#8217;s just not doable under generally agreed regulations or standards. So using also this technology to at least get people an ID, which is not just about financial services. Imagine that you have really have no identity. You are just that person living 30 meters from the church kind of thing, right? It&#8217;s a big problem, even apart from from being part of the financial system, that a lot of people in this world simply don&#8217;t have an ID. They don&#8217;t have an identity and you need that in many other contexts. So I think that&#8217;s one problem you need to solve. Then I hope to see regulators also making it a little easier. I mean, if amounts involved are not significant and are unlikely to be part of a criminal scheme or a terrifying thing, I think you can put some kind of minimum limit where you say, but below this level, we can be a little light on KYC, as long as we know the ID. That&#8217;s my hope because otherwise, you are not going to get this 1.4 billion people legally banked at least you can of course do illegal things and illegal transfers and that, but that&#8217;s not a very healthy business model and it&#8217;s not going to interest very many serious people, right? So there is a balance between getting more ID out there. Well, it&#8217;s a lot of initiatives around the emerging markets around regulators maybe losing a little bit on, let&#8217;s say the lower end of the income spectrum and then of course, use some of this new technology. So I&#8217;m optimistic, but it&#8217;s really important because this is sometimes the narrative in our industry that old banks are really the arctic people, they don&#8217;t want to support these unbanked people, but it is really very hard for them to do that on the old technology and the regulatory regulations that they are on the, you know, so, so we need to, we solve kind of a lot of the technology now, I think we need to now solve the ID and then we need to take a somewhat softer approach at least for smaller clients, right? Where it&#8217;s very unlikely that&#8217;s the criminals involved or something really bad. But at the same time, I think we all have an interest in that there are some safeguards against criminal activity and terror financing and so on. That&#8217;s an everybody&#8217;s interest, I believe unless you are a terrorist or criminal, but I don&#8217;t think we can let that decide our actions, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
You&#8217;re on fire right now, mate. We do have to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor to the show. And when we get back, we are going to jump right into Concordium and talk about how Lars and the team are doing exactly what he just spoke about. And that is giving the opportunity for millions of unidentifiable humans to get their own ID, which I absolutely love. And again, crazy to think that some people don&#8217;t even have IDs. Like imagine again, being a 28 year old dude who doesn&#8217;t even know, you know, your parents were you from absolutely wild. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50, to receive 50% of your deposit, credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Lars. Lars, let&#8217;s jump right into Concordium. I feel like most of the listeners already know what you and the team do. One of the most interesting aspects of the biz is exactly what we just discussed, and that is giving IDs to people who don&#8217;t have them. And that is using a combination of ZK Tech and a bunch of other really fun, interesting, and novel pieces of tech. I&#8217;d love if you could give a quick sort of TLDR 360 overview on what exactly you and the team are building and how you are going to hopefully give IDs to all the people who don&#8217;t currently have.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Well, I mean, the sort of fundamental idea of Concordium is to try to build this bridge between decentralization, which I&#8217;m a big believer in and see a lot of benefit from, not least because I&#8217;ve seen centralized the TradFi from the inside. And I know the huge amount of pain points and problems are that great. So decentralization is great, but we also have to be realistic around the requirements of society around you, the regulators, the lawmakers, general society has a lot of things they wanna impose on an industry. Now, that&#8217;s not very popular with the sort of the originals of this industry, but it&#8217;s just the fact that you can choose to live up to it or not, or to accept it and try to find solutions. So our vision with Concordium was to marry the decentralized, all the stuff that we all know is great about blockchain, but at the same time have some respect for the rules and society around us. And you can have all sorts of ideological ideas about that. You can be an anarchist, you can think you want a different world, but the fact is if you wanna see mainstream adoption for this industry, it is going to be, to a large extent, on the terms and conditions of the world as is. Now then we can go do things a lot smarter, a lot better, a lot more efficiently, a lot more secure, but at the end of the day, we have to expect to follow the same rules as everybody else. So that&#8217;s the key thing. Now, in terms of the bottom line of all sort of trustworthy interaction is really that you know who you&#8217;re dealing with. That&#8217;s kind of the baseline because knowing your client and the general KYC and checking people&#8217;s credentials and their understanding of what you might be proposing to them, et cetera, is one thing, but it&#8217;s all pretty relevant if you don&#8217;t know with certainty that you are Matt and I&#8217;m Lars, and then all KYC becomes pretty academic if we can&#8217;t be sure about that point. So that&#8217;s the core thing that we have built in at a foundational layer. I mean, most blockchains and outcoming rounds realizing it&#8217;s an absolute metathesis. So there&#8217;s a lot of Layer2 ID solutions being built and that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s a necessary direction for the space, but we chose to build it in at a time when it was less obvious to build it in at the Layer1, which then has the advantages that can go across all the use cases instead of being kind of the silos that we know from the old system, right? Now, just to correct you a bit, we can&#8217;t actually create an ID for an unidentified Nigerian. We can take his basic ID and lift it into an environment where you can get a lot of benefits from it, but we&#8217;re not issuing IDs to people that don&#8217;t have ID, right? We need to base ourselves off a credible ID, at least at this point, maybe it could be different in the future, but for us, it&#8217;s a question of taking that basic ID which you probably can&#8217;t do very much, to be honest, except that you at least have an identity and can use that in various ID and KYC processes. We take that ID and put it into an efficient environment where you can then use it across a whole range of different activities and projects and use cases, right? So just to clarify that, but we are dependent on the user having been IDed by a trustworthy ID issuer in the first place, right? But the whole thing here is that right now, this world is only going one way. In the old days, it used to be the financial sector where there was a lot of focus on ID and KYC, but today, you&#8217;re going to a gallery and you want to buy a painting, you have to go through KYC, you want to interact with a social media platform and you can see all the problems when people actually not appropriately IDed where people can do fake profiles, do all sorts of calls, all sorts of maim around it. So ID, at its basic form, I think, is increasingly very necessary across almost all walks of life now. But the important thing there is that having ID and being willing to ID yourself is not equal to not having privacy. There&#8217;s big difference between anonymity and privacy, so knowing that that person has been willing to, or an organization has been willing to ID itself, actually allows you to offer, extend more privacy to that individual than they used to in the current old system, right? As a simple example, if you send your kid down to the liquor store to pick up a bottle of wine, then if there&#8217;s any doubt whether that person&#8217;s over 18 or 21 and other jurisdictions, well, then they will ask for ID, which means you pass over a social security card or your passport and all of a sudden give a lot of information to an unknown person that&#8217;s just in the liquor store and could be abused from that point of view, right? Where with modern self-serving ID, you can control the watch characteristics of your ID that you need in any given circumstance. Now, in that particular case, the only thing that person needs to know is you&#8217;re over 18. Doesn&#8217;t need to know how old, yeah, actually he doesn&#8217;t need to know how old you are, as long as you&#8217;re over 18, doesn&#8217;t need to know where you live, doesn&#8217;t need to know your security number, doesn&#8217;t need to know your name, et cetera, but in the current system where ID is kind of the access, you say all or nothing type thing, right? It creates a lot of additional respect just when you actually ID yourself. So I think the beauty of a certain eyes-based ID on blockchain is that you get much more control over your ID and in that sense gain much more privacy than you have in the current system. So I think that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll see much more of and with current developments in AI and deep fake and avatars and all that, already now you can&#8217;t actually be sure that you&#8217;re talking to me. This could be an avatar, in fact, I have one. And I think it could be my avatar you spoke to, except they&#8217;ll probably be more intelligent because I would have put more stuff into the brain of it than I have, right? So in those scenarios, which are gonna be more and more common, it would be nice to know with certainty, true in ID, that I am in fact lost and not an avatar, right? And I think this is only gonna get more and more up to you with other technology developments at the moment. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, I do agree. We have to be getting close in regards to sort of the mass adoption of self-sovereign IDs well, especially with technology like ZK Tech, which is making it a lot easier and just more efficient to do exactly what you said and create this sort of binary identification system where someone can walk into a liquor store, grab a nice bottle of vino and it&#8217;s not a matter of, Lars, I need to see where you live, where you&#8217;re born, what color your eyes are, how tall you are. It&#8217;s not simply is he or she 18 or not. So I can&#8217;t wait for that as well. A couple more things on Concordium here, Lars, and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. And this has been an absolute treat. Having too much fun over here on my end. What else are you and the team working on? I know you guys have tons of plans. I know that on the video that was actually released this morning and doing a bit of show prep. There&#8217;s a bunch of noise on social media about something, maybe a little Christmas present from Lars and the Concordium team coming out. No one knows what it is. Will we see that Christmas present? That&#8217;s question numero uno. And numero dose is what&#8217;s on the agenda for 2024? What are you and the team planning on shipping and achieving?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I think, I don&#8217;t know, I hope we give Christmas presents every now and again throughout the year, right? So it sounds like I have planned something massive for the 24th, the 25th of December, but that will be good news, an interesting news coming on as we go along, including a couple of partnerships that we will announce before Christmas. So I think that should keep people happy enough. What we&#8217;re doing at the moment is we&#8217;re strengthening our look at verticals that we really want to support. That doesn&#8217;t mean anybody&#8217;s welcome. This is a use case agnostic, blockchain. So anybody is more than welcome, but of course we see areas where we have more traction than others and hence we want to make sure that we have the necessary infrastructure support that as well as possible. So an increased focus on certain verticals without saying to anybody that they&#8217;re not welcome, but just trying to support in particular areas like ESG, where we see a lot of interest at the moment, carbon credits type things, DeFi, which we think has wonderful potential, but also needs those aspects of ID KYC that we talked about, right? We&#8217;re looking at stuff in the automotive industry and trying to sort of focus our own proactive efforts in certain areas while still being there for anyone really that wants to build something on Concordium, because we are decentralized systems. It&#8217;s not for us to say you can build or you cannot build. So anybody can build, but we can choose where we try to supply a bit more as a sort of technology and stuff that makes it easier for those particular areas to engage with us. So I think 2024, I think the thing that this blockchain, I think lacks a little bit. I think we build a really good blockchain. I think the vision behind it is good. I think we are cutting edge around scalability, around finality, around the balance between accountability and privacy. We have stable fees and stuff like that. So we have built a really good blockchain that works very well. And I think really we need to tell more people about it. And that&#8217;s also why I appreciate having the opportunity here. We need to get more visibility for how great this blockchain really is. And that&#8217;s a strong focus area for 2024 to really, through proactive, reach out to companies that we think could be relevant, but could see Concordium as relevant to their needs. So a more proactive lead generation and stronger engagement from outside. But of course, also general visibility that people find it easier to get in touch with us to build on us, to be aware of our existence. So a lot of focus we&#8217;re going to that increased awareness and visibility because at the end of the day, we got a great blockchain here. It takes the boxes that any sort of serious use case would be interested in, I think. And we just need to tell more people about it. So that&#8217;s a very strong focus area for 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Yeah, it&#8217;s, I mean, heck, nowadays, you know, to quote Gary Vee, we live in the attention economy and it&#8217;s all about getting eyeballs on your product. And I mean, it&#8217;s sort of a key theme of the show is things that are binary and you either pay for it or create it. And that&#8217;s just how it works. But Lars, super pumped to have you on my friend. Great to speak with you again after two years. Incredible episode. And hopefully you and I can do round three together soon.  Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find Concordium and yourself personally, online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Yeah, the easiest access point I would say for broad access is concordium.com, the website where you can then see all of our many social media channels. We obviously got a Telegram group, which is quite active also, but if you want a full overview, I think concordium.com is a good place to start. Also there you will find that newly released AI-based chat box that actually amounts to very well questions in many different languages around sort of core information around Concordium. So that&#8217;s a good place to start. If you want to reach out to me, you can do it through the website or you can find me on other number of social media, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, you know, have your pick, but probably most of my sort of most business and related stuff is on LinkedIn where I should be fairly easy to find on. And you can actually see one of the things we did for combating fake profiles. If you go to my profile, you see what we call our mysome.id, where you can verify on Concordium that you are on fact on my profile and that somebody else&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And not a Lars doppelganger, a Lars fake. I love that. Lars, thanks again. Incredible episode, knowledge bombs everywhere. We&#8217;d love to see it. Can&#8217;t wait for round three and wishing you and the team all the best.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Thank you very much for having me, Matt. And then speak soon again.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Thank you. Folks what an episode with the one and only Lars Seier Christensen. He was dropping knowledge bombs left right and center. Anything on DeFi bringing the gap between DeFi and TradFi, IDs you name it, we covered it. Huge shout out to Lars and the team for making this happen listeners, love you guys as always. Thank you so much for listening. My team appreciate you guys. Justas my amazing sound editor. You are the man and you know it and back to the listeners love you guys keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing, as always, still coming in hot for Mexico. And I am super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, Tara Fung, the Co-Founder and CEO of Co:Create. She is a growth-oriented leader who enables innovative brands to unlock the power of their community through gamified, self-owned reward programs. And we need a lot of this in Web3. She has a background in a multitude of things and was the Chief Revenue Officer of Alto, a leading crypto IRA and digital asset IRA custodian, where she forged partnerships with institutional crypto asset managers driving a staggering 25x revenue growth in just 18 months. Tons of other stuff on the bio. We&#8217;ll get into that later. Super pumped to have you on. Welcome to the show.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Thanks so much for having me. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you on before we get into Co:Create and the super fun stuff. We gotta get into you. But one of the things that I&#8217;m most excited to jump into as a big ball fan is the incredible work that you guys did with BR. And that&#8217;s what I assume everyone, I believe that&#8217;s the bread and butter, if not the most famous thing you&#8217;ve done. I can&#8217;t wait to get into the new tattoo partnership as well. That&#8217;s super cool. I&#8217;m actually a tattoo virgin. And I feel like, you know, especially as a sort of younger millennial, I&#8217;m 28 born in 95. I&#8217;m like one of the only people my age who don&#8217;t have tats, which is sort of wild too.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
I bet that&#8217;s true actually. And the funny thing is that women are more likely to have tattoos than men.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100% just like you know, I feel like the men get dumber and stupider tats than women do I feel like women usually put a little more thought into it. Whereas men just put stupid shit all over their body But we&#8217;ll get into that later but before we get into a lot of the Web3 and community related and loyalty related stuff tell the listeners and myself a little bit about your past. You know childhood where you grew up how you got into Web3 the whole nine yards</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so, Tara Fung, I&#8217;m from a small little town in rural North Carolina called China Grove. And people always ask me, is that the China Grove and the Doobie Brothers songs? Which it is not, it has zero claim to fame. There was like 4,000 people there, but I loved it. It was a great childhood. Grew up on what was somewhat of a farm with goat, this, that, and the other. And I just always wanted to figure out how the world works. And so I traveled a lot, I studied languages, I worked abroad, in undergrad I studied economics because I thought that would teach me how to approach problems. It would teach me a mindset and a skill set that I could apply to all different industries. So you&#8217;re probably already picking up, I&#8217;m a total nerd. And after a few years in the workforce where I was working for parent company in Mercedes Benz actually, I went back and got a graduate degree because I wanted to get into tech and I wanted to start building things. I just realized big companies weren&#8217;t the fit for me. I wanted to be doing small, scrappy, trying to change the future type stuff. And initially that got me into fintech and fintech got me into crypto and crypto got me into Web3. And then two years ago, I set out starting what is Co:Create and had been at it ever since through a bunch of different environments and ups and downs. And it&#8217;s been a wild and really enjoyable ride.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What was your first sort of taste into the Web3 world? Like was there a, did you get orange pill back in the day? Like what was your sort of welcome to the crypto world? Did you have that friend who bought drugs with Bitcoin or whatever the case may be? Like what was it sort of that catalyst?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Oh my gosh. So much tamer like y&#8217;all are going to realize how uncool I am. I think I&#8217;ll go through this Podcast. But so my first taste or exposure was actually, in grad school. So I went to Harvard for my MBA and we had this course that I took called managing the financial firm, which is as boring as it sounds. And one of the financial firms that we studied were crypto companies. So we actually studied Coinbase and this was in 2015. And so we were studying Coinbase and other crypto companies as like, this is a new type of financial company. And I remember at that time I was like, I don&#8217;t get it. And I also just don&#8217;t have time to get it. Like this is just not interesting enough for me. And so I am in no way is a crypto OG, right? I can&#8217;t say like I bought my first Bitcoin in 2012 or this, that and the other. And so I put it off on a shelf. I was like, this is not the time for me to explore this. It just doesn&#8217;t feel relevant yet. When I went to become the CRO of Alto IRA, we, that company enables individuals to utilize retirement funds, which has a lot of tax advantages to invest in alternative assets, whether that&#8217;s venture capital, private equity, private real estate and crypto. And it was then that I realized, okay, I can&#8217;t put this off anymore because I&#8217;m not going to talk to people about using retirement dollars to invest into crypto unless I understand it. And I don&#8217;t invest in things I don&#8217;t understand. So it&#8217;s time for me to go deep. I remember it took me probably took me two or three months of one of my colleagues talking to me about what a self custodial wallet was. And I was so, I could not grok this concept. Like I really could not get it at all. I was like, why do you need a wallet? I don&#8217;t understand. We were a custodian. I&#8217;m like, they&#8217;re custodians for this type of stuff. And then the first time, and so I really started in crypto approaching it from an investor lens, right? Like what are the role of these assets within a diversified portfolio, particularly like your more stable assets or more accepted assets like BTC and ETHs and at the time, Sol and some others. And when I first logged in, when I finally got the wallet piece, and I first logged into a Web3 powered site with my wallet, I was like, holy smokes. This is a game changer. I&#8217;m taking my identity with me. My identity is not stored in this app. Rather it is mine and my assets are coming with me and that was, then it was over.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And that was it. I love that. What was the first wallet?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
MetaMask.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s crazy though. Like I hear these stories all the time. I remember the first time I got MetaMask and it&#8217;s so scary. Right? Cause like, you know, I fortunately had a couple of mentors and close friends who sort of walked me through the process, but like sending that first transaction when someone gives you, when someone gives you sort of the, you know, the prefix of this could literally go to the abyss. If you mess up one of these 20 something letters and numbers, you&#8217;re just like, holy shit. This is sort of spooky.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
You know, it is scary and I think that&#8217;s just an indication of the fact that this market is immature because the way that it works now is not the way that it can work or should work going forward. Like you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about if I lose this crazy long password or someone steals it, my financial future is in jeopardy, right? Like that is not the way that things should work and that&#8217;s definitely going to change.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And that&#8217;s one of the things that you guys are doing incredibly is building, you know, Web3 tech that looks and feels like Web2, like it&#8217;s got to be clean. It&#8217;s got to be sexy. It&#8217;s got to be frictionless, seamless. And we&#8217;ll get into that soon. I guess the bread and butter, the show is obviously you Co:Create and Web3 loyalty. Let&#8217;s jump right into Web3 loyalty. This is something incredibly powerful. We&#8217;ve seen a lot of brands. We&#8217;ve seen Starbucks. We&#8217;ve seen Nike, some of the biggest fortune 500 brands jump into this to try to really, you know, to try to make the terrain and leave the station. And very few people have truly done it yet. But like you said, being able to bring your identity with you and actually having something that&#8217;s black and white and not gray is truly powerful. In your eyes, how does Web3 loyalty? How is it really an upgrade on the traditional loyalty programs? Just as a whole, give us sort of the 360 degree elevator pitch on why Web3 loyalty is so much more powerful and has such a higher ceiling than classic Web2 loyalty programs.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, I like to say that the term a loyalty program is the most euphemistic term possible for what these programs actually are. They are not loyalty programs, they&#8217;re captivity programs. You earn things that you never own and if you decide you want to leave, you have to leave everything behind. And so that&#8217;s not loyalty. Loyalty is something that is given and something that is earned on both sides where there are mutual commitments made to one another. And Chris Dixon has this quote around, blockchains are computers that can make commitments. And I think the existing loyalty programs we have today, the commitments are one sided where the brand is unilaterally determined what is being earned that it has never owned and they can change the rules at any time and if they do, you&#8217;re stuck with it. And we saw this with Delta. One pushback that we would get and still do is well, clearly this benefits the brands disproportionately because they&#8217;re the ones in control and what they have no incentive to change. And I think some of the largest brands, you&#8217;re right, they have no incentive to change and to give more power control, voice saying ownership over to their community, over to the members of their loyalty programs. But there are a lot of brands who aren&#8217;t Delta. There are a lot of brands who are looking to stand out, who are trying to figure out how do I acquire and engage customers because I&#8217;m not so big that I can just set my own rules and say basically deal with it. And for those brands, the true power of Web3 is that it opens up a better way for you to engage and to gamify interactions with an audience to make them want to give you their time, their attention, their share of wallet, as well as it allows you to enter into these flexible coalition loyalty programs where your assets can be used at other brands and vice versa so that you can now market to like-minded communities. And you can open up not just retention, but acquisition because loyalty programs, they are typically managed by the quote and quote CRM or retention team at a brand. They are seen as a way to increase someone&#8217;s spending, someone&#8217;s LTV lifetime value with a brand. They are not seen as a way to acquire and grow a brand&#8217;s customer base. But in this world that we&#8217;re living now where try to get in front of a 14 year old girl, right? Like try to find a way and add that we&#8217;ll get in front of a 14 year old girl. Like she&#8217;s in Roblox, she&#8217;s in Fortnite, she&#8217;s in like, how are you gonna do this? And the way that you&#8217;re gonna do it going forward is because people, you&#8217;re going to have these communities that are super fans of brands and they&#8217;re going to be incentivized and encouraged and rewarded for telling others about it. And we&#8217;ll be able to track and reward those activities all on chain. And so I think the summary is Web3 Loyalty provides brands a better toolkit to grow, reward, engage an audience and it provides consumers the ability to own their loyalty, which actually then engenders loyalty, not captivity.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That was absolute gold. We gotta take a step back and excuse my ignorance here. What happened with Delta? I&#8217;m Canadian in Canada. It&#8217;s like all about aeroplanes. We have like two airlines. We fly Air Canada or WestJet. Really only the two in Canada. You gotta give me the deets. What happened with Delta?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
So, and this hurts me because I am a Delta Gold Medallion member, but basically what Delta did was they came out about a month and a half ago and they said, the way that miles and status have been earned is changing and deal with it. And what those changes were, you no longer actually get miles based on how much you fly, it&#8217;s based on how much you spend, which the question then becomes like, are you an airline or are you a financial institution? And they doubled the requirements to achieve status. So Silver Medallion, Gold Medallion, the status that actually starts to unlock the real aspirational benefits, they doubled it. And the thing is, it&#8217;s like, OK, well, I could just say I want to leave. You know, it&#8217;s the brand should be able to change things. They have to be able to evolve, but consumers should also be able to leave. And there is no concept of rage quitting within loyalty programs. These miles I have, I can&#8217;t even send them to my husband without paying a cent per mile. If I wanted to send 30,000 miles, I would have to pay $300. I might as well buy him a ticket, right? The Medallion status, it&#8217;s not mine. I can&#8217;t get out. I spent this entire year working for it because you work for it for one year. And then you get it really the next year. And the only way I can really realize those benefits is if I continue to fly Delta. So it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s a rigged game. And I think everyone has really seen that and they&#8217;ve just struggled with why is the power dynamics so disproportionate? Because a lot of people said, no, Delta, I&#8217;ve chosen to fly with you consistently, even when it involved layover. And for this. And now you went and changed everything without consulting us at all.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I&#8217;m the exact same with Air Canada. Fair Canada ever changes. I mean, riots. I&#8217;m gonna be the leader of the Air Canada Riot crew. Before we get into Co:Create, are there any Web3 brands or any loyalty programs that you are truly in love with or that you idolize or at least want to steal from? Like, who&#8217;s doing it right right now?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
So one of the brands that I think is so forward-thinking and is really changing what loyalty can mean, it&#8217;s a brand that was born into Web3 called KIKI World. And the reason I say born into Web3 is if you go to their website, you actually have no idea that there&#8217;s Web3 under the hood. Candidly, they are one of our clients. So all of the on-chain things that they&#8217;re doing are powered by API&#8217;s. So I love them for that reason too. But the way that they work is every single product they create is voted on by the community. So they&#8217;re a beauty, it&#8217;s really powerful because they&#8217;re a beauty brand, right? There are so many beauty brands. It&#8217;s actually really hard to distinguish yourself in that market. You&#8217;re going and you&#8217;re up against every other brand who&#8217;s buying the same ads and ad words on these various platforms. They will come out and say, we&#8217;re gonna make this amazing. Nail polish, here are the 10 shades, vote on your shade. They&#8217;ll show the leaderboards. You get points for voting. You then get minted a collectible, an NFT based on the color you vote for. And when that color, whichever color wins, that color is created. And then if you have the right collectible, you voted for the color that won, you actually, that NFT can be used to get a $5 discount in purchasing the product. So it&#8217;s like Co:Created, it&#8217;s gamified, it&#8217;s rewarding, it&#8217;s all underneath the hood, no Web3 wallet or knowledge required in order to participate. So I really love them as an example.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s huge. Another talk we have to get into, you&#8217;re absolutely on fire by the way, there&#8217;s so many different areas we can take this. The power of APIs, it&#8217;s like one of the most important and I guess another recurring theme of the pod is powerful because again, loyalty programs are powerful but APIs have literally become one of the most powerful pieces of software in tech present day. Like we&#8217;ve even seen it with the new sort of open AI API that came out and how many people are now creating their own GPTs. It&#8217;s just APIs are powering all of the web. It&#8217;s just web hook city, population APIs, they&#8217;re tearing it up, they&#8217;re doing incredible things. And it allows companies like you guys to create incredible pieces of tech and then so seamlessly allow all of your clients and partners and community to just like, hey, we built something that&#8217;s pretty frigging sick and you can snag it for a very fair price and you don&#8217;t have to do any of the heavy lifting we did it. It&#8217;s absolutely incredible. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about just the importance of APIs and how it&#8217;s such an integral part of your business and really everyone else&#8217;s business present day and moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, no, it&#8217;s a really great question. When we were starting, the thing that we believe to be true is that the best brands in the world, they want to own the experience layer. They want to be able to create these stories and tell them better than anyone else. And so the front end, if you will, everything that a consumer sees and engages with, they want to be able to make that theirs truly. And so we were considering, do we offer a white label solution where you basically just skin the same thing over and over again with slightly different colors and fonts, or do we want to build an API first product that is truly embeddable, that is behind the scenes that&#8217;s invisible to the consumer? We&#8217;re like, if we&#8217;re going after the best brands in the world, we have to build an API first product. One, it&#8217;s way more scalable, it allows for much more robust types of programs that are very different, and two, it makes the brand be the one in the spotlight. It allows them to truly come up with the experience they want to provide and the story they want to tell. And we&#8217;re just obfuscating everything that&#8217;s hard on chain, from programmable wallets to membership management, to token deployment, to mint burn transfer, to gas abstraction and wallet abstraction, to the logic for how tokens are earned, purchased and what that gives you in terms of benefits. So auctions, raffles, other redemption opportunities. So we&#8217;re trying to take all of that so that brands can truly focus on the things that make them unique and different, which is the experience, not the infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It is crazy how like, again, with an API, it&#8217;s just company X builds something so useful. And company A to Z just like gets the piggyback off of all that hard work for just a very minuscule, monthly, quarterly or annual price. And it&#8217;s just so cool. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve, you know, I don&#8217;t wanna say that I&#8217;ve become passionate about, but as a non coder and non super tech guy, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been more cognizant I guess really my main motivation comes from the profitability side of it. And it&#8217;s like, okay, as someone who likes to create businesses and help companies grow, like this is something that, you know, I need to become not an expert per se, but at least have a really good, better than the average Joe&#8217;s knowledge. So something very interesting. We do need to take a quick break though and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. When we get back, we&#8217;re gonna keep us in on Web3 Loyalty and we&#8217;ll get into some fun stuff like luxury, fashion, beauty brands, e-commerce, tattoos on the blockchain, and of course, Co:Create. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast. We love their team and their product as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style.

Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50, all one word, to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Tara. Let&#8217;s jump into Co:Create. I mean, you&#8217;ve already sort of thrown it on the platter and I feel like without even giving the elevator pitch, all the listeners know exactly what you and the team do, but I always have to throw the classic, give me the 30 second elevator pitch on what Co:Create is. So throw in the ball over to your court, give me the 30 second elevator pitch on Co:Create and then we&#8217;ll get into some more fun stuff here.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, absolutely. So we help innovative brands unlock the power of community, utilizing the tools of Web3, as well as to tap into the largest interoperable loyalty network so that they can partner with other innovative brands who are doing cool things and serving similar audiences. I think for us, what&#8217;s most important, as I was saying before, is we&#8217;re an API first platform. We are everything you don&#8217;t see that you don&#8217;t experience. With the exception of our first incubated concept, Co:Create, Ink. Which I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk a little bit more about.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I mean, let&#8217;s jump, we&#8217;ll get into that later. But first, first one I want to discuss. And we did have someone from your team, well, not from your team, but from the Bleacher Report team come on the show far earlier on. But you got to give us the TLDR on how incredible and how successful the partnership with Bleacher Reports. And of course, the NBA on TNT was because that was that was all world. That was incredible. And for guys like me who, you know, love ball and and then all the people who took part in that and had no clue that there was any like sort of Web3 tech involved in it, which was the best part.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so the Bleacher Report team, they are outstanding. They are so well-informed and knowledgeable when it comes to the space, which you really don&#8217;t see at large established companies very often. So it was just a total pleasure working with them. We&#8217;re powering the Watch to Earn program for inside the NBA. So if you&#8217;re watching Kenny and Shaq and all of them on television, after those episodes there, you can go on and it&#8217;s back because the NBA is back. You can go on and you can fill out answers to trivia questions. You earn BR tokens, so Bleacher Report tokens, which are actual ERC-20 tokens, that you then, as you accumulate them, can redeem in their rewards marketplace for either collectibles, inclusive of physical merch. So what&#8217;s really cool is I was actually just on there last night, which I got most of the questions right. I was on there last night and I was looking at the marketplace of redemption opportunities and I was like, there&#8217;s some cool swag and I just need to get some of my 5000 BR tokens because they&#8217;re still available. So I&#8217;m eyeing this sweatshirt that I really want and they&#8217;ve now expanded this. So the BR token, it&#8217;s not just gonna be for the NBA. They&#8217;ve now expanded the city in NHL. They&#8217;re thinking about expanding it to other properties. So it&#8217;s really meant to be this rewards token that is for sports lovers and sports fans. And it&#8217;s just been incredible partnership to work with them.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Yeah. Huge shout out to the BR and TNT team, especially as a Canadian. I mean, you know, when you&#8217;re a Canadian kid, you grow up, you don&#8217;t grow up watching basketball. Well, you do. But, you know, as soon as you come out of the womb, you literally, you know, get a pair of skates thrown on you and grab a hockey stick and start skating around in the pond. So it&#8217;s great to see TNT do such incredible work and grow the game of hockey as well, because, you know, we need our fellow Americans. There&#8217;s 10 of you for every one of us. And if we want to grow the game, need that to happen. So I absolutely love that. Let&#8217;s jump into your Co:Create Studio&#8217;s, your inaugural project, which is the Co:Create Ink. And you guys have partnered with, I believe it&#8217;s 10, world -famous tattoo artists. And again, this is just Web3 loyalty at its peak. So friggin&#8217; cool. You got to tell myself and the listeners more about this.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so we are an API first platform, which means that we don&#8217;t control the user experience or user journey. And intentionally so. And as we were coming together over the summer, we realized there are ideas that we&#8217;re really excited about that aren&#8217;t within the brand lane. They&#8217;re more so in the creator economy lane. And we want to, creator economy don&#8217;t need APIs. They need platforms, white label solutions, plug and play tooling that doesn&#8217;t require a developer. And so we started to explore like, what are cool ideas that we could bring to life built on our Co:Create tech stack. So we&#8217;ll use our base, but we&#8217;re actually going to build the full application inclusive of the front end experience. And one of the concepts that we got really excited about was this one of tattoos. You know, tattooing, it is one of the oldest art forms in the world. And there are tattoo artists who they have clearly craftsmanship. The application of tattoos takes a lot of skill, but there are tattoo artists who are also truly artists. And their artwork is still charged or priced based on their time. You know, even if they charge a higher hourly rate than others, they&#8217;re still getting paid based on their time, not on their art. Their art is still also impermanent as much as we think tattooing is permanent. It&#8217;s still tied to a human who gets sunburns, who gets cuts and wounds, who eventually passes away. And so their artwork also doesn&#8217;t have permanence to it. And we were excited about the potential for blockchain and NFT technology to enable this art form to be elevated, to be permanent, to highlight the collector network that surrounds an artist, which some of these artists, they&#8217;ve worked with incredible people, such as one of our founding artists has tattooed Usher and Chris Hemsworth, another one is tattooed Lady Gaga. Like, I mean, just incredible people that you want to kind of know who are the connections between this group. And so we realized, you know, NFTs can change this, but it&#8217;s got to be done in a way that doesn&#8217;t require someone to be a Web3 expert because there is a lot of skepticism within certain communities about blockchain and crypto and Web3. And this has to be experienced first. And so what we&#8217;re bringing out, which is Co:Create Ink, it&#8217;s launching in December, is you can go on and you&#8217;ll be able to actually see exclusive one of one works by these top tattoo artists. You can buy that design, which comes with the booking. It comes with the session. So you&#8217;re actually buying the application of the tattoo, which for these 10 artists around the world, we have artists in Brazil, in Italy, in Germany, in Tokyo, in the US, in Canada. We actually have one tattoo artist in Canada. You can&#8217;t get appointments with these folks. Like, one of our artists there, wait time is over a year. So this gets you an actual booking with an exclusive one of one work that you have a digital collectible that you can own forever, as well as the actual application. And it opens up all of the tradability that we know blockchain is capable of. So we&#8217;re really excited to bring it to life. We&#8217;ve got an incredible group of artists and feel very fortunate to be able to partner with them, to build something that works for them and really treating them as the subject matter experts. And we are just like the vessel to help them do something really cool.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I absolutely love this partnership. And again, like we live in the attention economy nowadays and you&#8217;ve stated many times on the show, you guys are primarily an API company. And for the ability for not only you, but the tattoo artist, I&#8217;m sure all of like every single one of these tattoos is gonna be filmed and is going to be content will be produced out of this. This is just all world content as well. Like this just seems like winds across the board for absolutely everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure. And we&#8217;re actually going to be launching the platform. Well, we&#8217;re only launching it to a select number, so we have a waitlist running right now. So for anyone interested, go to cocreate.ink to sign up for the waitlist so you can get first access when we launch. And we&#8217;re going to be running a prize draw. So for people that are on the waitlist that go on to refer, you will have the chance to actually be flown out to our launch event during Art Basel Miami on December 7th and meet all the artists and just have a good time. And if someone might even get tattooed, there we shall see.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Love that. Maybe that&#8217;ll be me. Maybe I&#8217;ll get my name thrown out of the hat. No longer be a tattoo virgin. First one. Oh, I love it. A couple more points here as we are getting a little tight for time. Ecommerce industry, something I&#8217;m very passionate about. I have been very fortunate to work with one of Canada&#8217;s fastest ever growing e-commerce brands. I love e-commerce. I think it&#8217;s great for the people. It&#8217;s so nice to go into store and again, especially with how powerful shipping is nowadays, literally you buy something, you get it the next day. Most of the time, Amazon e-commerce brands, maybe two or three days later, it&#8217;s lovely. And it just, just the absolute sort of economic creation that it has produced as well, very cool industry. This is a way that Web3 can really come in and start moving a groove and shake things out more specifically on the whole loyalty side of things. I really haven&#8217;t seen a whole lot of brands take the power of Web3 yet. There&#8217;s also tons of Shopify plugins that allow NFTs like Shopify and Toby Luke has, you know, on a multitude of different occasions has said, we&#8217;re cool with NFTs. We understand that this can unlock, you know, a bunch of really cool loyalty programs, but I still haven&#8217;t really seen any brand take this to the next level. I know you and the team are working on some really cool things here. Have any brands in the past done this that you&#8217;ve, you know, seen and been like, wow, that&#8217;s really cool. And I guess just a segue out of that question. What exactly are you and the team working on in e-commerce space right now?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so, you know, the KIKI World example that I gave, they are an e-commerce brand. They don&#8217;t have any physical stores and they actually use Shopify as well. So we have a Shopify integration and app that&#8217;s available for any of our clients to use. I agree with you wholeheartedly that e-com is an incredible opportunity for this because they already live online and in digital spaces. We also, though, are very excited about the ability to recognize and reward actions that are taken across IRL and URL. So physical stores to events to online e-com to Instagram and other social media platforms. And so we&#8217;ve actually built out integrations with Instagram, with Twitter, with Discord. Now I believe Telegram is coming next, where people say, I know my community, they&#8217;re going to engage with me on my e-com site, right? Because that&#8217;s where they come to get things. They&#8217;re also engaging me in these other places. And I want to be able to recognize and reward those actions. And so I have to have a way to bring this all together. And a blockchain or tokenized loyalty program is the perfect way to do that because it is this ledger, right? That can take in inputs from all these different places and create a centralized single source of truth for what that individual has done, has contributed and has redeemed and participated in. And so I think e-com is a huge opportunity. KIKI World is a great example of that. But we definitely need to see more because what I think what is one of the blockers right now is people here Web3 loyalty and they think, as we were talking about before, retention marketing, which if you&#8217;re a disruptor brand who&#8217;s trying to grow, you&#8217;re not focused on retention as much as you&#8217;re focused on growth. And so we have to change that concept of loyalty can be more than retention.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s so true. It just seems like there&#8217;s so many opportunities for all these e-commerce brands that again, it&#8217;s like you go on their website and they have perhaps a similar to an airline point system where it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s not like airlines where, you know, you are a CEO of a very fast growing company. You&#8217;re flying around North America all the friggin&#8217; time. Like no shit, you&#8217;re gonna wrap your points. You have a reason to like, you know, actually want those points and the rewards are worth it. But spending thousands and thousands of dollars to finally get like 10 bucks off your next purchase. It&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s no incentives. And we live in a world where incentives move the needle. So very interesting on that end. Another area that I think has a very high ceiling is high end fashion, beauty, just luxury as a whole. You know, I feel like luxury can really do it. What about the luxury space? Obviously, besides KIKI World, anyone moving and groovin&#8217; in the luxury space?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so we are working with one of the oldest luxury brands in the world, which is a program that&#8217;s not live, so I can&#8217;t share more about it. But I would say keep your eyes out because you&#8217;re right. The areas where brands really are starting to understand and take steps to implement Web3 loyalty programs are in intermediated industries. Luxury has often had an intermediated sale or relationship with their customers. Blockchain, it&#8217;s a back-end technology, but it&#8217;s a direct to consumer technology. It directly connects the two ends of the spectrum, a provider and a consumer or two community members, right? And so we&#8217;re seeing this in luxury, we&#8217;re seeing this in any sort of industry where they&#8217;re sold through intermediaries, so beauty, which is sold through Sephora or other large department stores. We&#8217;re seeing this in the alcohol industry where a lot of alcohol brands have not had that direct relationship with their end consumer. They&#8217;re sold in bars or they&#8217;re sold through intermediaries as well. So those are the ones where I get really excited. The other one that we&#8217;ve already talked about as well as an industry is fans of sports teams. So many fans exist out there and the sports teams, you don&#8217;t really, you&#8217;ve got your social media following, but they don&#8217;t have a good sense of who their fans are and where they are and what they care about in a way to directly incentivize them. Web3 loyalty programs, these are incentive programs that are supposed to create great rewards so that people take actions that that organization is wanting them to take. And so any intermediated industry where there is a desire for a direct relationship, those are the ones that I think are really getting Web3 loyalty and starting to do cool things.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very true. Yeah, sports teams, anyone from sports teams listening to this, get your shit together, get on the train. Make some shit happen. It&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s definitely a massively untapped one. Tara, this has been absolutely incredible. One last segment and then we will wrap up. We got to jump in the hot take factory, get our shit kicking boots on. You actually probably have more experience than I do as you grew up on a farm. But let&#8217;s jump in the hot take factory here. Let a couple fly. It doesn&#8217;t have to be Web3 loyalty, crypto blockchain related, can be health, wealth, happiness, some spicy stuff, politics, AI, aliens, you name it. But give me a couple Tara hot takes before you go.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
This is where I get cancelled, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No. This is a cancel free show.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
I mean, we touched on it a little bit before, which is I know there&#8217;s this concept within like OG crypto, if not your keys, not your coin, be your own bank. I don&#8217;t think anyone wants to be their own bank. I want my bank to be my bank, right? And the reason for that is there is so much pressure associated with being the safe guard, the vault for all of your assets. And so that&#8217;s where I really want to see us continue to evolve and mature as an industry, is reducing the pressure and the risk associated with ownership because to truly be an owner of something, you also have to protect it. And I need more help in protecting those things, which we&#8217;re trying to do some stuff on. There&#8217;s a lot of brands out there and companies and providers out there that are doing cool stuff on, but that&#8217;s the one. I don&#8217;t think people, with certain exceptions, there are places in the world where the ability to be your own bank is so important and critical that people will do it. But in a lot of stable developed countries, that&#8217;s not the case. No one wants to be their own bank.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty much in the same yacht as you in that regard. I&#8217;m a believer of like maybe 90, 10 rule 95, 5 where it&#8217;s like maybe keep, you know, maybe keep a couple of dineros under your bed, but like otherwise, yeah, let the big boys handle it. So incredible episode. Thank you so much for coming on. This was an absolute treat and can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two before you go. Can you please let our listeners know where they can find you personally and Co:Create online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yep, so I&#8217;m @nonfungibletara. My last name is Fung, so it&#8217;s a little bit cuter than normal than everyone else who&#8217;s non fungible. But so @nonfungibletara on Twitter, or X. And you can find us at usecocreate.io to learn more about the API platform. And if you&#8217;re into tattoos, definitely go check out cocreate.ink to see our new tattoo artists and to get signed up for the wait list.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Amazing. Tara, thank you so much. Appreciate the time. Had a blast and can&#8217;t wait for round two.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Appreciate it, thanks so much for having me.</p>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzin and as always, and I am super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, Adam Reeds, a fellow Canadian. We love to see it. He&#8217;s the Co-Founder and CEO of Ledn, a global company regulated in the Cayman Islands that focuses on building financial products to help people save in Bitcoin and digital assets. Prior to Co-Founding Ledn, Adam spent 10 years at Dream Asset Management, where he developed, built and financed a $1.5 billion portfolio of renewable power projects. It was Bitcoin&#8217;s connection with the energy that brought Adam into Bitcoin Mining, where he and his Co-Founder identified a gap in financial digital assets. Today, Ledn is a broad financial services platform with clients in over 130 countries. Adam is also a graduate of the HBA program at the Richard Ivey School of Business and also holds a Bachelor of Engineering Science from the University of Western Ontario. Absolutely love that. Can&#8217;t wait to get into all this stuff. Adam, pumped to have you on band. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Doing well. Thanks Matt. Great, great to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Adam, before we get into all the fun stuff here, I got to talk about some of your uni stuff. You went to Western Ontario. A couple of the guests on the show have gone to Western Ontario. For the listeners at home, Western Ontario is Canada&#8217;s version of, I would say, well, firstly, it&#8217;s an incredible academic school. And secondly, it&#8217;s Canada&#8217;s version of like Arizona State. It is absolutely wild. The parties are all world, beautiful people on the male and female side. Just an incredible school. How much fun did you have at Western?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
I had a wonderful time and it&#8217;s exactly that. Obviously, people think of Canada as a pretty small place, but when they hear the numbers of the school, it&#8217;s 50,000 attendees, so a pretty amazing faculty and students coming from all over the world. And actually had a chance to go back. I was just there teaching a guest lecture at the business school there with a really good friend of mine. So it was pretty nostalgic to go back and share what we&#8217;re doing at Ledn and everything that I&#8217;ve done since post-grad. So I definitely love spending as much time in London, Ontario, where Western is as I can. And yeah, great school.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Before we get into all the crypto and Ledn stuff, I&#8217;d love if you could tell me a little bit about yourself, childhood growing up in Guelph, you said, for the listeners at home, Guelph is just about an hour outside of Toronto, small town, really good town, very agriculture. And I wouldn&#8217;t say so much tech, but like really focuses on nature and everything agriculture related. Incredible school there as well, really good people, great sports teams, you name it, but walk me through your childhood, couple hobbies, whatever you wanna tell us, and then segue that into the 10 years you spent at Dream where you built a $1.5 billion portfolio, because that is absolutely incredible, the floor is yours.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, happy to. So Guelph was a great place to grow up. It&#8217;s when I was there, it&#8217;s grown a little bit since then, but it&#8217;s about 100,000 people city. And it&#8217;s about an hour from Toronto, as you mentioned. So I think what&#8217;s unique about it is the size of the town. It was five high schools. I think it&#8217;s six now expanded a little bit, but everyone knows each other. And that kind of makes for a nice community. And so it was a wonderful place to meet a lot of great people, still really good friends with a lot of friends that I grew up with in Guelph. Definitely a hockey town. I&#8217;m an okay athlete by no means a great athlete. So it wasn&#8217;t a competitive hockey player, but many of my friends were. And so that makes it very Canadian in the setup there. And yeah, I actually, I continued on one of my best friends from Guelph was my roommate at Western. And so still really good friends with him. And as I continued on to Western, took a business school and engineering at Western. And that was really helpful because I was able to combine a technical background with a knowledge and some of the interest I had in business. And that led me into the start of my career in renewable power. And so graduated after Western, joined a startup that was actually focused on building out renewable power projects throughout North America. And really I joked at the time that my job was to convert kilowatt hours into dollars. When I mean not that just in the business sense of creating projects like that, but in the explanation of how I was able to communicate and think about investing in the energy sector, kind of combining a knowledge, a technical background in engineering with that in business. And so spent 10 years developing and financing renewable power projects. There was some good incentives that the government had in place in Canada. And from there, really learned about how to put together and provide financing to large scale infrastructure projects. And that led it itself well to understanding Bitcoin because Bitcoin mining is an infrastructure project in itself. And through many conversations I had with my current co-founder, who was a friend that I met at Western at business school there, we decided to think about how to apply our different backgrounds. His first off in Bitcoin and mine in energy finance into create something new for the space. So to jump ahead a little bit, after spending 10 years in the renewable power sector, we decided to think about how to again, apply that knowledge into Bitcoin. And as we set out to build a Bitcoin mining operation, which was again, a small infrastructure project, no one would finance it. And so that was kind of the introduction into thinking about how to apply that knowledge from the energy sector into a new sector and think about how to advance things from there. So I&#8217;m kind of jumping ahead a bit, but that was the kind of relationship between starting in energy finance and then applying it to Bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What year did you guys build or at least try to get financing for the first mining rig?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, it was 2016 that we thought about and really approaching it. And then yeah, 2017, I think, the interesting thing about 2017 was there was broad retail interest, but no institutional interest yet or limited institutional interest. I think there was some of the investment banks looking at helping out some of the miners and taking some of the mining companies public, but there was no institutional interest at least broadly, at least speaking from a Canadian perspective in any of the banking institutions, it was quite the opposite. It was viewed as a risky endeavor. And that was actually the opportunity. So the opportunity was how do we take something that&#8217;s pretty misunderstood and thinking about how to provide something of value to it? And I think kind of tying back, that was the parallels I saw in renewables. And so I think what&#8217;s interesting, even when anything&#8217;s new, is the questions that are asked at the beginning are often not the most important once people begin to understand it. What I mean by that is if I can take a basic example with renewables, when solar projects first came out, everyone was asking, well, how do we know the solar panels are gonna last for 30 years? How do we know they&#8217;re not gonna fall apart? How do we know they&#8217;re not gonna blow off the roofs? It was really always around technical questions. And I think then once people get comfortable with the technology, the questions advance, and it&#8217;s like, okay, well, how do we know that if we&#8217;re putting a project on IKEA&#8217;s roofs, that IKEA&#8217;s gonna pay the bills for 20 years. And it&#8217;s more like traditional credit and that type of analysis. And so I saw this like deja vu with things happening in Bitcoin and that the questions that we&#8217;re asking was like obsession about the tech and not about the application. I was like, okay, even though this is quite different, there&#8217;s some interesting parallels as far as the challenges I went through with trying to finance renewable power into the challenges that I&#8217;m now experiencing with trying to talk about financing Bitcoin projects. And so I was like, okay, if something is misunderstood, there&#8217;s interesting opportunity here. And I think any innovation and any opportunity to generate profits comes out of misunderstanding of misallocation of knowledge. And so when you see knowledge gaps, there&#8217;s often an opportunity where a small amount of people know something deeply, the masses don&#8217;t, and then therefore things can really become exciting if you can connect that</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. That was absolute gold right there. I want to just take a quick step sideways if we will. And I&#8217;d love if you could take a little riff on sort of specifically the Bitcoin mining sector in Canada. And we do have a very significant, a significant chunk of the listener base is Canadian, which I absolutely love. And again, just priming this for the listeners here, Canada has a plethora of renewable energy. We have obviously anyone can really put solar on their ground, but we have obviously tons of natural falls, like Niagara Falls, we have a bunch of turbines in Quebec, we have oil, we have windmills all over the place. There&#8217;s tons of electricity and a massive chunk of the power grid in Canada that isn&#8217;t being used. In fact, it&#8217;s the same as the States and almost everywhere in the world, you know, minus a couple of places like Texas where they do battle for electricity. But nonetheless, I&#8217;d love if you could talk about energy usage in Canada and how it correlates and relates to Bitcoin mining. And if you could also segue into are there grants, because I know Canada hands out grants left, right and center, but are there any energy grants that you can use specifically for Bitcoin mining as well?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, so to just talk about the first part of what you said there, it&#8217;s exactly right. The renewable power sector supplies the majority of electricity in Canada, so most of that is hydro. Canada&#8217;s blessed with ample rivers, streams, lots of water that&#8217;s traveling big distances that you can put turbines in front of and grab hydro electricity. So that provides a significant amount of the electricity. Like Quebec&#8217;s grid is like 95% hydro. Ontario&#8217;s is a big chunk as well. Nuclear does play a big part in Ontario as well. I use the provincial reference because all the different provinces regulate their own energy. And then the only provinces that would be more skewed towards fossil fuels would be Saskatchewan and Alberta, but still broadly speaking, when you look at Canada as a whole, it&#8217;s a very clean grid. So that makes it interesting for Bitcoin mining because if you set up Bitcoin mining here in the right grid conditions, you&#8217;re able to power that Bitcoin mine with primarily renewable energy. And as you said, there&#8217;s a lot of situations where the power is not needed. So Quebec used to be like most places in North America used to have more heavy industry. That heavy industry has moved offshore. So there&#8217;s a lot of situations where grids are overbuilt and the power may not be needed in that circumstance. And therefore there&#8217;s like significant amount of existing infrastructure that can be used to power Bitcoin mining. And what&#8217;s cool about Bitcoin mining is it doesn&#8217;t care where it is. You need some internet connection, but by no means is it like robust. The internet connection needs it just needs something basic. And so you can put this anywhere. And it&#8217;s like an energy sponge to really optimize efficiency across grids. So that&#8217;s pretty cool. I would say Canada was decently positioned for it. But of course, regulation is always the key piece that can some adoption limits. And there was concerns with, okay, what if this goes too far? You know, obviously there&#8217;s a little bit of efficiency to be gained, but you know, how do we make sure it&#8217;s not overdone? So years ago, Quebec was in good headings, but then they started to do RFPs and it scared some of the Bitcoin development away from that, just given that the thought that the sector may not be as big as it could have. So I think there&#8217;s a little bit more there. But now you see more development, I would say in the places like Texas where it&#8217;s a little bit more of a free for all as far as setting up and more just private to private. So there&#8217;s the only province in Canada that regulates electricity almost like a free market is Alberta. The other provinces, you have to follow pretty stringent provincial guidelines as far as fulfilling how electricity is placed on the grid and proper approvals and things like that. So things just don&#8217;t move as fast as they do in fully unregulated or deregulated markets like Alberta and Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
How classic Canada was that? Had something good, fucked it up. I think we might be the best in the world at that, having a competitive advantage and just wiping it all away.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, Canada tends to kind of wait and see, which is, you know, it can be a little bit of the Achilles heel on a lot of things I&#8217;d say for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s truly wild. Let&#8217;s jump into Ledn. Before we get into it, give me the elevator pitch and then we&#8217;ll get into the fun stuff here.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Look, Ledn came out of solving our own problems. As I mentioned, Marisi and I, my co-founder of the business, we started to set up a Bitcoin mine in Canada, looked to get banking and financing for that exact mine and couldn&#8217;t achieve it. So built a solution that solved our own problem and from there decided and understood that there was a lot of other people, companies, ideas, applications worldwide that could benefit from a Bitcoin back loan. And so launched that first product in 2018 and then thought about how to build out more broad financial services. So since then have been focused almost exclusively on the boring and lending space. And that also means allowing clients to have opportunities to earn yield on their assets by lending those assets out and helping clients meet their financial goals by saving and maintaining, building their digital asset wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So you guys are sort of information a digital asset lending company that sort of specializes in Bitcoin lending.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And if I were a betting man, one of the biggest questions you probably get are, you know, Adam, tell me the difference between Bitcoin lending and traditional lending. Because, you know, anyone can go to the bank and get a loan. I mean, mind you, two, three years ago, that loan was a lot sexier than it is today with, I guess, in Canada, what, six, seven, eight percent interest rates now. But, you know, you guys are giving loans at a much sexier and much more appealing price with better terms as well. It&#8217;s crypto back lending. What are the biggest differences between traditional lending and crypto slash Bitcoin lending?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, the biggest difference is Bitcoin is the best and most pristine collateral there is globally. So what&#8217;s incredible about this asset, it&#8217;s the same to everyone globally. And that&#8217;s not true for any other asset, including gold. So even gold is jurisdictional. Financing gold in a vault in Venezuela is very different than finance and gold in a vault in Canada. And we get into assets like real estate, obviously, very different terms for what you can get on a mortgage in Mexico versus the US. So I think the best thing I like about building on this asset class is fairness. The terms can be the same everywhere because the asset is the same everywhere. And that&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Interesting. So walk me through some of the conversations or perhaps not conversations, but use cases. Why would someone want to rent out their Bitcoin, their crypto to use this collateral? And then on the other side of the coin, why would someone need to take out a loan? Is it mostly mining projects? Is it mostly crypto related projects? Are you guys doing this for sort of Web2 folks as well? More TradFi folks? Like, give me a bunch of use cases that you guys are going to town on.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Of course, yeah. So the key piece that&#8217;s the same for everybody is have Bitcoin, don&#8217;t want to sell it and need Fiat for other purposes. So the use cases range from for smaller loans, paying down perhaps more expensive debt, paying down credit card debt to larger use cases, we&#8217;d be diversifying, perhaps purchasing real estate, perhaps wanting to invest in other asset classes like equities. And then even use cases like wanting to buy more Bitcoin. So we developed a product for that called B2X using your existing Bitcoin to buy more of it. And so we see a plethora. Some of the use cases that I love to see is we&#8217;ve seen people use their Bitcoin back loan to finance a business, pay for education, pay for medicine. So all different types of meaningful use cases that are really incredible to see. I&#8217;d say the other thing that we love to see is for some people accessing our loan products, it&#8217;s the first loan that they ever achieved or first loan that they were ever approved for. So this is this is incredible because again, on the concept of fairness, it&#8217;s just not at all even close to the same the availability of banking, financial services that you have in many different markets. So for those to be able to qualify for a loan, it adds a whole bunch of different other benefits other than just financial. In some cases, it&#8217;s self-esteem. It&#8217;s like, oh, I got something. I did something I can grow now. So that&#8217;s pretty interesting to see.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Quick little funny story. Well, actually, it&#8217;s not funny. It&#8217;s actually the opposite of funny, but I won&#8217;t name him, but one of my close buddies is trying to buy condo in Toronto. The condo he&#8217;s looking at is about 1.2 mil. He does well for himself, makes about two, I think just over 200K a year Canadian has enough to put 20% down as well. And the banks will not get him alone. Again, this guy makes over 200K a year. He has I think the 225 that&#8217;s needed to put the 20% down payment in Canada. If you&#8217;re a first time home buyer and it&#8217;s less than a mil, you can put 5% down. If it&#8217;s more than a mil, you have to put the traditional 20 and they won&#8217;t even get him a loan right now.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Is it because he&#8217;s self employed?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah. Bingo. So he doesn&#8217;t have a traditional Canadian stamped TSX 500, whatever you want to call a company that&#8217;s signing his paychecks. It&#8217;s just wild. Like this dude has never missed the payment, has crazy high credit score, like literally perfect on paper. And the best he can get is a loan from a boutique bank. And I want to say they gave him 11.5%. It&#8217;s like, oh yeah, that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s crazy right now. Absolutely craziness.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, look, it&#8217;s kind of an interesting aspect because we call them mortgages, but they&#8217;re really financing future cash load of guaranteed income, right? So the banks want to take the security of the real estate collateral as secondary, but really the primary source is locking in future income. And so it&#8217;s pretty wild amount of belts and suspenders that are needed to get something. And then if the loan is insured, it&#8217;s really the taxpayers on the risk as well to back up that insurance. So it&#8217;s a common problem and something that really isn&#8217;t unlocking future wealth for Canadians.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, it&#8217;s absolutely wild. Adam and folks are out to a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. But when we get back, we are going to continue on the future of crypto lending and rebuilding the digital asset lending space.

Another question off topic on my end of my apologies for jumping around here. When I was doing research for the show in my head, and again, obviously you guys are, I believe you said you&#8217;re, you know, you&#8217;re HQ&#8217;d and the came and now, which makes total sense. But when I was doing the research for the show and I was like, Oh, another Canadian guy, Canadian company crushing it and crypto, I was like, Damn, I sort of wish these guys went public because like there&#8217;s so many, I don&#8217;t want to say so many, but there&#8217;s a couple of companies like you guys who have such a high ceiling and who are doing really solid work and making good money. And I wish there were more opportunities for Canadians to invest in them. Obviously once you do this, you&#8217;re, you know, you&#8217;re KYC&#8217;d up the yin yang. It&#8217;s an absolute logistical and compliance nightmare. But was there ever a thought you and your co-founder, do you guys ever discuss going public on the TSXV and working your way up to the TSX?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, we&#8217;ve definitely discussed a lot of different ways to kind of take the company forward in the future. I think going public to me, it&#8217;s one source of one path, but the key is it has to be sustainable. So to your point, you made about just adding friction to the company, you had a whole bunch of costs when you take a company public that don&#8217;t necessarily add value to clients. And so that&#8217;s the main thing we&#8217;re focused on is if we can provide good service and do it at fair pricing, we&#8217;ll grow the company. And then what we need is, I think going public is an interesting avenue, but it has to be at a time where the compliance costs and other costs associated with me taking a public company are a lower percentage compared to the overall volume that you&#8217;re doing. And so I think when you see companies go public too early, they end up with this kind of like, almost like ball and chain attached to them where they&#8217;re managing to the public markets instead of managing to their clients. And that becomes problematic. And so we wanna make sure that we&#8217;re doing the latter, managing to our clients, and then we&#8217;ll have a sustainable business. And that&#8217;s again, one tool as far as how you can approach the public markets later. But I do hear you, I think the idea to give many investors more options to invest and other different ways to kind of participate in the sector is interesting and something that we&#8217;d love to do. One more thing on that I&#8217;d say, the other piece is like, issuing a token and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve stayed away from up to this date just because like, I think you really have to think through does the token add value? And what we&#8217;ve seen is like other lenders that have a token, they really only have the token because they issued it as far as their ICO. And so they needed it for their initial fund raise and then they have it. And I would say, candidly, it&#8217;s a pretend that there&#8217;s use cases for it, but really it&#8217;s just to kind of keep the price up to keep their initial ICO investors happy where there&#8217;s really not a need today. So it&#8217;s like keep the model as simple as possible. The one of the favorite things we have at the company is the best restaurants have the smallest menu. And what we mean by that is like keep things like so simple, you curate a good list of things and you have a tight menu and therefore you provide a really good experience and the best companies in the world do this, right? Like think about the experience you have when buying an Apple computer. There&#8217;s like good, great, you know, best, you don&#8217;t have buyers remorse on anything you buy from the Apple store and that same for other products like Dyson and Vitamix and all these like, you know, great brands that have taken what really is a commoditized product and just wrapped it in a really good experience to make sure that they&#8217;re really are limiting choice for the better.</p>

That was beautifully said so true there one more thing on going public and I&#8217;ve seen it happen so many times almost more specifically with you know companies that have Bitcoin or crypto exposure or our crypto product focused they go public and something happens most of the time it&#8217;s oh now we need more money and then they do death spiral financing and then it&#8217;s like now you have so many outdated options and soon to be vesting options on the table that some finance year some you know, P boutique owns and they literally control almost as much stock as you do and then you&#8217;re at their will now. It&#8217;s like It&#8217;s just it&#8217;s so unfortunate to see and I really wish it didn&#8217;t happen, but on the flip side. I do wish That&#8217;s the average Joe and Josephine more specifically the average Canadian Joe and Josephine had the opportunity to invest in really good crypto companies like yourselves besides just the usual, you know ETFs and indexes that you can invest in because it&#8217;s like those guys there&#8217;s only such a ceiling with them and their price is so correlative to the price of whatever asset usually Bitcoin or ETH and and it&#8217;d be really cool to invest in companies like yours. Is is there anyone who&#8217;s doing that or do you think that&#8217;ll change anytime soon where the average person can and will have opportunities to invest in up and coming companies like yours?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
I think, I don&#8217;t know in detail, but I know there&#8217;s a bank to the future which is run by Simon Dixon. So I think he&#8217;s created a crowdfunding way to participate and given his background in the crypto sector, I think that&#8217;s one opportunity that I think there may be limitations there. I think, I assume it&#8217;s not open to US investors. I&#8217;m not sure about Canadians participating in it, but there may be similar securities roles about participating in that, but I think there&#8217;s been some different attempts to democratize investing in that aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love to see that happen. Let&#8217;s keep going on the digital asset lending space. What does the future of crypto lending look like? I know you&#8217;ve done a bunch of talks over the last little bit. You were just in Riyadh. Also, what&#8217;s Riyadh like? That&#8217;s probably so cool. We&#8217;ll get into that. But you&#8217;ve done a bunch of talks on rebuilding the digital asset lending space, the future of crypto lending and why Bitcoin makes great collateral all tied into one. That&#8217;s your main thesis and I absolutely love that. Let&#8217;s just, I guess, to start. The future of crypto lending, what does that look like? Are we going to see any really cool innovations or is it just going to be a larger scale, more macro focus of what the current products and capabilities are present day?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, maybe first I&#8217;ll just talk about what we focused on this year, because I think it sets up for well, for where we&#8217;re going and really coming out of the 2022 blowups. Let&#8217;s just call it frankly, what it was. We knew that there was a massive need for more transparency and a complete loss of trust in the digital asset lending industry. And so we focused on sharing more and more of what we&#8217;re up to and trying to really position all the information we&#8217;re sharing and just talk about what&#8217;s going on under the hood and how do we make sure clients are comfortable with all the different activities. So really it was adding more transparency, but then once you provide that transparency, giving clients more control so they can make their choice on what they wanna do with their digital assets. And so earlier this year, we announced us, something called the open book report. So we show now how much assets are sitting in custody, how much is lent out, all the different activities that are going on and talk frequently about the types of lenders that we&#8217;re lending to. And then we also created within the savings product that we&#8217;ve renamed to our growth accounts, we really say created a best in class structure for clients to earn yield on their digital assets. And what we saw from the 2022 blowups was, there was a whole bunch of contagion that happened. And so if I showed up and I just wanted to take a Bitcoin back loan, I was exposed to clients that are earning yield on their Bitcoin or other digital assets. And frankly, everything was commingled. And so what we did was we took our yield products, which are our growth account products, and we separated it out legally and technically. So we said, if you wanna earn yield on your Bitcoin or your USDC, we&#8217;ll create a separate legal entity for that. And we&#8217;ll lend out directly from that legal entity so that the activities of that account are not commingled with the activities of our Bitcoin back loans. And so something like really straightforward, obviously this exists in traditional finance, but we want to make it really clear and come up with the best in class structure to do that. So that was a big focus on how we updated the growth accounts. So they&#8217;re now legally and technically ring fenced, bankruptcy remote to lead in as a corporate entity for clarity, not bankruptcy remote from the activities of that account. So there is still risk in that if those assets are lent out and those borrowers have issues, there is still exposure there. But what we&#8217;re trying to make clear is what you have exposure to and what you don&#8217;t have exposure to so you can make the right decision with your assets. So that was the kind of progress that we made this year was taking something that people viewed as all commingled together and then separating it out into separate entities so that clients could again make their own choice on what activity they wanna participate in and not. And so that was the progress there and kind of going into the future, I&#8217;d say it relies on the same theme. So more and more transparency, I&#8217;d say also the benefit of blockchain and this technology is that it does allow for absolute transparency. So I think we&#8217;ll see more and more things coming on chain, more and more information on utilizing all the transparency that this technology allows and kind of moving it into the future that way. I&#8217;d say the other future of this is of course we can&#8217;t ignore regulation. I think the challenge this industry has is that the technology and for the most part, some of the marketing and education does work globally, although, you know, be adjusting for different cultural nuances with how clients learn and invest in this asset class, but the regulation is not, right? The regulation is still ring fenced by country and you have to play ball in order to make sure that you can bring the masses into this industry. And so that&#8217;s the piece that I think everyone is wrestling with now is like, how do you absorb the compliance costs with being a regulated entity and what markets are our focus? So that&#8217;s why I think you see, you know, kind of naturally the bigger markets, you have companies that are just servicing those, of course the US being the largest market and so you&#8217;re kind of getting this fragmentation that&#8217;s happening now as far as areas of focus.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very interesting. Taking a step back, how did you guys survive last year? Because last year was an absolute shit show. I mean, it was nightmare fuel in the purest sense of nightmare fuel, especially as a lending entity. What was the secret sauce? How&#8217;d you guys do it?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, we did a lot of things differently leading up to the crisis that allowed us to survive. The first was making sure that any asset that we offered an account for, we had a real use case for. This wasn&#8217;t true for some of the other large names that are no longer around in that, for example, to talk about the yield accounts first, if you&#8217;re going to offer a yield on that asset, you better make sure that there&#8217;s a true market for that. What happened was there was an incentive that caused this to not be true for some of the large players that failed in that if you, for example, were incentivized to get as many assets on platform as quickly as you could, which some of the venture investing was motivating, you then offered yield on assets that didn&#8217;t have a true market for, or maybe you offered a yield that was higher than market. For example, this is just for an example only, but let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m offering to pay 10% on link. If the market can only support 3% on link, what was happening in some of the background is they&#8217;re mismatching assets. I would take the link, maybe post it to a DeFi protocol, borrow stables, and then lend that stables out at a yield that was high enough for me to earn a spread, but now I have directional risk. This type of activity worked well in an up only market, but as things started to compress, they couldn&#8217;t meet margin calls and were offside on different loans and borings, and therefore the house of cards that was built up came crashing down. So that&#8217;s number one, that&#8217;s a mismatch of assets. The other one was a mismatch of tenure. So if you think about if I&#8217;m going to offer open term Bitcoin deposits, you have the right Matt to deposit Bitcoin when you like and withdraw it when you like. So I better make sure that if I&#8217;m offering a yield on that, I have to do the same thing on the other side. So I can lend that Bitcoin out, but I have to make sure that I can withdraw that Bitcoin back from the borrower at the same time. And so I have to make sure I maintain my inventory. Well, this was not done. So you had situations where you took liquid deposits and you took that and lent it out in very illiquid loans or sometimes like investments. So there was a situation where one digital asset lender took open term client deposits and made venture investments, obviously very illiquid and talk about not even like a term to it, that&#8217;s pretty wild when you think about getting liquidity back for that asset. So that&#8217;s a big one. And the other thing I think is just back on the theme of transparency. So if you&#8217;re not open with what you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;re not providing the right information for clients to make a choice of how their digital assets are being utilized, then you end up with these black box business models and problematic on all sides. So we were the first crypto digital asset lender to launch proof reserves. So we put it on ourselves before any type of regulation was required. We&#8217;ve been doing this for several years now where we offer, we send all of our information on an anonymized basis. No client information is shared to a third party, a qualified accountant, and they verify that we have more assets than liabilities on the platform. It&#8217;s just a way to keep our systems honest and make sure that we can again provide that confidence to our clients.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s crazy how that&#8217;s not the norm. It&#8217;s crazy how like what you guys are doing is like almost considered unscalable in space. Like it&#8217;s just wild. Like just sketch balls after sketch balls. Crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s tough, right? And I think it is challenging because the space and some of the activity that has happened get again, co-mingled from a media standpoint. The reality is like fraud and these situations happen in any type of industry, but that&#8217;s something that we all need to do better.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, so true. We are getting a little tight for time here. A couple more questions and we&#8217;ll wrap up Adam. Another thing you guys are doing, which is really cool, and I&#8217;d love to know how this works. You guys are helping clients refinance their Celsius loans with Ledn. How are you guys making that work?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, this is a really exciting opportunity. And obviously we feel horrible for what happened to the Celsius borrowers and all clients within any crypto lending platform or broader platform that had issues. And so what we&#8217;re trying to do is offer a really competitive way for clients to refinance their loans. And so the reason this is important is the way the Celsius and I think true for other bankruptcies in Celsius, you have the option to either take your net equity of the loan back or refinance that loan. And so if you take your net equity back, what can happen and again, not financial advice, but just some of the information that we&#8217;ve been receiving and just relaying that is there may be a taxable event for you doing that. In that if you say had a loan that you posted 20,000 of Bitcoin and you had a $10,000 loan against it, obviously adjusting for haircut splits, let&#8217;s say you have a net equity position of 10. If you just take that 10 back, you&#8217;ve effectively sold your 20K to repay the 10 and therefore there may be a deemed capital gain. And so this is like a double whammy for those that have been through really a very difficult situation. So not only did I get hair cutted by the bankruptcy, but now if I take my net equity of the loan, I might get a capital gain as well. It&#8217;s like, come on, hit me when I&#8217;m down. So what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re offering a way for clients to use Ledn services to participate and coordinate with the Celsius bankruptcy committee to be able to effectively unlock their collateral and reinstate that loan on Ledn&#8217;s platform with new terms that Ledn&#8217;s providing. And so this has been very active for us. We put a lot of thought and work into making sure we can provide something that&#8217;s super helpful to the Celsius community. And it&#8217;s very active and hoping that that gets resolved in the next few months.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Love that. So cool. Adam, what an episode. Really appreciate you coming on last segment before we wrap up. Hot take factory. Let&#8217;s let a couple hot takes fly and then we will conclude. What do you got for me? It doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto related. It can be health, wealth, happiness, alien, space, AI, you name it. But give me a couple of Adam hot takes before you leave us today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Oh, look, I mean, I will keep it crypto related. I think that what&#8217;s been exciting is on the ETF front is, when everyone&#8217;s thinking about price, but the other thing that this is changing when the ETFs eventually do happen is that it unlocks a whole bunch of new avenues on the digital asset lending space. So right now we&#8217;re paying 1% on Bitcoin, which admittedly is the lowest it&#8217;s been over the last couple of years, but as the institutional volume comes back, we&#8217;re gonna see more trading activity to kind of balance out the ETFs. And so what we think we&#8217;re gonna be able to do is raise the rate on Bitcoin yield there and then provide more liquidity to this new and emerging market. So I think that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about is like, we&#8217;re not just gonna see price, we&#8217;re gonna see a whole bunch of activity happen and a whole bunch of broad interest come in and that&#8217;s super exciting. Outside of that, I guess my hot takes, maybe just to kind of draw a life lesson, I actually, I&#8217;m a private pilot in my spare time. So what I think a lot about is everything we&#8217;re doing is acting with intention. So when you take off one of the first things that the control tower asks you is, what are your intentions? So what do you intend to do with that flight? So I try to think about that every day. I think about when I wake up, what are my intentions for the day? What are my intentions for the week? How do I want things to go? And based on the outcome, if it doesn&#8217;t happen a certain way, you need to pivot and you need to think about other options. So it&#8217;s always like, if this happens, what&#8217;s plan A, what&#8217;s plan B, how am I gonna make it through and how am I gonna feel if these go a different direction? So that&#8217;s my kind of closing hot take is be intentional with your thoughts, be intentional with your activity and with your days, time&#8217;s the most valuable thing we have. So use it to the greatest way you can.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. What an ending. Where do you fly out of Billy Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, I learned out of Billy Bishop, the Island Airport in Toronto, and yeah, I&#8217;ve been flying a little bit internationally. Had an opportunity to fly in Bahamas last year, which was pretty incredible kind of island hopping there. So, yeah, definitely an incredible activity for anyone to uptake. And as I said, it provides a lot of lessons and, you know, thinking that&#8217;s applicable to many other aspects in life. So recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool. Adam, what an episode. Really appreciate you coming on. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Ledn online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Of course, so I&#8217;m on Twitter, just my full name, @adamreeds, Ledn is @hodlwithLedn on Twitter. Instagram is Ledn.io or Ledn.es. We have a Spanish Instagram as well for our listeners in Espanol. And yeah, todo bien, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Love it. Adam, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. Can&#8217;t wait for round two. Wishing all the best to you and the team.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Thanks a lot for the time Matt, I&#8217;d appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Folks, what an episode with Adam Reed, Co-Founder and CEO of Ledn he was dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center. Anything crypto lending related Bitcoin being great collateral.

<p>In late August this year, Ben Armstrong, formerly Bitboy Crypto, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ben-bitboy-crypto-fired-from-his-own-company-in-coup-whats-going-on.htm">was ousted from his own company</a> and YouTube channel that he created in 2018. What followed was a slew of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-content-creator-bitboy-ben-armstrong-sues-former-colleagues-at-hit-network.htm">serious allegations from Ben towards his business partner</a> and long time friend TJ Shedd.</p>
<p>I sat down with TJ to discuss the road ahead for the company, crypto market trends and how content creators are doing in crypto right now.</p>
<h2>“Truth is Becoming More Apparent”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The company behind Bitboy Crypto led by TJ Shedd has rebranded itself to Discover Crypto and is looking to put behind all the controversies and focus on growing and attracting new audiences from around the world.</p>
<p>TJ said that since he has come out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUNsLniiXDQ">publicly to defend himself</a> there has been a shift in the audience who are seeing the truth of the situation. TJ said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have seen a dramatic shift in audience (in our favor). It was definitely confusing at the beginning for people, but I think as more time goes on, the truth is becoming more and more apparent.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Rebranding and Moving Past Controversy</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
TJ Shedd acknowledged the controversy surrounding the rebranding process and emphasized the importance of staying focused on the future. He stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just laser-focused on where the industry is going, where the space is going. We have a plan to bring in some new talent and really professionalize the content that we&#8217;re putting out and focusing on blockchain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Talking about new faces for Discover Crypto post Ben’s controversial exit, TJ said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A lot of people know Deezy, he&#8217;s been on the channel for quite some time. A lot of people love hearing his takes and opinions. He covers the news a lot. He&#8217;s not going anywhere. The platform is expanding its team with the addition of Joshua Jake, a well-connected figure in the policy and crypto regulation space.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Discussing the future of Discover Crypto, TJ said that they expect more strategic partnerships with industry leaders and policy influencers in the coming time.He added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for another person to specifically cover DeFi and deep dives and, you know, a lot of different coin reviews and tokenomics. So that&#8217;s the plan going forward into 2024.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto Market Trends in 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Discussing market trends right now and what the future looks like, TJ Shedd shared his perspective on the crypto market cycles.</p>
<p>He expressed his belief in four-year cycles, stating, &#8220;I think it will play out very similarly to cycles we&#8217;ve seen in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained how the space might experience a surge in the near future due to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-could-attract-3b-on-first-day-and-up-to-55b-over-five-years-analysts.htm">potential approval of spot ETFs</a> and hinted at the possibility of a subsequent correction.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be shocked if Bitcoin pumps all the way up to close to 50k and then retraces back down to the 25-30k range.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With the Bitcoin halving event coming up next year, things are looking pretty bullish, he added.<br />
TJ also sees India playing a big role in shaping the industry’s future. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Indian audience is in a big way underserved in the crypto community because it&#8217;s a very strong, passionate, committed, well, understanding technical audience that I think, in a lot of ways, could very likely become the hub of blockchain and in web three as it goes forward.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Responsibility of Content Creators in Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Talking about the ongoing controversies and how content creators in crypto are currently being perceived, TJ emphasized that Discover Crypto is committed to promoting quality projects that benefit the audience. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We work very hard to be the polar opposite of that, where we don&#8217;t promote any projects that could potentially hurt the audience or anything unethical. This space is moving from almost like a niche trial thing to really moving into traditional markets and institutional money coming in.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Discover Crypto aims to work with major brand names next year and act as the voice of the crypto community.</p>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab, and we are buzzing as always. Coming in hot from Mexico as always. And today, I&#8217;m super pumped to have the one and only Nihar Neelakanti on the show today, the Co-Founder and CEO of Ecosapiens, a VC-backed platform enabling consumers to fight climate change through the world&#8217;s first carbon-backed NFT. We love that shit. He previously worked in venture capital, spending several years at VCs, including Correlation Ventures, Kauffman Fellows, and most recently at the prestigious Menlo Ventures, where he helped develop the climate thesis that sparked the idea for Ecosapiens. He is deeply fascinated by the opportunity to rethink economics in a way that generates the planets rather than extracts from it. Super pumped to have you on. Nihar, welcome to show my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Pleasure to be here, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
You&#8217;re kicking it in New York City right now. It&#8217;s getting close to that time of year. We&#8217;re recording end of October. This episode will air very early November. It&#8217;s probably my favorite city on the planet. Again, I live in Toronto. It&#8217;s about an hour and a half flight. So super, very easily doable for me. But what&#8217;s life like in New York City right now? I know the weather&#8217;s turning. You guys still have one of the best nightlife scenes in the whole world. You got the best food scene in the whole world. What&#8217;s the tech scene? What&#8217;s the crypto scene like? What&#8217;s the buzz in NYC right now?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Honestly, dude, so I lived in San Francisco the last several years and I just moved here in April because my co-founder Garrett has been here in Brooklyn like his whole life and we got this really cool office and I decided to make the jump over here. What&#8217;s really funny is that this month feels exactly like San Francisco does during the summer. It&#8217;s like a perfect mid 60s. You may be wearing a sweater, but for the most part it&#8217;s really beautiful. It&#8217;s not humid. The trees are starting to turn orange, but you know what my co-founder tells me is that it&#8217;s like oddly way warmer for this time of the year than it has been in the past, right? I don&#8217;t mind San Francisco weather 24/7, but he tells me that we should be like wearing hefty jackets by this time of the year and we&#8217;re just not. He says last year was also like one of the warmest winters on record. I don&#8217;t mean to jump straight in the climate change. I don&#8217;t know if you know this, but I do work in climate obviously. Yeah, like I did move here from California, but it seems like we might be in for an okay winter and I&#8217;m bracing for it. Tech seems cool. A lot of crypto, a lot of NFTs here. Shout out to Bitcoin ETFs hopefully coming out by the time this episode is released. Take your time, man. How do you feel about the market?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a good question. I mean, I love that you&#8217;re already throwing questions back at me here. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to rip like everyone said it&#8217;s going to rip. I&#8217;m seeing a lot of traditional finance lads who literally all they do, their bread and butter is launching ETFs and they&#8217;re all like, this will be no different than the hundreds or thousands of ETFs that have launched since inception. Obviously, there&#8217;s the whole, you know, needing physical Bitcoin instead of just shares that you can make up. Yes, there&#8217;s some alpha there, but I love it. I just, my biggest thing, Nihar is the sentiment. It&#8217;s fun again. You know, the last week on crypto Twitter has been electric. I missed that shit. Yeah, a lot of it&#8217;s fugazi and a lot of it can be a little, a little nonsensical. It&#8217;s very nuanced as well, but we are back in the sense of energy is back. Yeah, we have a little bit of price discovery happening, but the price doesn&#8217;t really get me going that much. But the fact that the energy is back, I love that. How do you feel about Bitcoin going up to 35 and everyone being happy pants again?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
I love it. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t, right? When the price goes up and there&#8217;s more energy. I mean, you know, we found this company entirely sort of in this market, we, you know, we found our Ecosapiens on as you saw the price of crypto started to go down. Like in the life of a company, I&#8217;ve actually never experienced the volume of NFTs or the price of crypto is kind of going up. I&#8217;m only seeing it as a bystander and to see like crypto Twitter, to see like the sentiment even in our office, right? When people are, you know, slacking every morning saying, oh, price just went up. Like everyone gets excited about it. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the space is back as a whole, but you got to take your wins when you see them, right? When you put your hands up. I miss the meme culture. You know, Nikita Bier. I don&#8217;t know if you see that tweet.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, he got absolutely, he was the poster boy for 24 hours, now everyone&#8217;s roast them again already. But he does that on purpose, he knows exactly what he&#8217;s doing. He&#8217;s a master at that, he&#8217;s a magician.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
We love them, but you know, I do think like all bull markets are a little bit different. Right? I think last when you saw a lot of meme coins, you saw a lot of funky, you know, meme NFTs come out. Whatever this next like cycle is that we&#8217;re entering, you know, I do hope it&#8217;s going to be more mature, but I also do miss like all the memes, you know, I miss, what was that one that came out last year with like the goblintown.wtf. Right? I miss goblin town.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s wild. Let&#8217;s jump into Ecosapiens for a while. I want to touch on a point that you mentioned where when you guys launched crypto was literally going straight to the shitter. And you guys have found a way to not even create buzz, but just keep momentum throughout a what I guess almost two year bear market. Like how do you guys do that? But before we jump into Ecosapiens and you know, I&#8217;ll give you a chance to obviously do the pitch and the elevator pitch in the whole nine yards. But like how did you guys keep your community involved? How did you keep the price pretty steady? Like that&#8217;s not easy to do. You guys are one of the only people in the space who actually done this.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, honestly, I think it&#8217;s basically two things. One is we were VC funded from the very beginning, right? So we didn&#8217;t have this like pressing need to go launch NFTs to raise funds. We raise funds to help us think of how to use NFTs to solve interesting climate problems, right? And it&#8217;s a fundamental shift if you think about it. That&#8217;s one thing. The second thing is I think what you find is when you build a community from scratch in a bear market, you&#8217;re inherently attracting people that are there for values first, as opposed to like price first, right? And you know how it is, like when you when you build a community built on like shared values, specifically impact climate, like durable importance, you actually have people there that are willing to commit for the long haul as well. So I think we&#8217;ve been sort of in this weird way, blessed to encounter people who shared the same value system and the same purpose and mission. And we, you know, we frankly didn&#8217;t come across a lot of the folks that were like, when&#8217;s the price going to go up? What&#8217;s the team coming up with next? Which is an inevitable part of the space when you kind of have to play into it. But we never promised a product that would appreciate in value. Like that&#8217;s not really what we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re using digital collectibles as a way to, you know, finance climate action, right? And so it&#8217;s a very different sort of way. We weren&#8217;t using NFTs as a way to raise money. We had the money. We were using them as a tool to, you know, save the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Then again, that&#8217;s I love the point you touched on there. That&#8217;s very rare. You guys are in the, I was going to say 1%, but even that&#8217;s an absolute boost in a half. You guys are in the 0.001% of NFTs communities where the community itself gives a shit in the long term vision and isn&#8217;t there for the quick one, you know, maybe rich one, are we pumping, which is wild. And that&#8217;s a big chunk of that is because like you said, that the vision of climate change. Sorry, you were saying.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
No, I&#8217;ll just say one more thing. We&#8217;ve actually been more of like a Web2 company. I mean, and I&#8217;ll talk more about this in a moment, but our whole team has a background mostly that comes from Web2, you know? Like my co-founder was an advertiser at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and a bunch of other great platforms. We have a TikTok guy, et cetera. I came from investment and we never knew how to play until a lot of these sort of Web3 go to market tactics. We just want to ship consistently and learn. To date, we&#8217;ve actually shipped like six or seven products, right? And in a space where you maybe see an NFT team ship maybe once or twice a year, we&#8217;ve actually literally shipped six or seven products. In that process, like the community ends up staying active. They stay along for the ride and people aren&#8217;t left waiting for what might come next, right? So I think just this consistent shipping, which I think is a very Web2 mindset, has been a persistent part of our culture and it&#8217;s shown up like in the community as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, no, good point there. Walking through Ecosapiens as a whole, give me the 30 second TLDR elevator pitch and then we&#8217;ll get into some of the nitty gritty stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, we founded Ecosapiens on a really simple premise. Make climate action easy, elegant, and impactful. We&#8217;re a climate company first, right? So we wanted to build products that empowered every people such as you and me and Matt to make a really big difference in the planet in an easy and impactful way. And we do that through Ecosapiens, which are the world&#8217;s first carbon offsetting digital collectibles. And what we mean is when you buy one of our digital art pieces, you&#8217;re financing carbon removal projects around the world, like reforestation, solar regeneration. And in the process, you&#8217;re offsetting your carbon footprint for the whole year. That was sort of our initial thesis. We&#8217;ve only deepened our conviction. Today we are the leader in what we call carbon offsetting digital collectibles.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Before we keep going into Ecosapiens, you gotta give the listeners a little background on yourself because you&#8217;ve done some pretty darn cool shit at a very young age, got into VC hella early and went all in on climate. Give us the quick background on that and then we&#8217;ll sort of piece it all together and why it makes so much sense in regards to what you and the team are doing right now.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
So I actually, I grew up in Southern California in San Diego, and you know, I thought I&#8217;d be a filmmaker, you know, most of like my, who doesn&#8217;t want to be a filmmaker when you grew up in San Diego or LA, right? I don&#8217;t know what you wanted to be, Matt, when you were 16, but you know, Christopher Nolan was like a hero, right? And he&#8217;s a legend director. But I went to USC, I fell in love with entrepreneurship. And my mode of the world has always been through stories. And I think if you look at, you know, great tech companies, a lot of them do have this great story of like founding team comes together, has a vision for the how they want to change the world, build a piece of technology, scale it, grow it. There&#8217;s a hero&#8217;s journey in entrepreneurship. And that&#8217;s like rule number one of some of the best filmmaking, right? It&#8217;s sort of the hero&#8217;s journey. I ended up stumbling into venture capital, basically looking at the stories of great entrepreneurs for many years. And when I found myself at Menlo Ventures, I was sort of looking at my own story, you know, wondering sort of like how I wanted to develop my career long term, right? And impact has been a big part of my life, just like growing up. And I was doing consumer product related things. And in 2020, I remember being in San Francisco and saw the wildfires, you know, happen in October that year, I believe. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve seen those images of like the orange skies. Dude, it&#8217;s terrifying. I remember like opening my window in San Francisco. And from my apartment, I actually have a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Really special, by the way. And just immediately having this flashable memory of when I was a kid growing up in San Diego and seeing the same orange skies when I was a kid. I remember like literally the moment when my parents woke me up at 5 a.m. in San Diego, saying, we got to pack our bags. There&#8217;s a fire coming. What do you put in your backpack? If you only can only squeeze in one thing as a kid, right? I took my PlayStation with me, but.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I would have done the same, 100%.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, but it was terrifying. I snapped back into it and it just occurred to me that more and more families and kids are gonna wake up at 5 a.m. And have, you know, see that shit and have to flee hurricanes, wildfires, you name it. And that&#8217;s when I started sitting there asking myself, look, I&#8217;m here in San Francisco, in venture capital, surrounded by a lot of smart people. Why is it that I can&#8217;t really do anything? Like, what can I really do to make a difference on the planet? Turns out there&#8217;s a few ways, right? One is you can give up your car and you can, you know, bike to work, not very feasible in lots of parts of the world. You can end up spending more money on sustainable products, which is inaccessible to most people. But the third sort of insight that I had gleamed was like, there are really great climate companies like Tesla or Patagonia. And if you look at the number one reason why people buy them, it&#8217;s because of the signaling element of it, right? Like we are social animals. We do like to signal to the world that we are part of the specific value system. And so what I thought was, hey, people care about the planet. And it turns out there&#8217;s a lot of people just like me that want to make a difference, but they&#8217;re unable to do it. And the way to make climate action scale is maybe you have to make it like one click easy, like an easy button, like buy now on Amazon. Literally, it has to be like a button, right? One click easy. Two, it has to have this sort of like signaling effect, right? Like a Patagonia does or a Tesla. And three, there has to be some like financial attractiveness to it. Either it&#8217;s like really affordable or there&#8217;s potentially some alpha investing in it, right? If you look at those three ingredients, which is like financial attractiveness, potential for signaling, and it has to be easy, that&#8217;s where the idea for, hey, what if we took like climate assets such as regeneration, like soil regeneration, calpistry, like real world carbon capture? What if we kind of disguised it as the perfect digital art piece that made the world better and was a great signaling tool and has the potential to move in price over time? And that was sort of the idea of carbon offsetting NFTs. That&#8217;s kind of what we started at like two years ago. It was NFTs that fight climate change. It&#8217;s obviously been two years now, the community has grown. We&#8217;ve launched several products, but we&#8217;ve only deepened our conviction in that same core thesis that NFTs really are a great way to scale up climate action. And it&#8217;s because of these fundamentals of taking climate assets, putting them on chain, and turning it into a social tool for people.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That was all world. Thank you for that. I wanna just reiterate one last time, the three steps, the three parts of your thesis that you mentioned, you&#8217;d have social signaling, there needs to be some financial upside, maybe not financial upside, but some economic trigger. And the first one was easy to purchase or easy to use. One click easy, I love that. That&#8217;s going in the notes there, folks. You heard that, that has Amazon, that has Apple, that has any Elon Musk company written all over it. That&#8217;s exactly what you need in order to scale the shit out of a company. That&#8217;s huge. And working at the different VCs, millions and millions, that&#8217;s nonsense. Billions and billions, if not trillions of dollars, have gone into VC backed companies that are fighting climate change. Are there any particular that really get you going? Are there any areas of climate change that really get you going? I&#8217;d love if you could just say a little primer in regards to the good ones and the bad ones. There&#8217;s so many that are absolute fugazies. And many are not doing exactly what they say. They are, in my opinion, at least from what I&#8217;ve read. And again, I&#8217;m not an expert in this. So please take what I&#8217;m saying with a grain of salt. I just follow people like you who are actually in the weeds in the space on Twitter. And they&#8217;re the ones who are saying 80% of this stuff is absolute nonsense. It&#8217;s fugazies, it&#8217;s bullshit. So just give us a quick little primer on some great investments in the climate change industry right now, what the future of it looks like. Is it all about carbon credits? What do we have going on?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
First of all, the space for climate tech is massive. We&#8217;re talking about energy, we&#8217;re talking about transportation, we&#8217;re talking about construction, we&#8217;re talking about food. These are massive categories. These are trillion dollar economies in and of themselves. So the core thing, when I think about climate tech, I&#8217;m thinking about technologies that help those categories, energy, food, transportation, become net zero carbon emissions. That&#8217;s sort of how I think about climate tech. What you&#8217;re seeing today is energy has actually really come a long way. In the US and most places around the world, solar panels are cheaper than coal and fossil fuels. That only became possible in 2019. So up until 2019, even in the United States, it made more sense to open up a fossil fuel-based energy facility, like electricity facility. Today, it&#8217;s not feasible anymore. No one wants to open up fossil fuel-based electricity factories anymore because it doesn&#8217;t make economic sense. And this is a byproduct of great companies in batteries and in renewables over the last 20 years. So that&#8217;s kind of like, I&#8217;m really optimistic there. And that&#8217;s been around for a while. In food, you&#8217;re seeing a lot of companies figure out how to create plants that actually sequester more carbon. Living carbon is one of those companies, it&#8217;s a biotech company that&#8217;s figured out how to create trees. For example, they&#8217;re actually able to absorb way more CO2 than the typical tree and grow faster. That&#8217;s actually really powerful because if you can grow trees faster, for lumber, for example, you can actually reduce the amount of trees being cut for that resource. We&#8217;ll also capture more CO2 directly out of there. So there&#8217;s some really interesting companies that are figuring out how to scale up carbon capture through plants and trees and food that we&#8217;re all consuming. That&#8217;s a pretty exciting idea. Then you have like direct air carbon capture, like the Climeworks, for example, that have those like big fans, right? They&#8217;re actually capturing CO2 out of there, running on the ground. They&#8217;re geothermal caps. So taking CO2 that comes out of like exhaust pipes and then turning that into like blocks of carbon. There&#8217;s a company called Remora that&#8217;s actually doing this where you can attach like this object to a back of the tailpipe. So imagine a future where you&#8217;re driving, you know, your truck, for example, or a car that&#8217;s hard to decarbonize, like a large vehicle, and the exhaust that&#8217;s coming out of the pipe at the end is just simply being kind of back into like fossilized carbon, right? That&#8217;s not being emitted into the air. That&#8217;s a really interesting concept. I mean, dude, I can go on and on but I&#8217;m really excited by deep tech stuff that&#8217;s like touching direct air carbon capture that&#8217;s helping nature capture more carbon faster, right? And then the third one are economic incentives around carbon reduction. So like, you know, this is the type of stuff you see a lot of carbon credit companies doing on chain, right? Like figuring out ways to reintroduce carbon capture into market fundamentals, all companies emit emissions, for example. But if you can price in those negative externalities that a company already has, and Amazon and lots of companies are already doing it, if you can make that like a tax, for example, or introduce it as part of like a carbon balance, for example, I think the economy as a whole can actually move to a more regenerative state. So there&#8217;s actually a lot in there, by the way, but like I said, I can go on and on about climate tech, it&#8217;s massive.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, I totally feel you.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
I think our clothes in the future are all going to be like recycled plastic from oceans, you know? And I think it&#8217;s going to be made out of hemp or like sheep that&#8217;s highly renewable as opposed to the way tech sales are currently made.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />

You and the team published an incredible little tweet storm, couple of tweet storm, X storm. Good God. What do we even call it nowadays? You guys published some absolute fire a couple of weeks ago in regards to how enterprise companies, the big dogs, the biggest of dogs can get in to NFTs and Web3. I could rip through this myself. You can do a much better job of explaining this. What do we have to do to onboard the biggest Web2 companies into NFTs and Web3?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s a great question. And we&#8217;ve actually introduced a new corporate product ourselves recently. And that was sort of the impetus for our own inquiry into how enterprises are using NFTs. The big thing to note, really at a high level, Matt, is that NFTs are really here to stay. While consumer volume might be down, you&#8217;re seeing an increasing number of Fortune 500s actually digging deeper. And frankly, it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s less noise. I think it&#8217;s a lot easier to build things when there&#8217;s less noise. But the areas people are really excited by seem to be sort of in a few buckets. One is loyalty and rewards programs. So everyone&#8217;s trying to figure out how to reward consumers for shopping more, spending more, et cetera, within their businesses. But they need to figure out how to do it in sort of a more cultural, digital-first way. I think a lot of people are bored by points. People don&#8217;t want to create more credit cards. So long as you have your one MetaMask account, you can access the world of Web3. And maybe you have your one stop access to loyalty and rewards programs in a lot of different places. So companies are trying to really tap into this unified potential rewards platform that might exist via NFTs. That&#8217;s one really cool area. You see Lufthansa doing it with Flymore, for example. You can unlock certain unique NFT collectibles. McLaren is doing it for the games. Obviously Starbucks is doing it for coffee. So that&#8217;s sort of one layer to it. Another big layer is identity. So you don&#8217;t have any people lie on their LinkedIn, by the way. Let me just ask you this question. Do you have a LinkedIn account?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I do have LinkedIn. I never use it ever. Literally just to post about the pod and to like when my guests say, oh, had a great time on the Cryptonews Podcast. I still have a picture of my Kool Kat as my LinkedIn picture. It&#8217;s all nonsense. I don&#8217;t know when the last time you saw your LinkedIn inbox, but it is like, it&#8217;s worse than your spam folder and email. It&#8217;s the worst thing ever. I always tell people Twitter, I learn every single day. You&#8217;re a Twitter guy as well. The amount of alpha, not even alpha, just the amount of health, wealth and happiness, gold that I get on Twitter. And then I have my fun stuff like my politics, my sports. But what one was the last time I learned anything on LinkedIn? Nihar, I literally cannot tell you. I cannot tell you last time I learned one thing on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Well, you know when people do use LinkedIn, right? It&#8217;s when they&#8217;re looking for jobs. LinkedIn still, I think, is one of the best ways for job seekers and employers to sort of connect. Can you guess what percentage of job seekers lie on their LinkedIn page?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Oh, it&#8217;s gotta be hell high.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
It&#8217;s over 50%. In a platform that&#8217;s designed to help job seekers and employers connect, how can that exist as a form of truth if half the people are lying? Imagine if your resume was always verified on the blockchain through an NFT. From the moment you graduate a university, and then where the metadata was updated every single time you worked at an employer. And what if that employer left you with a review, for example, and that was also etched onto the metadata? That&#8217;s like the ultimate source of truth that can&#8217;t be replicated. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a true digital resume, a true digital resume. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
It&#8217;s part of this broader concept of identity, a true form of truth. I think LinkedIn is one area where people are starting to test the waters with digital identity, digital resumes. You also have memorabilia. Obviously, Porsche is a big one. MoMA is one. Pepsi, they all have iconic brands as it is, and they have fan base around that IP, and so they&#8217;re able to create memorabilia. People also use it for charity. Taco Bell, funny enough, has actually raised money through NFTs. Time magazine, football hype. Then you have this whole metaverse bucket, like Artifact that&#8217;s owned by Nike. Adidas has one. Those are the big buckets. It&#8217;s memorabilia, raise money for charity, identity, loyalty and rewards program, and just metaverse. Those are the big categories, and you&#8217;re seeing more and more enterprises jump into them. I think it&#8217;s because we see the underlying use case for the technology irrespective of where the markets at. That&#8217;s the thing with NFTs. You have to build in the absence of when like, you can&#8217;t just be an NFT person when the market&#8217;s really booming. You can&#8217;t just be a Tesla guy if the price keeps going up. You have to be a believer through the highs and the lows. Anyways, it&#8217;s good to see enterprises actually be that archetype. They believe in the underlying tech. They&#8217;re willing to invest in the long run, and they are seeing a few interesting use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. NFT speculation, like the get rich quick NFT days are over, which has its pros and cons, 99% pros. The only con being the fact that it, the days of actually printing money out of thin air are gone. But again, so heavy, it&#8217;s like anything else in life. You have your small window of opportunity and you got to jump on it. Just keeping on the sort of enterprise big brands from one last question on this. What needs to happen for that domino to fall for mass adoption big brands? Like is there one particular network effect or one particular catalyst or domino in your eyes that needs to happen in order for all the big dogs to jump in?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
I think there&#8217;s two things. One is, I think the payment layer actually has to become FIAT. I actually believe that. To me, it&#8217;s like a hot take.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, how&#8217;s that a hot take? I think everyone agrees with you, no?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
I think it&#8217;s too much work, man. Like if you&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Too much friction. It should be quick credit card. Apple Pay, boom, done. That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
That&#8217;s what it needs to be. Right? On the back end, you know, whether it&#8217;s a Visa or a MetaMask or a MoonPay, they can do the work on the back end to make it like crypto rails, which makes it like easily transferable and to make it global. But for the front end, the user should be able to use the cash that they already own. You know? I don&#8217;t own more than like, why would I own pounds and pesos and like unless you go to that country? That&#8217;s what crypto is kind of like saying, right? It&#8217;s like, imagine if you&#8217;re in 10 different countries, you have to like switch currencies every time you want that needs to go away. Right? I do think it needs to be FIAT on ramp onto crypto transactions. But the second thing is I actually do think like the whole concept of a wallet needs to be embedded in a browser that people already own. I actually secretly think like I&#8217;m waiting for the day that, you know, Google buys MetaMask or something and just integrates it. And all of a sudden you have like over a billion people that have access to a wallet without even knowing it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve heard that hot take. I love that.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Well, we&#8217;re all comfortable downloading plugins on our Chrome, right? Or like using these little internet widgets. It needs to be as easy as that, right? It shouldn&#8217;t need to be this whole custodial wall that you need to go download. I think it just needs to be integrated into the applications we already use. And it might happen, right? I do think this stuff will just get integrated into the browser wherever you are, right? So I don&#8217;t think there needs to be this dedicated app. As it is, getting people to download apps is hard, right? It&#8217;s never been easy. So those are the two things that I think need to happen. They need to be FIAT-based transactions. And I think it needs to be easy, wallet access embedded within your browser, embedded within your Chrome. You wouldn&#8217;t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I can&#8217;t stop thinking about that Google buying MetaMask take. You just mentioned, holy shit, that would, I&#8217;ve asked that question probably 20 times in the pod. And I&#8217;m not just going to smoke up your ass. That&#8217;s easily the best answer I&#8217;ve heard. Cause if that happens, I mean, how does a billion people getting into the arena to quote, chermoth not actually move the needle? You know, like that&#8217;s wild.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s absolutely awesome. It&#8217;s a great go to market hat. I mean, a parallel example in a Web2 was, Slack was founded well over a decade ago. I&#8217;m blanking on the exact year, but it was around the time, it was around late 2000s, right? It took them about 10 years to cross the 100 million user mark. And it&#8217;s because it was a brand new application. We were also switching from desktop to mobile right around that time. Microsoft obviously has computers in the hands of billions of people, and they have lots of enterprise contracts. When they launched Teams, they were actually able to get to that same 100 million mark in less than a year. And that&#8217;s just what, that&#8217;s a go to market hack, right? So we keep sitting here saying, we can get, you know, it&#8217;ll take 10 years to get people a MetaMask, or it can take one Google or one Microsoft to just deploy it within the existing application, and then you just have it overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t love a good moonshot every once in a while? Come on, let&#8217;s make it happen. We&#8217;ll give the Google guys a call. We are getting a little tight for time here, mate. Couple more questions and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. What is next for Ecosapiens? You guys had a very successful, I guess, third, fourth, fifth gen NFT launch a couple of weeks ago. What else do you guys have on the docket over the next couple of months, a couple of years?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, so we&#8217;re actually really leaning into our enterprise carbon-offset and collectibles. So today we actually are commissioning carbon-offset and collectibles for companies that they can put in their offices, for example, so that they can then go open addition for their all employees to be a part of that experience. We&#8217;ve done that with SELO. We do have a launch coming up with Polygon pretty soon. That&#8217;s, you can&#8217;t tell you the exact date, we&#8217;ll have more on that soon, but it has been public that we are doing something in partnership with them. So we&#8217;re going to be doing more of those, right? So expect to see us do more commission pieces for companies. We have another consumer launch coming up late this year, early next year, and that&#8217;ll be sort of our classic OG carbon-offset and collectible for individuals. We&#8217;re also working on a new, you know, back to Chrome integrations. We also are quietly working behind the scenes on our own sort of Chrome application. And it&#8217;s early days there, but there&#8217;s a story where, you know, you just shopped the web, the eco web, and you&#8217;re rewarded with our collectibles. And that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re pretty happy and working on and we&#8217;ll be able to share more later. But, you know, our goal is, you know, make climate action easy, accessible, impactful, right? And the only way you do that is if your collectibles are offered anywhere on the web. And that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re continuing to chip away at, whether it&#8217;s directly from us, right? Whether you&#8217;re buying them directly for us, or your company&#8217;s perhaps giving you to them, or maybe you&#8217;re just shopping on the web, or just browsing on the web, and you&#8217;re offered them at the checkout line, or even through a Chrome plugin, we want to be everywhere. And that&#8217;s sort of what you can expect from us over the next year, really.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. We need one or two hot takes before you go. The Gen Zers love the hot takes on socials. And I know you got a bunch of them. I bet you you have dozens of fire ones. Most of them probably so spicy we can&#8217;t even let them fly on the pod, mind you. This is a not kid friendly pod. It&#8217;s wearing is allowed, crazy hot takes are allowed, but Nihar, before you go, you gotta give me a couple.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
All right. Well, it&#8217;s been a little bit over a year since Elon Musk took over Twitter, took it private, changed the name to X, fuck with the algorithm, brought on an amazing advertising executive, right? To go become the new CEO to bring the big bucks, add bucks back in. I think within the next year, Elon Musk will take Twitter back to being public, but not through the traditional IPO market. I think he&#8217;s gonna release Xcoin and it&#8217;ll get back what it will convert into a token. That token, the currency by which all ads are transacted on Twitter, and it&#8217;s gonna be the same form of currency that creators get paid on within Twitter, or X rather. So I do think X Twitter just became x.com. I think it&#8217;s gonna become X protocol the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What chain? Do you have a take for any chain or is the inner build a chain?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
It&#8217;s going to be XChain.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
XChain. So that vision from like late 1990s will happen.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, seriously. That&#8217;s, I mean, if you really think about what Elon, it&#8217;s the everything app, right? Which means it has to have its own infrastructure, its own payments. And we already know, you know, Elon Musk loves crypto. I think this is a very natural way for there to be liquidity and it&#8217;s just like the currency of the whole platform, right? Data that&#8217;s transacted on Xcoin, advertising dollars that are transacted on Xcoin. I think it&#8217;s all gonna happen on X.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I like that. I mean, you can&#8217;t really bet against that guy. Like, you&#8217;d be, it&#8217;s just naive too. I love that one.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
It&#8217;s almost like immoral to humanity, seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It is. Give us one more and then we go. Any New York versus San Frans takes?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Okay, San Francisco is definitely back. It&#8217;s been back. Dude I think I so like fun story. There&#8217;s a someone that we share an office with who, you know, is like a young crypto founder and not that I was snooping, but I happened to come across like a receipt and it was like vegan chili and green juice, you know, like 22 year old crypto founder. That&#8217;s like the meal of choice. That&#8217;s like, you get that left and right in San Francisco, you know, I think you&#8217;re going to see a lot of like young crypto founders go like, do AI meets crypto in San Francisco? Cause that&#8217;s the only place you can do it. I mean, where else can you be vegan? Do AI do crypto anonymously and still be cool. It, there&#8217;s no other place. Not really. I think San Francisco is cool. And, I mean, dude, people have written San Francisco as a bituary, like the 10 times over the last 50 years and it still comes back. Same with New York. Right. 9/11, New York&#8217;s done. You know, God bless. 2008, New York&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s back. I don&#8217;t know. COVID, It&#8217;s back.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />

<p>Earlier on Thursday, a New York jury found FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried guilty of defrauding his customers and lenders, concluding a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/prosecution-eviscerates-sbf-during-closing-arguments-he-built-a-pyramid-of-deceit.htm">five-week trial</a>.</p>
<p>In a unanimous verdict which the judge said came in at 7:40 pm, the jury found Bankman-Fried guilty of all of the seven charges he had faced.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bankman-Fried’s defense attorney Mark Cohen said the disgraced FTX founder respects the jury’s decision but will continue to fight to prove his innocence.</p>
<p>The judge marked out the 28<sup>th</sup> of March 2024 as a potential sentencing date.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s charges include 1) wire fraud and 2) conspiracy to commit wire fraud against FTX customers, 3) wire fraud and 4) conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Alameda’s lenders, 5) conspiracy to commit securities fraud against FTX’s investors, 6) conspiracy to commit commodities fraud against FTX’s customers and, finally, 7) conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>
<p>A number of former FTX executives, including the company’s CTO Gary Wang, Head of Engineering Nishad Singh and former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, testified against Bankman-Friend.</p>
<p>They all said they are pleading guilty to charges relating to their role in the FTX collapse, but all argued that they had taken direction from Bankman-Fried, who oversaw the fraudulent operation.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto’s Biggest Fraudster</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SBF could easily go down for decades.</p>
<p>Investors and users lost billions when the exchange abruptly collapsed just over one year ago, following a bank-run that forced it to halt withdrawals.</p>
<p>The exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm">declared bankruptcy on the 11<sup>th</sup> of November 2022</a>, while <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas-following-formal-notification-by-united-states.htm">Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested around one month later</a>.</p>
<p>FTX said earlier this year that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftx-says-8-9-billion-in-customer-funds-are-missing-c232f684">hole in its balance was nearly $9 billion</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that Sam Bankman-Friend had funneled FTX customer/investor funds to bail out his failing hedge fund Alameda, which over the course of 2022 had lost billions amid bad crypto bets and poor risk management.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried’s guilt gives his the unwanted crown of being crypto’s biggest-ever fraudster.</p>
<p>Other notable scammers include the creators of the OneCoin and BitConnect ponzi schemes, which cost investors $2.4 and $4 billion respectively.</p>

<p>As the tech world undergoes a paradigm shift from Web2 to Web3, developers and companies are navigating uncharted waters in a quest to transition smoothly into the future of decentralized internet &#8211; one of the champions leading this transition is <a href="https://blog.tenderly.co/author/bogdan-habic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bogdan Habic</a>, the Co-Founder and CTO of Tenderly, a <a href="https://tenderly.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-stack infrastructure solutions provider</a> powering Web3 development teams across the globe.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with CryptoNews.com, Bogdan delves deep into the intricacies of this transition, the pivotal role of infrastructure, and how Tenderly is pre-emptively addressing the scalability quandaries of the burgeoning blockchain universe.</p>
<h2><strong>From Web2 to Web3: Deciphering the Intricacies of a Paradigm Shift</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“Transitioning from Web2 to Web3 presents a unique set of challenges for developers,” begins <a href="https://github.com/BogdanHabic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bogdan</a>, shedding light on the intricate journey of evolving paradigms.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Web3, the veil of security through obscurity is lifted, introducing a new dimension of programmability of value, which can be quite daunting initially.</p>
<p>“Web3 operates in a more constrained runtime environment, which might resonate with embedded systems programmers but could be a hurdle for others who are used to more flexible environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where Tenderly’s “TX preview” or simulations come into play, providing a risk-free environment for both newcomers and seasoned experts to experiment, test, and <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/take-your-smart-contract-development-to-the-next-level-with-tenderly-5fe58d2fa7d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refine</a> their decentralized applications (dapps) and transactions,&#8221; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/bogdan-habic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bogdan</a> explains.</p>
<p>“Developers can gain insights into asset transfers, gas and resource consumption, transaction success probabilities, and much more, all without making any on-chain commitments.”</p>
<p>&#8220;This enhances the security and predictability of the dapps, significantly improving both the user and developer experience, and making the transition from Web2 to Web3 smoother and more intuitive.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Pillars of Progress: How Tenderly Infrastructure Is Shaping the Future of Decentralized Ecosystems</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

<p>In the context of Tenderly’s impressive funding trajectory, which last year saw the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/02/blockchain-infra-startup-tenderly-raises-40m-after-seeing-500x-yoy-revenue-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firm raise $40m in funding amid 500% YoY</a> revenue growth, Bogdan emphasizes the intrinsic role of infrastructure in fostering expansive Web3 adoption against a backdrop of a general downtrend in Web3 start-up investments.</p>
<p>“Infrastructure plays a pivotal role in the evolution and adoption of Web3 technologies. It’s essential to have a solid foundation to support and nurture the growth of ground-breaking dApps,” he explains.</p>
<p>&#8221; It&#8217;s akin to a delicate balance, almost like the chicken and the egg dilemma &#8211; there is a transition happening slowly toward a dapp-centric focus. However, the innovation in dapps is heavily reliant on the robustness of the underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tenderly’s holistic platform integrates the best of Web2’s refined developer experiences with Web3’s innovative possibilities, acting as a bridge between the two worlds.</p>
<p>“Tools like our Simulations and TestNets embody this philosophy, offering something that isn&#8217;t possible in Web2 while being rooted in the best practices of both worlds,” Bogdan elaborates.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s almost like our Trojan horse, subtly introducing Web2 developers to the vast potentials of Web3, facilitating a smoother transition, and encouraging broader participation in the decentralized ecosystems.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always, coming in hot from Mexico. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have one of the OGs, not one of the OG of the move to earn industry on the show today, Oleg Fomenko, the Co-Founder of Sweat Economy, which is establishing the movement economy by realizing the value of physical activities and rewarding all forms of movement. Nine years prior to the conception of Sweat Economy, Oleg Co-Founded Sweatcoin, which we all know and love, a digital currency backed by physical movement with the Sweat Economy ecosystem. He has more than 15 years of experience as an entrepreneur. He founded bloom.fm and spearheaded a 16 million pound raise, attracting 1.2 million registered users in the UK and offering the world&#8217;s first one pound per month subscription service. Again, this is well ahead of the game. He also has a wealth of experience in the areas of propositions, strategy development, consultancy, brand management, you name it, a true serial entrepreneur and is incredibly interested in areas of health, civil rights, social actions, human rights, economic empowerment and education. I am super friggin pumped to have this guy on the show. Oleg, welcome to show my friend, pumped to have you on. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
Wow. Thank you very much, Matt. It&#8217;s an absolute pleasure being here. I can tell you PR agencies can certainly write some stuff. I&#8217;m like, holy moly, that&#8217;s me. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love it. Yeah. I always. You gotta ask the PR firm to send over a fire bio, right? Cause I can go and I can do my research and look over, but 9 times out of 10, they&#8217;re gonna send me something better. But yeah, that was pretty darn good by them. But look man, super pumped to have you on. This is one of these episodes that has so much real world utility. And I&#8217;m very fortunate to have some incredible guests, not some, all of my guests that come on are absolutely incredible. People who are multitudes smarter than myself. And I get to learn from them. Most of the time though, it&#8217;s just in Web3. There&#8217;s very little application to the Web2 world or real world for that matter. We sort of live in this magic internet economy and you are spearheading the move to earn movement, which I absolutely love. I am a huge walker. I like to run, I love to walk. I think walking is one of the most unrated activities you can do on the planet. And to get paid to walk is absolutely brilliant. I can&#8217;t wait to get in this Sweat Economy. Before then though, we gotta set the stage. You gotta let our listeners know a little bit about who you are growing up. Tell us some good Russia stories. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re a hockey fan at all. I live in bleed hockey. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen Putin play or Fedorov or any of those guys, but big hockey guy, tell us a little bit about yourself and some entrepreneurial stories. And then we&#8217;ll get into the Sweatcoin stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
I was born in Russia and yeah, as a Russian kid, I did play hockey. You had to, so the way it comes with it, with the territory, you gotta do cross-country skiing and playing hockey in winter and you walk and run in summer and play football. So, was huge fan of hockey, especially when Russia and Canada started going so really hard onto each other. Those games that were absolutely incredible. You know, kind of both from hockey perspective, but also on the, you know, kind of glove. Boxing perspective, it was, you know, absolutely superb time, very entertaining. But I did play very long time ago. 1995, I&#8217;ve already left Russia and has been living, you know, kind of all over the world ever since. I looked for the first time at Bitcoin in 2011 and absolutely loved it. But I was stupid enough not to actually buy a few thousand Bitcoin, they were 20 cents back then. Well, you know, there are plenty of stories. I&#8217;m sure circulating around, but I really got hooked on technology. And I really loved the fact that this was the first time that I touched technology that was so intricately linked with psychology. You know, I&#8217;ve never encountered this before because normally when you build tech, you always have to deal with all each cases and make sure that, you know, kind of nothing ever falls over. And here is the thing that basically says if more than 50% of participants are malicious, then the whole thing falls over. And I&#8217;m like, wow, that&#8217;s actually really cool because it brings psychology of large groups with tech and completely changes dynamics and sort of puts technology in a completely different role in the world.  Anyway, you know, enough philosophy. I really was very keen to figure out how to work with blockchain and, you know, kind of build around blockchain tech and opportunity presented itself in 2014 when I went for a run with my co-founder and I quit even around 5K. And three years before, I was climbing some of the highest mountains in the world. And we started talking, how is that possible? What&#8217;s going on? How do you lose fitness so quickly? And, you know, one thing after another, you know, sort of digging behavioral science and psychology, we realized that 100% of people in the world are frustrated with the level of physical activity. You know, they always want more. They want to be more active. They want to find more time. And when you encounter a problem that is so universal, there is a hint that there is an explanation there that might be a lot simpler than what&#8217;s on the surface. And on what&#8217;s on the surface, people complain about motivation, lack of money, lack of time, lack of, you know, kind of energy, you know, weather, you name it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Lack of incentives.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
You know, they suddenly complained about that. But what happens is that if you start digging this deep, you realize that the reason why we&#8217;re not as active as we want to be is very simple, because nature doesn&#8217;t want us to be active. Nature didn&#8217;t build us to be active. Nature built us and optimized us to survival, which means preservation of calories rather than spending on them. Right? So our ancestors wouldn&#8217;t run unless there is a mammoth on the horizon and there is food and you need to kill it so that the tribe has something to eat. Or Sabretooth tiger is about to make meal out of you. Otherwise you just sit and preserve those calories. Nobody would be doing pull-ups push-ups or training around and looking good. That would result in squandering of calories. And by the time mammoth shows up, everyone&#8217;s dead because they, you know, nature has really made it adamant that this is the way we should be behaving and it&#8217;s very hard to bite nature. However, nature also gave us a hint how to overcome this. And, you know, the shortcut or the solution is called instant gratification. So when we realize this, we kind of went, huh, so what if we create an instant gratification mechanism in exchange for every step that you take would that change people&#8217;s behavior? And this can be done with technology. So that&#8217;s how the ideas with Queen came about. We launched the app and we realized that it does subconsciously change people&#8217;s behavior. So it doesn&#8217;t make you go to gym more often. It doesn&#8217;t make you go for a run, but it makes you go for a little bit longer run. It makes you skip that stop on the bus. It makes you take a longer walk with your dog. It makes you take more steps on the daily basis because it is subconsciously starting to trigger those switches in the opposite direction. And nature tells you, well, it&#8217;s gainful activity. Therefore, you&#8217;re starting to change your behavior. Amazing result. We&#8217;ve done medical grade research in the UK with the University of Warwick and we learned that our users were 20% more active after installing our app than before. They loved proposition because, these guys do what they pay you to walk. It&#8217;s crazy that can&#8217;t work. So a lot of people were installing app just to prove that they must be doing something bad. They must be selling data. Yeah, important point we never did. We don&#8217;t do it and we never will sell data because we don&#8217;t have to and we believe that ethically it&#8217;s a wrong thing to do. And also legally we&#8217;re a European company and we are on the GDPR, which is the most draconian privacy protecting legal framework. So we are happy that we can&#8217;t and we don&#8217;t want to. But yeah, that&#8217;s a sort of side course. And then we just launched when you&#8217;re kind of into a lot of geographies and we started getting, you know, millions of users. Oh, important. Name, Sweat Queen, the original name. That suggests that we want to be on blockchain but we couldn&#8217;t. Bitcoin was too slow and too expensive to build on. Ethereum was too early. We met with Vitalic in 2015. It was just research grade project back then. And we had to launch centralized, but we thought that six months to a year there would be a great next blockchain coming in and we&#8217;ll just migrate very quickly. It took nearly nine years for blockchain tech to get robust enough and fast enough to support our scale. And we launched Sweat Economy last year on NEAR. I saw that, you know, you&#8217;re wearing a T-shirt. NEAR was sort of an amazing tech, really like founding team. And by then, we already had more than 120 million users, and it was too late to move the whole Sweatcoin ecosystem onto blockchain because imagine that over nine years, you already used to this thing behaving in a certain way, and you already build expectations. And we had to create a separate token, Sweat, and non-custodial wallet, Sweat wallets, and that went live last September in many geographies outside of the US. And we very quickly learned that US residents, US users of Sweatcoin, were not particularly happy about that decision. They made themselves known that, you know, why are we not able to walk into crypto? And the volume of these complaints was huge. And our community outside of the US was also very much supportive of going live in the US in the biggest ever governance vote in Web3&#8217;s history. 380 ,000 people cast their vote to go into the US and allocate a budget, which, you know, we did. So on 17th of October, or this is today, 19th, two days ago, we went live in the US, and we finally can say that, you know, pretty much 90% of the world countries now are both in Sweatcoin and in Sweat wallet, which means that you can literally walk into thrift shelf. I believe that you should be able to see that. So that&#8217;s basically the story.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What a start, Oleg. That was absolute fuego. That was nothing but fire. So many different ways we can take this. Let&#8217;s just keep going on cron order here. You just brought it up going into the US. That&#8217;s absolutely massive. It&#8217;s the most powerful economy in the world. For a good reason, the US is going to US. You know what they do. I could be wrong here, but I believe the Ripple ruling had a massive emphasis, a huge emphasis in your guys&#8217; ability to participate in the US. Why did it take so long? Why was it such a shit show? Obviously, everyone knows that they are the kings and queens of putting up walls and borders everywhere except from Mexico to US. But everywhere when it comes to anything tech related, they love putting forks in the fire and turning it into a shit show. And that obviously impacted you guys as well. Talk to me about the Ripple ruling and how that allowed you guys to jump into the US market.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
Yeah, I wouldn&#8217;t say that it was the main reason. The main reason was use a base of Sweatcoin users that were demanding that they should be able to walk into crypto. And our worldwide community understanding very well that actually growing the community and becoming bigger is beneficial for everybody. I would say that XRP ruling was sort of one of those solidifying moments where you all of a sudden need realize that, you know what the time has come that we know that it will happen, but that sort of precipitated their decision because we realized, and it is extremely important to emphasize this, that the reason why regulations exist in the US is to protect American investors from rugs, ivory, whatever. And we realized that we as a project, we&#8217;re coming with a completely different sort of goal objective sentiment and also history because unlike a lot of other crypto projects, we&#8217;ve been around for nine years. We already know what we&#8217;re doing and we have a Web2 business in the US. And our objective is to make the world more physically active. And we do it extremely well. And we know that by extending the business into Web3 we bring in more behavior change, we&#8217;re shaving more inches of that proverbial waste of a nation. And let&#8217;s face it, the United States is not the leanest and the thinnest population in the world. And yeah, to be honest, it&#8217;s everywhere right now, but we do need to have every single bit of help to be more physically active, earn more calories and can it be in a better shape that we can get? So we are coming with that in mind and we cannot even physically cause damages to American investors because they earn our token by walking and burning calories. So when you realize this, kind of while risks always exist, I think it would be very strange if we were sort of singled out as a project that is actually kind of causing damage and is doing stuff that needs to be stopped. So we thought about it and which kind of went, okay, you know what? We can&#8217;t really continue collecting such a huge user base that we already have. And frankly, I got tired of trying to explain to people why they are not treated like everybody else. And frankly, personally, you know this, like if you are getting worse deal than others, it&#8217;s unpleasant. I don&#8217;t wanna be that person. Absolutely, and I feel that it&#8217;s just so unfair on US residents that this was going on. So we just needed to fix it. And it&#8217;s literally massive sort of holder off my shoulders that we are now there, that anyone who wants to literally walk into crypto can do it. But actually I would like to take a step aside from kind of XRP and tell you that once we started doing the research into crypto and our proposition, we realized that there are two reasons why mass market audience is struggling to engage. And that&#8217;s the reason why Web3 is not growing as fast as I believe it should have been over the last few years. And the reasons are user experience and language. So we&#8217;re so used and I&#8217;m sure that you know your crypto. This 24 words that we need to write down and then there&#8217;s a big text. Don&#8217;t even take a screenshot. And so people are really kind of feeling like, oh my God, this is too complicated and it&#8217;s too wondrous or it&#8217;s too scary. And there&#8217;s also language, you know, huddle, biddle, finality and all that, you know, staking people just kind of go like, you know, I don&#8217;t understand. I read the sentence, I read words, but I don&#8217;t know the meaning that is really emanating. And we&#8217;ve taken that on board. And over the last many years, we learned how to build really slick, simple, you know, very straightforward applications that just work, Sweatcoin. We took that experience and we built really cool app, Sweat Wallet. If you go into App Store right now, you&#8217;ll see that we have a rating of 4.8 with tens of thousands of ratings. So, you know, can be really good app. And the other thing that people always were citing as a barriers and issue was even if you must have that opsec and you went in, the first step that you&#8217;d always have to take is buy some crypto. And that means you pull your card and you have to buy some, but typically it doesn&#8217;t make sense to buy less than a few hundred dollars worth. And all of a sudden you kind of go, ooh, you know, yesterday they wrote about 600 million being drained from here, 320 million being drained from there. People kind of go like, oh my God, no way, my lot. It&#8217;s going to be my money that&#8217;s going to disappear. And they bulk and they take a step back and they kind of go, you know, I don&#8217;t want to risk that much cash. They literally want to get in there, learn the ropes and understand how it works. And then they can participate. And this is exactly our proposition, walk into crypto. You move your legs, you earn your tokens. Is it going to make your, you know, kind of crazy rich and you know, you&#8217;re going to be able to stop working? No, we never promised that, unlike some other projects that, you know, kind of were making crazy claims. But you can actually learn crypto tokens and you can learn ropes. You can understand how to transfer, how to receive, you can understand how to state. You can understand how Web3 gaming works. You can understand how trading for other crypto token works. And all of a sudden you&#8217;re going to go, oh my God, this, you know, I am using Web3. I am in it. I&#8217;m experiencing this. And all of a sudden you can start engaging with other protocols, other chains and potentially putting in your money because you are no noob anymore and you feel a lot more confident. That&#8217;s basically what we do. Make you walk more and be seated and healthier while learning the ropes and understanding how Web3 works. So health and wealth go well together.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100% health, wealth, and happiness. That&#8217;s my motto. Oleg, like you are absolutely on fire and we got to give a huge shout out to our sponsor to the show, PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to get into the move to earn industry and how Sweat Economy will overcome the classic inability of the move to earn coins, companies, and projects, their ability to succeed. So far we haven&#8217;t seen any, but if I&#8217;m a betting man and I am a betting man, it&#8217;s gonna be you guys. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, the longtime friends of the Cryptonews Podcast and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Pod. Of course, we love these guys as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. PrimeXBT is also running an exclusive promotion for listeners of the Cryptonews Podcast. You can use the promo code <strong>CRYPTONEWS50</strong>, that&#8217;s CRYPTONEWS50, all one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50 to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with Oleg. Let&#8217;s get into the elephant in the room here. I&#8217;ve told my friends about Sweatcoin, I told my friends about Steppen. I was on Steppen, many of us were on Steppen. Again, the only similarity you guys have is that you&#8217;re both in the move to earn game. Well, I mean, they&#8217;re not really around anymore, but they were in the move to earn game. You guys literally are the move to earn game. You guys pioneered this shit. What everyone always asks me when I tell them about this, they always go, Matt, tell me about some cool DeFi applications. Tell me about some cool things in crypto. And I bring up things like, hey, a couple of weeks ago, I had a buddy who reached out, talking crypto, do you have any cool podcast guests coming up? And I&#8217;m like, well, if I tell him about DeFi Company One or ZK Tech Company Y, he doesn&#8217;t give a shit. But I was like, yeah, you know what? Actually, this super cool dude Oleg&#8217;s coming on. He&#8217;s the Founder and CEO of this company called Sweat Economy. And you&#8217;re a big walker. You love running. You run marathons. You literally get paid to run and walk. It&#8217;s pretty sweet. He goes, how does he pay me? Where does the money come from? So I&#8217;m going to throw it over to you because I&#8217;m sure this is not, I&#8217;m sure. This is the elephant in the room. Everyone wants to know, how does this whole economy work? On the outside looking in, it&#8217;s quite simple. People take their left leg, they put it in front of the right leg, and they get paid. And like you said, it&#8217;s not going to make you rich. Even if you&#8217;re running a marathon a day, you&#8217;re not going to be able to retire. But it&#8217;s not about that. It&#8217;s about giving you a very small piece of the pie. And in return, you get to participate in a really cool economy, get a little bit healthier, a little bit wealthier, and learn about Web3, learn about crypto. It&#8217;s wins, wins across the board. But I want to throw the ball over to your court. Tell me how the economy actually works. Where&#8217;s the money that you guys give? Where does that come from? Give me the whole nine yards here.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
There is a lot to unpack there. But you know where I&#8217;ll start? I&#8217;ll start with three steps back, because it&#8217;s always useful when there is an analogy, something that brings stuff to life, right? And there is an economy that is sort of XX to earn that has been, well, actually, there are two. There is one that has been going for thousands of years, and we&#8217;re so used to it, we don&#8217;t even think about it in the concept of XX to earn. And then there is one that was built by humanity over the course of the last hundred and fifty years to humongous size. The first one is work to earn, right? I mean, we all understand the concept and, you know, we&#8217;re all in it. The other one, the next one is pay attention to earn, or in other words, we call this attention economy. By some estimate, it is an industry of seven trillion dollars in size. Now, let&#8217;s unpack how does it work? I pay attention. A company gets the value of that attention that the third party advertiser pays them. And then that company gives them a sliver of that value in the shape of three products. And, you know, this product is making me spend more and more attention so that the company makes more money. And that&#8217;s how we have attention economy generating this big tech. And the reason why they&#8217;re so wealthy, this company, is because they&#8217;re giving us tiny little sliver of that value that they receive for your attention. Now, let&#8217;s unpack parallels between attention and physical activity. Both are useful and essential to you. Every bit of knowledge, every meeting of a person, every new transaction, or anything starts with you paying attention. That&#8217;s the value and the utility that you get. Physical activity, you are the primary beneficiary of physical activity, keeps you in a better physical shape. It helps you to stay in a mental health shape as well. It lengthens your life. It extends your health span. And it also makes you happier, reduces absenteeism, increases productivity. So, you know, it&#8217;s amazingly valuable to you. There are also third parties, like advertisers, in case of attention, that are willing to pay for your physical activity. Healthcare providers, insurers, employers, ultimately countries, because if you&#8217;re physically active, you put less pressure on healthcare costs. And you live longer, therefore you generate more tax revenue all the time. So, it is big business. And what matters most is both attention and physical activity, us cars, that are unlimited. You know, you can&#8217;t have an unlimited amount of attention and you can&#8217;t have an unlimited amount of physical activity. So, why would we not have a movement economy or physical activity economy very much akin to attention economy? Especially if we have this new blockchain technology where we can tokenize and actually turn, track and verify physical activity into a token that you earn, as opposed to mean getting all the value and giving you a tiny sliver of it in the shape of three products. This value exchange is going to make you go like, wow, okay, now I&#8217;m earning from my physical activity, makes you even more physically active, that creates more wealth in the world that again you earn. And that pushes us to create quite a lot of wealth because, you know, I already mentioned, there are a lot of entities that are benefiting from increasing the amount of physical activity in the world. In the US, average person walks 3,000 steps a day. That&#8217;s more than three times less than what, I mean, we have this data. In Europe, it&#8217;s 5,000, so we&#8217;re a million miles away from getting even 10,000 that is recommended, you know, on a daily basis. So, we can create an immense amount of wealth. And our thesis is, if attention is $7 trillion, seven times the total size of crypto, I bet you that movement economy will be bigger in size because it&#8217;s healthcare cost reduction, productivity increase, absolutely decrease, health span increase, higher amount of economic activity, etc. And why would it be less than $70 trillion? I don&#8217;t know the time horizon, but with the advent of technology, it&#8217;s certainly not going to take us 150 years to build this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Me playing devil&#8217;s advocate here, or like my only point in being the devil here would be the barrier to entry and the friction, right? Where it&#8217;s like for me to, for the movement economy to not be as big as the attention economy. Cause for the attention economy, I just pick up my phone and boom, I&#8217;m participating. But for the movement economy, actually I need to get my ass out of the chair and move. That&#8217;s my only thing. I do agree with you. It can be just as big, but that&#8217;s my only downfall.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
But everyone is moving already. It&#8217;s not that you need to fundamentally change your life. That&#8217;s what I started with, you know, and the nature plays districts on us. Everyone takes steps per day. You are not fundamentally doing anything different. You are just extending the period in which you are physically active. That is extremely easy to do. I&#8217;m not telling you you need to start going to your gym. That is a radical change. What we are telling you is every step is worth something. And all of a sudden, miraculously, you start putting one foot in front of another more times per day. That&#8217;s all we want. And the barrier to entry, the app is free. It does not consume your battery and you are getting paid to walk. Now, after we finish sort of this, you know, we are working on this analogy, which paints a very different picture from what a lot of people think about need to earn. We are building moving into Convay. We are creating sweat as a tokenized physical activity. In the future, I don&#8217;t want people to talk about, you know, sweat has increased price, decreased price. I&#8217;d like to have a headline that says, physical activity pumped 20% last week on the release of the recent obesity data. That&#8217;s the stuff that we are going for because physical activity has value. Everyone knows when we say that, but when you ask how much, everyone just kind of goes, but if something has value, it has to have tangible financial value. Let&#8217;s create it, let&#8217;s make it tradable and let&#8217;s figure out how much humanity is willing to pay for physical activity. They in and out very much like attention because we now know how much attention is worth. Let&#8217;s arrive to that answer in Movement Economy. Now, where does money come from? Very simple answer. Your moving has value and your attention as a physical person has incredible value as well. If you health, fitness, sports, vanity, fashion, makeup, dog accessories, healthy feed supplements, brands, talking to physically active people is fishing in the pond where you know all your users are because their mindset is already in the right direction. And you can target them extremely precisely. If you wanna target people who just started the journey, you put low price and all of a sudden you have tens of millions of people that can afford the product. If you wanna target people like yourselves, the athletes, you put high price and not many people will have those balances. So all of a sudden, you are dealing with the audience that you know is right customer, you can precisely target them and you also give them these products in a very different environment where they&#8217;re gagging, they&#8217;re interested in spending and getting your product as opposed to being interrupted with some advertising where they go, you know what, I was trying to chat to Matt and this video popped up and you know, again, it interrupted me, right? It&#8217;s a completely different mindset. So we are, you know, kind of, we, over the last nine years, nine years ago when I was telling the story, people were like, huh? What the hell are you talking about? This is a charity. You&#8217;re planning to pay people to walk. What kind of business is that? Right? Right now, especially after multiple years of us not just being sustainable and not just being growing but also being profitable, people are starting to get onto this. I&#8217;m like, oh yeah, I can understand how this works. So third parties are paying a lot of money to get in front of you and engage with you as a user. There are also third parties that are paying for your physical activity. We have a big contract in the United Kingdom with National Health Service and HHS to make people diagnosed with diabetes syndrome more active. If you diagnose with diabetes syndrome, you have six months within which you have to change your diet and your lifestyle. To change diet is easy, lifestyle is hard. That&#8217;s where we come in. The adherence in the previous program was 26%. It is in excess of 80% with our participation. And if you can stop people from becoming diabetic, you make them live longer, you grow quality of life because they don&#8217;t have to deal with insulin and constant checks. It&#8217;s absolutely incredible. And live along the huge cost that society bears by having another person who&#8217;s got serious medical condition and needs constant attention and support. So it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s happening. Everyone understands that pieces are starting to fall into place, but we can shave. I believe factor 10 in terms of trying to create the economy in comparison to attention economy by having blockchain because we can talk about physical activity. We can turn it into liquid asset. We can make it easily exchangeable from one party to another and tradeable independently without any party is able to influence.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. The reason why I have to play devil&#8217;s advocate and be the devil in the room here is because again, when people hear such an incredible value proposition like Sweatcoins, they are going to say and Sweat Economies. They&#8217;re going to say it sounds too good to be true. The only other thing we need to touch on is the data privacy, more specifically data privacy in the fitness industry. And when I&#8217;ve been asked about Sweatcoin and Sweat Economy in particular, your singular data, your own data is not being sold to anyone. When someone like NHS in Britain partners with you guys, they&#8217;re getting the data set as a whole. They are not getting anyone&#8217;s individual data. I&#8217;d love if you could just speak upon data privacy in the fitness industry as a whole and how you guys are protecting your users&#8217; data.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
So as I said, we never transferred or sold data. We don&#8217;t transfer or sell data now and we never will. And we&#8217;ve been asked plenty of times, especially insurance companies, that really wanted for their models. But you know what? Genuinely it feels like shooting out, if we were to consider this, that would be like shooting ourselves in the foot. Our objective is to make the world more physically active. And for that we need trust of hundreds of millions, billions of people. And selling data is, it feels like a dirty trick. It should not be practiced by any business. And it just really enrages me when I hear that businesses even got hacked and they were not taking care of the data enough so that my data got stolen. Leave along when they were willingly transferring it. And as I mentioned, this is one of the reasons why we keep all the data in Europe. Because that means that it is governed by the GPR framework. And we legally, even if anybody in the business were to consider it, legally we just wouldn&#8217;t be able to do any of this shit. So this never happened. And the reason for it is because, as I mentioned, we have really robust business models. Businesses pay to us, advertisers pay to us. And we also have premium subscription. And these three revenue streams work really well in Web2. In Web3 we have additional revenue streams because all of a sudden you have your own asset where you can charge your keys for transferring stuff. And in charge of trading, our Sweat hero game is also generating revenues for us. You know, it&#8217;s a battle and company charges battle fee. And this is not going into our pocket. This is going into a revenue pot. And if this revenue is in Sweat, the community votes on what to do with it. And historically they&#8217;ve been voting to burn it. So remove it from circulating supply. If this revenue is in other tokens in Fiat, we spend half of our profit on buying tokens on an open market. So this money effectively goes back to token holders. Web3 is incredibly flexible and very innovative space that represents more revenue opportunities than even Web2. Which is why from July this year we managed to become deflationary. As I mentioned, this nine years we&#8217;ve been spending, you know, kind of not just learning the ropes of move to earn. We also built sustainable businesses that were scaling and that were profitable. We took this into Web3 and profitability in Web3 is deflationary nature of your token economics. What does it mean? At the end of the month, our circulating supply of tokens is lower than at the end of the previous month. So that&#8217;s what we were able to achieve. And the reason for it is the fact that we&#8217;re paying a lot of attention to token economics, to token things, to revenue generation and making sure that we are not just telling you story, but we&#8217;re really focusing on building robust business and value for token holders.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Oleg you&#8217;ve been on fire today mate. I&#8217;m having too much fun here. I absolutely love this. One last topic, because I think we&#8217;ve covered almost everything here, just as sort of the gamification of the fitness industry as a whole. One thing that genuinely, I don&#8217;t want to say grinds my gears, that pisses me off a little, I have an Apple Watch. Is it a Rolex? Is it a Audemars Piguet? Is it a Patek Philippe? No, it&#8217;s not. But you know what? The reason why I like my Apple Watch is it gamifies health. I&#8217;m a very active guy. I&#8217;m fortunate to be in pretty good shape. I owe part of that to my parents who were very, who put such an emphasis on always being active and moving. When I was young, they put me in a bunch of sports. They gave me the opportunity to become a, you know, a physically fit human being. The reason why I have this Apple Watch on right now is it makes things fun, you know? It&#8217;s like, oh, if my ass is in the chair for 50 minutes on the hour, like it is right now in one minute, you know, we&#8217;re at the 50 minute mark right now. I&#8217;m going to get a little notification. Hey, time to get up. It&#8217;s just good little things like that. On the flip side, you have people going, what kind of human are you if you need a piece of technology to motivate you? It&#8217;s like, look, I would still get 20,000 steps a day. I would still be an absolute specimen without the Apple Watch, but it makes it fun for me. It makes it more interesting. It makes it cool. And it turns it into a game. Life&#8217;s a big, darn game. And if you can create many games out of life, you&#8217;re on the road to success. What do you have to say to the haters out there who are like, ah, who needs a friggin app in order to motivate them? Because for me, it&#8217;s a big old FU. I think it&#8217;s, I love it. I&#8217;m all for it. I&#8217;m all for health tech. And I think it&#8217;s going to really help us become a fitter, healthier, happier and wealthier society.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
Hmm. It&#8217;s a big topic for me. I was planning to have a TEDx talk on the topic of manipulation, because what you are talking about is, is it okay to manipulate somebody? And for quite a lot of people, they feel that unless it my sort of intrinsic drives and it somehow came out of me, it is unacceptable. You know, when my watch tells me to stand up, or when somebody tells you to do something, then it&#8217;s sort of an oppression and it&#8217;s manipulation, or it&#8217;s somebody else trying to change my behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What about the intent? If the intention is good, who gives a shit? You know what I mean? This thing is here to make me fitter. Who cares. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
Exactly. Now, that is precisely the talk, you know, kind of the story of my talk because my first ever memory is I am two and a half years of age and I see these spaces. One of them is my mom. Another one is highly concerned looking doctor that, you know, kind of somehow persuades me to swallow this liquid because it was very sweet. And apparently I told this to my mom and she said, oh, yeah, no, that was, you know, you had a temperature and they called it you were dead and you needed to get humongous quantity of this. I don&#8217;t remember the temperature dropping paracetamol, but you know, kind of version of paracetamol. And, you know, kind of in order to persuade me to do it, they put it into honey. So they tricked me by giving me something sweet and I swallowed it. And you know what? I lived because of that. Now, I have absolutely no problem with somebody manipulating or telling me to do something because it is exactly about that. It is intent. It&#8217;s not the action. But what does it do to me? And with what intent it is given to me? So if people are complaining that, you know, and they don&#8217;t want to use an app, God bless them. I mean, if they can find the discipline that, you know, kind of that great memory to every 60 minutes to jump up and move, who does to them and respect to them. And yep, but majority of us have a lot of other things to worry about. So if somebody nudges me and tells me to do something, I&#8217;m just thankful that I can actually delegate this means field task that I don&#8217;t want to use my brain for to technology. But I am still benefiting from those behaviors that are coming from those nudges. So if people don&#8217;t want to play the game, absolutely fine. You know, kind of, to be honest, it&#8217;s not like, you know, we&#8217;re selling you a really expensive NFT at the door and we&#8217;re dependent on you coming in and buying them. And that&#8217;s my revenue stream. No, as I said, everything&#8217;s free. The app is free. And everything works because of the scale and because you change your behavior. And there are a lot of companies are paying attention to that. I&#8217;m kind of going, these guys are able to make these people more active. I want to talk to them. And I want to attract their attention. And I want to have them as customers. So if you don&#8217;t want to participate in it, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Love it. Oleg what an episode, man. This has been an absolute treat. I&#8217;ve had a blast and can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two. I also need some of that Sweat swag. It is nasty. I love that. I&#8217;ll be rocking that. Just like I&#8217;m rocking the NEAR swag. I&#8217;ll be rocking some of the Sweat swag. But until the next time we speak, you got to let our listeners know where they can find you and Sweatcoin and Sweat Economy online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
So open your iPhone or Android open apps or Google Play and just type Sweat. The top is going to be a Sweat when we have nearly 200 million installs. We deserve that top spot. Install the app and if you want to play crypto game then on the main screen just see a banner that says walk into crypto, follow prompts and you will end up having your crypto account and you will install Sweat wallet that will effectively manage your Sweat. That&#8217;s it. On Telegram we are @SweatEconomy. On Twitter we are @SweatEconomy. On Discord we are Sweat Economy. Very simple of sweateconomy.com and you can find light paper and all the links to all the socials right there. And if you go into any of those channels and you want to chat to me you&#8217;ll find me there very easy. I&#8217;m active in all of those conversations.

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are Buzzing, as always, and I am super pumped to have the one and only Don Norbury on the show today, head of studio at SHRAPNEL, a AAA first-person extraction shooter with a creator ecosystem that empowers players to own their creations and shape the future of the game. From the genre-defining franchises of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Bioshock, Sunset Overdrive, and Crackdown to the sports superstars Madden, NFL, and NASCAR, Don has redefined creative boundaries across platforms and player experience for more than 16 years. Prior to joining SHRAPNEL, he held senior positions at companies such as HBO, Microsoft, and Electronic Arts, also known as EA. What a friggin&#8217; bio. Can&#8217;t wait to get into this one. Don, welcome to the show, my friend. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Matt, thank you. I&#8217;m doing great.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pump to have you on man. That is an absolutely wild bio right there. Someone who has played a multitude of the games that I just read off, and obviously, companies like HBO, Microsoft, and EA, I don&#8217;t think anyone on the planet who has an internet connection isn&#8217;t aware of those three companies. Super Pump to have you on. Can&#8217;t wait to get into this. Let&#8217;s go right back to square one before we get into some of the gaming and nitty gritty. A lot of people would absolutely kill, literally kill, to have their feet in your shoes and to have worked on some of these incredible titles, worked with these incredible companies, worked in the gaming industry. Gaming is so frigging big right now. It&#8217;s not even funny. People have no clue how big it is and how much time it takes up, how much of our bandwidth it takes up. But before we get into you, present day, and SHRAPNEL and GameBridge, let&#8217;s get into little baby Don all the way up to present day, walk me through your childhood, your past. Some of the cool things you worked on, and then we&#8217;ll get into why you made the jump from very cushy positions in Web2, taking a massive risk, jumping into Web3. But the floor is yours. Let&#8217;s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, little baby Don grew up in New Jersey actually my family moved to Florida when we were young because my dad wanted to play golf all year round.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. I already love your dad. Your dad&#8217;s a man.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, that was the up and down the East Coast experience. Ended up going to college for computing at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, which was a great like first city, you know, at that point in your life on your own first city experience. Not sure if I&#8217;d ever go back to live there. Ended up there for about seven years for a couple of years after graduating, just working there. And then landed my first game industry gig at Electronic Arts Tiberon, EA Tiberon, which of course is the studio that makes Madden at that time made NASCAR, worked on Tiger Woods and NCAA, worked on a title called NFL Head Coach. There was more like franchise management than it was that like, you know, you couldn&#8217;t play it. Like you could Madden, you couldn&#8217;t kind of like pick a player. So that was a great place to, you know, get my first launch off experience because you&#8217;re in a studio that not only is just pumping out hits like annual title after title, but because of that cadence of it, you go through this very compressed production experience. Right? You are guaranteed if you go there in your first couple of years, touching a whole bunch of titles, some of them completely from beginning to end because the design production, like shutting it down, shipping it has to happen in this very specific window. For that, it was great for me. They like head hunted me because I made a like a Neverwinter Nights mod, basically, back in, you know, I&#8217;m pretty old. Back in that day, Neverwinter Nights, like the original game, not the MMO that came out, had a great tool set and you could build your own campaign for it. So I did that and it kind of attracted their attention, you know, along with my kind of computing background and that&#8217;s what kicked me off in the game industry. And then it was the kind of tour de coasts, I suppose. After that, I went to LucasArts, now it&#8217;s called Lucasfilm Games, but LucasArts at the time worked on Star Wars and Indiana Jones and then to Boston where I worked at Irrational Games. I was the like team member number seven or something like that, six maybe, on the team that made Bioshock Infinite. So at the time, most of the studio was doing like DLC or something for the original Bioshock and we were kind of setting the architecture and the project and the team and everything that would eventually become the full, you know, Bioshock Infinite team. Then went back to coast again to Microsoft. So that&#8217;s when I ended up in Seattle, Xbox was like global publishing for six years. It was just great. It&#8217;s great like altitude change. Had spent so long building products and studios and teams and everything. And when you do publishing, you&#8217;re kind of over a large portfolio. You&#8217;re involved in the business decisions like having to look at the marketing and the biz dev and pitches and where things fit together. And for a place like Xbox also, like what the platform and company initiatives are and how you can orchestrate them into the titles that you&#8217;re making. So there I worked on a ton, you know, like Quantum Break, Ryse: Son of Rome, Age of Empires, like that stuff was a lead for Sunset Overdrive and a lead for Crackdown 3. And then after that went to HBO, where I met all the founders that we eventually created Neon, which is the company that we built in order to make SHRAPNEL. What was HBO we focused on, it was both publishing. So we did like Westworld and Game of Thrones publishing, but it was also R&amp;D, you know, HBO had this pedigree of just like entertainment technology being at the cutting edge of it. And we did a ton, you know, volumetric video, voice synthesis or like how we could use AI and voice fonts to put it in games so that you could more easily, right? Like have strong narratives and just not have to like do VO repeatedly again and again as you change like a script or something. So that sort of stuff we also did a ton of while over there. And I think that background and that kind of like who we are is what led us into blockchain gaming as well. Or like this is the nascent technology. There&#8217;s so much opportunity here. You know, this is, I always use the analogy of blockchain to me is like what TCPIP is for the internet. Like it&#8217;s this underlying protocol that enables something. Consumers don&#8217;t care. They just care about what they can do. They don&#8217;t care about TCPIP. They care about using Instagram or something like that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
They don&#8217;t care about the back end, they care about with the front end. What&#8217;s it for them? They don&#8217;t give a shit what is behind the scenes, what kind of engines in the car. As long as the car&#8217;s running and it&#8217;s fun to drive, that&#8217;s all that matters. That&#8217;s all it is.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
That kind of takes us to the present about two years ago. We kicked off SHRAPNEL in earnest as a project and started building the team and the architecture underneath and the game. And of course it&#8217;s like looking back, we feel so naive, like that we were so naive at the beginning and it&#8217;s become much more sophisticated and mature now on how we do that, you know, from an operational perspective as well as like the shape of the game design and what we&#8217;re actually building.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Such a good story. I mean heck we could not even talk about SHRAPNEL or GameBridge and probably chat for 10 hours here But we will get into that in a bit, but I do want to talk about your past just a bit more before we get into the Web3 stuff here I would love if you could just take it not a huge deep dive maybe just give a high-level overview on the differences of creating sort of games that have IP from shows like a Game of Thrones or like a Star Wars or Indiana Jones versus a Madden Just a sort of to set the lay the land for the listeners here. I&#8217;m a big sports guy I always dabbled played a little bit of the you know the Star Wars and the Game of Thrones not came through once but games like the Star Wars and Indiana Jones But when it came to the sports games, you know, I always played FIFA I always played Madden I always played NHL and it&#8217;s pretty much same but different very similar game. You&#8217;re adding a couple new things every year. You&#8217;re the biggest real changes is who gets traded to what team, right? I feel like you know graphics get a little better sounds get a little more vibrant. But how do you go about creating a game of thrones or a Star Wars. Like that&#8217;s wild. I love if you could just walk us through the process of how that happens from like, okay. We&#8217;re gonna create this game to actually shipping the game. And I know this is probably a four-hour question, but if you can just tell it into a couple minutes It&#8217;ll be lovely.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I&#8217;ll do my best. All of them have their own sets of constraints. I was to say, you know, SHRAPNEL is a title where we got to do all the world building and inception on our own.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah. You got a blank slate there. Yeah. Which I feel like is like sometimes easier, but sometimes harder, right?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
It can be paralyzing. We have a great set of people. We&#8217;re great at it here in terms of going from the blue sky to refining what it&#8217;s gonna be. Everyone&#8217;s kind of no ego. So we&#8217;re great at throwing shitty ideas out, like throwing bad ideas out, having them shot down, finding the next best thing. We&#8217;ll do that repeatedly until you have something where everyone can resonate with it. But that is a completely separate problem. To address your original question, it&#8217;s different with every license, with every franchise that you&#8217;re gonna interact with. So with a Hollywood franchise, you talk about something like Game of Thrones or Westworld, those were very much in development at the same time. So you have a show runner in the case of a show. And if that&#8217;s happening at the same time, that&#8217;s actually the most difficult example because making creative stuff is hard. And you&#8217;re always trying to de-risk everything. There&#8217;s so many places it can not happen and not launch along the way that you&#8217;re always just in this protection mode. And that applies to not just the show runners, but also the financing around shows. So they&#8217;re always trying to protect the show runners and everything from people like us who are gonna come in and make a game that maybe has conflicting storylines or conflicting plot elements. And they&#8217;re like, can&#8217;t do that. Everything&#8217;s gotta fit in the show is the shining example. They&#8217;re not always like that, but it&#8217;s something you have to be aware of when you&#8217;re especially any like Hollywood IP. With Star Wars and Indiana Jones, those were established IPs where the majority of Lucasfilm&#8217;s revenue comes from licensing, right? So like they&#8217;re used to this entire landscape. It&#8217;s a well-oiled machine. And even though nowadays, like the majority of us are licensed to external studios to build something and this was an internal studio, they still treated it relatively the same, which is we&#8217;re licensing and that&#8217;s internally, you still have to come up with the plot elements, what&#8217;s the story gonna be? And then we kind of like verify and validate that that&#8217;s okay. It has to pass all those checks, but it&#8217;s still like, once you&#8217;ve laid out the story and the characters, that&#8217;s the main part of what the licensing is gonna care about up front. And then as you move through, it&#8217;s sort of just like a check and verification to make sure everyone&#8217;s on the same page. But that&#8217;s actually the easiest one is because it&#8217;s already established and their business model is very much based on licensing anyway. Madden, as he brought up interesting, it was the first game I worked on in 2005. So it was Madden 2006. It&#8217;s very interesting because the sport changes too, right? And the NFL license is non-trivial. And I would say the amount of scrutiny and critique that they put on a game like Madden is actually extremely high. So perfect example, because it&#8217;s a brand image. It&#8217;s a premium brand image. You can have the same thing if you do like Formula One, right? Like there&#8217;s hundreds of millions of dollars behind this. They care a lot about the correct tone and the message in the brand. So the perfect example for that first iteration that I did, the first shipped game, horse collar tackles were made illegal that year, right? They banned them because it would injure, yeah, it would injure people&#8217;s knees, right? Most people think it was like a neck thing, but it was actually like a leg thing, right? We had to go in and modify the game so that there was no, because you have all these animations that trigger for various reasons to go in and remove horse collar tackles from the game, which is a non-trivial operation, right? You have decades of the game being built. There&#8217;s all sorts of code and data. Has some of it&#8217;s not named properly. And yeah, so you gotta go through and then the test team has to be like, oh, you missed one or this is causing some bug. And that&#8217;s an example of that same level of like ongoing scrutiny and quality. It definitely happens with something like Madden.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool. Last sort of, you know, old Web2 gaming related question, then we&#8217;ll get into Web3 stuff. Nowadays, it&#8217;s such a phenomenon for every sports game. I guess even FIFA 2, which is probably the, I assume the most popular sports game on the planet, but you have every single NFL player now, they get asked about the ratings and they go, do you believe that this is fair for your speed, your overall, your tackling, your jumping, your juke. Did the players give a shit back then? Or did we just not see it because of social media? Like, did you have players writing you guys and being like, don&#8217;t give your head a shake? Like I&#8217;m not an 85. I&#8217;m a 91 speed because I love that shit. I think that&#8217;s great. I think it&#8217;d be so cool to like be yourself in a game.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I would say some players care and some don&#8217;t, but they definitely carried back then. I&#8217;m glad I was not the person. I knew, you know, it was good friends with the designers that actually had to do that tuning and make those calls. I&#8217;m glad I was not that person.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so funny. Let&#8217;s jump into SHRAPNEL here. And again, I&#8217;m going to ask you some more question regards to creating a game, but you guys, and my apologies if I&#8217;m incorrect here, but it appears that you guys built this baby from scratch. And again, you guys are all very experienced game builders, developers, not just a couple lads, we&#8217;re like, hey, we&#8217;re going to make a game. You guys are literally world class. You guys are the best in the biz at this. Walk me through the like day one to shipping, because again, this is I&#8217;ve been fortunate to work with a couple companies. Who have shipped and are currently shipping games, more specifically mobile Web3 games. And I was in awe because I come from a marketing and sales background. I&#8217;m the guy you can help you, you know, get this in front of eyeballs and ears. But building it, I have no friggin clue what to do. And now I have a little bit of an idea and I am beyond baffled. It is absolute banana lands, the amount of work that goes into it, the size of the team that goes into it, the amount of hours, the iterations. And that&#8217;s just on like the building. Then there&#8217;s the creative side where it&#8217;s like, how does the guy or the gal wake up in the morning? The team of guys and gals wake up and think, we&#8217;re going to take this wacky dream like fairy tale story in my head and make this playable and visible and something you can hear. To me, it&#8217;s just as someone who&#8217;s not on the creative side, more of an athlete on the creative. I always think there&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re one or the other in life. This is so far in my wheelhouse and I&#8217;d love Don, if you could give us the lay of the land and talk about sort of the journey from day one to present day, because that I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s absolutely craziness.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, you&#8217;re absolutely right. It&#8217;s difficult. And we&#8217;re in like mid production right now, right? We have about 70 people internally and probably another 70 to 100. They were like external contracts, which is typical shape of the industry right now. That&#8217;s actually, you know, I&#8217;d consider us a, on the small to medium size studio really. Like, you know, once you get to your grand theft auto land or something like that, you&#8217;ve got 250 people internally, maybe more, you know, working on something. So it is, and it&#8217;s always a miracle that anything gets made. And it&#8217;s very difficult to keep people pointed at the correct North Star. I mean, it&#8217;s one of the reasons we have an in-person studio. You can see it historically in the industry during the pandemic, the reason so many games missed or like missed by a lot or just straight up canceled. There are not just inefficiencies, but it just straight up difficulties of getting everyone on the same page when you&#8217;re not in person.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s such a good point, such a good point.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
So, yeah, building a new IP, a new world building, you know, no good of story, nascent technology, new business model, like all of these things come together to increase the complexity of a already quite difficult process. The day one for this type of project, and they&#8217;re all different, right? If you look at like a $60 single player game like out of war or something, the creative process is gonna be a little different. The production process is gonna be different. For us, we&#8217;re taking much more of a like ship early unfinished early access style of things, get people involved way earlier. We felt it was kind of one of the things that attracted us like culturally on the Web3 side versus what people expect on the Web2. And I would say a lot of the people in that kind of like degen and gamer overlap tend to be more educated about how long good game production process is. So there&#8217;s a lot of voices that will come in and be very realistic. They&#8217;re like, dude, games take a really long time to make. Like you gotta be patient with the team, you expect like, you know, the impossible things basically from a timeline perspective for them to deliver. So we always appreciate those people who are kind of like doing it at the community level. But at the same time, we try and be as transparent as possible. So from the very beginning, when we kind of laid out at least for this project, we had the idea for a long time about just creator ecosystems. It was a creator ecosystems. And at the same time we thought extraction games were gonna be kind of the next evergreen design space in the same way Battle Royale had provided a construct for a lot of different games leading up to that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Sorry to interrupt here. Can you talk more about extraction games and exactly what they are and why they&#8217;re so powerful?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
For sure, you know, there&#8217;s a couple pieces and there&#8217;s different styles of extraction games. All of them involve having to get stuff out in some way or another, right? Some are a little softer where, example of the Dark Zone from the division. And actually one of our advisors, a guy named Terry Spear who created the division, who&#8217;s creative director for the division in Dark Zone. It was part of like in our early stages, how we were doing the game design was very much with him. That is the softest version where you don&#8217;t really lose anything, but you kind of go in and you try to get stuff. And if you die before you get it out, you lose just the stuff you&#8217;re trying to get out. And then you have the more hardcore version, which is like escape from Tarkov, which is closer to what SHRAPNEL is, where the stuff you bring in is at risk. It&#8217;s a lose your loadout game, right? So you&#8217;re always thinking about that risk reward that you want to take. Now, granted, we&#8217;ve done a lot of design work to say, like we always have the mantra, like we want people bringing in their dopest gear every time. We don&#8217;t want you to not want to bring in your stuff because you&#8217;re afraid of losing it. And a lot of it has to do with all of the other stuff that&#8217;s like much higher value, that&#8217;s the stuff that you really care way more about. And that stuff you can&#8217;t lose, at least in the like the default game mode, you can&#8217;t lose, but the weapons and equipment and everything that you have on your loadout, you can totally lose. That said, you can take it from somebody else as well. And there&#8217;s a bunch of high value stuff. Over the course of this session, the value actually increases of the stuff in the session. So you want to incentivize people to stay in longer and longer, but there&#8217;s multiple, and some people are gonna just like YOLO to the end. Some people are gonna be very careful. They&#8217;re going around the edges. And then we have multiple extraction moments to they&#8217;ll be getting out in an earlier extraction. While the wolves go after like later and later game stuff. You know, that&#8217;s kind of the like framework and context for at least SHRAPNEL as an extraction game. Is this like come in with your stuff, high stakes, treasure hunting, as you know, the studio pillar that we put against it. That was, you know, the beginnings that we knew we wanted to explore in that space, making a game like that. We knew user creation was also something important to us. And it&#8217;s a lot of it because like we&#8217;ve all, you know, I&#8217;ve been making games. I know you said 16 years at the beginning, I think it&#8217;s like 18 now. And we get a close to 20 years in gaming. Our CEO is getting closer to 30 years in gaming. And what a lot of us got our starts, like I was saying, getting hired for Madden, got our starts modding games, like creating our own stuff with tool sets and existing franchises that were out there and allowed us to do it. So we always have this like nostalgia factor against it. And it&#8217;s been great to see things like Minecraft, Roblox, you know, the creator mode for Fortnite. So we always wanted to do that. But we wanted like the aged out version. A lot of it&#8217;s in the kind of play pen sandbox child space. We&#8217;re not making a Sandbox. We&#8217;re making a fairly like serious themed, like adult level of, you know, of like fiction and intrigue. We didn&#8217;t want it to be a place where anybody can do anything that they want. We wanted to be like an intriguing universe where they could put their brand on it and create stuff that other people could experience. It&#8217;s a different shape than like a game like sandbox or something like Roblox, but we knew it was important. So when we came to the blockchain, started getting requests for advisement in blockchain for our game expertise, that&#8217;s where we kind of made the connection, started, you know, jumping as far down the rabbit hole as humanly possible. And it took us about six weeks. You know, we were start up at the time so you can dedicate time on the team to kind of go away, make your own conclusions about things, research things. I was very much in the tech side at the time. So it was like baby&#8217;s first solidity contract and looking at the landscape, the like technical landscape of what was available, what the L1s were, what the scalability solutions, et cetera, and came back and I was like, this is not if, this is when. And the gaming landscape is not that great right now. It&#8217;s especially in the time it&#8217;s getting better and better, but at the time we&#8217;re like, this is a blue ocean. Like we should take our expertise as game developers, make a really fun game and realize this kind of like vision that we think is the future of legitimate digital ownership, transportability, you know, interoperability and go as far as we can to add all of that additional agency to the digital, you know, assets that people have. And that&#8217;s, you know, that analogy of like the TCPIP, like we very quickly saw blockchain as just the thing that enabled these other things that we wanted to do. From that point on, it was kind of your typical like create enough of a design, start like going around pitching and trying to effectively get seed to get the actual company started. And that&#8217;s what took us to two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
You guys did all this before you got the first fund. For you got the first raise.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Design perspective. Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Wow, I guess I didn&#8217;t my apologies. I did my research wrong. I thought this was like idea right away, boom. And then darn, that&#8217;s impressive. I mean, I guess with your guys background, I mean, I&#8217;m sure it was probably difficult, but I guess with your guys background though, like, you know, that definitely gets you in the door. It must have.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure. I mean, our team, we have a very strong team and all the people we&#8217;ve hired are really strong too. I think I&#8217;ve worked on projects previously with like half the people at the studio and because we&#8217;re in-person studio, it was this like perfect personality filter of people who are at a right place in their career. So we ended up with a lot of veterans. Yeah, who are just like, yeah, that sounds like, you know, we were refined enough even though I was saying like, we were pretty naive at the beginning. It was refined enough to attract some very talented people to the studio, which just, it took our aspirations and kept making them higher and higher of what we were gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. Don you are on an absolute roll. We got to take a quick break and give a massive shout out to our sponsor of the show that&#8217;s PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we&#8217;re going to keep buzzing on the one and only SHRAPNEL and we&#8217;ll get into GameBridge as well and talk more about AAA games, blockchain games and some of the similarities and some of the things that make games go absolutely parabolic. Nowadays, one of the things that interests me the most is streaming and how you must create a game that is somewhat streamable. And we will get into that as well. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT. We love these guys, longtime friends of cryptonews.com, longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Now back to the show with Don. Don before we get into GameBridge and a couple other of the super fun things, I want to talk about streaming. It is absolutely blowing up. You have these 12 year olds to 23, 24 year old men and women, boys and girls who are literally making eight figures a year, eight frigging figures. And all they do is stream video games. It&#8217;s absolutely wild. I&#8217;m 28 years old. I never watched any of this stuff when I was a kid. Obviously now I don&#8217;t, but again, I have tuned into all of them. I need to because this is the field I&#8217;m in and it would be nonsensical for me to not know what makes the good ones good and what makes the bad ones bad. But it seems like the Gem Zers are absolutely hooked on everything streaming related. Instead of, you know, like you and I, when we were young, playing games or doing whatever at these kids still play games, but they just watch streams all day long, 24/7, walk me through the importance of streaming present day and why it&#8217;s so paramount for building a game to have easy streamability options for not just the gamers, but the viewers as well.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I would say it&#8217;s not just streaming its social reach period as compared to like traditional media, right? But certainly streaming and the personalities kind of represented therein are a huge, you know, a huge place. Just it&#8217;s as much entertainment as anything, right? People find the types of personalities, like taste making that those people have. And then they become like super attracted to that person. And instead of just being a show that they can watch for 30 minutes or an hour or whatever, it&#8217;s this like constant connection that they have, you know, a human who has a ton of people following them. It makes perfect sense in the current landscape of like social connectivity. But this is the human video connection that people like look to and rely upon. There&#8217;s a kind of air of more genuineness to it as well, right? And especially in the Web3 space, I would say, it&#8217;s really important to the point where you almost see, we always feel like traditional celebrities are like a huge red flag in Web3, where it&#8217;s like everyone&#8217;s skeptical, meaning like, why is he snooping? Right? So they want to see the people they trust and have a connection with. And certainly in Web2, like gaming, it has become the thing. I think the other part for the streaming portion as well is it&#8217;s the best way. If you don&#8217;t know if you want to play a game or buy a game or whatever, it&#8217;s this really easy shortcut. This is how I use it most formally. Like I don&#8217;t have standard personalities that I follow from a streaming perspective either. I&#8217;m aware of all of them. And we certainly have, and they&#8217;ll speak to it in a second, like our approach with streamers. But I will go to people like streaming games to see like real legitimate gameplay. Not just see like commercialized imagery and video. I want to see them playing the boring part and dying. That is the very obvious reason it is the heaviest part of the actual, like not just marketing, but awareness and how you get people into the kind of like social network of a game. Myth is probably our biggest streamer that we&#8217;re associated with now that we have a partnership with. He&#8217;s a great one, at least in the U.S. because he has a kind of insatiable curiosity. When he&#8217;s come to the studio, he actually spend like hours with our designers just sitting in the editor. Like how does this work? How do I tune this? Like why does this feel the way this feels? So it&#8217;ll actually like get into the game making side of it as well as just playing and giving feedback. Yeah. So you don&#8217;t always see that in streamer and influencer. A lot of times it&#8217;s like very transactional. He&#8217;s been an absolute delight partnership. But we definitely see our approach of those types of people and the best sorts of personalities to just create awareness and to have people understand who we are and what we&#8217;re building. As well as the like micro streamers as well who are like looking to build their audience and have franchises they&#8217;re associated with. They represent also a really great opportunity for win-win on both sides of the line. We&#8217;re including that in kind of our marketing approach as well. So yeah, we think that mixed with the other kind of social networks is the way to go. Nowadays, it almost feels like your traditional gaming media is following behind. They&#8217;re like reporting on streamers or on social as opposed to leading it. Right? The traditional media is a good indicator of how you&#8217;re performing on these kind of front-running networks but not really like where you go anymore to try. You&#8217;re not like chasing reporters anymore to try and get some sort of article. It&#8217;s just going to happen once you get enough momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And it&#8217;s crazy how lucky you can get to. Like all it takes is like one, you know, I show speed or one of those guys who literally like find your game on whatever gaming platform you&#8217;re on and like literally the rest is history. Like you can go from five figures in revenue to seven figures overnight. It is that easy. And again, that&#8217;s the power of the internet. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
And it&#8217;s global too, like as important, heavy weighted and popular as it is in the United States and Europe, if you go to the Middle East, they have streamers who have tens of millions of followers, like 30 million followers, right? Like we don&#8217;t have anything close to that caliber in kind of the West. So, you know, that&#8217;s a more untapped region, I guess in this space, but like the avenue is there to immediately have tens of millions of people who know about your franchise or kind of like buying into it and becoming the players within that ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Crazy how it works. Let&#8217;s get into GameBridge here. You guys recently launched GameBridge, which is an advanced and versatile Web3 game developer platform. So friggin important. So Paramount for, not your guys success, but Paramount for, just Web3 as a whole. We need, you can&#8217;t build good shit without having highly talented, motivated world-class people on board. And if they are building things in which, in the fashion that is just a complete nuisance for them, it&#8217;s not fun. There&#8217;s too much friction and it&#8217;s just bullshit city, which is, you know, what it is a lot of the time right now. It ain&#8217;t going to work. And that&#8217;s why it ain&#8217;t working right now. So there&#8217;s a lot of incredible companies like you guys who are launching incredible products like GameBridge that allow Web2 developers to come to Web3 and actually move the needle makes shit happen. Was this a no brainer for you and the team? Why did you guys decide to launch this?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
I wouldn&#8217;t say it was a no-brainer from the beginning, that it would be something that we formalized the way that we ended up. In hindsight, it was an inevitability, especially with the kind of technical prowess that we have on the blockchain side here. There&#8217;s a couple of dimensions I always like to talk about here. One is, Web3 as an industry to us always felt over-weighted on infrastructure and underweighted on product. So for us, we were always 100% focused on product and what&#8217;s required to deliver trap, right? And there&#8217;s so many infrastructure companies who are building these services, but they aren&#8217;t doing it with their own product. So you end up with these tons of infrastructure seeking a very like, you know, a thin layer of products that are actually trying to make something. So we took the, it&#8217;s kind of the unreal, Epic made Unreal Engine to make Unreal Tournament. And it was just required to make the product that like we built GameBridge to make SHRAPNEL. And in doing so, kind of formalized an architecture that allowed our game team who know, you know, enough about blockchain to be dangerous, but mostly to themselves and the people around them. But you don&#8217;t, you know, they&#8217;re not like writing our smart contracts or doing any of the operational side. So our, we call it the Nexus team. It&#8217;s effectively our platform team. It&#8217;s very much, you know, taking the requirements from the game team and building the platform that&#8217;s required to support them. And as a result, built this sort of partnership, agnostic game architecting platform. And it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re building it for a game. It really the pattern and the architecture that it is could go way beyond games. It&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s a lot of existing services in the way things are glued together that enable games very easily out of the gate. But the pattern allows you to pick whatever partners you want. And when I say partners, I mean, like what L1 do you want to run your production chain? Or like what, you know, how do you want the actual like chain side and consensus mechanism to work? Who are your wallet solutions, right? Like these sorts of things that everyone has a different set of constraints and partnerships and trade-offs. We built it. So those things are, you can snap in and out. And still the game team can then just focus making game. We need, you know, inventory systems and cataloging and like this style of monetization and how the marketplace works on yada yada. They can just do that in a way that game developers are familiar with. And at that resulted in GameBridge. And we&#8217;ve got a number, large number of studios at also different sizes and calibers looking to utilize it. So we&#8217;re kind of teaming up those conversations right now. Want to do it at a responsible, like onboard people in a responsible way. Cause it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re still shipping SHRAPNEL, right? Exactly. You want to have that maturity of the product or else everyone&#8217;s going to go through the same pains that we are internally making sure our product works the correct way.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Don, this is an absolute treat. We are getting a little tight for time here. One last thing that I would absolutely love to discuss is, and again, this is a thesis of yours that you&#8217;ve discussed in the past, is how blockchain can be included as not so much sort of the forefront in the main piece, but an optional sort of additional element of AAA games, right? Where it&#8217;s like you have incredible teams like yours who are still building AAA games, but the blockchain tech isn&#8217;t front and center. It&#8217;s not, hey guys, come play our blockchain game. It&#8217;s come play our kickass almost Web2-ish, not almost Web2-ish, AAA game that looks and feels like a Web2 game that is actually built on blockchain tech. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about the importance of that and why that&#8217;s needed to enable things like true community participation. Gives it the ownership of course, the interoperability and how it really is the future of gaming as a whole</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure. And I think really the part that is required is for mass adoption because it&#8217;s a thin slice of people that are willing to go through the friction and the trial and error when you have technophile adoption. That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re talking about. But that said, GameFi and interoperability, transportability is why we&#8217;re doing what we&#8217;re doing. So like that part can&#8217;t get lost in the process either, right? So even though when you jump into SHRAPNEL, there&#8217;s no blockchain familiar terminology, right? We don&#8217;t have NFTs, we have whatever they are. We have skins, we have like an M4 or our variation of that like, you know, weapon itemization. Like we have those things and that&#8217;s just what they are. They&#8217;re not NFTs. I mean, they are in the smart contracts behind scenes, but that&#8217;s not like what you see. You don&#8217;t need to link a, you know, a self custody wallet. We have custodial wallet behind the account service behind the scenes. It&#8217;s handling everything for you in a familiar way that you would in any other game. That said, you can link your non-custodial wallet, your self custody wallet. You can transfer items into that. You can, you know, bridge, you know, whether it&#8217;s shrap itself or the items that are on the platform that you own onto other ecosystems. So that capability is still there. And it&#8217;s an important part of the cohorts that will come to SHRAPNEL and that are already coming to SHRAPNEL. But if you&#8217;re gonna have, you know, a million concurrency, you need like the wider gaming audience to come to the title and not have to feel like they need to learn or know anything that&#8217;s not in their, they&#8217;re like familiar space. So really it&#8217;s like, hey, that thing that you have is actually yours and you can trade it or equip it and you slowly show people the things they can do that they maybe weren&#8217;t as familiar with unless they&#8217;re like trading on the gray market for Counter-Strike or something like that, right? It&#8217;s sort of like showing, just showing them the affordances that they have now. And then they&#8217;ll get more deeply, some of them will get more deeply into what it really means to have like blockchain back digital assets, what the other marketplaces are, what other games are like interoperable with SHRAPNEL itemization. So that&#8217;s kind of like our approach of how you blend those two crowds. And the other part of that as well is working with other games and platforms to make sure our stuff actually works. Cause that&#8217;s a floating tides, like this all boats sort of thing. Whereas if you look at some of the more cynical game developers, like why would I do the work to support like somebody else&#8217;s stuff in my title? For me, the answer is obvious, which is it is a acquisition funnel, right? You&#8217;re now have a shared community. Like they can take your stuff and go there. It will come from those other platforms into your game because now they have stuff that works everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Don&#8217;t get greedy if you think your product is good enough. Just like for a lack of better terms, it&#8217;s one big circle jerk. Again, I hate the term, but like it&#8217;s one of the best ways to describe it. Everyone scratches each other&#8217;s back in a little way. And if your product is good enough, you&#8217;re going to be able to take that person&#8217;s attention. And that&#8217;s all the gaming industry is. We love an attention economy now. If you build a good enough game and Game X Y or Z is willing to share the sense that, hey, I&#8217;m going to give you my person and I get your person. And it&#8217;s not a matter of, oh, and if they like my game better than yours, they&#8217;re only going to play. No, it&#8217;s now they can play two different games. And you should feel grateful that, you know, you got to embark on that kind of partnership. I don&#8217;t get why people don&#8217;t mess with that. It makes no sense to me. It&#8217;s so close-minded.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Traditionally very zero sum approach to it. And I think you look at that, I love the way you&#8217;re putting it. It&#8217;s exactly the right mindset, which is if your game not good enough, or they just wanna play some other game, they&#8217;re gonna do that no matter what. Well, make everything easier and better and more valuable for them, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, Don, what an episode, man. I know we barely scratched the surface with the rate you guys are moving at. Gotta have you on for round two and round three, but this has been an absolute treat. Thank you so much for coming on. Really glad that we got to make this happen and would love to meet you in person one day. But until then, please let our listeners know where they can find you and SHRAPNEL online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, you can find us on the web at shrapnel.com, on Twitter at @playSHRAPNEL. And either of those, you can find our Discord. We have a lively Discord community. And we&#8217;re actually selling extraction packs right now that are basically, we&#8217;re doing kind of an early access rollout of the game. So they get you into the early access and give you a bunch of stuff, some of it cosmetic, some of it more useful equipment. So we&#8217;re launching that basically right now. So there&#8217;s a lot going on from now, really, to the end of the year. There&#8217;s no better time to take a look at what we&#8217;re doing and get involved, be able to get in and shoot people in the face and have a bunch of fun really soon.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And what about yourself? You gotta plug yourself here too.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Oh, I&#8217;m @DonNorbury on Twitter. I keep it real simple. You can always, you know, if you&#8217;re in the industry, you&#8217;re looking for, have a chat around game development or Web3 stuff. You can find me on LinkedIn, same name and same handle.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And last thing, bar behind you looks like a pretty speed bar. What&#8217;s Don&#8217;s go to cocktail?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question. Probably the last word is my standard go to. So that&#8217;s equal parts, gin, maraschino liqueur, green shark truss and lime juice. That&#8217;s like a good&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s called the last word.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
The last word.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve never heard of that. I&#8217;m writing this down. Interesting. Okay, good to know.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, highly recommended. You know, it&#8217;s not complicated. It&#8217;s actually each cool proportions of each. So it&#8217;s mostly like how good is your lime juice? Like how good the limes that you bought, that&#8217;s gonna like define it. But any self respecting bar as well, you can walk into and ask and you&#8217;ll know. If they can&#8217;t make that, they&#8217;re not a self respecting bar.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I got a couple good spots in Mexico that I&#8217;d go to for a nice drink, not like the local watering hole because I mean, it&#8217;s strictly pretty much a beer in Tequila. But we&#8217;ll go to the Hyatt and shout out to Hyatt. Love the Hyatt. We&#8217;ll go to the Hyatt. They got a great bartender there and I&#8217;ll get him to make me one of those. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
There&#8217;s a version that uses mescal, I think instead of gin.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love mescal too. Love that. Don, what an episode. Appreciate you coming on, man. Can&#8217;t wait for round two. And, yeah, truly solid, wishing you and the team all the best. Can&#8217;t wait to play the game, and we&#8217;ll talk soon.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Thank you, Matt. It was a pleasure being here. I appreciate the invitation introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, and I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, Ryan Gill, CEO of Crucible Network, also the founder and CEO of Open Meta. Ryan is a pioneer of the Open Metaverse movement, and he is the founder and CEO of Crucible Network, an enterprise offering easy onramps for developers to leverage Web3 tech, as well as a founding member of the Open Meta DAO. An organization supporting the delivery of products, experiences, services, best practices and tools underpinning the emergence of an Open Metaverse. I love this, as we need more of this shit in Web3. Ryan stands out as a visionary, leader and entrepreneur, and has been moving the first industry figures to promote the term Open Metaverse. Ryan, super pumped to have you on. How you doing, mate? Welcome to the show. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Thanks Matt. Glad we made this happen. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />I know it&#8217;s been a hot minute, pumped to have you on. Folks, we are recording on Monday, October 16th, and this episode is going to air a week today on Monday, October 23rd. But as we are recording, it is bright and early in the morning for myself. Ryan is across the pond in beautiful London. And we just had a crazy Bitcoin candle, not one of those red ones, one of those nice, fat, tall green ones. And everyone thought it was Bitcoin ETF approval. BlackRock is going to be dancing. Everyone&#8217;s so pumped. It ripped 7% in about four seconds. The Team at Cryptonews was doing our due diligence, looking around. Is the source legit? Cointelegraph, you should never shout it a competitor, but Cointelegraph, you can fire it out in articles saying it was true. And this is not true. How crazy is this? 2023, the fake news is still producing 7% candles. How freaking crazy is this? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I mean, fake news has been peaking all week, right? So I think this information is part of where we&#8217;re at now. I think it does reinforce how emotional all this is, right? And certainly can&#8217;t write off the fact that maybe these leaks are intentional, but yeah, at this point right now, they&#8217;re unverified. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Isn&#8217;t it wild though? Like 7%. And again, we&#8217;re not talking 7% on fake news for a shit coin. We&#8217;re talking 7% on the creme de la creme of all cryptos, the big bad boy Bitcoin itself. I can&#8217;t believe this is still happening. And again, I guess my follow up to that is, do you think there&#8217;s any warrant? Do you think this is a precursor to this actually happening? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I mean, I think the next chapter is ETFs, right? There&#8217;s not just this BlackRock one, the iShares one, but like multiple. And for sure, the next market swinging up will be catalyzed by ETFs, by institutional buy-in and adoption and then all the way up to the halving. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />That&#8217;s what the industry needs right now. We need a little light at the end of the tunnel. But enough about Bitcoin. We are here to talk about you, Crucible, and of course, the Open Metaverse. But before we get into that, I&#8217;d love to learn a little bit more about yourself. Walk me through your past, walk me through childhood, all the way up to present day, why you got into crypto, and then we&#8217;ll get into the fun stuff here. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Sure, yeah. Growing up, I was sort of first musician, self-taught musician, made a lot of music, but decided I never really wanted to do anything career wise with it. And then through school, kind of got really into filmmaking. So first and foremost, a creative, but really kind of found my footing in the startup investor world, the venture capital world in LA, being a part of like the very first movements around the blockchain have been through three cycles now. So certainly have paid the dues and seen the patterns, but truthfully, I think my story is really about the fact that I dropped out of college, and sort of made a commitment to myself that from 20 to 30, it would be kind of my workshopping years. I would just try everything, and really not look at the receipts so much, but by 30 really be building. And Crucible is the culmination of those years, and my own personal thesis of what now is the Open Metaverse. I incorporated Crucible in 2018, so I was actually two years ahead of the game on that, but now six years in, really committed. And also very early, to imagine incorporating a company for the Open Metaverse in 2018, COVID maybe sped everything up, but 2018 for those two years, no one really knew what I was talking about. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Hold up, sort of interrupt there, Ryan. Before you move on there, what sort of ticked you off that the Open Metaverse would be a thing? Because again, doing that in 2018 is unheard of. That&#8217;s absolute banana lands. Was there a mentor or a talk or a workshop or was it just a culmination of everything you&#8217;ve learned? Being in the arena, I hate that quote, but love that quote. But you know what I mean? It&#8217;s like, how do you know that this would be a thing? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />I always have a gift, I think I have a gift of pattern recognition extrapolation. So seeing patterns and then sort of extrapolating those patterns forward. And so, I mean, I&#8217;ve always sort of said, you could drop me at any timeline in history and I&#8217;ll be focused on what&#8217;s coming next. This is kind of who I am. And I look at what&#8217;s coming next and how it solves problems, you know, for the current day. So innovation is just sort of, I think, where my experience, my expertise is. I&#8217;ve put 10, 15 years in focusing on a career around innovation, many different places from creative all the way through to technology. But I think the most sort of seminal period of my life was working directly with Peter Diamandis in that whole world of, you know, now it&#8217;s commonplace to talk about AI and automation because we&#8217;re living through it. But, you know, this is a group of people that was sort of the canary in the coal mine of trying to like tell people that this is coming and also shape and frame the opportunity that exists. And Peter was somebody that I always really looked up to with XPRIZE. I thought, you know, XPRIZE is such an important framework in the world. And if you really understand his story, he&#8217;s been a part of all the innovation that&#8217;s taken place. And so he actually brought me in as a head of Web3 for him in 2017, whereas the sort of like ICO token fail, bull market was happening, everything was being thrown at him and he didn&#8217;t know what to make sense of it all. So he wanted to come in and have somebody really take the responsibility of filtering all of that. And so him and I sort of worked directly for a while and I got through that to sort of peek around the corner of the future and meet the people that are building it, spending a lot of time with people like Philip Rosdale, but also meeting the founders of self-driving cars and self-flying cars and really just, you know, that William Gibson quote, I believe it&#8217;s William Gibson where he says like the future is already here. You know, it&#8217;s just that like people haven&#8217;t caught up and recognized that it is here yet. And so, you know, to me, innovation is not about predicting the future, it&#8217;s about recognizing where it&#8217;s happening today and then sort of that extrapolation. So that&#8217;s where I cut my teeth, that&#8217;s where the expertise is. And in that time, getting to be head of Web3 for somebody who&#8217;s so important to the space of innovation. I just shaped it. And then coming back to like my own mental model of saying, I&#8217;m gonna build my thing at 30, I was always trying to hone in on what that thesis was. What could I dedicate 30 to 40 to, you know, cause I kind of think in chapters of decades. So 20 to 30 was the workshopping, 30 to 40 now is the building. And I&#8217;m, you know, I&#8217;m gonna be 34 in a couple months. So we&#8217;re still in it. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Man, I love that. What a great start to the pod here. So many lessons. And again, just for the young folks listening, I&#8217;m 28 and couldn&#8217;t agree more with everything Ryan just said. When you&#8217;re in your 20s, like your tolerance for risk should be just stupendously high. Oh my God, there&#8217;s no reason. It&#8217;s with social media and everything else and just tech, it&#8217;s so easy to have a moonshot. But again, to get that moonshot, you gotta spend time in the arena, you gotta get your reps in, learn as much as possible in your 20s. Then I love that point. I wanna go back to pattern recognition one last time here, because that truly is a skill. And I know you said you have a gift for it. And I&#8217;m sure you do, but I also wholeheartedly believe that that is something that you can actually build. And again, it takes getting reps in. This might be a theme of the pod, getting reps and being in the arena. But, and I&#8217;m gonna throw a shitty question at you here, but how does one get good at that? Like, would that be the equivalent of a trader who, and again, all good traders I know, and there&#8217;s only a few of them. Everyone says they grow on trees, but they certainly do not. All good traders I know have a journal. And every night and every morning, they&#8217;re always journaling, not just the quantitative, but the qualitative, because the qual almost has more emphasis than the quant nowadays when it comes to trading. And we just use that example, because it&#8217;s, you know, it has a parallel to what we&#8217;re talking about here, but how does one become good at pattern recognition as a whole? Not an easy skill to learn, but one of the most valuable you can learn in the whole world. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />So, I mean, you mentioned I said gift and you said skill. I think there&#8217;s the talent versus skill argument, which happens a lot in athletics. Like there&#8217;s nobody who has natural talent that&#8217;ll outbeat somebody that works hard. Right? Now somebody who has natural talent who works hard is great. You know, you start to get into the realm of greatness. And in the sense of what we&#8217;re talking about, pattern recognition, more intellectual things than athletic, things I think first principles is probably the first place to start of being able to break things DAOn to their absolute fundamental and not getting caught up in the external or externalities of what other people are doing. Right? And I think clearly the ones won the games with that kind of thinking that sort of first principles thinking. So pattern recognition, I think starts in understanding the fundamentals. So, you know, studying mental models, understanding how to think in first principles is the foundational cornerstone to that. And then it&#8217;s really understanding how things progress and how they change. And certainly with the internet, how you could recognize patterns that you start to put into a narrative. Right? And to me, pattern recognition is storytelling. So I come back to my creative roots. And you know, it&#8217;s pattern recognition is being able to put the story together from all the data. And doing it with first principles is one where you can be sure it has fundamental value. It&#8217;s not caught up in whatever the next trend or fad is. And in the sense of what I do, pattern recognition is very much about we are through the prologue and maybe the first three episodes and what does it look like in season two? You know, just to come back again, I wanted to be a TV writer when I first moved to LA, a showrunner, but I still, I flexed that showrunner muscle as a founder. You know, this is just how I do it. And I don&#8217;t know that a lot of people relate to that, but it&#8217;s certainly how it works for me. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Any resources, books, blogs, podcasts, audio books that one can dive into to learn more about First Principles? I&#8217;m a big First Principles guy as well. I mean, I&#8217;ve done it shit ton. Again, you have Elon Musk, you have all the famous philosophers, you have the Socrats, and of course everyone else, the Tim Ferriss podcast when I was younger, learned a shit ton from him. Shout out to Tim Ferriss. But any good resources to learn from? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, Shane Parrish was always my secret weapon. Yeah, Farnam Street Blog. And he&#8217;s even published mental model books and stuff. It&#8217;s really difficult once you get into mental models, not to end up in game theory. And so also like, you know, game theory is where it starts to really matter. That&#8217;s where the stories actually get played out into potential outcomes, you know? But yeah, look, it all comes back DAOn to storytelling. I have come full circle back to this place where I really think that narrative is so important. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Yeah, well said. Also, we don&#8217;t do any free shoutouts on the pod, but huge shout out to Shane Parrish. Obviously, he&#8217;s had a big emphasis on Ryan and myself&#8217;s life as well. And he&#8217;s a good old Canadian boy, so we love to see that. And he just released a new book. I might even plug that at the end. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Volume 2, right? </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Yeah, he did. Just a new book. So huge shoutout. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />But also just to get really specific, it&#8217;s the Farnam Street blog, is the website. Yeah. And his podcast specifically, his podcast and the way that like, it&#8217;s all around learning how to learn. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />The knowledge project. Yeah. It&#8217;s phenomenal. Which is like folks, if you can learn how to learn, you&#8217;re unstoppable. You know what I mean? Like that&#8217;s just the learning is the skill. What a start, Ryan. I love this shit. Let&#8217;s get into crypto for a second here. Talk to me about Crucible and the Open Metaverse. And then we&#8217;ll break DAOn everything. We&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty. You said you started in 2018. Why did you feel that there was a need for an Open Metaverse way back when? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />So in innovation, especially around technology specifically, focusing on exponential growth and how things have ended up to that point, you go through the three acts of the internet, Web1, Web2, and Web3. And if you understand story structure, it&#8217;s in three acts. And it&#8217;s been very helpful for me to draw that parallel because the internet, Web1 was actually, if you read those papers, it&#8217;s very much about the end user, the individual. And it&#8217;s about technology protocols that could network to share information. And this was like so hugely revolutionary at the time. Great shout out is Lo and Behold, which is a Warner Hairsaw documentary. You really get to see that. And it was really about the end user and the individual. And it wasn&#8217;t a great business model. I mean, like you get like the million dollar homepage that started selling little pixels by brands that would advertise, but wasn&#8217;t purely about business. It was about information. It really important to recognize that. And then you had the dot com, which brought all the business, right? Even to the point that there was a huge bubble and people were selling things that weren&#8217;t actually there. But from that point, you can say Web2 was more about the shareholder than the end user. It was about these companies being built on these protocols and how dot coms became an actual way, a source of business engine of economics, right? And I would argue we&#8217;re still in Web2, right? Like it&#8217;s whether it got, it went into mobile, it went into apps, but it&#8217;s primarily still about these massive corporations built on the protocols. And we got tricked. I think most people slept walked into this, but these companies started giving the products away for free. And so everybody used them, not realizing that the business model is the fact that you&#8217;re the product and everything&#8217;s being sold on your back from that lens. I&#8217;ve had a lot of really important people that are friends of my life that I got to see really close up like Kaiser&#8217;s one of them. She was the whistleblower for Cambridge Analytica. And there&#8217;s been these incredibly seminal events that where everything we knew about what was happening in this space that I have been in, which is combination of innovation and Web3 kind of new tech, it&#8217;s punched through into the consciousness of the public. And that was definitely one of them. If you go watch the Great Hack, that&#8217;s a documentary all about her story on Netflix. But that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at as the same time as everything sort of centralized into these businesses. And the cracks have shown quite a lot in the sense of where data brokers are targeting you to just buy products that you may or may not need versus change the way your mind works and what you would vote for. And so my experience of just seeing all this happen, I&#8217;m understanding that Web3 is the third act where we can bring it back to the end user again. We can bring it back to the people. And yeah, some of those people may be shareholders or founders of businesses, but the scales need to be rebalanced in the sense that it&#8217;s not so focused just purely on shareholder value. If it&#8217;s just that, then we&#8217;ve peaked at centralization, I think from this point, it becomes more and more damage on our minds, on the environment, on all these things. So as most people probably know, in your audience, Bitcoin was a direct response from a market crash. And this community of people who started in Web1 and moved into privacy and now W3C and all of these, they never went away, right? And these are the people who are cryptographers, cipher punks, and that&#8217;s what this is about. This technology is about a new system of more decentralized capitalism that balances away from this sort of crony capitalism of just pure centralization. And the internet is the way it plays out. So for me, I just saw really quickly on one hand, gaming as a business is growing and swallowing everything up. And on the other hand, these things in the protocol levels and under the surface of it all is happening. And so I just saw like the metaverse, this science fiction concept that Neil Stevenson invented, it is the internet built by game developers. And so that easy definition was one, yeah, you can probably sense that I have a good grasp on language and being able to kind of put things into simple terms. And that&#8217;s been a lot of what the early years of Crucible is. It&#8217;s like the metaverse is the internet built by game developers. Okay, so now we know where we focus. We focus on game developers and the field of game development. And that&#8217;s basically what it was. And I think my time with Peter inspired that. And then me recognizing really early in 2017, Tim Sweeney&#8217;s vision and Epic Games and this game Fortnite that changed everything and started becoming this catch cow for him. But ultimately who Tim was, what he believed and him being an important character in this. Like he was the only person that I ever heard. other than myself when I decided to execute on this call, like talking about the Open Metaverse in the terms that he was from his place in gaming, but no one was saying it in Web3. The people that predate me were Decentraland and the ICOs that were building virtual worlds, but even those people at this time were not mentioning those words together. And I think that&#8217;s probably the biggest sort of contribution that I&#8217;ve had is recognizing that Crucible is a company, but I&#8217;m starting a movement and I need to build this like a movement. And so while I&#8217;m building this business, I need to start to plant these ideas in other businesses heads as well and find all the right people and kind of catalyze this as a movement. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />I love the, and again, I know that&#8217;s your Crucible&#8217;s mission is to empower gaming developers and gaming creators. And there&#8217;s this famous graph, I mean, famous is perhaps a stretch of a word, but I think I saw it a couple of years ago and it was the growth of gaming as a whole. And I also love like the CEO of Netflix even talked about our competitor is not Hulu or any of the, you know, the Disney plus or whatever, Apple TV, Amazon TV, any of their competitors he&#8217;s like our biggest competitor is gaming companies. This is what in people&#8217;s free time, they do a couple of things. They spend time on social media, they watch Netflix, IE and streaming service, but more often than not, it&#8217;s people gaming. And then you got to think about the Gen Zers where it&#8217;s like, I always talk about my little cousin who she&#8217;s addicted to Roblox and like, like these virtual worlds going on, it is like outer worldly things that we, you know, could fathom, but also can&#8217;t because we&#8217;re not in the weeds every day. Like the younger generation, the Gen Zers and the Gen to follow them, this is all they do. They love this shit. When you and I were young, I&#8217;m sure you were like me, I was playing road hockey or basketball or soccer or football on the streets, you know, that&#8217;s what I was doing. And then I had to come home for curfew or else my parents would kill me. And it&#8217;s like, we were out on the streets screwing around having fun. Nowadays kids, these were my best friends. Now their best friends are, you know, kids from halfway across the world in different countries who they&#8217;ve never met IRL, but they spend four or five hours a night shooting the shit with them. Like it&#8217;s a wild world that we live in and it&#8217;s going to get crazier and crazier. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I mean we&#8217;re playing hockey and baseball and basketball and football, but we were also playing Golden Eye and Halo I mean, you know, yeah, it&#8217;s been a key part of you know It&#8217;s very nostalgic video games all the way I used to get you know every console and 64 Nintendo and so I&#8217;m not necessarily a gamer playing them all the time today, but I recognize why it is a thing and why it&#8217;s important and why it has swallowed up all of media. And it will shape the rest of our lives moving forward gaming is it. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Yeah, it&#8217;s powerful. And again, competition is so powerful in life. And that&#8217;s just such an easy way to compete with very low barriers to entry. Ryan, you&#8217;ve been absolutely on fire, but we got to take a quick break. And folks, when we get back, we are going to jump more into Crucible and Open Meta DAO, which I cannot wait to get into.

Credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Ryan. Ryan, let&#8217;s jump right into it. Before we get into some of the nitty gritty stuff, and I can&#8217;t wait to get into the self sovereign identity, which again, verification of ID gaming. Absolutely huge. You guys are buzzing on this. Also the Emergence SDK, a toolkit for game developers, building interoperability into game worlds, massive. And we&#8217;ll conclude with some feature of the metaverse stuff. But until then, I love asking our guests for a little elevator pitch. Give me the elevator pitch on Crucible Network, and then we&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Elevator pitch is that the metaverse is the internet built by game developers, and if it&#8217;s not open, it&#8217;s a problem. It has to be open, and that&#8217;s what we exist for. And because it is game developers, we&#8217;ve designed tools for game developers to do that. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Walk me through some of those tools. Let&#8217;s start with the self-sovereign identity verification of ID and gaming, which is absolutely massive because you have people being fugazy here, fugazy there, fugazy everywhere. Everyone needs similar to how when you log on to a social media platform, and the only way you can really, truly get rid of bots is to verify them and or connect them to something that is singular like a phone number. There&#8217;s only one phone number, you can&#8217;t really replicate phone numbers. So that&#8217;s a great little way to look at it, but I&#8217;m gonna throw the ball over to your court, walk me through what you and the team are doing on the self-sovereign identity aspect of what you&#8217;re shipping out. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />So the product is emergence. There are a lot of sort of different innovative infrastructure around how we built emergence, but we&#8217;ve really sort of that is the product line. It&#8217;s an SDK on both the Unity and Unreal Engine right now. And it has all of these elements, right? So you can think of gaming as sort of exploded. And there&#8217;s all this innovation happening around Web3 and AI. There&#8217;s important things happening and it&#8217;s hard to keep up with. And so what we&#8217;ve done for game developers is package all that innovation into a set of tools and design it so it all feels like game development. We probably in the engines have the most traction of any SDK like this. We have about 40,000 downloads on the Unreal Engine, which is 4% of their total active developers. Still early, you know, downloads are happening, but games are super early in their life cycle of where they&#8217;re at and they&#8217;re shipping next year. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />And folks, just to jump in here, games take so frigging long to build. I&#8217;d love if you could just sort of chime in and let our listeners know how long it takes that to truly build a good frigging game. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Well, and that&#8217;s a good point. I think I internally with the team use this word game space. And it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m gonna use more because what we&#8217;re talking about in the sense of the Open Metaverse is not video games. We&#8217;re really used to playing video games which are thousands of people and the games take thousands of hours to complete. And if you&#8217;re talking triple A quality level work, I mean. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Half a decade. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah. I mean, it can take years and hundreds of millions of dollars of budget. And that isn&#8217;t necessarily what we&#8217;re saying is all going to be intropropable. And I hear this argument quite a lot, which is like Call of Duty and all these titles that we know that are video games that we understand already. And I think game space is a new concept to think about, right? Which is it feels more like a website, you know, it actually feels like a game, but in reality is more like a website. They&#8217;re all kind of networked together. You know, so the way we navigate all these websites and all these apps, it&#8217;s more like that than a video game. But it&#8217;s the experience of it actually feels more like a AAA game because these tools are making it much cheaper and much faster. Like we are very close to the point where one single developer can create something that feels like a AAA game. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have thousands of hours in its experience. Just like, you know, with AI tools, there&#8217;s going to be billion dollar companies created by one person. We&#8217;re very much at the 10x founder level, you know, where like the thing that one single founder or a small team can do is 10xing. So game space is this concept that I don&#8217;t really talk too much about yet, but we&#8217;re definitely going to. And yeah, it&#8217;s like a meta game. Think of it more like a meta game than a video game. It&#8217;s something that NFTs sort of scratch the surface of like with loot and with the narrative side of these collections and these characters. Like everybody sort of draws the invisible line of Board Apes to a video game or whatever. And very few of them have been able to make that leap because it&#8217;s quite hard to do, but that&#8217;s the next phase of it all. So it&#8217;s game space. And I think game space is not going to take as much as a video game does, but in the ways that matter the most, it&#8217;ll feel like a video game.  </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Interesting. Game Space, are you the only one buzzin&#8217; on this term, because I&#8217;ve never heard, again, I think you&#8217;re episode 276, 277. I&#8217;ve never heard this before. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I didn&#8217;t coin it, it&#8217;s existed. In fact, it comes primarily from a book. There&#8217;s three books that I read, well, sort of shaping Crucible. And one of those is called Gamer Theory. It&#8217;s by McKenzie Wark. And he&#8217;s a computer science philosopher. He looks at computer science and code through a philosophical lens. And, you know, he&#8217;s in academia as well. And so this is like a academic type book that talks about the concept of Game Space in our life. It&#8217;s not a video game. Video games are the digital, technological version of this, but we&#8217;ve always lived in games, you know, war is a game, the strategy of it, the two sides together. That&#8217;s why like chess and military strategy are so tightly compared. I think the show Billions does this really well, where they like, you know, they run a hedge fund, but they&#8217;re constantly spitting out all kinds of references of military strategy and chess strategy and social dynamic strategy. Cause all we&#8217;re playing games. That&#8217;s what we do, right? And so we shrink wrap different things into games. Even Uber is a game to see what car can pick you up quickest. And, you know, we&#8217;ve designed all of these things in game mechanics and game space is something that McKenzie used as a term, but I&#8217;m using it more in the sense that these are things that we&#8217;ll create. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Well said there. Let&#8217;s jump into the Open Metaverse. When you started, I mean, 20 minutes ago, when you started the show, you had a great little pitch on why the Open Metaverse is so important. But let&#8217;s just draw, we&#8217;ve drawn a bunch of comparisons to the show. Let&#8217;s let&#8217;s keep the comparison train rolling. Let&#8217;s definitely not let it stop. Building an Open Metaverse with open standards is absolutely paramount to success for Web3. And this would be, you know, this would be the exact opposite of the traditional Zuckerberg closed slash gated metaverse where it&#8217;s all through one single vehicle that allows you to play these games that we&#8217;re talking about. Why is it so important to build an open one? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />I think it&#8217;s necessary. I think it&#8217;s impossible to do it without it because, for example, open infrastructure, Web3, whatever you want to call it, is the only way to scale AI. There&#8217;s actually no possible way to do it without it. I think we need to shift the narrative from it&#8217;s like a nice to have, you know, up until now it&#8217;s been a nice to have. It&#8217;s like, if you bought Bitcoin, if you bought Ethereum, great for you. You know, I&#8217;m not interested in it. You made a lot of money. Great. If you were into NFTs, you like art also, great for you. I don&#8217;t really care that much about it. And now even with game developers, it&#8217;s sort of like, I really don&#8217;t care about it. Don&#8217;t make me do this. So it&#8217;s always been this sort of like, if you&#8217;re in it, you&#8217;re in it and it&#8217;s nice to have. But I think, you know, we&#8217;re going to start to see really quickly, it&#8217;s a must have. You must have it. And for the first principles, reasons why it was started in the first place, why not the speculative purely like profit seeking thing. That&#8217;s more of the economic incentive engine that was designed to get it to scale globally. There&#8217;s a reason, there&#8217;s a first principles reason why this matters. And that is a must have. There is no optional way of saying like, this is kind of just nice to have if you like it, you know, but again, AI hasn&#8217;t scaled to that point yet. And digital property ownership isn&#8217;t mattered to that many people yet, you know, and when it does, it&#8217;s the only way. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />When will it? Again, we&#8217;ve been, I&#8217;ve been doing this show since 2021. We&#8217;ve had dozens of guests come on and I agree with all of them. I do believe that interoperable Open Metaverse is the future, but we still haven&#8217;t had that catalyst. We still haven&#8217;t had that domino fall that where people are like, shit, I need to be in this or I need this to happen. And part of the reason is because people don&#8217;t like change, you know, humans are creatures of habit. It&#8217;s tough to go to an Open Metaverse when you have so many incredible games like the FIFA&#8217;s and the Fortnite&#8217;s and the Madden&#8217;s and the 2K&#8217;s and the CODs. I can go on and on. But what domino needs to fall in order for people, the, I&#8217;ll quantify people as more so Web2 gamers who are the largest demographic of gamers. What needs to happen in order for them to be like, damn, this is legit. This is something I want to be a part of. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />It&#8217;s gotta be fun. People have to care about it. So it&#8217;s a combination of it just being fun and also not too complicated. And at the same time, there&#8217;s a big generational shift that&#8217;ll take place where not necessarily our generation, but though definitely the one that&#8217;s younger, I don&#8217;t know what we call them, Gen Z, I guess. Like they just get it. It&#8217;s hard, they already live it. So it&#8217;s like when they kinda, when they step up, it&#8217;s just a different paradigm, it&#8217;s a different lifestyle. The problem I think generationally is like those who control things are still very much of older generation that don&#8217;t understand this at all. And will likely never want to change their paradigm at scale. There&#8217;s a few that you find, I mean, I talked to older people in their 60s, 70s, 80s that like love this stuff, cause they&#8217;re just very optimistic. But in general, like there&#8217;s a difference generationally. And we&#8217;re caught in the middle. As millennials, I think we&#8217;re caught in the middle of like, there&#8217;s some of us, but it&#8217;s not all of us. But by the time it gets to Gen Z, it&#8217;s pretty much all. You start to get down to like high school kids and like, I don&#8217;t remember the exact number. You could look at, there&#8217;s a Jeffery Study by this, but it&#8217;s like between 95 and 98% to play in these games. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />What does the future of the metaverse look like? And this is a question I ask all the time. I&#8217;ve heard many different answers, but there seems to be one similar thread that intertwines everything. And again, this is really one of the main topics of the show, which is just it&#8217;s open and it&#8217;s interoperable. But that&#8217;s more on the macro side. If we could get more to the micro side of things, what is the future of the metaverse actually look like? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />It starts to look like a digital economy you can walk through like I we&#8217;ve had a physical economy you can walk through So it&#8217;s like a pretty easy concept to learn. But like the economy is just becoming more and more digital. Yeah, we have all these kind of buzzwords and terminology for it, but you look at the what the internet means to you today and you look at how the internet was defined in the 90s and it&#8217;s not a different definition It just actually resonates with you because you use it all all the time. So in the 90s, you&#8217;re gonna define the internet and email the same way that you define it today, and it&#8217;s not like those words do a better job today than they did in the 90s. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s become life, you know, so you don&#8217;t get so caught up on the words. You just inherently understand it, you know, and it&#8217;s a part of your life and it&#8217;ll be the same things. It&#8217;s like the words that we use to describe this stuff won&#8217;t change It just will become a bigger part of our life. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />What year do you think if you were to throw a bit of a hot take, we might as well jump in the hot take factory at the segment started, which is always one of our favorites and concluding segment to the show. But if you were to, if you were a gambling man and you were to pick a year or a stretch of years where the Open Metaverse is actually going to pop off, what&#8217;s your thesis slash bet there? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a singular time, but I like this. I used to do this a lot. I used to get like 12 people together at a time to make bold predictions and start arguing with each other. So my bold prediction is that the Open Metaverse already started, but it&#8217;s the prologue of it. And that next year is the year where games start shipping that are fun that people like. And in the same way that like free to play in gaming was violently pushed back against, but created the space for mobile gaming and for Fortnite and grew that industry so meaningfully that like everybody that pushed back against free to play now just feels like that was a stupid idea. Cause there&#8217;s really nobody arguing against that anymore. The full interoperability is the next full measure, I believe. And I think next year is where these things start to ship and people spend time in them. And what is the Fortnite or Roblox or Minecraft of that? I don&#8217;t know. Part of the NFT game was like choosing, putting those bets donn and choosing who it will be. But I think to me, I&#8217;m built, what we&#8217;re built for, what Crucible&#8217;s built for, what Open Meta is built for starts next year. So even though I started it in 2018 and COVID sped us up, it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s just been plumbing, up until now. And I get it, it&#8217;s frustrating to put bets down and be early, but like, don&#8217;t get so caught staring down at the ground that you think it&#8217;s dead or that it&#8217;s wrong. Because I see a lot of like these articles like the metaverse is dead and people point to meta and people point to Decentraland and Sandbox and the numbers of people. And fine, let&#8217;s say the metaverse is dead, so long live the Open Metaverse. Let&#8217;s move on from that concept of the metaverse, which we say is dead, didn&#8217;t work, and let&#8217;s move forward to what really needs to be. And so like, that&#8217;s a great way to reclaim that narrative. But I think we will look back and say that 2024 was like the first year, and then the bull market that happens will be another huge rush into digital assets, digital property, new stories, new IP. Like NFTs failed economically, but a lot of great important kind of IP exploration and experimentation came from that. So I will make a bold prediction. I believe that new forms of narrative in digital assets, digital property as a new place to tell stories will be the focal point of the next bull market. It will be through what feels like gaming, but I really believe that narrative&#8217;s the more important thing. If you look, here&#8217;s basically my thinking on that. If you look at NFTs and say that was Wall Street, right? And NFTs was pretty much just Wall Street speculation with a glimpse of storytelling and character. And that&#8217;s kind of what hooked people about one collection over another one. But then you look at streaming and how much time everybody spends film and television and move like this sort of episodic storytelling. I mean, everybody on the planet is sort of hooked onto that. And as like storytelling has always been an important part of our species. And so I think the next part of this looks like where the NFT space moves away from Wall Street and starts to look more like what&#8217;s on streaming. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Well said. Ryan, you&#8217;ve been on a roll here. We are getting tight for time. Gotta have you on for round two because we barely scratched the surface here, but this has been an absolute treat of an episode. Really appreciate you coming on. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you, Crucible and Open Meta online and on socials. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I am @RyanCrucible on pretty much everything. Email&#8217;s Ryan@crucible.network. If you go to my Twitter, I have in my bio, you can find @CrucibleNetwork on Twitter. You can find @OpenMetaDAO on Twitter. crucible.network is the website, and then openmeta.xyz. Just to clarify, Crucible is the business, and what we&#8217;ve done is create our community into a DAO. We&#8217;ll do the sort of big public sale and everything next year when the timing is right, and turn this into that movement that I refer to. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />What an episode. Ryan thanks again man. Truly a treat. Pumped to have you on for round two. Wishing you and the team all the best and we&#8217;ll keep in touch. </p>

It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We&#8217;re buzzing as always, and I am super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, the one and only Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global, coming in hot from Bermuda. Wow, that must suck. Oliver is head of CEO at Bittrex Global, one of the world&#8217;s most secure digital asset exchanges. He also has over a decade of experience as a financial regulatory lawyer, having advised major investment banks, exchanges, and leading financial institutions on regulatory matters across the EEA, UK, and US. During his tenure with a leading global law firm, he specialized in various areas of financial regulatory advisory work, with particular expertise in advising exchanges, clearinghouses, and other financial market infrastructure companies. Super pumped to have this lad on. Ollie, welcome to show my friend.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>A real pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m pumped to have you on. How nice is that, you know, going from UK to the one and only island? How, what&#8217;s it like on the island? How freaking sweet is it?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m here quite a lot of the time. We&#8217;re regulated in Bermuda. We&#8217;re also regulated in Liechtenstein. So, I get to spend some of my time in two of the most beautiful countries in the world. But what&#8217;s really exciting about being here is we&#8217;ve just had Bermuda Tech Week on the island. And there&#8217;s a real buzz, a real excitement about digital asset sector in Bermuda. And it&#8217;s really showing the way forward and the way that actually the future of crypto can be regulated, heavily regulated. But that can lead to its own level of enthusiasm and excitement. And it&#8217;s just an engagement here in Bermuda for digital assets for crypto in general, that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen anywhere else in the world. So, it&#8217;s a real pleasure to be here, not just because of the regulatory environment, but because of the business environment too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How would a place like Bermuda differ from, say, Dubai or Singapore, which are two spots in the world that are also very open to digital assets and crypto? What&#8217;s the vibe like? I know that&#8217;s a tough question coming from you on my end, but if you could sort of depict not so much the Kwan, but more the Kual, like how it feels being there, what are the main differences? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been to both those spots as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I have. I&#8217;ve been lucky to do a lot of work in those spots as well. I think the difference here is Bermuda was such an early adopter, the Digital Assets and Business Act, which is still in many ways the world&#8217;s leading light on how to do crypto regulation properly. That was adopted here in 2018. In crypto years, that&#8217;s about 50 years ago, right? So there&#8217;s just a real sense here of not resting on their laurels, building something up, but it&#8217;s difficult really to compare it to Dubai or to compare it to Singapore because we&#8217;re an island here of 55,000, 60,000 people. They&#8217;re not trying to compete as a hub in the way that Dubai might be or Singapore might be. What they&#8217;re trying to do is show that actually what you need to make crypto a success is a proper fit for purpose bespoke regulation that has been carefully designed with crypto first and crypto in mind, coupled with a regulator that has real world experience and knows how to actually supervise and monitor financial services firms. I don&#8217;t mean crypto firms, I mean financial services firms. In Bermuda here, the BMA has that experience when it comes to insurance. Lichtenstein again, the regulator there, the FMA, had that experience in that case in the case of private wealth and banking. It&#8217;s really that synergy, those two things working together. You can write whatever pretty words you want on a page. Anyone can do that. Anyone can copy and paste. What they&#8217;re doing here in Bermuda and what they&#8217;re really showing is how that can come to life and how that can be actually, of course, be good and respected around the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, well said. I mean, I&#8217;m all for these smaller islands, really making moves. And again, just like you spoke about two minutes ago, it&#8217;s such a large asset class, not even just financial, but in the whole world economy. It&#8217;s so important. We&#8217;re becoming more and more digital every day, and we really need some solid and legit regulatory framework. But before we get into a bunch of that stuff, I&#8217;d love to learn a little bit more about you the star, the show. Tell me about your career. Let&#8217;s even go a little bit before that childhood. Where did you grow up? What did you fancy? Sounds like you got that beautiful British accent with football team you support. Tell me a little bit about you, and then we&#8217;ll get into Bittrex Global, your career, and a bunch of the regulatory stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. I&#8217;m very boring because I&#8217;m a lawyer and lawyers are by definition just a little bit dull. Now, I&#8217;m kidding, but I am a lawyer. I grew up in London. I spent my whole life there. I&#8217;d like to say that when I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut or firemen or whatever it is. But I think something in me that always just thought I&#8217;d probably, I don&#8217;t remember when I was a kid, but at some point I&#8217;d be joined to the law. And the reason for that is I realized very early on that law has the potential to actually allow people to interact properly. And it allows everything. If I go to an apple coffin trying to buy an apple, I know that what I&#8217;m going to get is an apple and not a pear. I know that it&#8217;s not going to be poisoned because there&#8217;s going to be some kind of food standards. And the vendor knows it&#8217;s exactly. And the vendor knows he&#8217;s going to get 50 pence from me. And if he doesn&#8217;t, and he can sue and he&#8217;s got certain actions, those principles allow me to go and buy an apple from an apple cart. Without that, most of the time it would work. But when it doesn&#8217;t work, then we&#8217;re all at sea. And it&#8217;s become increasingly apparent to me as I&#8217;ve worked more and more in the crypto sector, that without that fundamental, and that&#8217;s the same rules that apply to buying an apple from an apple cart to multi-billion dollar transactions. Without that, you just don&#8217;t have the confidence to do anything. You don&#8217;t have the confidence, you don&#8217;t know what the rules of the game are to have any kind of interaction with any kind of person. So that&#8217;s kind of what sort of motivated me to get into law. And I spent then a decade plus as a regulatory advisory lawyer, I was fortunate enough to specialize quite early and advise some of the world&#8217;s largest banks, traditional exchanges, broker dealers, the whole gamut of regulatory environments in the traditional finance sphere, focusing on financial market infrastructure. So exchanges, clearing houses, data repositories, that was kind of my niche. And then I guess about, I don&#8217;t know, in the last five years or so of that, I started working more and more in the Middle East. I was involved in some of the mega projects out there, including in Saudi Arabia with the Neon Project and those were very tech focused. They were very tech focused and they wanted to be like, and still want to be very futuristic, bin tech driven. And so you sort of get, you get traditional exchanges plus tech, mash them together, you sort of get crypto. And so here I am. And I joined Bittrex Global, actually originally as general counsel in 2021, and then got to bump up to the CEO chair last year. So I&#8217;ve been doing both of those since then.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>What got you on about crypto Oliver? Like again, you, I assume, one should never assume, but here I am assuming, but I assume you were making a pretty penny and had a very cushy job. Again, there&#8217;s not many financial regulatory, world-class lawyers in the world, people like you definitely do not grow on trees. And moving to the crypto sector was definitely a massive, massive risk. Why the jump? Why did you do it? What, what tickled your fancy? What made you move to the crypto sphere?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think it was a combination of things, but at Root is the opportunity to be involved in, I think, the biggest conversation that has been had and will be had for generations to come. I think blockchain technology is genuine. Everything is described as disruptive these days. I mean, I got out of bed this morning and I stubbed my toe and I was disruptive. Everything is important and everything is meaningful, but I think blockchain technology is genuinely disruptive and meaningful and we&#8217;re only beginning to scratch the surface of it. I think the opportunity to be in, if not quite at the ground level, then pretty damn close to the ground level is something that really appealed to me. I wanted to be part of building something and be part of shaping something. I think the two years that I&#8217;ve been involved, we&#8217;ve seen a dramatic change in the ethos of the sector as a whole. We&#8217;ve seen regulators be that the EU with MECA, the UK with its consultation paper that came out earlier this year, Dubai you mentioned earlier, Singapore, Hong Kong. We&#8217;ve seen jurisdictions around the world realize that actually this stuff is important and it&#8217;s not going anywhere and they&#8217;ve got to get a grip on it. Being part of helping shape that is really important. That regulatory side of it is really important to me personally because if you don&#8217;t create a path for good actors to behave well and to show people how crypto can actually be used for good and to create opportunities for people that don&#8217;t otherwise exist, you don&#8217;t create that good path. All you really do is clear the way for bad actors to behave badly. For me, that&#8217;s the power of what regulation can do and should be doing. Ultimately, it&#8217;s important to remember these regulations and these frameworks aren&#8217;t here to make geeky lawyers like me feel good about ourselves. Although I do, they&#8217;re there to protect people. They&#8217;re there to protect the most vulnerable and those people that we&#8217;ve spent decades in the traditional finance sector designing a patchwork of protections around. To my mind, there&#8217;s no reason that those same protections, the same principles, should suddenly not be important or should fly out the window just because you put the word digital at the front of it. I think the opportunity is really here to create both the characteristics for these jurisdictions. The characteristics, people want to get involved in this stuff. They want to participate. They want to innovate. There&#8217;s some incredibly exciting opportunities that crypto affords people that the traditional finance simply either can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t. If they can capture a bit of that, and that&#8217;s what, say my native UK, when they talk about becoming a crypto hub, that&#8217;s what they mean. They want to capture a piece of that and say, yeah, we want to foster that innovation, promote that entrepreneurialism. That&#8217;s a great carrot. The stick is, if you get it wrong, there could be a scandal. There are jurisdictions that are highly motivated by the possibility of a scandal, are scared of that possibility, but actually are quickly realizing that the best way to handle that is not to stick your head in the sand and pretend the whole thing doesn&#8217;t exist, but rather to create a framework for it being done properly. The absence of rules is not a solution. It&#8217;s a cop-out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How does someone like me who has zero regulatory framework experience and obviously is not a member of the bar, a member of the law, how do we even go about thinking what types of framework rules and regulations need to be implemented in order for crypto to actually be legit? And I love the analogy used earlier. You know, well, I&#8217;m paraphrasing, but life&#8217;s a big game, right? We&#8217;re all in one arena. If you don&#8217;t know the rules, you can&#8217;t win. If you don&#8217;t know the rules, it&#8217;s almost zero sum. You&#8217;re automatically losing. As an industry, how do we set legit rules that actually have positive emphasis on all players of the game and let everyone have an equal share at potentially winning for a lack of better words? Like what needs to be done? And I understand this is very tough and nuanced question. And I apologize in advance for throwing this at you, but and I&#8217;ve asked this many times and it&#8217;s tough to get a really, really good answer. If you were, let&#8217;s say, head of, you know, global crypto for the whole world, obviously, that&#8217;s not a thing. But if you had that power, what would you do in order to make legit rules so people can participate and have a chance at winning?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I think at the end, you came really close to where my answer is, right? Which is, the real question is, how does the average person in old fashioned English law, we call them the man on the clapper mom, the bus, the guy just going about his business, right? How does he know that he&#8217;s protected and can engage in crypto in a positive and secure way? And the answer is, or the answer ought to be, because we&#8217;ve created minimum standards around the world that mean that he can enter into any transaction under the legitimate jurisdiction with the same confidence. So let me give you an example. If you want to go and buy shares, you might understand what shares are, you might know what you want to achieve, and you might even have a good idea of what companies it is you want to invest in. But you basically know that if you need to go and buy those shares in New York, or London, or Tokyo, or Amsterdam, or Australia, wherever it is, the rules are basically the same. Sure, there are local variations and there are slightly different ways of doing things, and there are maybe slightly different processes. But at core, you&#8217;re going to get the same level of protection, you&#8217;re going to have the same rules about transparency, you&#8217;re going to have the same rules about, you know, if they&#8217;re cooling off periods, you&#8217;re going to have the same rules about insider trading. It doesn&#8217;t really matter to you as an individual where it is you end up. And that&#8217;s because we have international sammlet setters, in the case of exchanges, that CPSS IOSCO, setting out the principles for financial market infrastructure that essentially you know, so long as you&#8217;re playing in a legitimate jurisdiction, you&#8217;re going to get the same general level of protection. We don&#8217;t have that in crypto yet, and we need it. And I think we&#8217;re getting there, but far too slowly. That doesn&#8217;t require a, what was it you called it, global world head of crypto, which all sounds a bit James Bond villain to me, but it does require a level of coordination to eliminate old -fashioned regulatory arbitrage. It shouldn&#8217;t be a feature of doing crypto any more than it&#8217;s a feature of transaction on traditional exchanges. So that&#8217;s what we need. And we&#8217;re getting there. Right? And the way we&#8217;re getting there, look, I mean, you just had the EU adopting MECA, that&#8217;s the largest legal jurisdiction in the world to have adopted a comprehensive regulatory framework. It can be done. It is being done. You know, the G8 is looking at it, G20 is looking at it, IOSCO themselves are looking at it. And I&#8217;m impatient. And it&#8217;s important to remember, like, it took decades to get to that stage in judicial finance. And we&#8217;re talking about doing that same thing in, you know, minutes, hours, years, maybe, in crypto. So we are impatient, but I&#8217;m impatient because I, you know, I see every day the opportunities that are there and the success stories that people want to be participating in. But yeah, we need to make sure that those protections are there and that people can do it against that backdrop.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Incredibly well said there. Is there it seems like an obvious question? And perhaps I&#8217;m incredibly wrong here. But is there one country, ie the USA that could potentially actually adopt proper crypto framework rules and regulations that would be that domino effect for the rest of the world to join in? Because again, it seems like you have the device that Bermuda, the Singapore&#8217;s, the Hong Kong&#8217;s that have been proactive and actually want to move the needle and make this shit happen. But, you know, without the UK&#8217;s and the United States of America&#8217;s, I mean, my country, Canada, where Joe come running and throw us in that ring. But you know, the big dogs, if they actually implement framework, will that be the catalyst and will that be the domino that sort of kicks off the parade?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;m not going to pretend that there is one catalyst that will solve the whole thing. I think the UK and the US are two really good examples at the moment. The UK is sending out somewhat mixed messages. The government is sending out these, you know, we want to be a crypto hub and we know the prime minister when he was trying to do at least with very pro crypto, we want to be a hub, we want to attract investment, some very high profile investment announcements earlier this year with A16Z and all that kind of stuff on the one hand. And then on the other hand, the new rules on financial promotions which came in last week are extremely difficult to comply with them. And we certainly have to put a lot of time and resources and effort into ensuring that we comply with them, even when they contradicted themselves and were very quite difficult to follow. And I think it&#8217;s really easy to forget that these things do need to be thought through very carefully and that solutions are not straightforward. But it just goes to show how it can be done. The US is a different problem altogether. Because the US, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone now that doubts that the US regulatory environment is so impossible to navigate as to effectively make business impossible. Like, you know, when I said earlier, if you don&#8217;t create a good path for good people to act, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s lacking. And Bittrex US, which is separate from Bittrex Global, but previously existed in the US and served US customers, they just looked at it and said, well, look, we just don&#8217;t know what to do here. We spent a lot of money on expensive lawyers and we simply don&#8217;t know how it is possible to comply. So we&#8217;re just going to get out of the US. And they&#8217;re not the only ones And it&#8217;s really sad. And it&#8217;s tempting. You know, I used to say, the great joy of being CEO of Bittrex Global is I don&#8217;t just worry about the US. I need to worry about the SEC. But that&#8217;s not true. That&#8217;s always naive, right? Because the US is still the single largest economy in the world. It&#8217;s still the place for entrepreneurialism, for innovation. You&#8217;ve got the best universities. You&#8217;ve got the infrastructure. And if the future of crypto is just part of the wider financial services sector, which is why I think it&#8217;s going, then to think you can do that without the US is I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s naive. You can&#8217;t just pull down the shutters and pretend the US doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s too important for that. So we do need some movement in the US. It looks like, you know, maybe we&#8217;re going to get some in the coming months or years. Who knows? But at the moment, the chaos, the confusion is just impossible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it&#8217;s truly banana land&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s a pure bread shit show. And again, it&#8217;s unfortunate because a lot of us, myself included, are like, oh, there&#8217;s a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. And now it&#8217;s like, oh, sweet. Now we have two wars on our hand, potentially World War III. We have one of the most bleak and terrible economical outlooks that we&#8217;ve had probably since 2008. And of course, we have an election next year. I mean, I often say we even though I&#8217;m not American, it&#8217;s just as a Canadian, you&#8217;re technically a byproduct of America. So even though you&#8217;re Canadian, you&#8217;re technically American.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think the king disagrees, but I&#8217;m not so sure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. But look, Oli, we got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor, the show. And when we get back, we are going to get into everything Bittrex global related, a little bit of history, the awesome win by you guys with SEC. And like Oli spoke about as well, Bittrex USA, which is now, I guess, no longer a part of Bittrex global. Well, it is, but it isn&#8217;t. We&#8217;ll get into that in one second.

And now back to the show with Oliver. Let&#8217;s get into Bittrex. Star the show here. Bittrex global, excuse me, not just Bittrex. You got to walk me through and walk our listeners through the SEC lawsuit. What exactly happened there? The split of, you know, Bittrex as a whole and then Bittrex global, Bittrex USA. It seems like many crypto exchanges have unfortunately followed, well, I guess, fortunately is rather the correct word, the same suit. And again, this is just cherry on the cake, fortifying your point from about two minutes ago. America has no clue what they&#8217;re doing when it comes to crypto regulation. And if you have an exchange there, you either pretty much only operate there or you operate for every other country in the world. It&#8217;s absolute bananas. The floor is yours. Tell us what happened. And I guess start with a little bit of history of Bittrex because you guys are indeed one of the longest and, you know, in most secure exchanges on the planet as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I think the history helps. So Bittrex was set up in the US, established in 2013, 2014, and serviced US customers. And then as the global footprint got bigger, in 2018, 2019, they decided to set up an entirely separate company, which became Bittrex Global. And so Bittrex US was never part of Bittrex Global. Bittrex Global was never part of the US. They were entirely separate companies, still are entirely separate companies, different boards, different staff, just sharing the name Bittrex. Now, here&#8217;s what was the case. And in Bittrex US, earlier this year, decided that it could no longer continue to operate in the US. And so it shut down and it&#8217;s going through its mind down process at the moment. Bittrex Global, which only serves rest of world customers, doesn&#8217;t allow any US customers onto its platform, doesn&#8217;t offer its services into the US, and has always operated in that way, continues to operate unaffected by the shutdown of Bittrex US. The SEC case, they came and they said that both Bittrex US and Bittrex Global were operating as an unregistered exchange in the US. Now, from my perspective, we&#8217;ve settled that suit with the SEC on a neither admit nor deny basis. So we&#8217;ve neither admitted nor denied the charges. We&#8217;ve decided to draw a line under it and move on. We&#8217;re doing one of these that we do best, which is serving our customers. And we were pleased to have been able to just draw a line and move on. And others have not been so lucky, have not been able to do that so far, and are still subject to the confusion that we were talking about a few minutes ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, the couple year&#8217;s down the road if the USA gets their ducks in the row. Is there a way back in? Like, could it happen? Will it happen? Or is it is it so far gone that it&#8217;s like, eh, c&rsquo;est la vie, we&#8217;re going to move on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t know. I mean, Bittrex Global will never be in the US. That&#8217;s for sure. I don&#8217;t know whether anyone at Bittrex will still be around and want to get involved. But I think the question is more about the industry as a whole, right? Which is like, what can the US do now to keep those people that haven&#8217;t yet fled or reattract those people that have? And I think the answer there is actually quite straightforward. We need clarity. We need rules. We need to know what we&#8217;re doing. We need that apple cart. We need to know how to engage because without that, you couldn&#8217;t possibly set up a new business in the US without that regulatory clarity. And it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re asking them to reinvent the wheel. We know what it looks like. I can go and write it for them if they want. But it&#8217;s a political, not a legal problem. They only need to look as far across as Bermuda to have a regulatory framework that works. And if that&#8217;s not enough, and I&#8217;ve, of course, acknowledged that there&#8217;s a big difference between Bermuda with its small population and the US, but its global financial clout. So Bermuda doesn&#8217;t work. Look at the EU. The EU managed it with MECA. Nobody has ever accused the EU of being nimble. No one has ever accused the EU of having straightforward political processes, but they managed it. So I&#8217;m not naive enough to think that one lawyer shouting into a microphone is going to change anything. But we have to recognize that it&#8217;s a political problem, much more than a legal one. When people say it&#8217;s too difficult or there&#8217;s, you know, we don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s left or right. Like we do. We know what it&#8217;s going to look like. We know what it needs to look like. It comes back to what we were talking about with global standard setters. Like this isn&#8217;t reinventing the wheel. This is getting it done in the US. And I don&#8217;t know enough about the US political process to know who needs to crack, who&#8217;s heads together. But they better get on to it quickly. Otherwise, the US is really going to suffer. And ultimately, you know, the important thing to note here is that it&#8217;s the US citizens to suffer. And they&#8217;re being failed twice. They&#8217;re being failed twice. They&#8217;re being failed the first time because they&#8217;re not going to be allowed access and not going to have access to all of those opportunities that DLT, blockchain technology and crypto is affording people around the world. So they&#8217;re being failed on that level. And they&#8217;re being failed because they&#8217;re also not going to be getting the protections that a proper regulatory regime can afford them. And exactly those people that are most in need of a regulatory framework are being left hung out to dry by the complete refusal to engage in a proper regulatory framework. So, you know, it&#8217;s sad for the industry, but it&#8217;s even more sad for those people that are most in need of actual action.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said. A little off topic here, Ali, but one thing that I want to say partly gets my blood boiling, but partly just literally makes me laugh out loud is all of the political members in the States who do insider trading. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen the Nancy Pelosi stock trader on Twitter. She&#8217;s up like what, 150% in the last year. Last week you had multiple governors, multiple people in politics who bought army and war stocks before Saturday. And for the listeners, this episode is going to air on Thursday, the 20th of October, I believe, but last week you had Palestine and Israel and you&#8217;ve had senders and legitimate political people in the States buying, like how the hell does this keep happening? Like, what do you think about that? To me, I think it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s laughable on all ends. I&#8217;m a bit jealous as well, because I&#8217;d love to make some cake on that, but what&#8217;s your two cents in that regard?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, I don&#8217;t know enough about the US political system or about the specifics of what&#8217;s going on there, but I think the principle is really important, which is that whenever you have rules about trading and about transparency, clarity is the most important thing. People need to feel not only are the rules fair, but they&#8217;re being applied in a fair way. I don&#8217;t know whether X, Y, or Z person or I should say Z person has done it, whatever it is they&#8217;re accused of having done. But I think the lesson that we can learn across the financial services sector is people get really annoyed about this stuff. It really creates this them and us mentality. And it&#8217;s not just politicians. There&#8217;s a sense that, and this is something that the crypto can really help with, the sense that if you&#8217;re rich, you play by different rules. And actually the financial services sector is designed like that. There&#8217;s a whole suite of products in the traditional finance sphere where we say to people, sorry, these are complex financial products. You can&#8217;t have access to them. You&#8217;re too poor or too stupid. You&#8217;re not allowed to play here. And no wonder they get annoyed at that. No wonder they think the system is stacked against them. And actually no wonder then they look to crypto and say, well, look, help us out here. How can we get involved? We&#8217;re not too stupid. We want some exposure to this kind of stuff. We&#8217;re willing to educate ourselves. We&#8217;re willing to play by the rules. But we&#8217;re just being shut out of the door. We&#8217;re not even getting a foot in the door. We&#8217;re just being told no. And that&#8217;s one of the many opportunities that the crypto is affording people around the world. And that&#8217;s before you even come to the issue of people that can&#8217;t get bank accounts and don&#8217;t have access to traditional banking at all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. Let&#8217;s jump into Bittrex Global here. Give myself and listeners a little primer about what you guys are working on and what&#8217;s going to pop off for the next couple of years. I know you got a shitload of stuff in the pipeline. Already one of the most established and secure global exchanges on the planet. We&#8217;d love to see that. We need more guys like you and more exchanges like Bittrex that actually take care of customers and not the FTXs and the other scumbags that are in the space. But give us a quick primer on what exactly you guys are doing right now and what you have planned over the next couple of years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. Obviously, at the moment, we&#8217;re suffering through this bear market. So when I say it&#8217;s an exciting time, it kind of sounds weird, but it&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s an exciting time. And it&#8217;s exciting because I think the scandals of last year have bossed people back to basics. People have realized that actually the Bittrex global approach, which has always been focused on our core products, focused on our principles of security, innovation and regulation, and provide to people a straightforward but incredibly robust spot exchange is actually now seen as a breath of fresh air to people. And it&#8217;s all of the additional bells and whistles and complications and bright neon lights and headline grabbing that we&#8217;d never engaged in. That seems to have got a lot of people into a lot of trouble. And actually, even down to things like, look at the structure charts coming out of the FTX hearings, and obviously, the trial of Sandbank Mifru is coming on now. Yeah, I spent my time as a regulatory lawyer. I&#8217;ve seen some pretty damn complicated charts in my time for entirely legitimate reasons. I&#8217;m not going to say, wow, it&#8217;s not just one company. They must have been not something nefarious. I&#8217;m not an idiot. But even I and my close friends and people I&#8217;ve worked with for a long time looked at them when, poof, we can&#8217;t make heads or tails of this. How was anyone supposed to know who it was they were trying to act with? When FTX said they were regulated, you weren&#8217;t actually facing that regulated entity. You were like the services being provided from God only knows where. Actually, Bittrex Global, if you&#8217;re a customer of Bittrex Global Bermuda Limited, you go on the website and it says you&#8217;re a customer of Bittrex Global Bermuda Limited. And then you go on the BMA&#8217;s register of authorized regulated companies it&#8217;s Bittrex Global Bermuda Limited. And it&#8217;s so stupid that I have to say that. I&#8217;m saying something novel or exciting. That&#8217;s how it should be. But there are people receiving services and they just don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re getting them from. They don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re getting them. And so what we&#8217;re focused on is, as I say, our three principles, security, innovation, and regulation. Security is at the heart of everything that we do. Our founders are security engineers. By background, the entire premise of Bittrex was they wanted to get involved in crypto, looked at what was out there from a security perspective and realized it all sucked. And they could either lose all their money on other exchanges or they could write their own. So they decided to write their own. And the foundation method the company, I say method, it almost certainly didn&#8217;t happen like this. But apparently over the course of the weekend, they sat down in one of their basements and wrote the code that became Bittrex. Like, okay, maybe it was a couple of weeks, but it&#8217;s a good story, right? And in the wake of the scandals from last year, people are suddenly massively animated by that as well as they should be. Innovation, similarly, are we going to go for the headline grabbing, but ultimately empty promises? No, absolutely not. What are we going to do? What are we going to work with in our regular issue frameworks, engage deeply with our customers on what it is they want to see, what features they want, how to make the platform work for them, and provide them that. And I think there&#8217;s people that try and say that there&#8217;s a trade-off between regulation and innovation. I don&#8217;t buy that at all. I don&#8217;t agree with that at all. I think regulation provides you the framework within which to innovate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>You need to know the rules. You can&#8217;t know the rules. You can&#8217;t win. Like it&#8217;s as simple as that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think that&#8217;s right. And it gives you a framework and it says, right, here is some space in which you can innovate, go out and do it. And then finally, of course, regulation, working in conjunction with the other two, that&#8217;s how we run people&#8217;s trust back. There&#8217;s a complete lack of trust at the moment. There&#8217;s a complete antipathy, I think, towards a lot of crypto, especially in the retail space. The institutions are different. Institutions, I think, is still really interested and still really engaging in crypto. But at the retail level, we need to win people&#8217;s trust back. And we&#8217;re not going to do that by being showy and having more culture personality and SBF like nonsense. We&#8217;re going to do that by being deliberate, concise, conservative, calm. And dare I say it, just a little bit boring.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, no, very well said. Oliver this has been an absolute treat. One more thing on Bittrex here. Next couple of years, what do you guys have popping off? Anything for us, people on the outside to look forward to?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>There&#8217;s an awful lot on the pipeline right now. They say during bear markets you should build. And so we&#8217;ve been building away. We&#8217;ve got a lot of interesting features coming up, some product lines coming up. You&#8217;ll have to watch this phase.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love it. Sounds good. Quick little segment in the hot take factory and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. I feel like you&#8217;ve got a bunch of spicy ones, which I can&#8217;t wait to hear. It doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto, blockchain, regulation related, can be health, wealth, happiness, AI, space, politics, war, you name it. But any Oli hot takes before we let you go.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Hot takes I mean, the one I&#8217;m going to come back to is always do your own research. The joy of crypto, the joy of this space is the unlike traditional finance. With enough time and effort, you can actually find out what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;ve spoken to some of the most sophisticated derivatives traders that the city has to offer. And at heart, they can&#8217;t always really explain what of this they&#8217;re trading. That&#8217;s not true of crypto. The information is out there. It can be done. And that&#8217;s how you gain confidence in what you&#8217;re doing. So you can never read enough, you can never learn enough. And if that has to be in a sweet little phrase of do your own research, then so be it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Just added that to the show notes. DYOR folks, one of the, probably one of the best and most underrated term in all of crypto. Oliver, what an episode. Thank you so much for coming on. Truly appreciate it and knee jump for round two as we barely scratched the surface here. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Bittrex Global online and on socials.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Absolutely. So our website is bittrexglobal.com. Our Twitter handle is @BittrexGlobal, unless you&#8217;re in the UK, because of those new UK rules that come in, where you have to go to @BittrexGlobalUk, and you can find me @OliverLinch. Hey, it&#8217;s important. You don&#8217;t mess around with these things.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I know. No, it is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>And you can find me @OliverLinch, both on LinkedIn and on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Hey, when are you coming to my homeland? When are you guys gonna open up shop in Canada? Or you&#8217;re like, nah, we don&#8217;t want that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>You know, we have a good partnership with a firm in Canada. And, you know, you guys are doing some interesting things out there. There&#8217;s actually a Canadian association in Bermuda that are working lobbying on how to make some waves in Canada too. So, you know, maybe next time we have this conversation, I&#8217;ll be able to put you guys up there with the EU and Dubai and Singapore and those jurisdictions that are really pushing to make grips or a thing. And, you know, I&#8217;m not kidding on that. You know, there&#8217;s going to be jurisdictions around the world saying, how do we get in on the action?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. I mean, very unlikely for my country, but c&rsquo;est la vie. Oli what an episode. Thanks again, man. Truly appreciate it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thanks, Matt. Really appreciate it, sir.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global. He was dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center. Anything regulatory framework related security, innovation, regulation. He talked about it, learned a ton. Guys, I hope you enjoyed this one. I certainly did. If you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I. Speaking to the team, love you guys so much. Thank you for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor. You are the GOAT and you know it. I love you. Back to the listeners. Love you guys. Thank you for always as listening. Keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy and keep on growing those bags. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.&nbsp;</p>
