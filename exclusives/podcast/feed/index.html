<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show. This gentleman might have the nicest and best beard in all of the crypto sphere. We have Frederik Gregaard, coming in hot today, the CEO of the Cardano Foundation, a true leader in fintech and blockchain, who has a background in banking, and wealth management and asset management. He joined the Cardano Foundation in 2020 and leads work across the Foundation&#8217;s three core focus areas, operational resilience, education, and adoption. These focuses guide all of the Foundation&#8217;s activities, and his work has enabled expedited value creation for inclusive and equitable growth using Cardano with the overall goal of decentralized, efficient, and secure economic empowerment for all. Been waiting for this one for a hot minute. Super pumped to have this lad on. Fred, welcome to the show, my friend. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I&#8217;m doing excellent. Thank you for asking and thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you. I got to start with the beard. You have the most electric beard in all the crypto. How long have you been supporting that bad boy for?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a really good question. I don&#8217;t know, like eight, nine years probably, something like that. When I started losing my top hair, I was getting really frustrated. I thought, hey, what can I do? And it turns out I can grow a beard.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Have you ever, so it&#8217;s been eight years, even me. I mean, I think I&#8217;ve gone baby face, I want to say two or three times in the last three years. And every time I do, I&#8217;m always like, holy crap, you look so young, like you look so different. Have you ever put yourself in any of those like AI image generators to see what you look like without the beard?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
No, I haven&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ve been dappling into AI and also longevity treatments for quite a long time in terms of sort of projection also where society goes. So I put myself into one of these aging things, right? But not just an aging things in terms of, you know, an image of me looking really old, but also sort of like where you get into a virtual reality experience and you actually sort of experience based on some life choices, how you will be in your age, right? So in this case, it was a virtual reality experience where I was, I think, 115 years old and I was sitting in this flat and I was having problems moving. And that was definitely not the place I wanted to be, right? Because it was sort of like a two room apartment with no view and, you know, there was a microwave oven. It was not a lot of green and sustainable food, right? It was sort of packaged food I was supposed to eat and that came sort of elated to sort of mend me and treat me. And, you know, it opens a few eyes, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. No, I love how we started this. Before we get into Cardano Foundation and obviously your business past, I&#8217;d love to let myself and the listeners learn a little bit more about the guy who is running Cardano Foundation more on the personal life, some habits, some rituals, maybe even we can keep buzzin on the longevity aspect. Me myself, I&#8217;m a big sauna ice bath guy. I know everyone thinks it&#8217;s cheesy, but it makes me feel incredible. It&#8217;s an easy way to get the heart rate up. Whenever I get out of an ice bath, I feel like I&#8217;m Superman. It&#8217;s only time today. I feel like a superhero. The dopamine lasts for literally hours. Do you have any rituals or habits that really move the deal for you?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, I tried to get out in nature. So at the moment, I&#8217;m fortunately injured because I did some very big projects over the summer. But a couple of times a year, I go for a very long run in the mountains. And I learned a lot by being in nature, specifically in remote nature. And one of the things I use the most, sort of in my daily job, is the ability to ask for help. And sometimes you can be a kind of a proud person and you say, I know everything, I&#8217;m the CEO, and I&#8217;m supposed to be able to have all professions sort of catered into one personality. But that&#8217;s simply isn&#8217;t the case. So this ability to ask for help is very strong. And then the other part is the humility when you&#8217;re out in nature and you feel the vibrance and the sunlight and the ice going through the glacier seas and stuff like that. It&#8217;s just very cool.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s the absolute best. When you&#8217;re saying long runs, how long are we talking here?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
So I think the longest sort of recorded run I have is probably around 240 miles. So that&#8217;s quite a distance. And I tend to sort of be in the range of 100, 240 miles. And I do that maybe twice, three times a year. But it&#8217;s sort of always sort of special projects, you know, a special community where you can give something back. It&#8217;s always in the mountains. It&#8217;s sort of always tend to be sort of somewhere remote.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And it&#8217;s crazy the mental clarity you get from going on a long walk or a long run, just like all the clutter, all the nonsense, all the BS, I always find it just always goes away. I absolutely love that. Let&#8217;s jump into your past here before becoming CEO of Cardano Foundation. Fintech Background did a whole bunch. Walk me through a little bit about what you did, and then we&#8217;ll get into the Cardano and all the crypto fund stuff here.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Oh yeah, where should we start? Just before I, you know, Cardano was working for PWC and I built up two things with PWC. I built up what&#8217;s called the blockchain go to markets, including sort of the general strategy. So that includes advisory, audit and legal and so on. And then I built up and we call it an experience center. And many people went there to get exposure to emerging technology, whether there was sensors or AI or machine learning or blockchain. Or whatever that was. But the true nature of the experience center was actually using something called MG Taylor, which is a methodology made by an architect and a Montessori kindergarten teacher, which is about how you align a large group of people. So imagine if you could take 50 to 100 people into a room, lock them in for two days, and you don&#8217;t manipulate them, you don&#8217;t, you know, force and view down on them, you find a topic which they&#8217;re completely aligned on and you let them lose into a business. And that basically accelerates businesses incredible, right? Because, you know, you suddenly don&#8217;t have 100 individuals, you have like an army of change makers which you&#8217;re sending back into the business. So it uses a lot of elements from design thinking, from, you know, smells. So we already had several ovens in the facility in PWC. We&#8217;re always baking bread. So then when people came in, the sort of the sensors were opening up for that smell. We were playing music. We had a grand piano there. Of course, it was machine learning and AI enabled, but we had a grand piano. And if you have a large group of people, there&#8217;s always somebody who can play the piano and it&#8217;s very rare you can do that on a grand piano, right? So, you know, we use sort of different elements to basically open up people&#8217;s life and facades and take away those things and let them be humans interacting with humans and let them be motivated about the things they are motivated about and then basically get the business out of them and then send them back with a, you know, a plan and how they work together to enable large changes in organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. And this was developed by a kindergarten teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, an American kindergarten teacher and she uses a philosophical Montessori, which I think probably a lot of people have heard about. And then an architect, you know, a house architect basically thinking about buildings and you know, how should rooms be constructed? So they were looking at the world and they found that the world was sort of not really going in the direction where there was more love and more alignment and more sort of positive things coming out of humanity was more going in a direction where we saw that people were seeing more disaster, more macroeconomic disaster events, more, you know, evil centralization of power to the wrong persons, et cetera. And they said, you know, what can we do with the skillsets we had? And then they invented this called MG Taylor, which is now sort of a subgroup of people. It&#8217;s probably close to a thousand people worldwide working with this methodology. And it&#8217;s literally changing war zones today. So some of my colleagues has been working on stopping wars. Most other has been working with United Nations World Economic Forum. I spent some time both with the World Economic Forum but also with blockchain. That&#8217;s actually how I came in contact with Charles Hodgkinson was due to some of the work I did there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. And Fred, you just teed me up for my next question here. Taking this job must have been, again, you had multiple incredible jobs at very high level firms, obviously PWC, even the big four consulting firms as well. This must have been a bit of a headscratcher or perhaps I&#8217;m wrong. And it was a no brainer. But when you took this job and when you met Charles, what were sort of the key factors that made you be like, damn, I got to do this.I got to help take this thing to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I was probably my daughter. I was actually thinking I would go back into banking and build a bank for the actual users of the bank and really align the incentives because the thing banking has gone astray is not really helping the people who really need the expertise. So I was thinking and going back to banking and Cardano was one of my clients, you can say, in advisory, right? And then one day my daughter woke up and she had a nightmare and she came down to me and I had sort of basement office and she was asking, you know, crying and said, you know, what are you doing dad? And I was like, well, I&#8217;m helping some dude earn more money. You know, and she was like, why? And I was like, well, I actually don&#8217;t know because I already took the decision to leave PWC and I was sort of like, yeah, why am I actually sitting up at two o &#8216;clock messing with my, you know, a sleep schedule and, you know, away from my family to help somebody, you know, earn more money on an account. He was not really caring about anyway. So, you know, after she left and I talked to her in and she fell asleep, I was sort of thinking about, you know, maybe as an investment banker, there is another route I could do. So I started looking into my portfolio and, you know, I think I was always very impressed by Cardano, specifically the vision and the mission. The purpose of Cardano is so different than many of the other blockchains back then. So I thought, hey, this is actually a way where I can, you know, deploy my skill set and do something with the bank I normally can&#8217;t do. And that is to be a part of potentially, you know, I was about to say saving the world, but that sounds so big, right? But at least ensure that the world becomes a better place for every working day I have compared to just optimizing money in a pyramid scheme somewhere in another industry.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s wild. This is also a masterclass in storytelling. My goodness. I&#8217;ll be listening to this over and over again. This is an absolute masterclass. We just touched on Cardano and he talks about, you briefed on Cardano&#8217;s foundation and obviously not the Cardano foundation, but it&#8217;s foundational elements and three core focus areas, operational resilience, education and adoption. I absolutely love this. I think this needs to be injected into everyone&#8217;s veins in the crypto space and everyone who wants to learn more and jump in as well. I&#8217;d love if you could touch on these three core points, why they&#8217;re so important and how you and the team are moving the needle to bring the next million users into Web3.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Sure. So we have a concept in the Cardano Foundation called blockchain for good. And I think not knowing your listeners, I need to go one step back before we go to blockchain for good. So just keep that as an anchor point. But if you think about what truly makes a public permissionless blockchain special, is the ability that it does not cancel everybody out. It doesn&#8217;t belong to the canceled culture. It does not belong to the culture where you have to be born in a certain country to have a certain identity, to be able to get access to health care, to capital market services or just to vote or whatever that might be. And we have about two billion people around the world who actually don&#8217;t have an identity. And we have a huge digital divide between the people who has and the people who haven&#8217;t. So unfortunately, the way the world is structured at the moment is that everything is centered around this sort of centralized identity service, which you cannot create yourself where you&#8217;re depending on certain trust anchors or institutions who gives you the access permissions to be you, to be who you are. And that, of course, is very dangerous when you then come and say, no, everybody can gain value from Cardano. Everybody can contribute to Cardano and everybody can take something from Cardano and bring that back to your community. Because what it also does is it battles or dabbles with the control, you know, the enforcement control, which we built into society to ensure that people behave, right? And it also says, you know, we are not the one who polices the blockchain. The blockchain is a social good, is a utility. So when the Cardano Foundation speaks about blockchain for good, we mean it in two aspects. The first aspect is sort of an ESG aspect, right? What we&#8217;re saying, you know, if something is available for everybody to do and there is an information asymmetry, and I think about when the start of the internet came, there is a couple of use cases where it&#8217;s very frequently being used, so very few people benefit on behalf of the masses. So you&#8217;re actually saying you&#8217;re seeing a well skewing in the wrong direction, right? So we set forward to say, OK, what can we do? And how can we measure us externally to ensure that we can open up the eyes for what&#8217;s possible to add value to the global society or the spaceship we call Earth today to bring people more together and to show that blockchain can be used for social good? That&#8217;s why we did the tree planting project called Very Tree in Kenya where we got close to planting a million trees where every single tree is actually an NFT who lives on the blockchain. And you can verify who was the planter, and you can get data, so dynamic metadata on a quarterly basis that the tree actually exists and there&#8217;s no double counting. That means it doesn&#8217;t go into the normal greenwashing and all those things you see there. But it&#8217;s also the same rationality and why we work with United Nations, humanitarian crisis organizations and so on. So the idea here is really we&#8217;re taking, OK, if we are not policing the blockchain and we don&#8217;t have a view, we need an external framework to define what is good. And there we use United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. And there&#8217;s 17 of those and we say it has to take a few boxes, huh?  The other part of blockchain for good, sort of the double meaning of the word, is the longevity. So the Cardano Foundation is into the longevity of blockchain. This is a marathon, an ultramarathon. It&#8217;s not a sprint. So most blockchains, they are actually not economically sustainable. And that means that they will run out of juice or gas or funding or whatever you might call it over time, right? And what we&#8217;re really looking at is saying we need to get to a situation that the blockchain becomes immortal. If you want to get to a situation that the blockchain becomes immortal and truly fulfills the promises of being there for humanity across the generations and centuries to come, we need to get to a situation that when you go to a dinner party and you bring your own food to the dinner party, there&#8217;s always too much food because you have this mentality that you bring a little bit more than you can eat yourself. If you go to a centralized dinner party, if I&#8217;m cooking for you, right, you&#8217;ll probably eat all my meat and drink my red wine and you eat too much, really, because it was good, right? And we&#8217;re actually short of resources. So what I&#8217;m trying to say is that these blockchains to be immortal, we need transaction diversity at a scale who covers the incentives for the generations to come. And nearly no blockchain, if any at all, has solved that yet. Therefore, the Cardano Foundation set forward and said, if we look at those two use cases, those two hypothesis of how to enable that, what do we need to do? And the first thing we came to was saying, we have already over a thousand companies who&#8217;s deployed in Cardano. If you want to have business critical infrastructure or humanity critical infrastructure or identity on Cardano, operation resilience is very important. And as you probably know as being a blockchain affinato, the way the blockchain is structured is a complete different security architecture than what we know from the internet and other settings. And that means that for us, operation resilience is one of those things you cannot go down on. I&#8217;ve been quoted at the moment for saying, boring is good, right? So Cardano has actually been up since 2017. It never missed a beat and we processed over 78.3 million transactions or something like that, right? So it&#8217;s really a lot. And we have no downtime, knock on wood. And what we&#8217;re basically doing with the foundation is we have built a real-time network monitoring tool, including the ability to look into the networking stack and other things to ensure that when things are happening, we have a pre-warning, we have ideas about how to do disaster recovery in a decentralized distributed network. We have experts who understand this is again a little bit boring, sorry about that. What&#8217;s the key point when SOC 1 is, which is really these kind of risk mitigations you use when you run a central bank or if you run a hospital or if you run, you know, pacemakers and stuff like that. You cannot just produce a pacemaker and get a hospital to put it in. You need to go through a set of qualifications who allows you to do that. So that&#8217;s the operation resilience. We truly believe that if a blockchain is fast and brave, that&#8217;s probably not what you want if this is going to be the foundations of society forever, right? You want something who is peer-reviewed, academic, who has a very tough operation resilience, specifically when you know that the product to market fit is not a straight fit, right? So if you look around the blockchain and crypto world, we have all these discussions about the regulatory environment in the US and we have all these, you know, what is the use cases and maybe blockchain had over promised a bit. And what that basically tells you is that the actual huge use cases of blockchain in the future has not been there yet. They&#8217;re coming, huh? So you need a way also to adapt the code base to ensure that this product to market fit in the future will be there. Now how do you adapt the code base? Well you have to start thinking about who is going to tell you what features they need in order for them to use the blockchain. Secondly, do you pay them for it or do they do it because there&#8217;s business value? And therefore education actually became a very important part of us because when we looked into the education landscape, everybody speaks about tokenization, everybody speaks about CBDCs, everybody speaks about Bitcoin, people speaks about how Ethereum was able to replace Wall Street in capital assimilation. But they don&#8217;t speak about identity in Ethiopia for students. They don&#8217;t speak about supply chain for 100,000 bottles of wine from 22 different wineries signed off by the National Wine Agency in Georgia. They don&#8217;t speak about scattered random diamonds who can be injected in cancer medicine so you can track and ensure that that is the exact medicine. Now that&#8217;s what we are touching upon in the Cardano Foundation because we think this is actually what&#8217;s going to kickstart the blockchain revolution. So this part of having free available high quality education who can get business people to understand the magic what engineers and IT people already know so they can understand where does the use case fit and where doesn&#8217;t it fit is why education is so important. Secondly, by writing these scripts as the foundation has now done in public, where you can get that for free, you can translate it, you can build an app on it, you can do whatever you want with it, it&#8217;s under an open source or public source license. So that basically means that there&#8217;s a business model to be had to do it in Arabic or to do it in Japanese and do a learning platform. But we provide all the content for free because we want the whole world to understand blockchain, not just Cardano. And the other part of that is of course when you look into the regulatory space, which is difficult, right? Because as I told you in the start, when you have public permission as blockchains, you&#8217;re giving away enforcement power, right? What it really does is it opens up the opportunity to address the regulator and tell them about that blockchain is more than capital markets. The blockchain is more than a utility token or security token. The blockchain is value creation, is job creation, is changes democracy, it does a lot of things, right? So this ability for us to do that also led us to building a REC TEK tool. So I think we are the only Layer 1 blockchain we ever built a REC TEK tool for policy makers and regulators who basically takes down the pants of a blockchain and says, you know what? We are very open to talk to you about staking. We are open to talk to you about incentives. So let us tell you how exactly staking works in Cardano. And you will find there&#8217;s no slashing, there&#8217;s no login mechanism or period, there&#8217;s no ownership change. So if you look into current capital markets infrastructure, you can now see with your own eyes why we are different than many others. And not only can you see that, you can verify that all the way down to the actual blockchain and to the code, depending on your knowledge level. And then we took the educational content and we pushed that into that workflow diagram in our Explorer to show that. And we now been in contact in the last two, three months, I think, with close to 10 different regulators and enforcement agencies and showed them this. And they are just like completely excited. One of them said, you&#8217;re bringing trust back into blockchain, which I think is a very powerful statement, but also is a testament to where we as an industry might have misjudged the environment a little bit. So those two anchors into what we&#8217;re really trying to do with this adoption. So what you really need is you need a multitude of different use cases on the blockchain whether that&#8217;s Cardano&#8217;s blockchain or another one, is actually a little bit irrelevant. But you want to get as many people to live on the blockchain as possible, because specifically how Cardano works is that when you do a transaction on Cardano, the transaction fees is being rooted through the treasury into the incentive structure, and that basically pays the state pool operators for operating Cardano. So the more transactions you have, and the more diversity in transactions, and the more they use the blockchain for what it was meant to do, so smart contracts and native assets, the higher is the transaction fee is by the way the terministic fees in Cardano, so you can calculate that down to the cent, the more economic sustainable it becomes. So this anchors into this sort of idea about blockchain for good, right? That you need to have those components in place to allow the legacy world, the Web2 world, but also the legacy in real world, you know, the supply chain companies and commodity companies and supermarkets to go on a blockchain, you need to answer a few questions and you need to show that your technology stack is ready for that.</p>

I love that. Fred that was absolutely electric. I love the spiel there. So many points we can touch on. We do need to give our sponsor of the show a quick shout out. But before then, one of my favorite things that you just discussed in that little spiel was just one of the best things about Cardano and you said, it&#8217;s a little boring and it&#8217;s sexy. It&#8217;s a little boring and it&#8217;s a little unsexy. It does what needs to be done. It is a perfect layer for powering all these applications and projects that want to come on the blockchain and a shit ton, pardon my French, of real world applications. And that&#8217;s what we need for the blockchain to grow. It can&#8217;t just be, hey, we&#8217;re a coin, number go up, number go down. The financial incentives needs to go away. There needs to be some real world use cases and we are going to get into that in one second folks. But until then, huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime friends of the Cryptonews Podcast. You know who we&#8217;re talking about. That is PrimeXBT. They offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders.

That is CRYPTONEWS50, all one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with Fred. Fred, let&#8217;s jump into some of the recent projects that you and the team have done at Cardano Foundation. I am not going to lie. I love a good glass of vino every once in a while. Red, white, rose, you name it. When I was doing research for the show, I learned about the George and Wine partnership. That is so friggin&#8217; cool. You got to give us the TLDR. What happened there? How did you guys make this happen? I think this is absolutely brilliant and I would love for more of this to happen in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Wow, the truth of this is probably starting all the way back in the Soviet Union. So when the Soviet Union collapsed, something new happened. And that is what people don&#8217;t realize is that wine was most likely invented in Georgia. But under the Soviet Union, they were only allowed to market their product within the Soviet Union. So when the Italian wine and Spanish wine were sort of living on this marketing grace, you know, and building these strong for the world&#8217;s best wine, well, they had communism, right? But it means also that for them, wine is their identity. Every single family nearly has their own wine receipts and they work together with local vineyards and so on. So when we came in contact with the agricultural ministry there, what we learned was that the quality controls for their wine is extraordinary high. And they were talking about how do we export the Georgian culture and how do we show the world what Georgia is made of? You know, obviously they&#8217;re thinking about, you know, business opportunities, they&#8217;re thinking about tourism, they&#8217;re thinking about the country Georgia&#8217;s brand and what do they have to offer. And their wine was a big thing. So we were in competition with a couple of other blockchains, even a specific wine blockchain even, very specialized. And it turned out that due to us, you know, being who we are in terms of academic reviews and being able to answer those questions around disaster recovery and, you know, business continuity and all those kind of things, we were elected to do that. And we found a local partner in Switzerland because blockchain alone does not anchor into a physical product. So we worked together with a company called Scantrust who does high definition QR codes. And the first thing we did was authenticity. So the ability to authenticate that the wine you have is actually the real wine who comes from the fields. Right? So, you know, on the internet, you have all these sort of copycats and you never really know what you buy. And what I thought was, oh, hey, this is really good. This is engine room stuff. You know, this is about, you know, security and so on. But what it turns out was that this small winery was actually a female wine producer called Bayer. She got sold out of, you know, within for a year or something like that. So people in Norway and Korea was buying Georgian wine where there was never any commercials about Georgia at all. Because there&#8217;s a new generation on the internet with you and I probably belong to, which I think about as blockchain citizens. And we actually want to verify what we buy if that&#8217;s actually the right thing we buy, because we&#8217;ve been through the the treadmill of getting, you know, fake iPhones home or get, you know, Chinese copies or whatever it is. Right? And the other part was that she was able to very cheaply portray herself through the user experience. Right? So she could talk about her field and her history and those kind of things. And what we now done this year is we turned it from an authenticity solution into a track and trace solution. So we&#8217;re actually putting the right now just labeling it, but we&#8217;re talking about 100,000 bottles of wine from the region of Bolnisi. And what&#8217;s very interesting here is that the government of Georgia is signing every single bottle on the blockchain that has been through the export control, including customs are signing off when it leaves the country. And that means that you&#8217;re suddenly relying on something where this blockchain was made to do, but it&#8217;s very hard to do. And that&#8217;s something called verified credentials. So the ability to verify that you are the right trusted authority to sign this data on the blockchain. And you as a consumer will then be able, if it has a business value for you, to track every single one of those 100,000 bottles and get the story of the vineyard, including the fields and the grapes and the produce and all of that through the user experience. And you can then verify that with the, you know, national wine agency under the agricultural ministry. And you can, you know, see if it&#8217;s really true, right? So we do that together with Scantrust and the country of Georgia. And my hope is that here sort of in Q1 when they finish bottling, that&#8217;s going to be hitting, you know, worldwide. And everybody out there who buys a Bolnisi, one of those 100,000 bottles will be able to insight with the Cardano blockchain and understand a little bit better what blockchain actually can be used for, both in terms of exporting culture, but also in terms of verifying track and trace and authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. I&#8217;m not here in Mexico at the moment on the east coast. And I&#8217;m, I do know a couple people in the wine game. So I&#8217;m going to be hitting them up after the show and I&#8217;ll see if I can get my hands on one of those bottles. That would be absolutely incredible. Also, thanks for the history lesson there. I did not know that Georgia was like the sort of birthplace of wine. I would have guessed it was like you said, you know, one of the Spain, Italy or France or one of the like, but so cool. Another topic I&#8217;d love to get into Fred is obviously the global blockchain landscape. Do you guys are front runners and leaders and actually speaking with the big boys and the big gals at the top of the food chains in the regulatory space? What are some of the conversations that are happening right now? I know you obviously can&#8217;t spill all the beans. I mean, we&#8217;d love a nice little breaking news flash on the Cryptonews pod, but what are some of the policy developments going on in the blockchain space right now from a regulatory standpoint?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, so to be honest, right now the US is actually quite quiet. And I know this sounds a bit odd, right? Because obviously you see a lot of headlines and so on. But, you know, I think we&#8217;re going into election season there, right? And all they&#8217;re building up cases or they&#8217;re running cases, right? In Europe, the big thing is MiCA. MiCA is sort of the, let&#8217;s call it the stable coin and a couple of other things, regulation on cryptocurrencies, which is coming into force. And there is a sort of a grace period to be compliant there. And there&#8217;s a couple of things, sort of curve balls who are thrown into that mix. And I think in a certain way, this is sort of is very good policymaking from the European Union. Conceptually, I&#8217;m a little bit questioning a few points. And one of the points is, I think you should not hinder innovation. So they&#8217;re basically protecting the inner market of the European Union and ensuring that if you are having a stable coin, it actually needs to be issued by somebody under MiCA license. So, for instance, probably see Tether and USDC and others will, you know, very quickly need to figure out how they get, you know, a European issue. But we&#8217;re already in discussions with MiCA 2. And MiCA 2 is going to cover more than stable coins and then utility tokens is also going to go into most likely things like NFTs and yield farming and staking and other things. And that&#8217;s going to be very interesting. And I hope that more Layer 1s will start engaging in that. Out of Japan is really interesting. They&#8217;ve come up with some really good regulation. It&#8217;s very protective, but it&#8217;s very clear. And as you probably know, Cardano and ADA, our utility token has been whitelisted to the JBCA there for years. So we&#8217;re really ready to engage. And we just spent some time together with the Swiss regulator in a workshop, but also the European banking authorities and European security and market authorities sort of like equivalent to the SEC and the FCA in the UK and showed them the REC TEK tool I spoke to about earlier. And the two things that really starting to ask questions about which are really interesting, the first one is they start understanding they cannot be technology agnostic. Before they were like, OK, a blockchain is a blockchain. It has to be fair game if it&#8217;s a blockchain. It&#8217;s equal. But now they&#8217;re saying, well, there&#8217;s so big differences in terms of the blockchain. It&#8217;s not just if it&#8217;s, you know, a proof of stake or proof of work. It&#8217;s actually also if it&#8217;s a proof of relevant history, a proof of history. But it&#8217;s also is it multi-party computation or zero knowledge proof. And, you know, what is the incentives in there? You know, do you have like a slashing or do you only have positive reinforcements like Cardano? So they&#8217;re really asking very good and detailed questions. And they were very positive when we showed them the Cardano Explorer with these regulatory tooling in there where they can verify how Cardano is built. The other thing we sort of surprised me a bit was that they had a lot of questions on business continuity and a disaster recovery. And what that makes it means is that they are not just looking and saying, OK, I have a little use case, a little token on top of a blockchain. Well, they actually start looking at, OK, they have requests from large counterparties to move some of the infrastructure who normally would be in a centralized, you know, environment to a distributed, decentralized environment. So they had really deep questions around, you know, block propagation around centralization of staking or mining, how you monitor the network, how you flag certain actions, can you do front running in and those kind of aspects. And luckily, I&#8217;m sort of coming from a world of building banks and my chief legal officer is coming from the Swiss regulators and he has a specialty in distributed systems. So we were able to have these dialogues with them. And I think on one hand, this is scary and on the other hand, this is very positive. I look at it very positively because it means that we are getting into the place where blockchain is accepted much more. But we are still playing a finite window where we could end up with some not so good regulation in terms of really utilizing the value of blockchain. So there is definitely if I have one cry out for your listeners, is find as many non financial use cases you can on a blockchain. Doesn&#8217;t matter which one and start tweeting about it, start talking about it, speak to your friends, do your elevator pitch? Because the more people realize that the blockchain is not associated with capital markets and banking only, but it&#8217;s a worldwide industry optimization game, the better it is for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Very quickly, Fred, before we move on to our next question here, and I know we&#8217;re getting a little tight for time as well. The overall sentiment, though, from the regulators, there&#8217;s no way that it&#8217;s not better than what&#8217;s a couple of years ago. I feel like every couple of years, they become more educated. They learn more about blockchain as a whole and understand more potential use cases that are non-financial, incentive, and capital markets related. Would you say that that&#8217;s true?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I think that&#8217;s true for some regulators. So I mean, I was a little bit scared of highlighting people or pointing fingers, right? But I would say definitely the Swiss regulator, Luxembourg, FCA, MIS in Singapore, Hong Kong, has definitely taken, and the European Union has taken huge steps forward. I really truly feel that. I think I can agree with your sentiment there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. And last little thing, then we will wrap up here Fred, Cardano Foundation. You guys had an incredible year and obviously we are recording mid November. This episode will air mid to end ish November. You guys just did Cardano Summit 2023 in Dubai. That looked like an absolute bang or that looked like an incredible time. I&#8217;d love for you to touch on that. And then a little forward looking here, what&#8217;s on the docket for 2024? What do you have on the back burner? What are you in the plan? What are you and the team have planned for 2024? Can&#8217;t wait to see all this stuff pop off.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
That was a good question. Let&#8217;s see where we start. I think what was truly unique about the Cardano Summit in Dubai, and by the way, we did 30 different locations around the world at the same time as we did Dubai, so plus minus two weeks. So it&#8217;s not just Dubai is really around the world. I think what people really paid attention to was the fact that we had regulators and policymakers to a Layer 1 event present, but not just present like members of parliament in the actual crowd. We had them on the stage, really discussing and nearly brainstorming each other with how we do and how we can do better in enabling that. So a big thank you for the city of Dubai to basically host us there. The other part was the attendance. What a lot of people told me was, hey, this doesn&#8217;t feel like a crypto bro event. This feels like industry blockchain. We had the World Trade Organization there. We had the United Nations there. We had Fortune 500 companies. We had large industry companies like Trade Zones, who has 23,000 companies in their trade zone who was there. And that combined with all the engineers and the blockchain affinados who were sort of mixing together and finding out what works and doesn&#8217;t work and signing deals and doing things. So I think this dynamic where you really feel the blockchain is getting maturing in terms of the industry adoption, I think that was fantastic and really high quality content as well. If you miss some of it, some of the YouTube videos is now live. And specifically some of this stuff on the technical side, with side chains and interoperability, its identity is really key to understanding where blockchain is today. On your other question, so what&#8217;s happening next year? So Operation Resilience will continue. I think we will never stop there. So Operation Resilience, Mainnet Monitoring, Cybersecurity, Bug Bounty and those kind of aspects. I think this is truly important. As you&#8217;ve probably seen, Cardano is the large Layer 1 who has the most GitHub commits, right? So it basically means we are adding more and more code as more and more companies are relying on Cardano. And that obviously means that we need to be much more careful there and we need to get the right Q&amp;A and things in process. The other thing which you can expect as you&#8217;re going to see a lot more open source from us. So already this year we did Python libraries and Java libraries, but most importantly we did a project called Icon Boot Flap from the Foundation in full open source. And if you saw the adoption circle, so the amount of time it took to develop this in the true open source format and the amount of adoption, plus that it actually is 10 times faster and 10 times easier than the original smart contracting language on Cardano, you got to be wondering, isn&#8217;t that the future for solving the product to market fit on blockchain, right? I think this is like true amazing. So we&#8217;re going to build on this icon, which is called, on the learnings there and also our connections to the Linux Foundation and the Apache Foundation and what we learned and interacting in those ecosystems. And then we&#8217;re going to do a lot more in open source and not just sort of small things, but we&#8217;re really going to try and see if we can push the envelope there. Then Technical Enablers is still a big thing. So you saw our ledger sync came out this year, which is a database you can see. We did some changes to the command line interface and we did some changes to&#8230; a couple of other things. So what we&#8217;re hoping to get out with is what we call a metadata bus, which we already, actually, Bolnisi Wine is living on that. So think about a combination of how you structure metadata, identity and transaction building in a tool. So basically to lower the cost of operating on Cardano. So tooling and those kind of things is some of the things we really want to deliver, but tooling in a way that business architects can get full value of it. And then obviously we are, as you know, in Cardano, we are in the age of Voltaire, which is the governance era. So we&#8217;re going to, hopefully, we&#8217;ve been working very hard on that with the community. We had over 50 workshops around the world. We&#8217;re going to vote in the, what we call the Cardano Improvement Proposal, CIP 1694, which is the tooling for true decentralized governance. So it&#8217;s voting and PKI&#8217;s and a lot of beautiful things that really allows the community to take over the lead on decision making. And so that&#8217;s going to be really cool. And then there&#8217;s going to be a longer discussion and hopefully a finalization of what we think about as the guardrails for Cardano. Because when you have something as big as Cardano, what you want to do is you want to keep the essence of Cardano or make it very hard to change, but still you can change it, right? And then smaller things like transaction fees or, you know, other things, block sizes that you can very easily change that as sort of when you need to, right? So then these are different in terms of the democracy there and some safeguards around that. So that&#8217;s going to be one of the last work chunks we&#8217;re going to do next year as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Incredible. Fred what an episode you were a human electric factory today and very grateful and Incredibly pumped to have you on hopefully we can do this again in the future Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Cardano Foundation online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Sure. So, cardanofoundation.org is the best place to find the Cardano Foundation. We would like to have a new, more exciting webpage and we will have that in the future. cardano.org is a very good place to go, specifically the forum. In the forum there&#8217;s a lot of different threads, also in different languages, and the community is one of the biggest, if not the biggest and best community in the whole blockchain. So if you can&#8217;t find anything, just write help somewhere and the community is super helpful. There&#8217;s also a whole set of Discord channels and then there&#8217;s our developer portal. So if you go on our developer portal through cardano.org you can see use cases, containers, tooling and other things that can help get you started. And then we have a large sort of venture funding bootstrapping system called Catalyst. And on Catalyst you have the ability to look for funding or look for business partners and other things. So that&#8217;s also a cool place. I&#8217;m not so active on socials to be honest, but you can find me on Twitter and on LinkedIn under @F_Gregaard or Frederik Gregaard on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Amazing. Frederik, thank you so much, incredible episode. And hope to have you on for round two, wishing you and the team all the best moving forward. This was incredible. Thanks again, mate.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Thank you, it was very fun and looking forward to next time.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Folks, what an episode with Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation. Easily one of the best episodes we&#8217;ve ever had. He was dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center, human electric factory and just a masterclass in storytelling. I had a blast and I hope you guys did as well. If you enjoyed this one, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I speaking to the team. Love you guys so much. Justas, my amazing sound editor. You are the man and back to the listeners. Love you guys. Thank you for everything. Keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always, still coming in hot from Mexico. And my guest was in Mexico last week as well. I had quite the issue on the food poisoning slash Salmonella. Charlie and I had to reschedule our pod. Charlie&#8217;s also battling through the same stuff. We&#8217;ll get into that. But before then, intro time, today we have Charlie Schumacher on the show today, VP of Corporate Communications at the one and only Marathon Digital Holdings, Ticker Mara. Mara is a digital asset technology company that mines cryptocurrencies with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets. From 2018 to 2021, Charlie worked at Gateway Investor Relations, first as an analyst and worked his way up to an associate, specializing in investor relations.

Huge shout out to Boston U. I&#8217;m a big hockey fan and they have a sake hockey program. Charlie, welcome to show my friend, Pump to have you on.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, thanks for having me, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s crazy, last week folks, just for the listeners who are tuning in, whether you&#8217;re watching on YouTube or for the few of you that still have a commute to the office, I assume a big chunk of our listeners are still commuting and as many podcast listeners throwing those headphones or throw it on Bluetooth and listen. Charlie and I had a bit of a battle last week. I was supposed to record with Charlie, we were supposed to record a week ago. And I woke up on Tuesday morning, actually not even Tuesday morning. It was a battle through the night from Monday to Tuesday went to, we&#8217;re not going to shout him out. No free ads. And we&#8217;re actually boycotting now, but currently in Mexico and went to my favorite jerk chicken spot. And I got Salmonella and for those who&#8217;ve never had it, highly recommended not getting it. It was an absolute battle. And fast forward a week later, Charlie was in Mexico city for a lovely wedding, had a couple street tacos as one has to, and, him and I are in the same boat and battling some Mexico stomach shit. What a story.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, what a nice thing to bond over, right? Yeah, it&#8217;s not been super pleasant, but fortunately I think I&#8217;m on like, you know, I&#8217;m below the trough. I&#8217;m moving up in the right direction, but yeah, I landed on Thursday in Mexico and I, for me, food is half of like why I travel, maybe more, it&#8217;s food in history pretty much. And so I landed and I immediately went out to get street tacos, cause obviously street food is the best food. And that was in hindsight, that turned out to be quite an aggressive move on my part. I think if I&#8217;d been in Mexico for one or two weeks, maybe I would have adjusted, I would have been okay, but I ended up spending, you know, all day Friday in bed or, you know, trapped in my room.<br />
I was there for a wedding and, there&#8217;s a chance I was a little tardy to the wedding and to the ceremony, but I did end up making it. I was able to rally, have a good time on the dance floor with some friends and was doing better. But yeah, it&#8217;s just, as you know, Matt, it kind of like comes and goes, right? So we&#8217;re working through it, but we&#8217;ll be good.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s crazy. Charlie the honestly the biggest and again folks we are gonna get into the crypto pod of course the crypto aspect of the show. This is not a gut health related pod or a health related pond mind you. But it was just funny that Charlie and I were in the same boat for a very short period of time unless the biggest takeaway for me on top of obviously boycotting the Jamaican jerk chicken restaurant was, we wake up every single day and it&#8217;s just like oh another day Matt feels good Charlie feels good. The whole last week I&#8217;ve been so friggin happy just because I felt normal not even like feeling better than normal Just feeling normal or even a little sub par has put the biggest smile on my face I&#8217;ve been journaling about it and I&#8217;m like you know what I&#8217;m gonna start I&#8217;m gonna stop being a little ungrateful, you know what and I&#8217;m gonna be more grateful so I don&#8217;t know about you But that was that was sort of my biggest takeaway from just being absolutely in the gutter for two or three days</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Totally. I&#8217;m not quite on your level yet. I&#8217;m not fully back to a gratitude, but I&#8217;m looking forward to getting there. But that&#8217;s absolutely what happens, right? We take everything for granted. And it&#8217;s when you lose things or don&#8217;t have access to them or things get worse that you realize how good your, quote unquote, normal, boring life can be. And so just feeling good, and I certainly take it for granted. I&#8217;m sure most people do. And health at the end of the day for me is one of the most important things, but I forget that sometimes, especially when I&#8217;m out in foreign country, having fun, eating street tacos and going to weddings and being silly, but yeah, it&#8217;s a good reminder, right? Every time I come back from a trip like that, I&#8217;m super motivated to get healthy again. And sometimes that works and sometimes that doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a motivation can be short lived.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Before we get into Marathon, and I guess I do need to disclose this, I am an investor in Marathon. This isn&#8217;t the reason why Charlie is on the show. The reason is because Charlie is a great guest and Marathon is an incredible company. But I do feel like that has to be said. Anytime a guest comes on, I do always disclose to the listeners when I am an investor. I got into Marathon way back in the day in 2020 for a multitude of reasons and we will get into those. But again, just wanted to be fully transparent and candid with all the listeners and everyone tuning in. But one thing that I am very curious about and not even so much Marathon related, but just on your job title and how important it is in anyone on the investor relations and corporate comm side of things, I have been fortunate enough to work with a couple of public traded companies in Canada who do actually have Bitcoin on their balance sheet as well. And people don&#8217;t really understand the importance of a corporate comm job or an investor relations job. And furthermore, how many companies totally drop the ball? Like you are on the media show and on the road show doing absolutely everything all the time, one of the faces of the company. But there are so many public traded companies, more specifically microcap ones, where it is like the IR team is just sort of non-existent. And the corporate comms are sort of non-existent. It is sort of wild to think about. But walk me through your day to day and exactly what it is and what a corporate comms VP does on a day to day basis.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, I appreciate you kind of teeing up some reverence for what I do. It makes me sound a little less self-important, I guess, when I started speaking about it. I agree with you, though, that people, it&#8217;s like, well, it&#8217;s the same thing we were just talking about. People take it for granted. We take for granted that we all speak and we can all tell stories, some better than others. And it just depends on where your focus is, right, as an individual. But human beings are both story creating and story-consuming machines. That&#8217;s basically what we are. And so narrative is close to everything. Obviously, if you think about it from the company&#8217;s perspective, you have to execute. If you don&#8217;t execute, a story will only go so far. But you need a good combination of both narrative and numbers for something to be compelling and for it to make sense to people. There&#8217;s a rational side of us and there&#8217;s an irrational side of us. And ideally, you&#8217;re capable of speaking to both of those. So my job, it&#8217;s funny, I changed this description depending on whom I&#8217;m speaking to. Because not everyone gets Bitcoin, not everyone gets Bitcoin Mining, right? So I typically will start if it&#8217;s a new person and tell them that my job is I&#8217;m a Bitcoin propagandist. And I kind of let that sit for a second. And then they&#8217;re like, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. And I&#8217;m like, well, let me explain what I do. And then once I&#8217;m done explaining, they&#8217;re like, yeah, okay, that made sense. I get it. So I run communications and marketing for Marathon currently. What that basically means is everything that we produce, that&#8217;s a word or a video or our marketing and branding, kind of all comes through my team and through me. So we are in ways responsible for the voice of the company, Fred, our CEO is our primary spokesperson and obviously sets the tone and pace of everything that we do. And so a lot of our job is working with him collaboratively and then kind of like echoing his sentiment. So it&#8217;s really, you know, I don&#8217;t know, I view my job in some ways as a teacher, as an educator. I love Marathon. I think Bitcoin Mining is really interesting. I wouldn&#8217;t be in this industry if I didn&#8217;t. And so the job that my team and I have is basically to educate people on what we do, to teach them about Marathon and the cool story we think that is the company, as well as to teach them about the industry and why we spend all of our time doing this and suffer a crisis every single week, as everyone does in the Bitcoin space. And so that&#8217;s kind of just a&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, no, your point in regards to the narratives is so, I mean, you&#8217;re at least as from your bio former actor and live in LA. So obviously you&#8217;re big with, you know, in tune with the Hollywood scene. And it&#8217;s like, why does every movie have such a powerful narrative and multiple character arcs and a villain and a love story? It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s just classic shit that humans can relate to. That&#8217;s all it is. And moving forward to publicly traded companies. A lot of us invest in companies because we hear from person A, B or C that number is going to go up or numbers going to go down. We look at the balance sheet, we look at the chart, all the charts at the bottom of the apex, it&#8217;s probably going to go up, but it&#8217;s like, a lot of us don&#8217;t know anything about the narrative of the company, right? Like besides just the one line or what exactly they do. So again, big fan of anyone in IR, I&#8217;ve had multiple ideas of how to jump into the IR space and move in grooves more specifically in Canada. Cause where I&#8217;m from, there&#8217;s so many different publicly traded companies with Bitcoin on the balance sheet that really don&#8217;t move the needle on the IR side of things. So super cool.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
If I could jump in on that Matt, something you said I thought was kind of interesting where you tend to look at the numbers and then don&#8217;t necessarily know the story of the company. So what you&#8217;re kind of doing there though is you&#8217;re forming your own narrative based on the information you&#8217;re getting. Because what people actually do is they make decisions with their emotions and then they rationalize their choices with their intellect more often than us. Not always like a very optimistic in people&#8217;s capacity for rationality, but I also believe that for the most part we&#8217;re quite emotional and intuitive creatures. So if you think about it, like you are also creating and telling yourself a story even if you&#8217;re just looking at the numbers of something. So the job of a good communicator from a company is kind of to get ahead of that. To make sure that you understand the story from the company&#8217;s perspective and what they believe is important before you&#8217;re able to create your own narrative yourself and interject it with your own thoughts or your own biases. And obviously we have our own as well, but that&#8217;s one of the important things of communications in any company is you wanna have influence over the narrative. Because even if you&#8217;re just looking at numbers, you&#8217;re not looking at it objectively as much as you might try.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, well said. One last question on the IR stuff and that and the comm stuff then we&#8217;ll get into Marathon and everything Bitcoin and Bitcoin Mining related AI I&#8217;ve been messing around with AI a shit ton just like every other human on the planet has. How have you been utilizing AI as someone who again is a wordsmith and a not just you know on the writing side but on the audio and visual side of things like I&#8217;m sure of all fields you and your team probably have a lot more wiggle room to utilize AI in some capacities because of the nature of the job, but then in others where it&#8217;s like you guys have to obviously you know make sure that all of the publicly related regulatory bodies, you know look over all your stuff no forward-looking statements. I bet that&#8217;s an absolute nightmare for you we won&#8217;t even get into that but how have you in the team been utilizing AI to make your lives a little easier?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
A lot of experimentation and a little bit of actual implementation, I&#8217;d say. So super interested in AI. I was on board the ChatGPT train early on. I remember like where I was in December when it got launched and everyone was talking about it. All of our minds were blown and why we were made was immediately calling contacts over at OpenAI and seeing they had, so it was, we&#8217;ve all really enjoyed experimenting with it. And to the point where it&#8217;s funny actually in the IR space, I thought that I actually almost, I considered starting little side projects related to I and investor relations. I actually bought the domain name AI IR, like air.io. Yep, nice. And I might do something with it. I haven&#8217;t yet. So if anyone wants to buy it from me, please let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No free ads on the pod, no free ads.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, I&#8217;d do myself for money like that. But my thesis behind that was a lot of investor relations work and public company finance work is quite formulaic. 10Ks and 10Qs are very formulaic. Press releases tend to be formulaic. If you&#8217;re not used to writing them, it may not seem that way. But there&#8217;s definitely a formula to structuring the way a press release is done.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
All of them are like pretty plug and play-ish.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yes, exactly. And so my thought was, well, but ChatGPT seems to be great at is taking an outline and then converting it into full sentences. And so if you can feed it a really good outline, then you can skip the drafting process, basically. You still have to do some editing, and there&#8217;s still a lot of the live work up front, so you have to do most of the critical thinking. But then you can leverage AI for the muscle, which would be the drafting process. And so I kind of had this idea of, well, maybe I could go around and create really good outlines for press releases or for scripts or 10Qs or whatnot, and then feed that into ChatGPT and get a quality press release out. And maybe that&#8217;s a service that might function well in the IR world. I don&#8217;t think it actually works super well as a company. I think that&#8217;s all going to get commoditized super fast, so that already has. But I do think people who understand how to leverage the tools can get more leverage out of themselves. We haven&#8217;t used it a ton. So again, we experiment with it, but we haven&#8217;t used it a ton, actually, on Marathon stuff. The primary reason is just sensitivity with public company information. Material non public information is obviously super sensitive and important topic. And I don&#8217;t fully know in what capacity we can use something like ChatGPT with information like that. So I&#8217;m very hesitant to use it, actually, and implement it effectively for our communications. But I do like using it as a brainstorming tool. I do find it really effective for that. So if I&#8217;m trying to&#8230; So for example, when you write press releases, you often end up saying the same thing over and over. Like every press release ends with the quote of the CEO saying, something about how he gets optimistic for the future, essentially. And excited about the company. If you have to write that multiple times a month or when I was working as an investor relations associate at a consulting firm, you&#8217;re writing that every single day. It can get a little dry and you have to kind of get creative and just saying the same thing in new ways. So I do find AI super helpful for that, for bouncing ideas off of, or if we&#8217;re trying to come up with a new name for a product or something like that, it&#8217;s a nice way to do that as well. So it&#8217;s a good brainstorming tool and it&#8217;s good for exporting some of the muscle. So we like to play with it, but just given sensitivities of public company, it&#8217;s a little hard to just like full&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I totally agree. Let&#8217;s get into the bread and butter of the show here. I&#8217;m gonna go with the cop out question and just to set the tone and stage for the listeners, give us the elevator pitch on Marathon and then we&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
So Marathon Digital Holdings is one of the largest Bitcoin Minerss in the world. I believe at this point, it&#8217;s basically the largest publicly traded one in North America. We have a little over 19x a hash of capacity online. We&#8217;re targeting to be about 26x a hash around the end of this year. So for reference, that puts us, I think, about 5% of the global Bitcoin network. Pretty sizable, especially given that the company is like what it&#8217;s, we&#8217;ve been doing this really at scale for three years. So it&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s been fast. It&#8217;s been a lot of growth. We&#8217;re also a very large holder of Bitcoin. So we hold over 13,000 BTC or a balance sheet, closer to 14 maybe now. So large holder of Bitcoin, large producer of Bitcoin. And we also, we&#8217;re a little different in the way that we mine and approach the industry. So we take, we&#8217;re really focused on technology and trying to find efficiency through vertically integrated technology and mining. So we&#8217;re actually pretty hands on with everything from the pool, which is the software layer that basically interacts between the miners and the Bitcoin protocol all the way down to the hardware, like the actual ASICs. A lot of people know that we&#8217;ve invested in a company called Auradine, which makes Bitcoin Mining machines, for example. So we&#8217;re really focused on technology. And then we&#8217;re also really focused on right now, on exploring some of the interesting things that Bitcoin Mining can do other than just mine Bitcoin. So we&#8217;re really interested in kind of the positive externalities that come off the mining, like leveraging heat, for example. What can you do with that? Capturing methane and using that. How are your miners? So we kind of say a little bit of a different approach, I think, from other folks, not just in terms of how big we are, how much Bitcoin we hold, but also just the way that we approach the industry. We&#8217;re always trying to do something a little different and trying to figure out, is there something more that we can do other than just grow hash rate, basically, even though that&#8217;s obviously our primary.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Charlie, we got to take a quick break and have a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. But when we get back, we are going to continue to talk about hash price, incentive strategies, other macro trends that will affect miners, and of course, the big bad question, the halving cycle, which I believe we are about five months if I&#8217;m correct away from. Until then, we got to give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50, all one word, to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Charlie, I would love to start with the not elephant in the room per se, but just the one sort of question that I&#8217;m sure you get asked the most, more specifically as we are getting closer and closer to the halving for someone like yourself, your company&#8217;s business that is so heavily reliable on obviously hash rates and the amount of Bitcoin that you guys can produce from all the Bitcoin Mining that you guys do. Everyone must be asking about sort of the Bitcoin halving impacts of the Bitcoin halving how you guys are working around that whole line yards.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah. So the Bitcoin halving is obviously a huge deal for the industry. Mining is a very weird business for many reasons. One is technically you don&#8217;t really have a customer. So that&#8217;s the weirdest business in the world already. The other is you don&#8217;t control your revenue. And as a business, the inability to control your revenue can be a very difficult thing to plan around and try to strategize for. That&#8217;s also one of the reasons though that I think people are gravitated towards this industry is it&#8217;s a very intellectually stimulating question to try to figure out how are you going to increase profitability, drive value for shareholders, or even for some people just survive as a business when you don&#8217;t necessarily know what the price of Bitcoin is going to be. Because obviously, we know that if Bitcoin prices can go up. and the halving occurs, then your revenues get cut in half. And I remember back in, I&#8217;d say the start of 2021, when institutional investors first got started being interested in Bitcoin Mining and hearing about Bitcoin, that was one of the big questions we got was, why would I invest in an industry where every four years your revenue gets cut in half? Great question. The reality, I mean, is I think there&#8217;s an element of hope and faith that you have to have to be in this industry. You have to believe that at some point, Bitcoin is going up in price. Otherwise, yes, why would you be in an industry where revenues are cut in half every four years? Historically, we&#8217;ve seen that around, having cycles, right? So the price of Bitcoin tends to go up post-halving. It kind of peaks, what, like 18 months, I think, or so after the halving, and then you get this crash, and you go sideways for a while, and it settles at a higher low, and everyone gets disenchanted. The rational route does awesome analysis on this stuff, by the way. But I think most people didn&#8217;t understand that. So for us, it&#8217;s interesting, there&#8217;s a lot of people who love Bitcoin and are very interested in Bitcoin, and we were talking about it this morning, actually, in a meeting. There&#8217;s some people in the room who are bullish and very much believe in the halving. There&#8217;s some people who don&#8217;t. Long-term, everyone obviously believes in Bitcoin. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re in the room. But we have differences of opinion on what&#8217;s gonna happen in the short term. So to be in Bitcoin, I think you have to have some degree of hope and faith to operate effectively as a company. Hope is not a strategy, and you have to plan for downside. So what we&#8217;ve been positioning Marathon to do is to hopefully be in a good spot where we are very well protected from downside, but also in a position where we can capitalize on the upside. So let me explain that a little further. We&#8217;ve recently retired about 56% of our long-term debt, which we got a little pushback on because it&#8217;s low interest debt, and some people were confused as to why we were retiring it early. But for us, we&#8217;re looking at it. We&#8217;ve seen other people in this industry get upside down because of they were overlevered. You don&#8217;t exactly know what&#8217;s gonna happen at the halving. And we had a pretty steep discount on the debt that we could take advantage of. So we went ahead and did that, cleaned up the balance sheet. As a result, we now have more cash and Bitcoin than we do debt first time in two years. Also, typically around having, there&#8217;s potential for acquisition opportunities. Some people struggle, some people got ahead of their skis, and so they&#8217;re not able to continue operating, and that can be a good buying opportunity. And if you&#8217;re looking for acquisitions, or you want that optionality, you have to have a strong balance sheet. So a lot of that&#8217;s being opportunistic. We&#8217;re also super focused on reducing costs to mine Bitcoin. I think we reduce our costs from Q2 to Q3. And then we&#8217;ve also been exploring a lot of interesting ways that you can get really cheap, or ideally someday, potentially free power. So we have a pilot project we just announced in Utah, where we&#8217;re using the methane that comes off of a landfill, and using that to mine to power our Bitcoin Miners. It&#8217;s super cool. Yeah, we can get into that as you want. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s a really, neat project. We&#8217;re excited about. Well, let me finish on the first topic before I get too off track, then we can come back maybe to the methane thing. But that is by far our cheapest operating site. Like the energy cost is so much lower than anywhere else. So we&#8217;re very much focused on costs, because you can control costs as a company. So you want to do that as best as you can. The other thing you can do as well though is put yourself in a position to capitalize on upside. So cleaning up the balance sheet is part of that. I talked about like for interested in acquisitions, we want to have a really good balance sheet. The other part of that is growing hash rate and getting hash rate online now. Because in Bitcoin Mining, if Bitcoin starts to take off, the most profitable time is typically like in that first 6 to 12 months. When the price of Bitcoin is much higher than the global hash rate, which expands your margins. And the reason that happens is there are real world constraints in mining where it takes time to go buy machines, find a place to plug them in. If you&#8217;re going to build a facility, you have to buy transformers, containers, there can be leads. It&#8217;s a lot, right? And it can take 6 to 12 months to get miners online once you make the decision to actually purchase them. So if you have hash rate, what you want is you want hash rate on before that happens. So that you can capitalize on them as much of that upside that typically might occur in that 6  to 12 month window post halving if you believe in historical halving cycles. So that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re seeing us both do these things like really focus on reducing our costs, clean up our balance sheet as well as grow hash rate simultaneously. I think we&#8217;re supposed to be close to 23 or 26x a hash at the end of this year. We said we&#8217;re going to grow another 30% in 2024. So we&#8217;re really focused on doing both sides of that. If I had to really quickly summarize it, you don&#8217;t control price of Bitcoin, you don&#8217;t control global hash rates. So do everything you can to control the other variables. Grow your own hash rate, reduce your costs as much as possible. I think every miner knows that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. One second, Charlie, before we get into the methane project or other cool things, how does, just as a bit of a primer, how does one increase their hash rate? Because that is one of the magic variables that really does truly move the needle. How does one improve hash rate?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
The very oversimplified answer is buy Bitcoin Mining machines and plug them in. Obviously, it&#8217;s more nuanced than that. You want the latest and greatest technology always in the industry. You want the most powerful equipment and the most energy efficient equipment. So we&#8217;re always really focused on that. The other thing though is when you&#8217;re at the scale that we are, it&#8217;s not as easy as plug machine into the wall and sit back and just watch it make Bitcoin. There&#8217;s a lot more that goes into it. Air-cooled machines, for example, have to be cleaned about every 30 days because they get dusty.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Really? Holy shit. I didn&#8217;t know that.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah. It&#8217;s pretty frequent. And that&#8217;s, by the way, that&#8217;s one of the reasons that we were super excited about our immersion project that we did in the UAE, which has now been built out into&#8230; It&#8217;s going to be 250 megawatts worth of Bitcoin Mining because we ran that immersion project in the worst environment possible for Bitcoin Mining. Super hot, super humid, and it ran for over 100 days without anyone having to touch it. So that&#8217;s another thing that&#8217;s really big for us is the way you can increase hash rate. Again, this is part of our focus on technology, is you want to reduce downtime. So anytime a machine is offline, whether that&#8217;s heat, maintenance, repair, maybe curtailment, which happens in Texas a lot, that&#8217;s all lost revenue. That&#8217;s opportunity cost. So we&#8217;re really focused on trying to maximize uptime. 100% is theoretical, not necessarily possible. But we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of that in Texas. One of our facilities, the site that&#8217;s in McKamey, Texas, it&#8217;s at a big wind farm. That one historically struggled with uptime and our team&#8217;s been spending a lot of time there working on everything from just repairing machines to network connectivity, stuff that&#8217;s not super sexy, but just comes with territory of Bitcoin Mining. And we&#8217;ve really seen performance improve there. So you want to try to do what you can to increase performance, but in very simple terms, it&#8217;s also just a matter of like, you have to have the capital to buy a lot of machines, and then you have to have somewhere to plug them in.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. Very quickly, walk me through, because we do have a couple, we are getting a little tight for time, and there are definitely a couple topics that I&#8217;d love to jump into, but very quickly run me through the methane project out of Utah.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Sure. Yeah. So it&#8217;s that we&#8217;re running a small number of miners at a landfill in Utah. We&#8217;re working with a company. They&#8217;re called Nodal Power. They&#8217;re great. We really like them. We check. There&#8217;s a couple of people in the space that have figured out how to do that. We really like those guys. They&#8217;re good operators. This is a small site. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s not going to make a dent in our hash rate, but it has the potential to really change the way that Bitcoin Mining is done. So as we were talking about around the halving earlier, everything you have to lower your energy costs. That is the one big variable that you do control. Miners have this very interesting economic incentive to go find right now it&#8217;s been cheap power. In the future, it&#8217;s got to be basically free power. What you&#8217;re looking for is because if you don&#8217;t have free power in two halving cycles, unless Bitcoin&#8217;s very high, it&#8217;s going to look bad. You&#8217;ve got to plan for that now. We think like six, eight years ahead. So we&#8217;re trying to go after places that there&#8217;s potential for energy that literally no one can use. Landfills are one really interesting example of this. So landfills emit quite a lot of methane. I forget the exact percentage. It might be like 14% of all the methane in the United States is from landfills. I may have that number wrong. It was in the press release we issued, which I should know. But I&#8217;ll cite that. People can check it out. Typically, that energy is wasted, not all of it. So really big landfills, they produce enough methane that it makes sense to them to basically capture that methane and put it into a pipeline. Then that methane can be sold elsewhere and utilized elsewhere. So there are people who use the methane off of landfills for power, but there are a lot of really small landfills out there where it does not make any economic sense to capture the methane or build a pipeline to it, which is super expensive. And so typically this methane is flared, which it&#8217;s burnt, right, and turned into CO2. Or it&#8217;s fented, which means that you are literally just letting methane go into the atmosphere. And it&#8217;s been estimated that methane is 80 times worse of a greenhouse gas than CO2 is. So it&#8217;s a big environmental problem, actually. So what miners can do if this does work, it seems to be going quite well actually so far, but the question is, can this work at big scale? Is can you capture all this methane that&#8217;s currently being just vented into the atmosphere and use it converted into electricity, basically clean it, burn it. So you produce CO2 as byproducts, and then you produce electricity and use that electricity to power your Bitcoin Miners. If you do that, you&#8217;re reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and you&#8217;re leveraging energy that no one else was using that already existed. So the energy to begin with is super cheap. You&#8217;re actually benefiting the environment, which is contrary to how most people think about Bitcoin Mining today. Certainly how the media tends to portray it. And you can actually, in addition, lower your costs because there&#8217;s potential for carbon credits or things like that. So it&#8217;s super exciting for those reasons. There&#8217;s another, and I know this is a little long-winded, but it&#8217;s cool, which is I think that this can make Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate much more decentralized. So with public companies coming on board, these sites have gotten really big. You&#8217;re talking hundreds of megawatts at some of these, 300 megawatts, 500 megawatts. And so you kind of get this concentration in hash rate, which as Bitcoiners, people love. Although, to be fair, it&#8217;s not huge percentages of the network. But what I think this is going to do is it&#8217;s going to take mining off grid, and it&#8217;s going to take it to much smaller sites. So I think long-term, if stuff like this works, you&#8217;re going to end up with mining that is much more decentralized and spread out all over the world, and leveraging stuff like methane as its source of power. So I think you&#8217;re going to get more decentralized hash rate. I think it&#8217;s going to get cheaper power, and I think it&#8217;s actually going to be cleaner all at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool. I love that. Such an interesting space and we barely scratched the surface. Another not elephant in the room per se, but another very sexy and trendy topic that absolutely everyone and perhaps even their grandmas are talking about is the Bitcoin ETF. A lot of people think it&#8217;s going to make Bitcoin absolutely rip. I don&#8217;t truly believe it will. Long term, I definitely think, I mean, how could it not help? I really don&#8217;t see any argument in regards to how it could not be a net positive in the future. But in the short term, I feel like it&#8217;s already somewhat priced in. What are your two cents on that? How&#8217;s the Bitcoin ETF? Couldn&#8217;t affect the price of Bitcoin? And will it have any effect on Marathon at all as well?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
I think yes to both. I think it, I don&#8217;t disagree with you that it&#8217;s getting priced in. I think this has been a large part of the, you know, the recent kind of rally in Bitcoin&#8217;s price is people are anticipating the approval of the ETF. I think for the industry, it&#8217;s super important. Bitcoin&#8217;s biggest problem, in my opinion, is that the user experience sucks. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s so bad.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s trash ass. It&#8217;s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yes. Like buying Bitcoin, holding Bitcoin, trading Bitcoin, selling it is all like very cumbersome. And honestly, it&#8217;s high risk. Like I know that most people who got into the space early, they love the idea of sovereignty over their money and over their assets. I&#8217;m one of those. I was like, I love the political and philosophical aspects of Bitcoin. But the reality is that the majority of people do not want to run the risk of being able to vaporize their net worth by forgetting their private keys. And so like custody, right? So like, it&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s real. Like, it&#8217;s scary. And so like custody is super important or some type of vehicle that makes it easy for people to get exposure without running that risk of vaporizing a ton of their assets is really important. So I think the ETF is a vehicle like that. It doesn&#8217;t solve all the problems, obviously. But it is a very familiar way for people to get direct to get exposure to Bitcoin, maybe not direct without having to worry about custody and the potential consequences of that much freedom. So I think it&#8217;s actually really good for the industry. I think it&#8217;ll pull new people in. What is it going to do to miners? Kind of remains to be seen. What we&#8217;ve seen so far is miners haven&#8217;t exactly been trading and locks up with Bitcoin. You know, historically, miners have held much higher beta to the underlying asset. And I do think like long term, that&#8217;s true. Gold miners tend to operate this way. Gold miners have higher beta to gold. So I and I think Bitcoin Miners will are very similar to that. But I think what you might see in the short term is kind of people move out of mining stocks and move into the ETF. Because previously, one of the primary thesis of mining stocks was that they were a an easy way to get exposure to Bitcoin. Now, I think people are going to look at them as yeah, so I think they&#8217;re still an easy way because they&#8217;re publicly traded stock. But I think people will now look at them more the way they look at gold miners. So there&#8217;s, you know, you can capture the cash flow from the company, but also it&#8217;s a levered play on Bitcoin. So I think it&#8217;s just going to change like the mix of investors and what people are interested in. But overall for Bitcoin adoption, I think it&#8217;s quite helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah. Amazingly said there. And again, I said I am an investor in Marathon. I never sold one share since I got in 2020. And why did I get in in 2020? I was like, in Canada, we have a TFSA, which is like, I believe your version of the, what&#8217;s it called? Oh geez, how am I forgetting this? What&#8217;s the retirement account again called?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Oh, IRAs. 401Ks.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Exactly, where you guys can invest tax free. That&#8217;s our version of tax free investing, TFSAs and RSPs. And I was like, okay, I already bought some regular Bitcoin. How can I do this and not get taxed when I want to sell? Oh, lovely. There&#8217;s a company like Marathon who has a shit ton of Bitcoin on their balance sheet and who&#8217;s doing great things in the space. It&#8217;s an absolute no brainer. So I totally agree with you. I still think companies like yourselves who do have other verticals as well, where it&#8217;s not just Bitcoin Mining. You guys are investing in a bunch of tech and other cool stuff. I think that&#8217;ll definitely move the needle. But we are getting tight for time here, Charlie. One last question, then we&#8217;ll wrap up. Hopefully knock on wood, fingers crossed, bull market incoming. If it is, how have you guys prepped yourselves to absolutely take advantage of this and make some shit happen?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Schumacher</strong><br />
Yeah, love that. The optimistic side, right? So one is getting a lot of hash rate online, which we&#8217;ve been doing a lot this year. We went from 7x of hash to 19, supposed to be 26 by the end of the year. So that&#8217;s been like a ton of growth. And obviously you want that online so that you can make Bitcoin if and when Bitcoin goes into a bull market. So keeping continuing to grow is a huge one. The other one, I think that we&#8217;ll come back to look really positive is the fact that we&#8217;ve cleaned up our balance sheet so much. So you really want to be in good position for acquisition opportunities or to buy a bunch of machines or to buy immersion tanks, whatever it is, when other people can&#8217;t because you want to move first. And that&#8217;s actually historically what Marathon&#8217;s done. In 2020, we bought machines before anyone else could. And as a result, we&#8217;re, you know, we kind of cornered the market for that. And that&#8217;s what allowed Marathon to grow so much so fast. So that&#8217;s still in our DNA. We still keep focus on that of trying to grow as much as possible. But we&#8217;re doing so in a much more controlled and intellectual manner these days.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are Buzzin as always, and I am super pumped to have the one and only Lars Seier Christensen on the show today, Chairman of Swiss nonprofit Concordium Foundation. He has over 30 years of experience across the banking and financial sector, is a global pioneer in FX and derivatives trading and Co-Founded the online trading and investment platform, Saxo Bank in 1992, where he served as co-CEO for more than 20 years, in which time the bank grew to 1500 employees across 150 locations, serving customers in 170 countries. Wowza. He is also a founder and sole owner of Seier Capital, a private equity and venture capital firm specializes in investments in angel seed and around stage companies, the firm invests in art and fashion, financial services, food and beverage, sports, entertainment, social media and technologically industries. Super pumped to have this lad on the show. Lars, welcome to the show, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Thanks very much. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you on. It&#8217;s crazy that you and I first met almost two years ago, almost two years ago to this day. Crazy to think back in Dubai, 2021 blockchain expo and you and I hit it off not so much for our love for crypto and blockchain, but our love for hockey and football, more specifically hockey. I absolutely love this. I think this is a super cool place to start. You got to tell me your hockey inception story. What made you fall in love with the sport and why do you love it so much?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I have a good friend that was running a Danish Hockey team and brought it out of bankruptcy about 10 years ago. And he reached out to me and said, do you want to be part of this and see if we can take it to the next level? And I went to see a couple of matches and said, okay, let&#8217;s give it a shot. Before that, I wasn&#8217;t sort of a regular every weekend Hockey go or just watch the big matches on TV. But since then, I&#8217;ve spent a lot more time with hockey and we actually proceeded to win the Danish Championship a couple of times over the last four or five years. So it&#8217;s been quite good. This year&#8217;s a little dodgy, but we don&#8217;t know to the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. It&#8217;s crazy. A lot of Danes are playing in the NHL now. It seems like every year you guys have a couple more guys come to the NHL. I mean, the most famous Dane at least in my eyes, not league wide, but as a Toronto guy, is Frederick Anderson, you know, big goalie. He used to play for us. We used to love him. He was great for us. He&#8217;d always sort of choking the playoffs, but cest la vie. But it&#8217;s just such a good sport. It is true that there&#8217;s nothing like hockey. Like, and it&#8217;s tough because the game could grow so globally, but the barrier to entry is so bloody high, and the rules are just very difficult to understand. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Yeah, and I think I&#8217;m actually quite surprised also that we have that many players in any cell and other leagues because the sport is not big in Denmark. I would say we&#8217;ve probably got about 1500, 2000 serious players, but we actually seem to have some really great talent occasionally. And the national team, of course, has been a regular in Ruby for the last 15 years or so. We&#8217;re punching a little bit above our weight there compared to the times with this sport, but it&#8217;s very enjoyable. And I love going up to the hockey hall. It&#8217;s more like a family atmosphere than when you go to the big football.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, I love that. That&#8217;s awesome. Let&#8217;s jump into the business side of things here Lars. You co-founded Saxo Bank and that is obviously an incredible story. The barrier to entry of creating a bank is just absurdly high. And then let alone having a bank that succeeds is also just absurd. You and the team did it. Absolutely incredible. What are some of the biggest lessons that you learned, you know, perhaps some of your leadership or management styles? Like how did you and the team grow a bank from a small little thing to one of the biggest in the world? Because that&#8217;s again, you&#8217;re literally only a handful of people in the planet who&#8217;ve ever done that. What are some of the biggest lessons, key takeaways or perhaps even better stories that you have along the 30 years of growing it?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I think there&#8217;s some interesting parallels to the blockchain industry because what really gave us our opportunity was being very early adopters of the internet back in the day. While we found it as a tiny company in 1992, when we were not a bank at the time that came later, we embraced the internet that was in the very early states in the mid 90s, obviously, and brought out one of the first trading platforms in 1997, which was extremely early days for online trading. So it was really the early adoption of a new transformative technology that I think enabled us to find a good place there. That has always been the focus of the bank. We are a bank, but there&#8217;s a lot of banking things we don&#8217;t do, right? So we&#8217;re more of an investment facilitating bank and have this trading platform that we then, over the years, continue to develop. So today it&#8217;s a very broad platform where you can basically trade tens of thousands of assets. And if you have a macro approach, you can cover most of that on this platform if not everything. So the internet was the key to that. And just like back in those days when we were fascinated by a new technology, which was, at that time, by no means a given. I had many conversations with top TradFi guys that said, you&#8217;re wasting your time with this internet people. Always want to speak with a dealer on the phone and stuff. We said, maybe, but we got to give it a shot. And I experienced a little bit of the same here. You have another transformative technology, which also is fairly early station and around, which is also low skepticism. So I think some of those learnings from back in the day with the internet comes in quite handy now and gives you confidence that we will eventually get with broad adoption of blockchain because it makes a lot of sense just like the internet did.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Was there a specific moment back in 1997? And again, that&#8217;s wild. I can&#8217;t even, I mean, I was born in 1995. So obviously I don&#8217;t remember, you know, anything that early on, but 1997, that you guys must have been one of the first trading platforms in the whole world. Like how did you even develop a trading platform that early on in the internet days?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Yeah, I think for our sort of area, which at the time was mostly foreign exchange and derivatives, I think we were probably number two or three in the world realistically, right? And then, of course, it&#8217;s like everything else, like with the blockchain industry, you know, you start small in an area where, you know, the one-eyed is leading the buying, right? So, a little bit more very basic platform that we developed with a handful of engineers. And we just started it, you know, and nobody else was doing it, certainly none of the big banks. And, and to me, I mean, I&#8217;m not part of the same company anymore. I sold out my last years, about five years ago. But today there&#8217;s like a thousand engineers there. So, so we started very small, but very simple. I remember sitting designing, you know, we&#8217;re like a buy button here and we&#8217;d like a sell button there, B-scroll bill. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of competition back in those days. And actually, there wasn&#8217;t a lot of customers embracing it either the first few years, because it was just too different, you know? So as the first two or three years, we even ourselves sort of doubted it sometimes because we saw it was so obvious that it was a lot better than sitting with phones and dealers. And but, still, it took a few years to really gain traction. And I think that&#8217;s the story of new technology, no matter how value adding they are.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Oh, such a cool story. One last question on the good old days, then we&#8217;ll get into crypto and blockchain, DeFi and all the fun stuff like that. I wanna get into Lars for a second. You worked your tail off for so long, you still do, but how did you manage, and again, I would love for my feet to be in your shoes one day, how did you manage to pursue so many passions and fun projects on the side, sports teams, charities, you name it, while grinding so hard at the bank? Like it just seems like that&#8217;s an impossible feet. I&#8217;m doing one 100 of what you&#8217;re doing, and I&#8217;m having trouble with the work-life balance and grinding and making everything work. How the heck did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Well, I guess, I just, I&#8217;m sort of quite emotional. And if I find something I like. I like to get involved in it. Obviously, the success of Saxo Bank and the subsequent sales have also given me some financial possibilities that I didn&#8217;t have back in the early days. But sometimes I also actually believe I bite off more than I can chew, to be honest, because some of my projects probably deserve a little bit more time and love than I have available for them. But particularly in later years, I&#8217;ve very much taken the focus at, you know, you&#8217;ve got to do stuff that you really enjoy, that you really love being part of. And not necessarily the monetary return for all of this. It&#8217;s nice to have a few things here and there that work out well financially, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be all about financial return. And so I got two wonderful restaurants. They&#8217;re not going to be the next Saxo Banks, but it&#8217;s a great joy. I got the Ice Hockey Club, I got the Football Club and a whole range of other activities. And also just keeping engaged in stuff that I really enjoy being part of, you know. And it&#8217;s a combination of like hardcore business things and stuff that are a little bit more less orientated where you make a lot of people happy because you give them experiences, etc. And then there&#8217;s a sort of third category of things that I would like to understand better. So I might make an investment just to force myself to understand it better, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Some skin in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Yeah, exactly. Because if you have a stake in a business, you&#8217;re kind of naturally inclined to keep at least an eye on it. And that would spread to like lab based meats and stuff that I think will be very important in the future, but where I find it interesting to have a reason to follow it. You know, and I have a number of examples in that category as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s incredible. Lars, you gotta give me some gold mines here. Walk me through some morning rituals, nighttime rituals, daily routines? Like, how do you stay locked in, dialed in for such a long period of time and be so bloody efficient?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m that efficient, but I&#8217;m not sort of a big&#8230; I don&#8217;t dream about going and be a pensioner, or sit on a beach or anything like that. I do like to have fun, you know? But I actually, you know, one of the things that people talk a lot about is this life-work balance word, which I hate because it&#8217;s kind of implying that life is one thing and work is another, right? And for me, work is a very significant part of life because I think that&#8217;s where you live out your own, you know, your own potential and your own ambitions. So for me, that&#8217;s a very important part. So I don&#8217;t have that distinguishment between some of the time I don&#8217;t have to work. Of course, I do stuff that&#8217;s not directly work-related, but most of my day is involved in some kind of work activity. I&#8217;m quite, in a way, quite happy to not be with the bank anymore because now I can put it exactly when I want. A lot of it is like here over Zoom or Teams or whatever. And you can basically be anywhere in the world. You can schedule your time as you please. You probably get to do a lot of hours, but you do them on your own sort of schedule, right? And then I can only recommend drinking a fair bit of good red wine. That&#8217;s good for keeping your energy levels on.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Hey, we&#8217;re down in Mexico. I&#8217;m currently down in Mexico now too. The one thing that&#8217;s lovely down here is the tequila. I mean some nice sipping tequila every once in a while. That&#8217;s lovely. It&#8217;s hard to get a good bottle of red down here. My friends and I have found, but the tequila is plentiful. The mezcal is plentiful and it&#8217;s nice. It&#8217;s not like back home where tequila, you know, runs in arm and a leg here. It&#8217;s a pennies on the dollar and you get some really quality stuff. So I feel it.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
You&#8217;re not going to run out to Tequila, Mexico City. That&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, 100%. It&#8217;s nice at night sometimes when you put in a good shift at work and you want to get the creative juices flowing, put a couple of words on paper, now put a couple of words on the computer, but you get what I mean here. Let&#8217;s jump into crypto and the fun stuff for a second. One of the big underlying narratives at Concordium and yourself is that DeFi is paving the way for a more inclusive financial future. 10 minutes ago in the pod, you just discussed the parallels you saw back in 1997 with the internet revolutionizing the finance industry and just all industries in the whole. On present day in the 2020s, we have blockchain, which hopefully and most likely will do the same thing. There are 1.4 billion people that are currently unbanked, which is absolutely bananas. What is there 8 billion people in the world, right? That&#8217;s just a crazy amount of people that are unbanked. DeFi has the ability to give everyone a bank. I&#8217;d love if you could, before we get into some more nitty gritty stuff and some more Concordium related stuff, just give me your thoughts on what exactly is the future of DeFi and how it will empower so many people and bank the unbanked.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I think technology in general has a democratizing effect. And again, if we take the parallel from back in the day, I was a foreign exchange dealer prior to Saxo Bank, where literally you have to deal with people on the phone. You could have two, let&#8217;s say four phones, if you were four phones in your hands sufficiently, and you could sort of speak to four people at the same time. When we did our platform in Saxo Bank we could do for tens, for hundreds, for thousands, for tens of thousands of people simultaneously, right? Which also meant that we could bring down the barriers to be part of the financial industry, right? So it has a strongly democratizing effect. And I think it&#8217;s the same here, the traditional way of doing things is somewhat exclusive. It&#8217;s not necessarily because of bad will from the banks, but it&#8217;s simply that the systems are so costly and so complicated that it&#8217;s very hard for them to justify bringing on very small clients. It&#8217;s simply gonna be losing business. And it&#8217;s a total order to demand from a bank that it should lose tons of money on doing essentially the right thing, right? So it has a lot to do with the old technology and not being very suitable for banking smaller clients, basically, as opposed to a heavy regulatory aspect, which doesn&#8217;t make it easier. So some of the regulatory hurdles that you can, albeit on or as you can fulfill in Western Europe or the States or this part of the world, very hard to meet in some of the emerging markets where some people don&#8217;t even have an ID or unable to verify the necessary information for KYC purposes, et cetera. So we shouldn&#8217;t think that this is sort of conspiracy to keep people out of the market, but I don&#8217;t think it is. I think genuinely banks like to have customers, but the combination of old school technology, that&#8217;s very clunky and high requirements for ID KYC makes it very difficult for the traditional sector to bank this 1.4 billion people now. Blockchain and the internet, to some extent, of course, are solving one side of that issue, which is we now have a technology that actually makes it fairly easy to get people involved in the financial system that hasn&#8217;t solved the regulatory aspect. And I think that&#8217;s the next concern here. How do we find a way to comfortably integrate all these unbanked people into the financial system to a degree that&#8217;s acceptable to regulators? Because if you can&#8217;t do that in a way that is acceptable to regulators, well, then you&#8217;re gonna have to be on the borderline all the time and perhaps across the borderline of legality. And that&#8217;s, of course, what we&#8217;re already seeing, that some of these things while being very efficient, blockchain, DeFi, et cetera, are efficient and engaging people, but definitely borderline from a legal point of view and sometimes worse than that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very true. How do you even go about the whole regulatory aspect though? Because again, you nailed it on the head. We have the infrastructure and we have the tech, i.e. DeFi, crypto, blockchain. In order for the unbanked people, using an example of the many people in Africa who don&#8217;t have access to this technology, they can do this. There is an opportunity for them to get internet, but then just like you said, there&#8217;s the regulatory shit show. No banks want to come in and build their own infrastructure because it&#8217;s not profitable. At the end of our profit business, they&#8217;re not a non for profit, they&#8217;re not a charity. How do we get all the countries involved to at least talk to each other, to at least take down some of these walls, take down some of these barriers for the regulatory shit show to finally end?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I think there&#8217;s a general consensus among most people in the world that we want to not make it too easy to be a criminal. We don&#8217;t want terror financing. We don&#8217;t want money laundering, et cetera. And that&#8217;s why you have these requirements for our ID and for know your customer rules, et cetera. So I think the idea is fundamental, but I think part of this technology as we&#8217;ve already seen now, as in yesterday, that you now say we&#8217;re going to have an ID for all citizens in the EU, there&#8217;s a number of also technology enabled ID solutions in a lot of emerging markets coming up. And I think that&#8217;s another thing that this makes easier than it would be to go around and issue physical passports and stuff like that. I&#8217;m heading down to Nigeria day after tomorrow, where I believe around 80 million people don&#8217;t have an ID. But then now you, you finally enough, most of them have a smartphone, right? So then now you&#8217;re linking the ownership of a smartphone subscription to the new national ID. And these things are essential because very hard for anyone to say I am willing to enter into a financial transaction, having no idea who you are, no idea what the money comes from, et cetera. That&#8217;s just not doable under generally agreed regulations or standards. So using also this technology to at least get people an ID, which is not just about financial services. Imagine that you have really have no identity. You are just that person living 30 meters from the church kind of thing, right? It&#8217;s a big problem, even apart from from being part of the financial system, that a lot of people in this world simply don&#8217;t have an ID. They don&#8217;t have an identity and you need that in many other contexts. So I think that&#8217;s one problem you need to solve. Then I hope to see regulators also making it a little easier. I mean, if amounts involved are not significant and are unlikely to be part of a criminal scheme or a terrifying thing, I think you can put some kind of minimum limit where you say, but below this level, we can be a little light on KYC, as long as we know the ID. That&#8217;s my hope because otherwise, you are not going to get this 1.4 billion people legally banked at least you can of course do illegal things and illegal transfers and that, but that&#8217;s not a very healthy business model and it&#8217;s not going to interest very many serious people, right? So there is a balance between getting more ID out there. Well, it&#8217;s a lot of initiatives around the emerging markets around regulators maybe losing a little bit on, let&#8217;s say the lower end of the income spectrum and then of course, use some of this new technology. So I&#8217;m optimistic, but it&#8217;s really important because this is sometimes the narrative in our industry that old banks are really the arctic people, they don&#8217;t want to support these unbanked people, but it is really very hard for them to do that on the old technology and the regulatory regulations that they are on the, you know, so, so we need to, we solve kind of a lot of the technology now, I think we need to now solve the ID and then we need to take a somewhat softer approach at least for smaller clients, right? Where it&#8217;s very unlikely that&#8217;s the criminals involved or something really bad. But at the same time, I think we all have an interest in that there are some safeguards against criminal activity and terror financing and so on. That&#8217;s an everybody&#8217;s interest, I believe unless you are a terrorist or criminal, but I don&#8217;t think we can let that decide our actions, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
You&#8217;re on fire right now, mate. We do have to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor to the show. And when we get back, we are going to jump right into Concordium and talk about how Lars and the team are doing exactly what he just spoke about. And that is giving the opportunity for millions of unidentifiable humans to get their own ID, which I absolutely love. And again, crazy to think that some people don&#8217;t even have IDs. Like imagine again, being a 28 year old dude who doesn&#8217;t even know, you know, your parents were you from absolutely wild. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50, to receive 50% of your deposit, credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Lars. Lars, let&#8217;s jump right into Concordium. I feel like most of the listeners already know what you and the team do. One of the most interesting aspects of the biz is exactly what we just discussed, and that is giving IDs to people who don&#8217;t have them. And that is using a combination of ZK Tech and a bunch of other really fun, interesting, and novel pieces of tech. I&#8217;d love if you could give a quick sort of TLDR 360 overview on what exactly you and the team are building and how you are going to hopefully give IDs to all the people who don&#8217;t currently have.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Well, I mean, the sort of fundamental idea of Concordium is to try to build this bridge between decentralization, which I&#8217;m a big believer in and see a lot of benefit from, not least because I&#8217;ve seen centralized the TradFi from the inside. And I know the huge amount of pain points and problems are that great. So decentralization is great, but we also have to be realistic around the requirements of society around you, the regulators, the lawmakers, general society has a lot of things they wanna impose on an industry. Now, that&#8217;s not very popular with the sort of the originals of this industry, but it&#8217;s just the fact that you can choose to live up to it or not, or to accept it and try to find solutions. So our vision with Concordium was to marry the decentralized, all the stuff that we all know is great about blockchain, but at the same time have some respect for the rules and society around us. And you can have all sorts of ideological ideas about that. You can be an anarchist, you can think you want a different world, but the fact is if you wanna see mainstream adoption for this industry, it is going to be, to a large extent, on the terms and conditions of the world as is. Now then we can go do things a lot smarter, a lot better, a lot more efficiently, a lot more secure, but at the end of the day, we have to expect to follow the same rules as everybody else. So that&#8217;s the key thing. Now, in terms of the bottom line of all sort of trustworthy interaction is really that you know who you&#8217;re dealing with. That&#8217;s kind of the baseline because knowing your client and the general KYC and checking people&#8217;s credentials and their understanding of what you might be proposing to them, et cetera, is one thing, but it&#8217;s all pretty relevant if you don&#8217;t know with certainty that you are Matt and I&#8217;m Lars, and then all KYC becomes pretty academic if we can&#8217;t be sure about that point. So that&#8217;s the core thing that we have built in at a foundational layer. I mean, most blockchains and outcoming rounds realizing it&#8217;s an absolute metathesis. So there&#8217;s a lot of Layer2 ID solutions being built and that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s a necessary direction for the space, but we chose to build it in at a time when it was less obvious to build it in at the Layer1, which then has the advantages that can go across all the use cases instead of being kind of the silos that we know from the old system, right? Now, just to correct you a bit, we can&#8217;t actually create an ID for an unidentified Nigerian. We can take his basic ID and lift it into an environment where you can get a lot of benefits from it, but we&#8217;re not issuing IDs to people that don&#8217;t have ID, right? We need to base ourselves off a credible ID, at least at this point, maybe it could be different in the future, but for us, it&#8217;s a question of taking that basic ID which you probably can&#8217;t do very much, to be honest, except that you at least have an identity and can use that in various ID and KYC processes. We take that ID and put it into an efficient environment where you can then use it across a whole range of different activities and projects and use cases, right? So just to clarify that, but we are dependent on the user having been IDed by a trustworthy ID issuer in the first place, right? But the whole thing here is that right now, this world is only going one way. In the old days, it used to be the financial sector where there was a lot of focus on ID and KYC, but today, you&#8217;re going to a gallery and you want to buy a painting, you have to go through KYC, you want to interact with a social media platform and you can see all the problems when people actually not appropriately IDed where people can do fake profiles, do all sorts of calls, all sorts of maim around it. So ID, at its basic form, I think, is increasingly very necessary across almost all walks of life now. But the important thing there is that having ID and being willing to ID yourself is not equal to not having privacy. There&#8217;s big difference between anonymity and privacy, so knowing that that person has been willing to, or an organization has been willing to ID itself, actually allows you to offer, extend more privacy to that individual than they used to in the current old system, right? As a simple example, if you send your kid down to the liquor store to pick up a bottle of wine, then if there&#8217;s any doubt whether that person&#8217;s over 18 or 21 and other jurisdictions, well, then they will ask for ID, which means you pass over a social security card or your passport and all of a sudden give a lot of information to an unknown person that&#8217;s just in the liquor store and could be abused from that point of view, right? Where with modern self-serving ID, you can control the watch characteristics of your ID that you need in any given circumstance. Now, in that particular case, the only thing that person needs to know is you&#8217;re over 18. Doesn&#8217;t need to know how old, yeah, actually he doesn&#8217;t need to know how old you are, as long as you&#8217;re over 18, doesn&#8217;t need to know where you live, doesn&#8217;t need to know your security number, doesn&#8217;t need to know your name, et cetera, but in the current system where ID is kind of the access, you say all or nothing type thing, right? It creates a lot of additional respect just when you actually ID yourself. So I think the beauty of a certain eyes-based ID on blockchain is that you get much more control over your ID and in that sense gain much more privacy than you have in the current system. So I think that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll see much more of and with current developments in AI and deep fake and avatars and all that, already now you can&#8217;t actually be sure that you&#8217;re talking to me. This could be an avatar, in fact, I have one. And I think it could be my avatar you spoke to, except they&#8217;ll probably be more intelligent because I would have put more stuff into the brain of it than I have, right? So in those scenarios, which are gonna be more and more common, it would be nice to know with certainty, true in ID, that I am in fact lost and not an avatar, right? And I think this is only gonna get more and more up to you with other technology developments at the moment. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, I do agree. We have to be getting close in regards to sort of the mass adoption of self-sovereign IDs well, especially with technology like ZK Tech, which is making it a lot easier and just more efficient to do exactly what you said and create this sort of binary identification system where someone can walk into a liquor store, grab a nice bottle of vino and it&#8217;s not a matter of, Lars, I need to see where you live, where you&#8217;re born, what color your eyes are, how tall you are. It&#8217;s not simply is he or she 18 or not. So I can&#8217;t wait for that as well. A couple more things on Concordium here, Lars, and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. And this has been an absolute treat. Having too much fun over here on my end. What else are you and the team working on? I know you guys have tons of plans. I know that on the video that was actually released this morning and doing a bit of show prep. There&#8217;s a bunch of noise on social media about something, maybe a little Christmas present from Lars and the Concordium team coming out. No one knows what it is. Will we see that Christmas present? That&#8217;s question numero uno. And numero dose is what&#8217;s on the agenda for 2024? What are you and the team planning on shipping and achieving?</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
I think, I don&#8217;t know, I hope we give Christmas presents every now and again throughout the year, right? So it sounds like I have planned something massive for the 24th, the 25th of December, but that will be good news, an interesting news coming on as we go along, including a couple of partnerships that we will announce before Christmas. So I think that should keep people happy enough. What we&#8217;re doing at the moment is we&#8217;re strengthening our look at verticals that we really want to support. That doesn&#8217;t mean anybody&#8217;s welcome. This is a use case agnostic, blockchain. So anybody is more than welcome, but of course we see areas where we have more traction than others and hence we want to make sure that we have the necessary infrastructure support that as well as possible. So an increased focus on certain verticals without saying to anybody that they&#8217;re not welcome, but just trying to support in particular areas like ESG, where we see a lot of interest at the moment, carbon credits type things, DeFi, which we think has wonderful potential, but also needs those aspects of ID KYC that we talked about, right? We&#8217;re looking at stuff in the automotive industry and trying to sort of focus our own proactive efforts in certain areas while still being there for anyone really that wants to build something on Concordium, because we are decentralized systems. It&#8217;s not for us to say you can build or you cannot build. So anybody can build, but we can choose where we try to supply a bit more as a sort of technology and stuff that makes it easier for those particular areas to engage with us. So I think 2024, I think the thing that this blockchain, I think lacks a little bit. I think we build a really good blockchain. I think the vision behind it is good. I think we are cutting edge around scalability, around finality, around the balance between accountability and privacy. We have stable fees and stuff like that. So we have built a really good blockchain that works very well. And I think really we need to tell more people about it. And that&#8217;s also why I appreciate having the opportunity here. We need to get more visibility for how great this blockchain really is. And that&#8217;s a strong focus area for 2024 to really, through proactive, reach out to companies that we think could be relevant, but could see Concordium as relevant to their needs. So a more proactive lead generation and stronger engagement from outside. But of course, also general visibility that people find it easier to get in touch with us to build on us, to be aware of our existence. So a lot of focus we&#8217;re going to that increased awareness and visibility because at the end of the day, we got a great blockchain here. It takes the boxes that any sort of serious use case would be interested in, I think. And we just need to tell more people about it. So that&#8217;s a very strong focus area for 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Yeah, it&#8217;s, I mean, heck, nowadays, you know, to quote Gary Vee, we live in the attention economy and it&#8217;s all about getting eyeballs on your product. And I mean, it&#8217;s sort of a key theme of the show is things that are binary and you either pay for it or create it. And that&#8217;s just how it works. But Lars, super pumped to have you on my friend. Great to speak with you again after two years. Incredible episode. And hopefully you and I can do round three together soon.  Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find Concordium and yourself personally, online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Yeah, the easiest access point I would say for broad access is concordium.com, the website where you can then see all of our many social media channels. We obviously got a Telegram group, which is quite active also, but if you want a full overview, I think concordium.com is a good place to start. Also there you will find that newly released AI-based chat box that actually amounts to very well questions in many different languages around sort of core information around Concordium. So that&#8217;s a good place to start. If you want to reach out to me, you can do it through the website or you can find me on other number of social media, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, you know, have your pick, but probably most of my sort of most business and related stuff is on LinkedIn where I should be fairly easy to find on. And you can actually see one of the things we did for combating fake profiles. If you go to my profile, you see what we call our mysome.id, where you can verify on Concordium that you are on fact on my profile and that somebody else&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And not a Lars doppelganger, a Lars fake. I love that. Lars, thanks again. Incredible episode, knowledge bombs everywhere. We&#8217;d love to see it. Can&#8217;t wait for round three and wishing you and the team all the best.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Seier</strong><br />
Thank you very much for having me, Matt. And then speak soon again.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Thank you. Folks what an episode with the one and only Lars Seier Christensen. He was dropping knowledge bombs left right and center. Anything on DeFi bringing the gap between DeFi and TradFi, IDs you name it, we covered it. Huge shout out to Lars and the team for making this happen listeners, love you guys as always.

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing, as always, still coming in hot for Mexico. And I am super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, Tara Fung, the Co-Founder and CEO of Co:Create. She is a growth-oriented leader who enables innovative brands to unlock the power of their community through gamified, self-owned reward programs. And we need a lot of this in Web3. She has a background in a multitude of things and was the Chief Revenue Officer of Alto, a leading crypto IRA and digital asset IRA custodian, where she forged partnerships with institutional crypto asset managers driving a staggering 25x revenue growth in just 18 months. Tons of other stuff on the bio. We&#8217;ll get into that later. Super pumped to have you on. Welcome to the show.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Thanks so much for having me. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you on before we get into Co:Create and the super fun stuff. We gotta get into you. But one of the things that I&#8217;m most excited to jump into as a big ball fan is the incredible work that you guys did with BR. And that&#8217;s what I assume everyone, I believe that&#8217;s the bread and butter, if not the most famous thing you&#8217;ve done. I can&#8217;t wait to get into the new tattoo partnership as well. That&#8217;s super cool. I&#8217;m actually a tattoo virgin. And I feel like, you know, especially as a sort of younger millennial, I&#8217;m 28 born in 95. I&#8217;m like one of the only people my age who don&#8217;t have tats, which is sort of wild too.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
I bet that&#8217;s true actually. And the funny thing is that women are more likely to have tattoos than men.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100% just like you know, I feel like the men get dumber and stupider tats than women do I feel like women usually put a little more thought into it. Whereas men just put stupid shit all over their body But we&#8217;ll get into that later but before we get into a lot of the Web3 and community related and loyalty related stuff tell the listeners and myself a little bit about your past. You know childhood where you grew up how you got into Web3 the whole nine yards</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so, Tara Fung, I&#8217;m from a small little town in rural North Carolina called China Grove. And people always ask me, is that the China Grove and the Doobie Brothers songs? Which it is not, it has zero claim to fame. There was like 4,000 people there, but I loved it. It was a great childhood. Grew up on what was somewhat of a farm with goat, this, that, and the other. And I just always wanted to figure out how the world works. And so I traveled a lot, I studied languages, I worked abroad, in undergrad I studied economics because I thought that would teach me how to approach problems. It would teach me a mindset and a skill set that I could apply to all different industries. So you&#8217;re probably already picking up, I&#8217;m a total nerd. And after a few years in the workforce where I was working for parent company in Mercedes Benz actually, I went back and got a graduate degree because I wanted to get into tech and I wanted to start building things. I just realized big companies weren&#8217;t the fit for me. I wanted to be doing small, scrappy, trying to change the future type stuff. And initially that got me into fintech and fintech got me into crypto and crypto got me into Web3. And then two years ago, I set out starting what is Co:Create and had been at it ever since through a bunch of different environments and ups and downs. And it&#8217;s been a wild and really enjoyable ride.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What was your first sort of taste into the Web3 world? Like was there a, did you get orange pill back in the day? Like what was your sort of welcome to the crypto world? Did you have that friend who bought drugs with Bitcoin or whatever the case may be? Like what was it sort of that catalyst?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Oh my gosh. So much tamer like y&#8217;all are going to realize how uncool I am. I think I&#8217;ll go through this Podcast. But so my first taste or exposure was actually, in grad school. So I went to Harvard for my MBA and we had this course that I took called managing the financial firm, which is as boring as it sounds. And one of the financial firms that we studied were crypto companies. So we actually studied Coinbase and this was in 2015. And so we were studying Coinbase and other crypto companies as like, this is a new type of financial company. And I remember at that time I was like, I don&#8217;t get it. And I also just don&#8217;t have time to get it. Like this is just not interesting enough for me. And so I am in no way is a crypto OG, right? I can&#8217;t say like I bought my first Bitcoin in 2012 or this, that and the other. And so I put it off on a shelf. I was like, this is not the time for me to explore this. It just doesn&#8217;t feel relevant yet. When I went to become the CRO of Alto IRA, we, that company enables individuals to utilize retirement funds, which has a lot of tax advantages to invest in alternative assets, whether that&#8217;s venture capital, private equity, private real estate and crypto. And it was then that I realized, okay, I can&#8217;t put this off anymore because I&#8217;m not going to talk to people about using retirement dollars to invest into crypto unless I understand it. And I don&#8217;t invest in things I don&#8217;t understand. So it&#8217;s time for me to go deep. I remember it took me probably took me two or three months of one of my colleagues talking to me about what a self custodial wallet was. And I was so, I could not grok this concept. Like I really could not get it at all. I was like, why do you need a wallet? I don&#8217;t understand. We were a custodian. I&#8217;m like, they&#8217;re custodians for this type of stuff. And then the first time, and so I really started in crypto approaching it from an investor lens, right? Like what are the role of these assets within a diversified portfolio, particularly like your more stable assets or more accepted assets like BTC and ETHs and at the time, Sol and some others. And when I first logged in, when I finally got the wallet piece, and I first logged into a Web3 powered site with my wallet, I was like, holy smokes. This is a game changer. I&#8217;m taking my identity with me. My identity is not stored in this app. Rather it is mine and my assets are coming with me and that was, then it was over.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And that was it. I love that. What was the first wallet?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
MetaMask.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s crazy though. Like I hear these stories all the time. I remember the first time I got MetaMask and it&#8217;s so scary. Right? Cause like, you know, I fortunately had a couple of mentors and close friends who sort of walked me through the process, but like sending that first transaction when someone gives you, when someone gives you sort of the, you know, the prefix of this could literally go to the abyss. If you mess up one of these 20 something letters and numbers, you&#8217;re just like, holy shit. This is sort of spooky.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
You know, it is scary and I think that&#8217;s just an indication of the fact that this market is immature because the way that it works now is not the way that it can work or should work going forward. Like you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about if I lose this crazy long password or someone steals it, my financial future is in jeopardy, right? Like that is not the way that things should work and that&#8217;s definitely going to change.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And that&#8217;s one of the things that you guys are doing incredibly is building, you know, Web3 tech that looks and feels like Web2, like it&#8217;s got to be clean. It&#8217;s got to be sexy. It&#8217;s got to be frictionless, seamless. And we&#8217;ll get into that soon. I guess the bread and butter, the show is obviously you Co:Create and Web3 loyalty. Let&#8217;s jump right into Web3 loyalty. This is something incredibly powerful. We&#8217;ve seen a lot of brands. We&#8217;ve seen Starbucks. We&#8217;ve seen Nike, some of the biggest fortune 500 brands jump into this to try to really, you know, to try to make the terrain and leave the station. And very few people have truly done it yet. But like you said, being able to bring your identity with you and actually having something that&#8217;s black and white and not gray is truly powerful. In your eyes, how does Web3 loyalty? How is it really an upgrade on the traditional loyalty programs? Just as a whole, give us sort of the 360 degree elevator pitch on why Web3 loyalty is so much more powerful and has such a higher ceiling than classic Web2 loyalty programs.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, I like to say that the term a loyalty program is the most euphemistic term possible for what these programs actually are. They are not loyalty programs, they&#8217;re captivity programs. You earn things that you never own and if you decide you want to leave, you have to leave everything behind. And so that&#8217;s not loyalty. Loyalty is something that is given and something that is earned on both sides where there are mutual commitments made to one another. And Chris Dixon has this quote around, blockchains are computers that can make commitments. And I think the existing loyalty programs we have today, the commitments are one sided where the brand is unilaterally determined what is being earned that it has never owned and they can change the rules at any time and if they do, you&#8217;re stuck with it. And we saw this with Delta. One pushback that we would get and still do is well, clearly this benefits the brands disproportionately because they&#8217;re the ones in control and what they have no incentive to change. And I think some of the largest brands, you&#8217;re right, they have no incentive to change and to give more power control, voice saying ownership over to their community, over to the members of their loyalty programs. But there are a lot of brands who aren&#8217;t Delta. There are a lot of brands who are looking to stand out, who are trying to figure out how do I acquire and engage customers because I&#8217;m not so big that I can just set my own rules and say basically deal with it. And for those brands, the true power of Web3 is that it opens up a better way for you to engage and to gamify interactions with an audience to make them want to give you their time, their attention, their share of wallet, as well as it allows you to enter into these flexible coalition loyalty programs where your assets can be used at other brands and vice versa so that you can now market to like-minded communities. And you can open up not just retention, but acquisition because loyalty programs, they are typically managed by the quote and quote CRM or retention team at a brand. They are seen as a way to increase someone&#8217;s spending, someone&#8217;s LTV lifetime value with a brand. They are not seen as a way to acquire and grow a brand&#8217;s customer base. But in this world that we&#8217;re living now where try to get in front of a 14 year old girl, right? Like try to find a way and add that we&#8217;ll get in front of a 14 year old girl. Like she&#8217;s in Roblox, she&#8217;s in Fortnite, she&#8217;s in like, how are you gonna do this? And the way that you&#8217;re gonna do it going forward is because people, you&#8217;re going to have these communities that are super fans of brands and they&#8217;re going to be incentivized and encouraged and rewarded for telling others about it. And we&#8217;ll be able to track and reward those activities all on chain. And so I think the summary is Web3 Loyalty provides brands a better toolkit to grow, reward, engage an audience and it provides consumers the ability to own their loyalty, which actually then engenders loyalty, not captivity.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That was absolute gold. We gotta take a step back and excuse my ignorance here. What happened with Delta? I&#8217;m Canadian in Canada. It&#8217;s like all about aeroplanes. We have like two airlines. We fly Air Canada or WestJet. Really only the two in Canada. You gotta give me the deets. What happened with Delta?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
So, and this hurts me because I am a Delta Gold Medallion member, but basically what Delta did was they came out about a month and a half ago and they said, the way that miles and status have been earned is changing and deal with it. And what those changes were, you no longer actually get miles based on how much you fly, it&#8217;s based on how much you spend, which the question then becomes like, are you an airline or are you a financial institution? And they doubled the requirements to achieve status. So Silver Medallion, Gold Medallion, the status that actually starts to unlock the real aspirational benefits, they doubled it. And the thing is, it&#8217;s like, OK, well, I could just say I want to leave. You know, it&#8217;s the brand should be able to change things. They have to be able to evolve, but consumers should also be able to leave. And there is no concept of rage quitting within loyalty programs. These miles I have, I can&#8217;t even send them to my husband without paying a cent per mile. If I wanted to send 30,000 miles, I would have to pay $300. I might as well buy him a ticket, right? The Medallion status, it&#8217;s not mine. I can&#8217;t get out. I spent this entire year working for it because you work for it for one year. And then you get it really the next year. And the only way I can really realize those benefits is if I continue to fly Delta. So it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s a rigged game. And I think everyone has really seen that and they&#8217;ve just struggled with why is the power dynamics so disproportionate? Because a lot of people said, no, Delta, I&#8217;ve chosen to fly with you consistently, even when it involved layover. And for this. And now you went and changed everything without consulting us at all.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I&#8217;m the exact same with Air Canada. Fair Canada ever changes. I mean, riots. I&#8217;m gonna be the leader of the Air Canada Riot crew. Before we get into Co:Create, are there any Web3 brands or any loyalty programs that you are truly in love with or that you idolize or at least want to steal from? Like, who&#8217;s doing it right right now?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
So one of the brands that I think is so forward-thinking and is really changing what loyalty can mean, it&#8217;s a brand that was born into Web3 called KIKI World. And the reason I say born into Web3 is if you go to their website, you actually have no idea that there&#8217;s Web3 under the hood. Candidly, they are one of our clients. So all of the on-chain things that they&#8217;re doing are powered by API&#8217;s. So I love them for that reason too. But the way that they work is every single product they create is voted on by the community. So they&#8217;re a beauty, it&#8217;s really powerful because they&#8217;re a beauty brand, right? There are so many beauty brands. It&#8217;s actually really hard to distinguish yourself in that market. You&#8217;re going and you&#8217;re up against every other brand who&#8217;s buying the same ads and ad words on these various platforms. They will come out and say, we&#8217;re gonna make this amazing. Nail polish, here are the 10 shades, vote on your shade. They&#8217;ll show the leaderboards. You get points for voting. You then get minted a collectible, an NFT based on the color you vote for. And when that color, whichever color wins, that color is created. And then if you have the right collectible, you voted for the color that won, you actually, that NFT can be used to get a $5 discount in purchasing the product. So it&#8217;s like Co:Created, it&#8217;s gamified, it&#8217;s rewarding, it&#8217;s all underneath the hood, no Web3 wallet or knowledge required in order to participate. So I really love them as an example.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s huge. Another talk we have to get into, you&#8217;re absolutely on fire by the way, there&#8217;s so many different areas we can take this. The power of APIs, it&#8217;s like one of the most important and I guess another recurring theme of the pod is powerful because again, loyalty programs are powerful but APIs have literally become one of the most powerful pieces of software in tech present day. Like we&#8217;ve even seen it with the new sort of open AI API that came out and how many people are now creating their own GPTs. It&#8217;s just APIs are powering all of the web. It&#8217;s just web hook city, population APIs, they&#8217;re tearing it up, they&#8217;re doing incredible things. And it allows companies like you guys to create incredible pieces of tech and then so seamlessly allow all of your clients and partners and community to just like, hey, we built something that&#8217;s pretty frigging sick and you can snag it for a very fair price and you don&#8217;t have to do any of the heavy lifting we did it. It&#8217;s absolutely incredible. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about just the importance of APIs and how it&#8217;s such an integral part of your business and really everyone else&#8217;s business present day and moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, no, it&#8217;s a really great question. When we were starting, the thing that we believe to be true is that the best brands in the world, they want to own the experience layer. They want to be able to create these stories and tell them better than anyone else. And so the front end, if you will, everything that a consumer sees and engages with, they want to be able to make that theirs truly. And so we were considering, do we offer a white label solution where you basically just skin the same thing over and over again with slightly different colors and fonts, or do we want to build an API first product that is truly embeddable, that is behind the scenes that&#8217;s invisible to the consumer? We&#8217;re like, if we&#8217;re going after the best brands in the world, we have to build an API first product. One, it&#8217;s way more scalable, it allows for much more robust types of programs that are very different, and two, it makes the brand be the one in the spotlight. It allows them to truly come up with the experience they want to provide and the story they want to tell. And we&#8217;re just obfuscating everything that&#8217;s hard on chain, from programmable wallets to membership management, to token deployment, to mint burn transfer, to gas abstraction and wallet abstraction, to the logic for how tokens are earned, purchased and what that gives you in terms of benefits. So auctions, raffles, other redemption opportunities. So we&#8217;re trying to take all of that so that brands can truly focus on the things that make them unique and different, which is the experience, not the infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It is crazy how like, again, with an API, it&#8217;s just company X builds something so useful. And company A to Z just like gets the piggyback off of all that hard work for just a very minuscule, monthly, quarterly or annual price. And it&#8217;s just so cool. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve, you know, I don&#8217;t wanna say that I&#8217;ve become passionate about, but as a non coder and non super tech guy, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been more cognizant I guess really my main motivation comes from the profitability side of it. And it&#8217;s like, okay, as someone who likes to create businesses and help companies grow, like this is something that, you know, I need to become not an expert per se, but at least have a really good, better than the average Joe&#8217;s knowledge. So something very interesting. We do need to take a quick break though and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. When we get back, we&#8217;re gonna keep us in on Web3 Loyalty and we&#8217;ll get into some fun stuff like luxury, fashion, beauty brands, e-commerce, tattoos on the blockchain, and of course, Co:Create.

I mean, you&#8217;ve already sort of thrown it on the platter and I feel like without even giving the elevator pitch, all the listeners know exactly what you and the team do, but I always have to throw the classic, give me the 30 second elevator pitch on what Co:Create is. So throw in the ball over to your court, give me the 30 second elevator pitch on Co:Create and then we&#8217;ll get into some more fun stuff here.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, absolutely. So we help innovative brands unlock the power of community, utilizing the tools of Web3, as well as to tap into the largest interoperable loyalty network so that they can partner with other innovative brands who are doing cool things and serving similar audiences. I think for us, what&#8217;s most important, as I was saying before, is we&#8217;re an API first platform. We are everything you don&#8217;t see that you don&#8217;t experience. With the exception of our first incubated concept, Co:Create, Ink. Which I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk a little bit more about.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I mean, let&#8217;s jump, we&#8217;ll get into that later. But first, first one I want to discuss. And we did have someone from your team, well, not from your team, but from the Bleacher Report team come on the show far earlier on. But you got to give us the TLDR on how incredible and how successful the partnership with Bleacher Reports. And of course, the NBA on TNT was because that was that was all world. That was incredible. And for guys like me who, you know, love ball and and then all the people who took part in that and had no clue that there was any like sort of Web3 tech involved in it, which was the best part.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so the Bleacher Report team, they are outstanding. They are so well-informed and knowledgeable when it comes to the space, which you really don&#8217;t see at large established companies very often. So it was just a total pleasure working with them. We&#8217;re powering the Watch to Earn program for inside the NBA. So if you&#8217;re watching Kenny and Shaq and all of them on television, after those episodes there, you can go on and it&#8217;s back because the NBA is back. You can go on and you can fill out answers to trivia questions. You earn BR tokens, so Bleacher Report tokens, which are actual ERC-20 tokens, that you then, as you accumulate them, can redeem in their rewards marketplace for either collectibles, inclusive of physical merch. So what&#8217;s really cool is I was actually just on there last night, which I got most of the questions right. I was on there last night and I was looking at the marketplace of redemption opportunities and I was like, there&#8217;s some cool swag and I just need to get some of my 5000 BR tokens because they&#8217;re still available. So I&#8217;m eyeing this sweatshirt that I really want and they&#8217;ve now expanded this. So the BR token, it&#8217;s not just gonna be for the NBA. They&#8217;ve now expanded the city in NHL. They&#8217;re thinking about expanding it to other properties. So it&#8217;s really meant to be this rewards token that is for sports lovers and sports fans. And it&#8217;s just been incredible partnership to work with them.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Yeah. Huge shout out to the BR and TNT team, especially as a Canadian. I mean, you know, when you&#8217;re a Canadian kid, you grow up, you don&#8217;t grow up watching basketball. Well, you do. But, you know, as soon as you come out of the womb, you literally, you know, get a pair of skates thrown on you and grab a hockey stick and start skating around in the pond. So it&#8217;s great to see TNT do such incredible work and grow the game of hockey as well, because, you know, we need our fellow Americans. There&#8217;s 10 of you for every one of us. And if we want to grow the game, need that to happen. So I absolutely love that. Let&#8217;s jump into your Co:Create Studio&#8217;s, your inaugural project, which is the Co:Create Ink. And you guys have partnered with, I believe it&#8217;s 10, world -famous tattoo artists. And again, this is just Web3 loyalty at its peak. So friggin&#8217; cool. You got to tell myself and the listeners more about this.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so we are an API first platform, which means that we don&#8217;t control the user experience or user journey. And intentionally so. And as we were coming together over the summer, we realized there are ideas that we&#8217;re really excited about that aren&#8217;t within the brand lane. They&#8217;re more so in the creator economy lane. And we want to, creator economy don&#8217;t need APIs. They need platforms, white label solutions, plug and play tooling that doesn&#8217;t require a developer. And so we started to explore like, what are cool ideas that we could bring to life built on our Co:Create tech stack. So we&#8217;ll use our base, but we&#8217;re actually going to build the full application inclusive of the front end experience. And one of the concepts that we got really excited about was this one of tattoos. You know, tattooing, it is one of the oldest art forms in the world. And there are tattoo artists who they have clearly craftsmanship. The application of tattoos takes a lot of skill, but there are tattoo artists who are also truly artists. And their artwork is still charged or priced based on their time. You know, even if they charge a higher hourly rate than others, they&#8217;re still getting paid based on their time, not on their art. Their art is still also impermanent as much as we think tattooing is permanent. It&#8217;s still tied to a human who gets sunburns, who gets cuts and wounds, who eventually passes away. And so their artwork also doesn&#8217;t have permanence to it. And we were excited about the potential for blockchain and NFT technology to enable this art form to be elevated, to be permanent, to highlight the collector network that surrounds an artist, which some of these artists, they&#8217;ve worked with incredible people, such as one of our founding artists has tattooed Usher and Chris Hemsworth, another one is tattooed Lady Gaga. Like, I mean, just incredible people that you want to kind of know who are the connections between this group. And so we realized, you know, NFTs can change this, but it&#8217;s got to be done in a way that doesn&#8217;t require someone to be a Web3 expert because there is a lot of skepticism within certain communities about blockchain and crypto and Web3. And this has to be experienced first. And so what we&#8217;re bringing out, which is Co:Create Ink, it&#8217;s launching in December, is you can go on and you&#8217;ll be able to actually see exclusive one of one works by these top tattoo artists. You can buy that design, which comes with the booking. It comes with the session. So you&#8217;re actually buying the application of the tattoo, which for these 10 artists around the world, we have artists in Brazil, in Italy, in Germany, in Tokyo, in the US, in Canada. We actually have one tattoo artist in Canada. You can&#8217;t get appointments with these folks. Like, one of our artists there, wait time is over a year. So this gets you an actual booking with an exclusive one of one work that you have a digital collectible that you can own forever, as well as the actual application. And it opens up all of the tradability that we know blockchain is capable of. So we&#8217;re really excited to bring it to life. We&#8217;ve got an incredible group of artists and feel very fortunate to be able to partner with them, to build something that works for them and really treating them as the subject matter experts. And we are just like the vessel to help them do something really cool.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I absolutely love this partnership. And again, like we live in the attention economy nowadays and you&#8217;ve stated many times on the show, you guys are primarily an API company. And for the ability for not only you, but the tattoo artist, I&#8217;m sure all of like every single one of these tattoos is gonna be filmed and is going to be content will be produced out of this. This is just all world content as well. Like this just seems like winds across the board for absolutely everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure. And we&#8217;re actually going to be launching the platform. Well, we&#8217;re only launching it to a select number, so we have a waitlist running right now. So for anyone interested, go to cocreate.ink to sign up for the waitlist so you can get first access when we launch. And we&#8217;re going to be running a prize draw. So for people that are on the waitlist that go on to refer, you will have the chance to actually be flown out to our launch event during Art Basel Miami on December 7th and meet all the artists and just have a good time. And if someone might even get tattooed, there we shall see.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Love that. Maybe that&#8217;ll be me. Maybe I&#8217;ll get my name thrown out of the hat. No longer be a tattoo virgin. First one. Oh, I love it. A couple more points here as we are getting a little tight for time. Ecommerce industry, something I&#8217;m very passionate about. I have been very fortunate to work with one of Canada&#8217;s fastest ever growing e-commerce brands. I love e-commerce. I think it&#8217;s great for the people. It&#8217;s so nice to go into store and again, especially with how powerful shipping is nowadays, literally you buy something, you get it the next day. Most of the time, Amazon e-commerce brands, maybe two or three days later, it&#8217;s lovely. And it just, just the absolute sort of economic creation that it has produced as well, very cool industry. This is a way that Web3 can really come in and start moving a groove and shake things out more specifically on the whole loyalty side of things. I really haven&#8217;t seen a whole lot of brands take the power of Web3 yet. There&#8217;s also tons of Shopify plugins that allow NFTs like Shopify and Toby Luke has, you know, on a multitude of different occasions has said, we&#8217;re cool with NFTs. We understand that this can unlock, you know, a bunch of really cool loyalty programs, but I still haven&#8217;t really seen any brand take this to the next level. I know you and the team are working on some really cool things here. Have any brands in the past done this that you&#8217;ve, you know, seen and been like, wow, that&#8217;s really cool. And I guess just a segue out of that question. What exactly are you and the team working on in e-commerce space right now?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so, you know, the KIKI World example that I gave, they are an e-commerce brand. They don&#8217;t have any physical stores and they actually use Shopify as well. So we have a Shopify integration and app that&#8217;s available for any of our clients to use. I agree with you wholeheartedly that e-com is an incredible opportunity for this because they already live online and in digital spaces. We also, though, are very excited about the ability to recognize and reward actions that are taken across IRL and URL. So physical stores to events to online e-com to Instagram and other social media platforms. And so we&#8217;ve actually built out integrations with Instagram, with Twitter, with Discord. Now I believe Telegram is coming next, where people say, I know my community, they&#8217;re going to engage with me on my e-com site, right? Because that&#8217;s where they come to get things. They&#8217;re also engaging me in these other places. And I want to be able to recognize and reward those actions. And so I have to have a way to bring this all together. And a blockchain or tokenized loyalty program is the perfect way to do that because it is this ledger, right? That can take in inputs from all these different places and create a centralized single source of truth for what that individual has done, has contributed and has redeemed and participated in. And so I think e-com is a huge opportunity. KIKI World is a great example of that. But we definitely need to see more because what I think what is one of the blockers right now is people here Web3 loyalty and they think, as we were talking about before, retention marketing, which if you&#8217;re a disruptor brand who&#8217;s trying to grow, you&#8217;re not focused on retention as much as you&#8217;re focused on growth. And so we have to change that concept of loyalty can be more than retention.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s so true. It just seems like there&#8217;s so many opportunities for all these e-commerce brands that again, it&#8217;s like you go on their website and they have perhaps a similar to an airline point system where it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s not like airlines where, you know, you are a CEO of a very fast growing company. You&#8217;re flying around North America all the friggin&#8217; time. Like no shit, you&#8217;re gonna wrap your points. You have a reason to like, you know, actually want those points and the rewards are worth it. But spending thousands and thousands of dollars to finally get like 10 bucks off your next purchase. It&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s no incentives. And we live in a world where incentives move the needle. So very interesting on that end. Another area that I think has a very high ceiling is high end fashion, beauty, just luxury as a whole. You know, I feel like luxury can really do it. What about the luxury space? Obviously, besides KIKI World, anyone moving and groovin&#8217; in the luxury space?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yeah, so we are working with one of the oldest luxury brands in the world, which is a program that&#8217;s not live, so I can&#8217;t share more about it. But I would say keep your eyes out because you&#8217;re right. The areas where brands really are starting to understand and take steps to implement Web3 loyalty programs are in intermediated industries. Luxury has often had an intermediated sale or relationship with their customers. Blockchain, it&#8217;s a back-end technology, but it&#8217;s a direct to consumer technology. It directly connects the two ends of the spectrum, a provider and a consumer or two community members, right? And so we&#8217;re seeing this in luxury, we&#8217;re seeing this in any sort of industry where they&#8217;re sold through intermediaries, so beauty, which is sold through Sephora or other large department stores. We&#8217;re seeing this in the alcohol industry where a lot of alcohol brands have not had that direct relationship with their end consumer. They&#8217;re sold in bars or they&#8217;re sold through intermediaries as well. So those are the ones where I get really excited. The other one that we&#8217;ve already talked about as well as an industry is fans of sports teams. So many fans exist out there and the sports teams, you don&#8217;t really, you&#8217;ve got your social media following, but they don&#8217;t have a good sense of who their fans are and where they are and what they care about in a way to directly incentivize them. Web3 loyalty programs, these are incentive programs that are supposed to create great rewards so that people take actions that that organization is wanting them to take. And so any intermediated industry where there is a desire for a direct relationship, those are the ones that I think are really getting Web3 loyalty and starting to do cool things.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very true. Yeah, sports teams, anyone from sports teams listening to this, get your shit together, get on the train. Make some shit happen. It&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s definitely a massively untapped one. Tara, this has been absolutely incredible. One last segment and then we will wrap up. We got to jump in the hot take factory, get our shit kicking boots on. You actually probably have more experience than I do as you grew up on a farm. But let&#8217;s jump in the hot take factory here. Let a couple fly. It doesn&#8217;t have to be Web3 loyalty, crypto blockchain related, can be health, wealth, happiness, some spicy stuff, politics, AI, aliens, you name it. But give me a couple Tara hot takes before you go.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
This is where I get cancelled, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No. This is a cancel free show.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
I mean, we touched on it a little bit before, which is I know there&#8217;s this concept within like OG crypto, if not your keys, not your coin, be your own bank. I don&#8217;t think anyone wants to be their own bank. I want my bank to be my bank, right? And the reason for that is there is so much pressure associated with being the safe guard, the vault for all of your assets. And so that&#8217;s where I really want to see us continue to evolve and mature as an industry, is reducing the pressure and the risk associated with ownership because to truly be an owner of something, you also have to protect it. And I need more help in protecting those things, which we&#8217;re trying to do some stuff on. There&#8217;s a lot of brands out there and companies and providers out there that are doing cool stuff on, but that&#8217;s the one. I don&#8217;t think people, with certain exceptions, there are places in the world where the ability to be your own bank is so important and critical that people will do it. But in a lot of stable developed countries, that&#8217;s not the case. No one wants to be their own bank.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty much in the same yacht as you in that regard. I&#8217;m a believer of like maybe 90, 10 rule 95, 5 where it&#8217;s like maybe keep, you know, maybe keep a couple of dineros under your bed, but like otherwise, yeah, let the big boys handle it. So incredible episode. Thank you so much for coming on. This was an absolute treat and can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two before you go. Can you please let our listeners know where they can find you personally and Co:Create online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Fung</strong><br />
Yep, so I&#8217;m @nonfungibletara. My last name is Fung, so it&#8217;s a little bit cuter than normal than everyone else who&#8217;s non fungible. But so @nonfungibletara on Twitter, or X. And you can find us at usecocreate.io to learn more about the API platform. And if you&#8217;re into tattoos, definitely go check out cocreate.ink to see our new tattoo artists and to get signed up for the wait list.</p>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzin and as always, and I am super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, Adam Reeds, a fellow Canadian. We love to see it. He&#8217;s the Co-Founder and CEO of Ledn, a global company regulated in the Cayman Islands that focuses on building financial products to help people save in Bitcoin and digital assets. Prior to Co-Founding Ledn, Adam spent 10 years at Dream Asset Management, where he developed, built and financed a $1.5 billion portfolio of renewable power projects. It was Bitcoin&#8217;s connection with the energy that brought Adam into Bitcoin Mining, where he and his Co-Founder identified a gap in financial digital assets. Today, Ledn is a broad financial services platform with clients in over 130 countries. Adam is also a graduate of the HBA program at the Richard Ivey School of Business and also holds a Bachelor of Engineering Science from the University of Western Ontario. Absolutely love that. Can&#8217;t wait to get into all this stuff. Adam, pumped to have you on band. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Doing well. Thanks Matt. Great, great to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Adam, before we get into all the fun stuff here, I got to talk about some of your uni stuff. You went to Western Ontario. A couple of the guests on the show have gone to Western Ontario. For the listeners at home, Western Ontario is Canada&#8217;s version of, I would say, well, firstly, it&#8217;s an incredible academic school. And secondly, it&#8217;s Canada&#8217;s version of like Arizona State. It is absolutely wild. The parties are all world, beautiful people on the male and female side. Just an incredible school. How much fun did you have at Western?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
I had a wonderful time and it&#8217;s exactly that. Obviously, people think of Canada as a pretty small place, but when they hear the numbers of the school, it&#8217;s 50,000 attendees, so a pretty amazing faculty and students coming from all over the world. And actually had a chance to go back. I was just there teaching a guest lecture at the business school there with a really good friend of mine. So it was pretty nostalgic to go back and share what we&#8217;re doing at Ledn and everything that I&#8217;ve done since post-grad. So I definitely love spending as much time in London, Ontario, where Western is as I can. And yeah, great school.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Before we get into all the crypto and Ledn stuff, I&#8217;d love if you could tell me a little bit about yourself, childhood growing up in Guelph, you said, for the listeners at home, Guelph is just about an hour outside of Toronto, small town, really good town, very agriculture. And I wouldn&#8217;t say so much tech, but like really focuses on nature and everything agriculture related. Incredible school there as well, really good people, great sports teams, you name it, but walk me through your childhood, couple hobbies, whatever you wanna tell us, and then segue that into the 10 years you spent at Dream where you built a $1.5 billion portfolio, because that is absolutely incredible, the floor is yours.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, happy to. So Guelph was a great place to grow up. It&#8217;s when I was there, it&#8217;s grown a little bit since then, but it&#8217;s about 100,000 people city. And it&#8217;s about an hour from Toronto, as you mentioned. So I think what&#8217;s unique about it is the size of the town. It was five high schools. I think it&#8217;s six now expanded a little bit, but everyone knows each other. And that kind of makes for a nice community. And so it was a wonderful place to meet a lot of great people, still really good friends with a lot of friends that I grew up with in Guelph. Definitely a hockey town. I&#8217;m an okay athlete by no means a great athlete. So it wasn&#8217;t a competitive hockey player, but many of my friends were. And so that makes it very Canadian in the setup there. And yeah, I actually, I continued on one of my best friends from Guelph was my roommate at Western. And so still really good friends with him. And as I continued on to Western, took a business school and engineering at Western. And that was really helpful because I was able to combine a technical background with a knowledge and some of the interest I had in business. And that led me into the start of my career in renewable power. And so graduated after Western, joined a startup that was actually focused on building out renewable power projects throughout North America. And really I joked at the time that my job was to convert kilowatt hours into dollars. When I mean not that just in the business sense of creating projects like that, but in the explanation of how I was able to communicate and think about investing in the energy sector, kind of combining a knowledge, a technical background in engineering with that in business. And so spent 10 years developing and financing renewable power projects. There was some good incentives that the government had in place in Canada. And from there, really learned about how to put together and provide financing to large scale infrastructure projects. And that led it itself well to understanding Bitcoin because Bitcoin mining is an infrastructure project in itself. And through many conversations I had with my current co-founder, who was a friend that I met at Western at business school there, we decided to think about how to apply our different backgrounds. His first off in Bitcoin and mine in energy finance into create something new for the space. So to jump ahead a little bit, after spending 10 years in the renewable power sector, we decided to think about how to again, apply that knowledge into Bitcoin. And as we set out to build a Bitcoin mining operation, which was again, a small infrastructure project, no one would finance it. And so that was kind of the introduction into thinking about how to apply that knowledge from the energy sector into a new sector and think about how to advance things from there. So I&#8217;m kind of jumping ahead a bit, but that was the kind of relationship between starting in energy finance and then applying it to Bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What year did you guys build or at least try to get financing for the first mining rig?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, it was 2016 that we thought about and really approaching it. And then yeah, 2017, I think, the interesting thing about 2017 was there was broad retail interest, but no institutional interest yet or limited institutional interest. I think there was some of the investment banks looking at helping out some of the miners and taking some of the mining companies public, but there was no institutional interest at least broadly, at least speaking from a Canadian perspective in any of the banking institutions, it was quite the opposite. It was viewed as a risky endeavor. And that was actually the opportunity. So the opportunity was how do we take something that&#8217;s pretty misunderstood and thinking about how to provide something of value to it? And I think kind of tying back, that was the parallels I saw in renewables. And so I think what&#8217;s interesting, even when anything&#8217;s new, is the questions that are asked at the beginning are often not the most important once people begin to understand it. What I mean by that is if I can take a basic example with renewables, when solar projects first came out, everyone was asking, well, how do we know the solar panels are gonna last for 30 years? How do we know they&#8217;re not gonna fall apart? How do we know they&#8217;re not gonna blow off the roofs? It was really always around technical questions. And I think then once people get comfortable with the technology, the questions advance, and it&#8217;s like, okay, well, how do we know that if we&#8217;re putting a project on IKEA&#8217;s roofs, that IKEA&#8217;s gonna pay the bills for 20 years. And it&#8217;s more like traditional credit and that type of analysis. And so I saw this like deja vu with things happening in Bitcoin and that the questions that we&#8217;re asking was like obsession about the tech and not about the application. I was like, okay, even though this is quite different, there&#8217;s some interesting parallels as far as the challenges I went through with trying to finance renewable power into the challenges that I&#8217;m now experiencing with trying to talk about financing Bitcoin projects. And so I was like, okay, if something is misunderstood, there&#8217;s interesting opportunity here. And I think any innovation and any opportunity to generate profits comes out of misunderstanding of misallocation of knowledge. And so when you see knowledge gaps, there&#8217;s often an opportunity where a small amount of people know something deeply, the masses don&#8217;t, and then therefore things can really become exciting if you can connect that</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. That was absolute gold right there. I want to just take a quick step sideways if we will. And I&#8217;d love if you could take a little riff on sort of specifically the Bitcoin mining sector in Canada. And we do have a very significant, a significant chunk of the listener base is Canadian, which I absolutely love. And again, just priming this for the listeners here, Canada has a plethora of renewable energy. We have obviously anyone can really put solar on their ground, but we have obviously tons of natural falls, like Niagara Falls, we have a bunch of turbines in Quebec, we have oil, we have windmills all over the place. There&#8217;s tons of electricity and a massive chunk of the power grid in Canada that isn&#8217;t being used. In fact, it&#8217;s the same as the States and almost everywhere in the world, you know, minus a couple of places like Texas where they do battle for electricity. But nonetheless, I&#8217;d love if you could talk about energy usage in Canada and how it correlates and relates to Bitcoin mining. And if you could also segue into are there grants, because I know Canada hands out grants left, right and center, but are there any energy grants that you can use specifically for Bitcoin mining as well?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, so to just talk about the first part of what you said there, it&#8217;s exactly right. The renewable power sector supplies the majority of electricity in Canada, so most of that is hydro. Canada&#8217;s blessed with ample rivers, streams, lots of water that&#8217;s traveling big distances that you can put turbines in front of and grab hydro electricity. So that provides a significant amount of the electricity. Like Quebec&#8217;s grid is like 95% hydro. Ontario&#8217;s is a big chunk as well. Nuclear does play a big part in Ontario as well. I use the provincial reference because all the different provinces regulate their own energy. And then the only provinces that would be more skewed towards fossil fuels would be Saskatchewan and Alberta, but still broadly speaking, when you look at Canada as a whole, it&#8217;s a very clean grid. So that makes it interesting for Bitcoin mining because if you set up Bitcoin mining here in the right grid conditions, you&#8217;re able to power that Bitcoin mine with primarily renewable energy. And as you said, there&#8217;s a lot of situations where the power is not needed. So Quebec used to be like most places in North America used to have more heavy industry. That heavy industry has moved offshore. So there&#8217;s a lot of situations where grids are overbuilt and the power may not be needed in that circumstance. And therefore there&#8217;s like significant amount of existing infrastructure that can be used to power Bitcoin mining. And what&#8217;s cool about Bitcoin mining is it doesn&#8217;t care where it is. You need some internet connection, but by no means is it like robust. The internet connection needs it just needs something basic. And so you can put this anywhere. And it&#8217;s like an energy sponge to really optimize efficiency across grids. So that&#8217;s pretty cool. I would say Canada was decently positioned for it. But of course, regulation is always the key piece that can some adoption limits. And there was concerns with, okay, what if this goes too far? You know, obviously there&#8217;s a little bit of efficiency to be gained, but you know, how do we make sure it&#8217;s not overdone? So years ago, Quebec was in good headings, but then they started to do RFPs and it scared some of the Bitcoin development away from that, just given that the thought that the sector may not be as big as it could have. So I think there&#8217;s a little bit more there. But now you see more development, I would say in the places like Texas where it&#8217;s a little bit more of a free for all as far as setting up and more just private to private. So there&#8217;s the only province in Canada that regulates electricity almost like a free market is Alberta. The other provinces, you have to follow pretty stringent provincial guidelines as far as fulfilling how electricity is placed on the grid and proper approvals and things like that. So things just don&#8217;t move as fast as they do in fully unregulated or deregulated markets like Alberta and Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
How classic Canada was that? Had something good, fucked it up. I think we might be the best in the world at that, having a competitive advantage and just wiping it all away.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, Canada tends to kind of wait and see, which is, you know, it can be a little bit of the Achilles heel on a lot of things I&#8217;d say for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s truly wild. Let&#8217;s jump into Ledn. Before we get into it, give me the elevator pitch and then we&#8217;ll get into the fun stuff here.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Look, Ledn came out of solving our own problems. As I mentioned, Marisi and I, my co-founder of the business, we started to set up a Bitcoin mine in Canada, looked to get banking and financing for that exact mine and couldn&#8217;t achieve it. So built a solution that solved our own problem and from there decided and understood that there was a lot of other people, companies, ideas, applications worldwide that could benefit from a Bitcoin back loan. And so launched that first product in 2018 and then thought about how to build out more broad financial services. So since then have been focused almost exclusively on the boring and lending space. And that also means allowing clients to have opportunities to earn yield on their assets by lending those assets out and helping clients meet their financial goals by saving and maintaining, building their digital asset wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So you guys are sort of information a digital asset lending company that sort of specializes in Bitcoin lending.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And if I were a betting man, one of the biggest questions you probably get are, you know, Adam, tell me the difference between Bitcoin lending and traditional lending. Because, you know, anyone can go to the bank and get a loan. I mean, mind you, two, three years ago, that loan was a lot sexier than it is today with, I guess, in Canada, what, six, seven, eight percent interest rates now. But, you know, you guys are giving loans at a much sexier and much more appealing price with better terms as well. It&#8217;s crypto back lending. What are the biggest differences between traditional lending and crypto slash Bitcoin lending?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, the biggest difference is Bitcoin is the best and most pristine collateral there is globally. So what&#8217;s incredible about this asset, it&#8217;s the same to everyone globally. And that&#8217;s not true for any other asset, including gold. So even gold is jurisdictional. Financing gold in a vault in Venezuela is very different than finance and gold in a vault in Canada. And we get into assets like real estate, obviously, very different terms for what you can get on a mortgage in Mexico versus the US. So I think the best thing I like about building on this asset class is fairness. The terms can be the same everywhere because the asset is the same everywhere. And that&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Interesting. So walk me through some of the conversations or perhaps not conversations, but use cases. Why would someone want to rent out their Bitcoin, their crypto to use this collateral? And then on the other side of the coin, why would someone need to take out a loan? Is it mostly mining projects? Is it mostly crypto related projects? Are you guys doing this for sort of Web2 folks as well? More TradFi folks? Like, give me a bunch of use cases that you guys are going to town on.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Of course, yeah. So the key piece that&#8217;s the same for everybody is have Bitcoin, don&#8217;t want to sell it and need Fiat for other purposes. So the use cases range from for smaller loans, paying down perhaps more expensive debt, paying down credit card debt to larger use cases, we&#8217;d be diversifying, perhaps purchasing real estate, perhaps wanting to invest in other asset classes like equities. And then even use cases like wanting to buy more Bitcoin. So we developed a product for that called B2X using your existing Bitcoin to buy more of it. And so we see a plethora. Some of the use cases that I love to see is we&#8217;ve seen people use their Bitcoin back loan to finance a business, pay for education, pay for medicine. So all different types of meaningful use cases that are really incredible to see. I&#8217;d say the other thing that we love to see is for some people accessing our loan products, it&#8217;s the first loan that they ever achieved or first loan that they were ever approved for. So this is this is incredible because again, on the concept of fairness, it&#8217;s just not at all even close to the same the availability of banking, financial services that you have in many different markets. So for those to be able to qualify for a loan, it adds a whole bunch of different other benefits other than just financial. In some cases, it&#8217;s self-esteem. It&#8217;s like, oh, I got something. I did something I can grow now. So that&#8217;s pretty interesting to see.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Quick little funny story. Well, actually, it&#8217;s not funny. It&#8217;s actually the opposite of funny, but I won&#8217;t name him, but one of my close buddies is trying to buy condo in Toronto. The condo he&#8217;s looking at is about 1.2 mil. He does well for himself, makes about two, I think just over 200K a year Canadian has enough to put 20% down as well. And the banks will not get him alone. Again, this guy makes over 200K a year. He has I think the 225 that&#8217;s needed to put the 20% down payment in Canada. If you&#8217;re a first time home buyer and it&#8217;s less than a mil, you can put 5% down. If it&#8217;s more than a mil, you have to put the traditional 20 and they won&#8217;t even get him a loan right now.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Is it because he&#8217;s self employed?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah. Bingo. So he doesn&#8217;t have a traditional Canadian stamped TSX 500, whatever you want to call a company that&#8217;s signing his paychecks. It&#8217;s just wild. Like this dude has never missed the payment, has crazy high credit score, like literally perfect on paper. And the best he can get is a loan from a boutique bank. And I want to say they gave him 11.5%. It&#8217;s like, oh yeah, that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s crazy right now. Absolutely craziness.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, look, it&#8217;s kind of an interesting aspect because we call them mortgages, but they&#8217;re really financing future cash load of guaranteed income, right? So the banks want to take the security of the real estate collateral as secondary, but really the primary source is locking in future income. And so it&#8217;s pretty wild amount of belts and suspenders that are needed to get something. And then if the loan is insured, it&#8217;s really the taxpayers on the risk as well to back up that insurance. So it&#8217;s a common problem and something that really isn&#8217;t unlocking future wealth for Canadians.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, it&#8217;s absolutely wild. Adam and folks are out to a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show.

Another question off topic on my end of my apologies for jumping around here. When I was doing research for the show in my head, and again, obviously you guys are, I believe you said you&#8217;re, you know, you&#8217;re HQ&#8217;d and the came and now, which makes total sense. But when I was doing the research for the show and I was like, Oh, another Canadian guy, Canadian company crushing it and crypto, I was like, Damn, I sort of wish these guys went public because like there&#8217;s so many, I don&#8217;t want to say so many, but there&#8217;s a couple of companies like you guys who have such a high ceiling and who are doing really solid work and making good money. And I wish there were more opportunities for Canadians to invest in them. Obviously once you do this, you&#8217;re, you know, you&#8217;re KYC&#8217;d up the yin yang. It&#8217;s an absolute logistical and compliance nightmare. But was there ever a thought you and your co-founder, do you guys ever discuss going public on the TSXV and working your way up to the TSX?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, we&#8217;ve definitely discussed a lot of different ways to kind of take the company forward in the future. I think going public to me, it&#8217;s one source of one path, but the key is it has to be sustainable. So to your point, you made about just adding friction to the company, you had a whole bunch of costs when you take a company public that don&#8217;t necessarily add value to clients. And so that&#8217;s the main thing we&#8217;re focused on is if we can provide good service and do it at fair pricing, we&#8217;ll grow the company. And then what we need is, I think going public is an interesting avenue, but it has to be at a time where the compliance costs and other costs associated with me taking a public company are a lower percentage compared to the overall volume that you&#8217;re doing. And so I think when you see companies go public too early, they end up with this kind of like, almost like ball and chain attached to them where they&#8217;re managing to the public markets instead of managing to their clients. And that becomes problematic. And so we wanna make sure that we&#8217;re doing the latter, managing to our clients, and then we&#8217;ll have a sustainable business. And that&#8217;s again, one tool as far as how you can approach the public markets later. But I do hear you, I think the idea to give many investors more options to invest and other different ways to kind of participate in the sector is interesting and something that we&#8217;d love to do. One more thing on that I&#8217;d say, the other piece is like, issuing a token and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve stayed away from up to this date just because like, I think you really have to think through does the token add value? And what we&#8217;ve seen is like other lenders that have a token, they really only have the token because they issued it as far as their ICO. And so they needed it for their initial fund raise and then they have it. And I would say, candidly, it&#8217;s a pretend that there&#8217;s use cases for it, but really it&#8217;s just to kind of keep the price up to keep their initial ICO investors happy where there&#8217;s really not a need today. So it&#8217;s like keep the model as simple as possible. The one of the favorite things we have at the company is the best restaurants have the smallest menu. And what we mean by that is like keep things like so simple, you curate a good list of things and you have a tight menu and therefore you provide a really good experience and the best companies in the world do this, right? Like think about the experience you have when buying an Apple computer. There&#8217;s like good, great, you know, best, you don&#8217;t have buyers remorse on anything you buy from the Apple store and that same for other products like Dyson and Vitamix and all these like, you know, great brands that have taken what really is a commoditized product and just wrapped it in a really good experience to make sure that they&#8217;re really are limiting choice for the better.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That was beautifully said so true there one more thing on going public and I&#8217;ve seen it happen so many times almost more specifically with you know companies that have Bitcoin or crypto exposure or our crypto product focused they go public and something happens most of the time it&#8217;s oh now we need more money and then they do death spiral financing and then it&#8217;s like now you have so many outdated options and soon to be vesting options on the table that some finance year some you know, P boutique owns and they literally control almost as much stock as you do and then you&#8217;re at their will now. It&#8217;s like It&#8217;s just it&#8217;s so unfortunate to see and I really wish it didn&#8217;t happen, but on the flip side. I do wish That&#8217;s the average Joe and Josephine more specifically the average Canadian Joe and Josephine had the opportunity to invest in really good crypto companies like yourselves besides just the usual, you know ETFs and indexes that you can invest in because it&#8217;s like those guys there&#8217;s only such a ceiling with them and their price is so correlative to the price of whatever asset usually Bitcoin or ETH and and it&#8217;d be really cool to invest in companies like yours. Is is there anyone who&#8217;s doing that or do you think that&#8217;ll change anytime soon where the average person can and will have opportunities to invest in up and coming companies like yours?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
I think, I don&#8217;t know in detail, but I know there&#8217;s a bank to the future which is run by Simon Dixon. So I think he&#8217;s created a crowdfunding way to participate and given his background in the crypto sector, I think that&#8217;s one opportunity that I think there may be limitations there. I think, I assume it&#8217;s not open to US investors. I&#8217;m not sure about Canadians participating in it, but there may be similar securities roles about participating in that, but I think there&#8217;s been some different attempts to democratize investing in that aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love to see that happen. Let&#8217;s keep going on the digital asset lending space. What does the future of crypto lending look like? I know you&#8217;ve done a bunch of talks over the last little bit. You were just in Riyadh. Also, what&#8217;s Riyadh like? That&#8217;s probably so cool. We&#8217;ll get into that. But you&#8217;ve done a bunch of talks on rebuilding the digital asset lending space, the future of crypto lending and why Bitcoin makes great collateral all tied into one. That&#8217;s your main thesis and I absolutely love that. Let&#8217;s just, I guess, to start. The future of crypto lending, what does that look like? Are we going to see any really cool innovations or is it just going to be a larger scale, more macro focus of what the current products and capabilities are present day?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, maybe first I&#8217;ll just talk about what we focused on this year, because I think it sets up for well, for where we&#8217;re going and really coming out of the 2022 blowups. Let&#8217;s just call it frankly, what it was. We knew that there was a massive need for more transparency and a complete loss of trust in the digital asset lending industry. And so we focused on sharing more and more of what we&#8217;re up to and trying to really position all the information we&#8217;re sharing and just talk about what&#8217;s going on under the hood and how do we make sure clients are comfortable with all the different activities. So really it was adding more transparency, but then once you provide that transparency, giving clients more control so they can make their choice on what they wanna do with their digital assets. And so earlier this year, we announced us, something called the open book report. So we show now how much assets are sitting in custody, how much is lent out, all the different activities that are going on and talk frequently about the types of lenders that we&#8217;re lending to. And then we also created within the savings product that we&#8217;ve renamed to our growth accounts, we really say created a best in class structure for clients to earn yield on their digital assets. And what we saw from the 2022 blowups was, there was a whole bunch of contagion that happened. And so if I showed up and I just wanted to take a Bitcoin back loan, I was exposed to clients that are earning yield on their Bitcoin or other digital assets. And frankly, everything was commingled. And so what we did was we took our yield products, which are our growth account products, and we separated it out legally and technically. So we said, if you wanna earn yield on your Bitcoin or your USDC, we&#8217;ll create a separate legal entity for that. And we&#8217;ll lend out directly from that legal entity so that the activities of that account are not commingled with the activities of our Bitcoin back loans. And so something like really straightforward, obviously this exists in traditional finance, but we want to make it really clear and come up with the best in class structure to do that. So that was a big focus on how we updated the growth accounts. So they&#8217;re now legally and technically ring fenced, bankruptcy remote to lead in as a corporate entity for clarity, not bankruptcy remote from the activities of that account. So there is still risk in that if those assets are lent out and those borrowers have issues, there is still exposure there. But what we&#8217;re trying to make clear is what you have exposure to and what you don&#8217;t have exposure to so you can make the right decision with your assets. So that was the kind of progress that we made this year was taking something that people viewed as all commingled together and then separating it out into separate entities so that clients could again make their own choice on what activity they wanna participate in and not. And so that was the progress there and kind of going into the future, I&#8217;d say it relies on the same theme. So more and more transparency, I&#8217;d say also the benefit of blockchain and this technology is that it does allow for absolute transparency. So I think we&#8217;ll see more and more things coming on chain, more and more information on utilizing all the transparency that this technology allows and kind of moving it into the future that way. I&#8217;d say the other future of this is of course we can&#8217;t ignore regulation. I think the challenge this industry has is that the technology and for the most part, some of the marketing and education does work globally, although, you know, be adjusting for different cultural nuances with how clients learn and invest in this asset class, but the regulation is not, right? The regulation is still ring fenced by country and you have to play ball in order to make sure that you can bring the masses into this industry. And so that&#8217;s the piece that I think everyone is wrestling with now is like, how do you absorb the compliance costs with being a regulated entity and what markets are our focus? So that&#8217;s why I think you see, you know, kind of naturally the bigger markets, you have companies that are just servicing those, of course the US being the largest market and so you&#8217;re kind of getting this fragmentation that&#8217;s happening now as far as areas of focus.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very interesting. Taking a step back, how did you guys survive last year? Because last year was an absolute shit show. I mean, it was nightmare fuel in the purest sense of nightmare fuel, especially as a lending entity. What was the secret sauce? How&#8217;d you guys do it?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, we did a lot of things differently leading up to the crisis that allowed us to survive. The first was making sure that any asset that we offered an account for, we had a real use case for. This wasn&#8217;t true for some of the other large names that are no longer around in that, for example, to talk about the yield accounts first, if you&#8217;re going to offer a yield on that asset, you better make sure that there&#8217;s a true market for that. What happened was there was an incentive that caused this to not be true for some of the large players that failed in that if you, for example, were incentivized to get as many assets on platform as quickly as you could, which some of the venture investing was motivating, you then offered yield on assets that didn&#8217;t have a true market for, or maybe you offered a yield that was higher than market. For example, this is just for an example only, but let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m offering to pay 10% on link. If the market can only support 3% on link, what was happening in some of the background is they&#8217;re mismatching assets. I would take the link, maybe post it to a DeFi protocol, borrow stables, and then lend that stables out at a yield that was high enough for me to earn a spread, but now I have directional risk. This type of activity worked well in an up only market, but as things started to compress, they couldn&#8217;t meet margin calls and were offside on different loans and borings, and therefore the house of cards that was built up came crashing down. So that&#8217;s number one, that&#8217;s a mismatch of assets. The other one was a mismatch of tenure. So if you think about if I&#8217;m going to offer open term Bitcoin deposits, you have the right Matt to deposit Bitcoin when you like and withdraw it when you like. So I better make sure that if I&#8217;m offering a yield on that, I have to do the same thing on the other side. So I can lend that Bitcoin out, but I have to make sure that I can withdraw that Bitcoin back from the borrower at the same time. And so I have to make sure I maintain my inventory. Well, this was not done. So you had situations where you took liquid deposits and you took that and lent it out in very illiquid loans or sometimes like investments. So there was a situation where one digital asset lender took open term client deposits and made venture investments, obviously very illiquid and talk about not even like a term to it, that&#8217;s pretty wild when you think about getting liquidity back for that asset. So that&#8217;s a big one. And the other thing I think is just back on the theme of transparency. So if you&#8217;re not open with what you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;re not providing the right information for clients to make a choice of how their digital assets are being utilized, then you end up with these black box business models and problematic on all sides. So we were the first crypto digital asset lender to launch proof reserves. So we put it on ourselves before any type of regulation was required. We&#8217;ve been doing this for several years now where we offer, we send all of our information on an anonymized basis. No client information is shared to a third party, a qualified accountant, and they verify that we have more assets than liabilities on the platform. It&#8217;s just a way to keep our systems honest and make sure that we can again provide that confidence to our clients.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s crazy how that&#8217;s not the norm. It&#8217;s crazy how like what you guys are doing is like almost considered unscalable in space. Like it&#8217;s just wild. Like just sketch balls after sketch balls. Crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s tough, right? And I think it is challenging because the space and some of the activity that has happened get again, co-mingled from a media standpoint. The reality is like fraud and these situations happen in any type of industry, but that&#8217;s something that we all need to do better.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, so true. We are getting a little tight for time here. A couple more questions and we&#8217;ll wrap up Adam. Another thing you guys are doing, which is really cool, and I&#8217;d love to know how this works. You guys are helping clients refinance their Celsius loans with Ledn. How are you guys making that work?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, this is a really exciting opportunity. And obviously we feel horrible for what happened to the Celsius borrowers and all clients within any crypto lending platform or broader platform that had issues. And so what we&#8217;re trying to do is offer a really competitive way for clients to refinance their loans. And so the reason this is important is the way the Celsius and I think true for other bankruptcies in Celsius, you have the option to either take your net equity of the loan back or refinance that loan. And so if you take your net equity back, what can happen and again, not financial advice, but just some of the information that we&#8217;ve been receiving and just relaying that is there may be a taxable event for you doing that. In that if you say had a loan that you posted 20,000 of Bitcoin and you had a $10,000 loan against it, obviously adjusting for haircut splits, let&#8217;s say you have a net equity position of 10. If you just take that 10 back, you&#8217;ve effectively sold your 20K to repay the 10 and therefore there may be a deemed capital gain. And so this is like a double whammy for those that have been through really a very difficult situation. So not only did I get hair cutted by the bankruptcy, but now if I take my net equity of the loan, I might get a capital gain as well. It&#8217;s like, come on, hit me when I&#8217;m down. So what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re offering a way for clients to use Ledn services to participate and coordinate with the Celsius bankruptcy committee to be able to effectively unlock their collateral and reinstate that loan on Ledn&#8217;s platform with new terms that Ledn&#8217;s providing. And so this has been very active for us. We put a lot of thought and work into making sure we can provide something that&#8217;s super helpful to the Celsius community. And it&#8217;s very active and hoping that that gets resolved in the next few months.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Love that. So cool. Adam, what an episode. Really appreciate you coming on last segment before we wrap up. Hot take factory. Let&#8217;s let a couple hot takes fly and then we will conclude. What do you got for me? It doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto related. It can be health, wealth, happiness, alien, space, AI, you name it. But give me a couple of Adam hot takes before you leave us today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Oh, look, I mean, I will keep it crypto related. I think that what&#8217;s been exciting is on the ETF front is, when everyone&#8217;s thinking about price, but the other thing that this is changing when the ETFs eventually do happen is that it unlocks a whole bunch of new avenues on the digital asset lending space. So right now we&#8217;re paying 1% on Bitcoin, which admittedly is the lowest it&#8217;s been over the last couple of years, but as the institutional volume comes back, we&#8217;re gonna see more trading activity to kind of balance out the ETFs. And so what we think we&#8217;re gonna be able to do is raise the rate on Bitcoin yield there and then provide more liquidity to this new and emerging market. So I think that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about is like, we&#8217;re not just gonna see price, we&#8217;re gonna see a whole bunch of activity happen and a whole bunch of broad interest come in and that&#8217;s super exciting. Outside of that, I guess my hot takes, maybe just to kind of draw a life lesson, I actually, I&#8217;m a private pilot in my spare time. So what I think a lot about is everything we&#8217;re doing is acting with intention. So when you take off one of the first things that the control tower asks you is, what are your intentions? So what do you intend to do with that flight? So I try to think about that every day. I think about when I wake up, what are my intentions for the day? What are my intentions for the week? How do I want things to go? And based on the outcome, if it doesn&#8217;t happen a certain way, you need to pivot and you need to think about other options. So it&#8217;s always like, if this happens, what&#8217;s plan A, what&#8217;s plan B, how am I gonna make it through and how am I gonna feel if these go a different direction? So that&#8217;s my kind of closing hot take is be intentional with your thoughts, be intentional with your activity and with your days, time&#8217;s the most valuable thing we have. So use it to the greatest way you can.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. What an ending. Where do you fly out of Billy Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />
Yeah, I learned out of Billy Bishop, the Island Airport in Toronto, and yeah, I&#8217;ve been flying a little bit internationally. Had an opportunity to fly in Bahamas last year, which was pretty incredible kind of island hopping there. So, yeah, definitely an incredible activity for anyone to uptake. And as I said, it provides a lot of lessons and, you know, thinking that&#8217;s applicable to many other aspects in life. So recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool. Adam, what an episode. Really appreciate you coming on. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Ledn online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Reeds</strong><br />

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab, and we are buzzing as always. Coming in hot from Mexico as always. And today, I&#8217;m super pumped to have the one and only Nihar Neelakanti on the show today, the Co-Founder and CEO of Ecosapiens, a VC-backed platform enabling consumers to fight climate change through the world&#8217;s first carbon-backed NFT. We love that shit. He previously worked in venture capital, spending several years at VCs, including Correlation Ventures, Kauffman Fellows, and most recently at the prestigious Menlo Ventures, where he helped develop the climate thesis that sparked the idea for Ecosapiens. He is deeply fascinated by the opportunity to rethink economics in a way that generates the planets rather than extracts from it. Super pumped to have you on. Nihar, welcome to show my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Pleasure to be here, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
You&#8217;re kicking it in New York City right now. It&#8217;s getting close to that time of year. We&#8217;re recording end of October. This episode will air very early November. It&#8217;s probably my favorite city on the planet. Again, I live in Toronto. It&#8217;s about an hour and a half flight. So super, very easily doable for me. But what&#8217;s life like in New York City right now? I know the weather&#8217;s turning. You guys still have one of the best nightlife scenes in the whole world. You got the best food scene in the whole world. What&#8217;s the tech scene? What&#8217;s the crypto scene like? What&#8217;s the buzz in NYC right now?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Honestly, dude, so I lived in San Francisco the last several years and I just moved here in April because my co-founder Garrett has been here in Brooklyn like his whole life and we got this really cool office and I decided to make the jump over here. What&#8217;s really funny is that this month feels exactly like San Francisco does during the summer. It&#8217;s like a perfect mid 60s. You may be wearing a sweater, but for the most part it&#8217;s really beautiful. It&#8217;s not humid. The trees are starting to turn orange, but you know what my co-founder tells me is that it&#8217;s like oddly way warmer for this time of the year than it has been in the past, right? I don&#8217;t mind San Francisco weather 24/7, but he tells me that we should be like wearing hefty jackets by this time of the year and we&#8217;re just not. He says last year was also like one of the warmest winters on record. I don&#8217;t mean to jump straight in the climate change. I don&#8217;t know if you know this, but I do work in climate obviously. Yeah, like I did move here from California, but it seems like we might be in for an okay winter and I&#8217;m bracing for it. Tech seems cool. A lot of crypto, a lot of NFTs here. Shout out to Bitcoin ETFs hopefully coming out by the time this episode is released. Take your time, man. How do you feel about the market?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a good question. I mean, I love that you&#8217;re already throwing questions back at me here. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to rip like everyone said it&#8217;s going to rip. I&#8217;m seeing a lot of traditional finance lads who literally all they do, their bread and butter is launching ETFs and they&#8217;re all like, this will be no different than the hundreds or thousands of ETFs that have launched since inception. Obviously, there&#8217;s the whole, you know, needing physical Bitcoin instead of just shares that you can make up. Yes, there&#8217;s some alpha there, but I love it. I just, my biggest thing, Nihar is the sentiment. It&#8217;s fun again. You know, the last week on crypto Twitter has been electric. I missed that shit. Yeah, a lot of it&#8217;s fugazi and a lot of it can be a little, a little nonsensical. It&#8217;s very nuanced as well, but we are back in the sense of energy is back. Yeah, we have a little bit of price discovery happening, but the price doesn&#8217;t really get me going that much. But the fact that the energy is back, I love that. How do you feel about Bitcoin going up to 35 and everyone being happy pants again?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
I love it. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t, right? When the price goes up and there&#8217;s more energy. I mean, you know, we found this company entirely sort of in this market, we, you know, we found our Ecosapiens on as you saw the price of crypto started to go down. Like in the life of a company, I&#8217;ve actually never experienced the volume of NFTs or the price of crypto is kind of going up. I&#8217;m only seeing it as a bystander and to see like crypto Twitter, to see like the sentiment even in our office, right? When people are, you know, slacking every morning saying, oh, price just went up. Like everyone gets excited about it. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the space is back as a whole, but you got to take your wins when you see them, right? When you put your hands up. I miss the meme culture. You know, Nikita Bier. I don&#8217;t know if you see that tweet.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, he got absolutely, he was the poster boy for 24 hours, now everyone&#8217;s roast them again already. But he does that on purpose, he knows exactly what he&#8217;s doing. He&#8217;s a master at that, he&#8217;s a magician.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
We love them, but you know, I do think like all bull markets are a little bit different. Right? I think last when you saw a lot of meme coins, you saw a lot of funky, you know, meme NFTs come out. Whatever this next like cycle is that we&#8217;re entering, you know, I do hope it&#8217;s going to be more mature, but I also do miss like all the memes, you know, I miss, what was that one that came out last year with like the goblintown.wtf. Right? I miss goblin town.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s wild. Let&#8217;s jump into Ecosapiens for a while. I want to touch on a point that you mentioned where when you guys launched crypto was literally going straight to the shitter. And you guys have found a way to not even create buzz, but just keep momentum throughout a what I guess almost two year bear market. Like how do you guys do that? But before we jump into Ecosapiens and you know, I&#8217;ll give you a chance to obviously do the pitch and the elevator pitch in the whole nine yards. But like how did you guys keep your community involved? How did you keep the price pretty steady? Like that&#8217;s not easy to do. You guys are one of the only people in the space who actually done this.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, honestly, I think it&#8217;s basically two things. One is we were VC funded from the very beginning, right? So we didn&#8217;t have this like pressing need to go launch NFTs to raise funds. We raise funds to help us think of how to use NFTs to solve interesting climate problems, right? And it&#8217;s a fundamental shift if you think about it. That&#8217;s one thing. The second thing is I think what you find is when you build a community from scratch in a bear market, you&#8217;re inherently attracting people that are there for values first, as opposed to like price first, right? And you know how it is, like when you when you build a community built on like shared values, specifically impact climate, like durable importance, you actually have people there that are willing to commit for the long haul as well. So I think we&#8217;ve been sort of in this weird way, blessed to encounter people who shared the same value system and the same purpose and mission. And we, you know, we frankly didn&#8217;t come across a lot of the folks that were like, when&#8217;s the price going to go up? What&#8217;s the team coming up with next? Which is an inevitable part of the space when you kind of have to play into it. But we never promised a product that would appreciate in value. Like that&#8217;s not really what we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re using digital collectibles as a way to, you know, finance climate action, right? And so it&#8217;s a very different sort of way. We weren&#8217;t using NFTs as a way to raise money. We had the money. We were using them as a tool to, you know, save the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Then again, that&#8217;s I love the point you touched on there. That&#8217;s very rare. You guys are in the, I was going to say 1%, but even that&#8217;s an absolute boost in a half. You guys are in the 0.001% of NFTs communities where the community itself gives a shit in the long term vision and isn&#8217;t there for the quick one, you know, maybe rich one, are we pumping, which is wild. And that&#8217;s a big chunk of that is because like you said, that the vision of climate change. Sorry, you were saying.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
No, I&#8217;ll just say one more thing. We&#8217;ve actually been more of like a Web2 company. I mean, and I&#8217;ll talk more about this in a moment, but our whole team has a background mostly that comes from Web2, you know? Like my co-founder was an advertiser at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and a bunch of other great platforms. We have a TikTok guy, et cetera. I came from investment and we never knew how to play until a lot of these sort of Web3 go to market tactics. We just want to ship consistently and learn. To date, we&#8217;ve actually shipped like six or seven products, right? And in a space where you maybe see an NFT team ship maybe once or twice a year, we&#8217;ve actually literally shipped six or seven products. In that process, like the community ends up staying active. They stay along for the ride and people aren&#8217;t left waiting for what might come next, right? So I think just this consistent shipping, which I think is a very Web2 mindset, has been a persistent part of our culture and it&#8217;s shown up like in the community as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, no, good point there. Walking through Ecosapiens as a whole, give me the 30 second TLDR elevator pitch and then we&#8217;ll get into some of the nitty gritty stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, we founded Ecosapiens on a really simple premise. Make climate action easy, elegant, and impactful. We&#8217;re a climate company first, right? So we wanted to build products that empowered every people such as you and me and Matt to make a really big difference in the planet in an easy and impactful way. And we do that through Ecosapiens, which are the world&#8217;s first carbon offsetting digital collectibles. And what we mean is when you buy one of our digital art pieces, you&#8217;re financing carbon removal projects around the world, like reforestation, solar regeneration. And in the process, you&#8217;re offsetting your carbon footprint for the whole year. That was sort of our initial thesis. We&#8217;ve only deepened our conviction. Today we are the leader in what we call carbon offsetting digital collectibles.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Before we keep going into Ecosapiens, you gotta give the listeners a little background on yourself because you&#8217;ve done some pretty darn cool shit at a very young age, got into VC hella early and went all in on climate. Give us the quick background on that and then we&#8217;ll sort of piece it all together and why it makes so much sense in regards to what you and the team are doing right now.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
So I actually, I grew up in Southern California in San Diego, and you know, I thought I&#8217;d be a filmmaker, you know, most of like my, who doesn&#8217;t want to be a filmmaker when you grew up in San Diego or LA, right? I don&#8217;t know what you wanted to be, Matt, when you were 16, but you know, Christopher Nolan was like a hero, right? And he&#8217;s a legend director. But I went to USC, I fell in love with entrepreneurship. And my mode of the world has always been through stories. And I think if you look at, you know, great tech companies, a lot of them do have this great story of like founding team comes together, has a vision for the how they want to change the world, build a piece of technology, scale it, grow it. There&#8217;s a hero&#8217;s journey in entrepreneurship. And that&#8217;s like rule number one of some of the best filmmaking, right? It&#8217;s sort of the hero&#8217;s journey. I ended up stumbling into venture capital, basically looking at the stories of great entrepreneurs for many years. And when I found myself at Menlo Ventures, I was sort of looking at my own story, you know, wondering sort of like how I wanted to develop my career long term, right? And impact has been a big part of my life, just like growing up. And I was doing consumer product related things. And in 2020, I remember being in San Francisco and saw the wildfires, you know, happen in October that year, I believe. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve seen those images of like the orange skies. Dude, it&#8217;s terrifying. I remember like opening my window in San Francisco. And from my apartment, I actually have a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Really special, by the way. And just immediately having this flashable memory of when I was a kid growing up in San Diego and seeing the same orange skies when I was a kid. I remember like literally the moment when my parents woke me up at 5 a.m. in San Diego, saying, we got to pack our bags. There&#8217;s a fire coming. What do you put in your backpack? If you only can only squeeze in one thing as a kid, right? I took my PlayStation with me, but.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I would have done the same, 100%.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, but it was terrifying. I snapped back into it and it just occurred to me that more and more families and kids are gonna wake up at 5 a.m. And have, you know, see that shit and have to flee hurricanes, wildfires, you name it. And that&#8217;s when I started sitting there asking myself, look, I&#8217;m here in San Francisco, in venture capital, surrounded by a lot of smart people. Why is it that I can&#8217;t really do anything? Like, what can I really do to make a difference on the planet? Turns out there&#8217;s a few ways, right? One is you can give up your car and you can, you know, bike to work, not very feasible in lots of parts of the world. You can end up spending more money on sustainable products, which is inaccessible to most people. But the third sort of insight that I had gleamed was like, there are really great climate companies like Tesla or Patagonia. And if you look at the number one reason why people buy them, it&#8217;s because of the signaling element of it, right? Like we are social animals. We do like to signal to the world that we are part of the specific value system. And so what I thought was, hey, people care about the planet. And it turns out there&#8217;s a lot of people just like me that want to make a difference, but they&#8217;re unable to do it. And the way to make climate action scale is maybe you have to make it like one click easy, like an easy button, like buy now on Amazon. Literally, it has to be like a button, right? One click easy. Two, it has to have this sort of like signaling effect, right? Like a Patagonia does or a Tesla. And three, there has to be some like financial attractiveness to it. Either it&#8217;s like really affordable or there&#8217;s potentially some alpha investing in it, right? If you look at those three ingredients, which is like financial attractiveness, potential for signaling, and it has to be easy, that&#8217;s where the idea for, hey, what if we took like climate assets such as regeneration, like soil regeneration, calpistry, like real world carbon capture? What if we kind of disguised it as the perfect digital art piece that made the world better and was a great signaling tool and has the potential to move in price over time? And that was sort of the idea of carbon offsetting NFTs. That&#8217;s kind of what we started at like two years ago. It was NFTs that fight climate change. It&#8217;s obviously been two years now, the community has grown. We&#8217;ve launched several products, but we&#8217;ve only deepened our conviction in that same core thesis that NFTs really are a great way to scale up climate action. And it&#8217;s because of these fundamentals of taking climate assets, putting them on chain, and turning it into a social tool for people.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That was all world. Thank you for that. I wanna just reiterate one last time, the three steps, the three parts of your thesis that you mentioned, you&#8217;d have social signaling, there needs to be some financial upside, maybe not financial upside, but some economic trigger. And the first one was easy to purchase or easy to use. One click easy, I love that. That&#8217;s going in the notes there, folks. You heard that, that has Amazon, that has Apple, that has any Elon Musk company written all over it. That&#8217;s exactly what you need in order to scale the shit out of a company. That&#8217;s huge. And working at the different VCs, millions and millions, that&#8217;s nonsense. Billions and billions, if not trillions of dollars, have gone into VC backed companies that are fighting climate change. Are there any particular that really get you going? Are there any areas of climate change that really get you going? I&#8217;d love if you could just say a little primer in regards to the good ones and the bad ones. There&#8217;s so many that are absolute fugazies. And many are not doing exactly what they say. They are, in my opinion, at least from what I&#8217;ve read. And again, I&#8217;m not an expert in this. So please take what I&#8217;m saying with a grain of salt. I just follow people like you who are actually in the weeds in the space on Twitter. And they&#8217;re the ones who are saying 80% of this stuff is absolute nonsense. It&#8217;s fugazies, it&#8217;s bullshit. So just give us a quick little primer on some great investments in the climate change industry right now, what the future of it looks like. Is it all about carbon credits? What do we have going on?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
First of all, the space for climate tech is massive. We&#8217;re talking about energy, we&#8217;re talking about transportation, we&#8217;re talking about construction, we&#8217;re talking about food. These are massive categories. These are trillion dollar economies in and of themselves. So the core thing, when I think about climate tech, I&#8217;m thinking about technologies that help those categories, energy, food, transportation, become net zero carbon emissions. That&#8217;s sort of how I think about climate tech. What you&#8217;re seeing today is energy has actually really come a long way. In the US and most places around the world, solar panels are cheaper than coal and fossil fuels. That only became possible in 2019. So up until 2019, even in the United States, it made more sense to open up a fossil fuel-based energy facility, like electricity facility. Today, it&#8217;s not feasible anymore. No one wants to open up fossil fuel-based electricity factories anymore because it doesn&#8217;t make economic sense. And this is a byproduct of great companies in batteries and in renewables over the last 20 years. So that&#8217;s kind of like, I&#8217;m really optimistic there. And that&#8217;s been around for a while. In food, you&#8217;re seeing a lot of companies figure out how to create plants that actually sequester more carbon. Living carbon is one of those companies, it&#8217;s a biotech company that&#8217;s figured out how to create trees. For example, they&#8217;re actually able to absorb way more CO2 than the typical tree and grow faster. That&#8217;s actually really powerful because if you can grow trees faster, for lumber, for example, you can actually reduce the amount of trees being cut for that resource. We&#8217;ll also capture more CO2 directly out of there. So there&#8217;s some really interesting companies that are figuring out how to scale up carbon capture through plants and trees and food that we&#8217;re all consuming. That&#8217;s a pretty exciting idea. Then you have like direct air carbon capture, like the Climeworks, for example, that have those like big fans, right? They&#8217;re actually capturing CO2 out of there, running on the ground. They&#8217;re geothermal caps. So taking CO2 that comes out of like exhaust pipes and then turning that into like blocks of carbon. There&#8217;s a company called Remora that&#8217;s actually doing this where you can attach like this object to a back of the tailpipe. So imagine a future where you&#8217;re driving, you know, your truck, for example, or a car that&#8217;s hard to decarbonize, like a large vehicle, and the exhaust that&#8217;s coming out of the pipe at the end is just simply being kind of back into like fossilized carbon, right? That&#8217;s not being emitted into the air. That&#8217;s a really interesting concept. I mean, dude, I can go on and on but I&#8217;m really excited by deep tech stuff that&#8217;s like touching direct air carbon capture that&#8217;s helping nature capture more carbon faster, right? And then the third one are economic incentives around carbon reduction. So like, you know, this is the type of stuff you see a lot of carbon credit companies doing on chain, right? Like figuring out ways to reintroduce carbon capture into market fundamentals, all companies emit emissions, for example. But if you can price in those negative externalities that a company already has, and Amazon and lots of companies are already doing it, if you can make that like a tax, for example, or introduce it as part of like a carbon balance, for example, I think the economy as a whole can actually move to a more regenerative state. So there&#8217;s actually a lot in there, by the way, but like I said, I can go on and on about climate tech, it&#8217;s massive.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, I totally feel you.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
I think our clothes in the future are all going to be like recycled plastic from oceans, you know? And I think it&#8217;s going to be made out of hemp or like sheep that&#8217;s highly renewable as opposed to the way tech sales are currently made.</p>

You and the team published an incredible little tweet storm, couple of tweet storm, X storm. Good God. What do we even call it nowadays? You guys published some absolute fire a couple of weeks ago in regards to how enterprise companies, the big dogs, the biggest of dogs can get in to NFTs and Web3. I could rip through this myself. You can do a much better job of explaining this. What do we have to do to onboard the biggest Web2 companies into NFTs and Web3?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s a great question. And we&#8217;ve actually introduced a new corporate product ourselves recently. And that was sort of the impetus for our own inquiry into how enterprises are using NFTs. The big thing to note, really at a high level, Matt, is that NFTs are really here to stay. While consumer volume might be down, you&#8217;re seeing an increasing number of Fortune 500s actually digging deeper. And frankly, it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s less noise. I think it&#8217;s a lot easier to build things when there&#8217;s less noise. But the areas people are really excited by seem to be sort of in a few buckets. One is loyalty and rewards programs. So everyone&#8217;s trying to figure out how to reward consumers for shopping more, spending more, et cetera, within their businesses. But they need to figure out how to do it in sort of a more cultural, digital-first way. I think a lot of people are bored by points. People don&#8217;t want to create more credit cards. So long as you have your one MetaMask account, you can access the world of Web3. And maybe you have your one stop access to loyalty and rewards programs in a lot of different places. So companies are trying to really tap into this unified potential rewards platform that might exist via NFTs. That&#8217;s one really cool area. You see Lufthansa doing it with Flymore, for example. You can unlock certain unique NFT collectibles. McLaren is doing it for the games. Obviously Starbucks is doing it for coffee. So that&#8217;s sort of one layer to it. Another big layer is identity. So you don&#8217;t have any people lie on their LinkedIn, by the way. Let me just ask you this question. Do you have a LinkedIn account?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I do have LinkedIn. I never use it ever. Literally just to post about the pod and to like when my guests say, oh, had a great time on the Cryptonews Podcast. I still have a picture of my Kool Kat as my LinkedIn picture. It&#8217;s all nonsense. I don&#8217;t know when the last time you saw your LinkedIn inbox, but it is like, it&#8217;s worse than your spam folder and email. It&#8217;s the worst thing ever. I always tell people Twitter, I learn every single day. You&#8217;re a Twitter guy as well. The amount of alpha, not even alpha, just the amount of health, wealth and happiness, gold that I get on Twitter. And then I have my fun stuff like my politics, my sports. But what one was the last time I learned anything on LinkedIn? Nihar, I literally cannot tell you. I cannot tell you last time I learned one thing on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Well, you know when people do use LinkedIn, right? It&#8217;s when they&#8217;re looking for jobs. LinkedIn still, I think, is one of the best ways for job seekers and employers to sort of connect. Can you guess what percentage of job seekers lie on their LinkedIn page?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Oh, it&#8217;s gotta be hell high.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
It&#8217;s over 50%. In a platform that&#8217;s designed to help job seekers and employers connect, how can that exist as a form of truth if half the people are lying? Imagine if your resume was always verified on the blockchain through an NFT. From the moment you graduate a university, and then where the metadata was updated every single time you worked at an employer. And what if that employer left you with a review, for example, and that was also etched onto the metadata? That&#8217;s like the ultimate source of truth that can&#8217;t be replicated. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a true digital resume, a true digital resume. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
It&#8217;s part of this broader concept of identity, a true form of truth. I think LinkedIn is one area where people are starting to test the waters with digital identity, digital resumes. You also have memorabilia. Obviously, Porsche is a big one. MoMA is one. Pepsi, they all have iconic brands as it is, and they have fan base around that IP, and so they&#8217;re able to create memorabilia. People also use it for charity. Taco Bell, funny enough, has actually raised money through NFTs. Time magazine, football hype. Then you have this whole metaverse bucket, like Artifact that&#8217;s owned by Nike. Adidas has one. Those are the big buckets. It&#8217;s memorabilia, raise money for charity, identity, loyalty and rewards program, and just metaverse. Those are the big categories, and you&#8217;re seeing more and more enterprises jump into them. I think it&#8217;s because we see the underlying use case for the technology irrespective of where the markets at. That&#8217;s the thing with NFTs. You have to build in the absence of when like, you can&#8217;t just be an NFT person when the market&#8217;s really booming. You can&#8217;t just be a Tesla guy if the price keeps going up. You have to be a believer through the highs and the lows. Anyways, it&#8217;s good to see enterprises actually be that archetype. They believe in the underlying tech. They&#8217;re willing to invest in the long run, and they are seeing a few interesting use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. NFT speculation, like the get rich quick NFT days are over, which has its pros and cons, 99% pros. The only con being the fact that it, the days of actually printing money out of thin air are gone. But again, so heavy, it&#8217;s like anything else in life. You have your small window of opportunity and you got to jump on it. Just keeping on the sort of enterprise big brands from one last question on this. What needs to happen for that domino to fall for mass adoption big brands? Like is there one particular network effect or one particular catalyst or domino in your eyes that needs to happen in order for all the big dogs to jump in?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
I think there&#8217;s two things. One is, I think the payment layer actually has to become FIAT. I actually believe that. To me, it&#8217;s like a hot take.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, how&#8217;s that a hot take? I think everyone agrees with you, no?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
I think it&#8217;s too much work, man. Like if you&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Too much friction. It should be quick credit card. Apple Pay, boom, done. That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
That&#8217;s what it needs to be. Right? On the back end, you know, whether it&#8217;s a Visa or a MetaMask or a MoonPay, they can do the work on the back end to make it like crypto rails, which makes it like easily transferable and to make it global. But for the front end, the user should be able to use the cash that they already own. You know? I don&#8217;t own more than like, why would I own pounds and pesos and like unless you go to that country? That&#8217;s what crypto is kind of like saying, right? It&#8217;s like, imagine if you&#8217;re in 10 different countries, you have to like switch currencies every time you want that needs to go away. Right? I do think it needs to be FIAT on ramp onto crypto transactions. But the second thing is I actually do think like the whole concept of a wallet needs to be embedded in a browser that people already own. I actually secretly think like I&#8217;m waiting for the day that, you know, Google buys MetaMask or something and just integrates it. And all of a sudden you have like over a billion people that have access to a wallet without even knowing it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve heard that hot take. I love that.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Well, we&#8217;re all comfortable downloading plugins on our Chrome, right? Or like using these little internet widgets. It needs to be as easy as that, right? It shouldn&#8217;t need to be this whole custodial wall that you need to go download. I think it just needs to be integrated into the applications we already use. And it might happen, right? I do think this stuff will just get integrated into the browser wherever you are, right? So I don&#8217;t think there needs to be this dedicated app. As it is, getting people to download apps is hard, right? It&#8217;s never been easy. So those are the two things that I think need to happen. They need to be FIAT-based transactions. And I think it needs to be easy, wallet access embedded within your browser, embedded within your Chrome. You wouldn&#8217;t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I can&#8217;t stop thinking about that Google buying MetaMask take. You just mentioned, holy shit, that would, I&#8217;ve asked that question probably 20 times in the pod. And I&#8217;m not just going to smoke up your ass. That&#8217;s easily the best answer I&#8217;ve heard. Cause if that happens, I mean, how does a billion people getting into the arena to quote, chermoth not actually move the needle? You know, like that&#8217;s wild.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s absolutely awesome. It&#8217;s a great go to market hat. I mean, a parallel example in a Web2 was, Slack was founded well over a decade ago. I&#8217;m blanking on the exact year, but it was around the time, it was around late 2000s, right? It took them about 10 years to cross the 100 million user mark. And it&#8217;s because it was a brand new application. We were also switching from desktop to mobile right around that time. Microsoft obviously has computers in the hands of billions of people, and they have lots of enterprise contracts. When they launched Teams, they were actually able to get to that same 100 million mark in less than a year. And that&#8217;s just what, that&#8217;s a go to market hack, right? So we keep sitting here saying, we can get, you know, it&#8217;ll take 10 years to get people a MetaMask, or it can take one Google or one Microsoft to just deploy it within the existing application, and then you just have it overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t love a good moonshot every once in a while? Come on, let&#8217;s make it happen. We&#8217;ll give the Google guys a call. We are getting a little tight for time here, mate. Couple more questions and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. What is next for Ecosapiens? You guys had a very successful, I guess, third, fourth, fifth gen NFT launch a couple of weeks ago. What else do you guys have on the docket over the next couple of months, a couple of years?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, so we&#8217;re actually really leaning into our enterprise carbon-offset and collectibles. So today we actually are commissioning carbon-offset and collectibles for companies that they can put in their offices, for example, so that they can then go open addition for their all employees to be a part of that experience. We&#8217;ve done that with SELO. We do have a launch coming up with Polygon pretty soon. That&#8217;s, you can&#8217;t tell you the exact date, we&#8217;ll have more on that soon, but it has been public that we are doing something in partnership with them. So we&#8217;re going to be doing more of those, right? So expect to see us do more commission pieces for companies. We have another consumer launch coming up late this year, early next year, and that&#8217;ll be sort of our classic OG carbon-offset and collectible for individuals. We&#8217;re also working on a new, you know, back to Chrome integrations. We also are quietly working behind the scenes on our own sort of Chrome application. And it&#8217;s early days there, but there&#8217;s a story where, you know, you just shopped the web, the eco web, and you&#8217;re rewarded with our collectibles. And that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re pretty happy and working on and we&#8217;ll be able to share more later. But, you know, our goal is, you know, make climate action easy, accessible, impactful, right? And the only way you do that is if your collectibles are offered anywhere on the web. And that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re continuing to chip away at, whether it&#8217;s directly from us, right? Whether you&#8217;re buying them directly for us, or your company&#8217;s perhaps giving you to them, or maybe you&#8217;re just shopping on the web, or just browsing on the web, and you&#8217;re offered them at the checkout line, or even through a Chrome plugin, we want to be everywhere. And that&#8217;s sort of what you can expect from us over the next year, really.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. We need one or two hot takes before you go. The Gen Zers love the hot takes on socials. And I know you got a bunch of them. I bet you you have dozens of fire ones. Most of them probably so spicy we can&#8217;t even let them fly on the pod, mind you. This is a not kid friendly pod. It&#8217;s wearing is allowed, crazy hot takes are allowed, but Nihar, before you go, you gotta give me a couple.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
All right. Well, it&#8217;s been a little bit over a year since Elon Musk took over Twitter, took it private, changed the name to X, fuck with the algorithm, brought on an amazing advertising executive, right? To go become the new CEO to bring the big bucks, add bucks back in. I think within the next year, Elon Musk will take Twitter back to being public, but not through the traditional IPO market. I think he&#8217;s gonna release Xcoin and it&#8217;ll get back what it will convert into a token. That token, the currency by which all ads are transacted on Twitter, and it&#8217;s gonna be the same form of currency that creators get paid on within Twitter, or X rather. So I do think X Twitter just became x.com. I think it&#8217;s gonna become X protocol the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What chain? Do you have a take for any chain or is the inner build a chain?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
It&#8217;s going to be XChain.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
XChain. So that vision from like late 1990s will happen.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Yeah, seriously. That&#8217;s, I mean, if you really think about what Elon, it&#8217;s the everything app, right? Which means it has to have its own infrastructure, its own payments. And we already know, you know, Elon Musk loves crypto. I think this is a very natural way for there to be liquidity and it&#8217;s just like the currency of the whole platform, right? Data that&#8217;s transacted on Xcoin, advertising dollars that are transacted on Xcoin. I think it&#8217;s all gonna happen on X.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I like that. I mean, you can&#8217;t really bet against that guy. Like, you&#8217;d be, it&#8217;s just naive too. I love that one.</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
It&#8217;s almost like immoral to humanity, seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It is. Give us one more and then we go. Any New York versus San Frans takes?</p>
<p><strong>Nihar Neelakanti</strong><br />
Okay, San Francisco is definitely back. It&#8217;s been back. Dude I think I so like fun story. There&#8217;s a someone that we share an office with who, you know, is like a young crypto founder and not that I was snooping, but I happened to come across like a receipt and it was like vegan chili and green juice, you know, like 22 year old crypto founder. That&#8217;s like the meal of choice. That&#8217;s like, you get that left and right in San Francisco, you know, I think you&#8217;re going to see a lot of like young crypto founders go like, do AI meets crypto in San Francisco? Cause that&#8217;s the only place you can do it. I mean, where else can you be vegan? Do AI do crypto anonymously and still be cool. It, there&#8217;s no other place. Not really. I think San Francisco is cool. And, I mean, dude, people have written San Francisco as a bituary, like the 10 times over the last 50 years and it still comes back. Same with New York. Right. 9/11, New York&#8217;s done. You know, God bless. 2008, New York&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s back. I don&#8217;t know. COVID, It&#8217;s back.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always, coming in hot from Mexico. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have one of the OGs, not one of the OG of the move to earn industry on the show today, Oleg Fomenko, the Co-Founder of Sweat Economy, which is establishing the movement economy by realizing the value of physical activities and rewarding all forms of movement. Nine years prior to the conception of Sweat Economy, Oleg Co-Founded Sweatcoin, which we all know and love, a digital currency backed by physical movement with the Sweat Economy ecosystem. He has more than 15 years of experience as an entrepreneur. He founded bloom.fm and spearheaded a 16 million pound raise, attracting 1.2 million registered users in the UK and offering the world&#8217;s first one pound per month subscription service. Again, this is well ahead of the game. He also has a wealth of experience in the areas of propositions, strategy development, consultancy, brand management, you name it, a true serial entrepreneur and is incredibly interested in areas of health, civil rights, social actions, human rights, economic empowerment and education. I am super friggin pumped to have this guy on the show. Oleg, welcome to show my friend, pumped to have you on. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
Wow. Thank you very much, Matt. It&#8217;s an absolute pleasure being here. I can tell you PR agencies can certainly write some stuff. I&#8217;m like, holy moly, that&#8217;s me. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love it. Yeah. I always. You gotta ask the PR firm to send over a fire bio, right? Cause I can go and I can do my research and look over, but 9 times out of 10, they&#8217;re gonna send me something better. But yeah, that was pretty darn good by them. But look man, super pumped to have you on. This is one of these episodes that has so much real world utility. And I&#8217;m very fortunate to have some incredible guests, not some, all of my guests that come on are absolutely incredible. People who are multitudes smarter than myself. And I get to learn from them. Most of the time though, it&#8217;s just in Web3. There&#8217;s very little application to the Web2 world or real world for that matter. We sort of live in this magic internet economy and you are spearheading the move to earn movement, which I absolutely love. I am a huge walker. I like to run, I love to walk. I think walking is one of the most unrated activities you can do on the planet. And to get paid to walk is absolutely brilliant. I can&#8217;t wait to get in this Sweat Economy. Before then though, we gotta set the stage. You gotta let our listeners know a little bit about who you are growing up. Tell us some good Russia stories. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re a hockey fan at all. I live in bleed hockey. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen Putin play or Fedorov or any of those guys, but big hockey guy, tell us a little bit about yourself and some entrepreneurial stories. And then we&#8217;ll get into the Sweatcoin stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
I was born in Russia and yeah, as a Russian kid, I did play hockey. You had to, so the way it comes with it, with the territory, you gotta do cross-country skiing and playing hockey in winter and you walk and run in summer and play football. So, was huge fan of hockey, especially when Russia and Canada started going so really hard onto each other. Those games that were absolutely incredible. You know, kind of both from hockey perspective, but also on the, you know, kind of glove. Boxing perspective, it was, you know, absolutely superb time, very entertaining. But I did play very long time ago. 1995, I&#8217;ve already left Russia and has been living, you know, kind of all over the world ever since. I looked for the first time at Bitcoin in 2011 and absolutely loved it. But I was stupid enough not to actually buy a few thousand Bitcoin, they were 20 cents back then. Well, you know, there are plenty of stories. I&#8217;m sure circulating around, but I really got hooked on technology. And I really loved the fact that this was the first time that I touched technology that was so intricately linked with psychology. You know, I&#8217;ve never encountered this before because normally when you build tech, you always have to deal with all each cases and make sure that, you know, kind of nothing ever falls over. And here is the thing that basically says if more than 50% of participants are malicious, then the whole thing falls over. And I&#8217;m like, wow, that&#8217;s actually really cool because it brings psychology of large groups with tech and completely changes dynamics and sort of puts technology in a completely different role in the world.  Anyway, you know, enough philosophy. I really was very keen to figure out how to work with blockchain and, you know, kind of build around blockchain tech and opportunity presented itself in 2014 when I went for a run with my co-founder and I quit even around 5K. And three years before, I was climbing some of the highest mountains in the world. And we started talking, how is that possible? What&#8217;s going on? How do you lose fitness so quickly? And, you know, one thing after another, you know, sort of digging behavioral science and psychology, we realized that 100% of people in the world are frustrated with the level of physical activity. You know, they always want more. They want to be more active. They want to find more time. And when you encounter a problem that is so universal, there is a hint that there is an explanation there that might be a lot simpler than what&#8217;s on the surface. And on what&#8217;s on the surface, people complain about motivation, lack of money, lack of time, lack of, you know, kind of energy, you know, weather, you name it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Lack of incentives.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
You know, they suddenly complained about that. But what happens is that if you start digging this deep, you realize that the reason why we&#8217;re not as active as we want to be is very simple, because nature doesn&#8217;t want us to be active. Nature didn&#8217;t build us to be active. Nature built us and optimized us to survival, which means preservation of calories rather than spending on them. Right? So our ancestors wouldn&#8217;t run unless there is a mammoth on the horizon and there is food and you need to kill it so that the tribe has something to eat. Or Sabretooth tiger is about to make meal out of you. Otherwise you just sit and preserve those calories. Nobody would be doing pull-ups push-ups or training around and looking good. That would result in squandering of calories. And by the time mammoth shows up, everyone&#8217;s dead because they, you know, nature has really made it adamant that this is the way we should be behaving and it&#8217;s very hard to bite nature. However, nature also gave us a hint how to overcome this. And, you know, the shortcut or the solution is called instant gratification. So when we realize this, we kind of went, huh, so what if we create an instant gratification mechanism in exchange for every step that you take would that change people&#8217;s behavior? And this can be done with technology. So that&#8217;s how the ideas with Queen came about. We launched the app and we realized that it does subconsciously change people&#8217;s behavior. So it doesn&#8217;t make you go to gym more often. It doesn&#8217;t make you go for a run, but it makes you go for a little bit longer run. It makes you skip that stop on the bus. It makes you take a longer walk with your dog. It makes you take more steps on the daily basis because it is subconsciously starting to trigger those switches in the opposite direction. And nature tells you, well, it&#8217;s gainful activity. Therefore, you&#8217;re starting to change your behavior. Amazing result. We&#8217;ve done medical grade research in the UK with the University of Warwick and we learned that our users were 20% more active after installing our app than before. They loved proposition because, these guys do what they pay you to walk. It&#8217;s crazy that can&#8217;t work. So a lot of people were installing app just to prove that they must be doing something bad. They must be selling data. Yeah, important point we never did. We don&#8217;t do it and we never will sell data because we don&#8217;t have to and we believe that ethically it&#8217;s a wrong thing to do. And also legally we&#8217;re a European company and we are on the GDPR, which is the most draconian privacy protecting legal framework. So we are happy that we can&#8217;t and we don&#8217;t want to. But yeah, that&#8217;s a sort of side course. And then we just launched when you&#8217;re kind of into a lot of geographies and we started getting, you know, millions of users. Oh, important. Name, Sweat Queen, the original name. That suggests that we want to be on blockchain but we couldn&#8217;t. Bitcoin was too slow and too expensive to build on. Ethereum was too early. We met with Vitalic in 2015. It was just research grade project back then. And we had to launch centralized, but we thought that six months to a year there would be a great next blockchain coming in and we&#8217;ll just migrate very quickly. It took nearly nine years for blockchain tech to get robust enough and fast enough to support our scale. And we launched Sweat Economy last year on NEAR. I saw that, you know, you&#8217;re wearing a T-shirt. NEAR was sort of an amazing tech, really like founding team. And by then, we already had more than 120 million users, and it was too late to move the whole Sweatcoin ecosystem onto blockchain because imagine that over nine years, you already used to this thing behaving in a certain way, and you already build expectations. And we had to create a separate token, Sweat, and non-custodial wallet, Sweat wallets, and that went live last September in many geographies outside of the US. And we very quickly learned that US residents, US users of Sweatcoin, were not particularly happy about that decision. They made themselves known that, you know, why are we not able to walk into crypto? And the volume of these complaints was huge. And our community outside of the US was also very much supportive of going live in the US in the biggest ever governance vote in Web3&#8217;s history. 380 ,000 people cast their vote to go into the US and allocate a budget, which, you know, we did. So on 17th of October, or this is today, 19th, two days ago, we went live in the US, and we finally can say that, you know, pretty much 90% of the world countries now are both in Sweatcoin and in Sweat wallet, which means that you can literally walk into thrift shelf. I believe that you should be able to see that. So that&#8217;s basically the story.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What a start, Oleg. That was absolute fuego. That was nothing but fire. So many different ways we can take this. Let&#8217;s just keep going on cron order here. You just brought it up going into the US. That&#8217;s absolutely massive. It&#8217;s the most powerful economy in the world. For a good reason, the US is going to US. You know what they do. I could be wrong here, but I believe the Ripple ruling had a massive emphasis, a huge emphasis in your guys&#8217; ability to participate in the US. Why did it take so long? Why was it such a shit show? Obviously, everyone knows that they are the kings and queens of putting up walls and borders everywhere except from Mexico to US. But everywhere when it comes to anything tech related, they love putting forks in the fire and turning it into a shit show. And that obviously impacted you guys as well. Talk to me about the Ripple ruling and how that allowed you guys to jump into the US market.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
Yeah, I wouldn&#8217;t say that it was the main reason. The main reason was use a base of Sweatcoin users that were demanding that they should be able to walk into crypto. And our worldwide community understanding very well that actually growing the community and becoming bigger is beneficial for everybody. I would say that XRP ruling was sort of one of those solidifying moments where you all of a sudden need realize that, you know what the time has come that we know that it will happen, but that sort of precipitated their decision because we realized, and it is extremely important to emphasize this, that the reason why regulations exist in the US is to protect American investors from rugs, ivory, whatever. And we realized that we as a project, we&#8217;re coming with a completely different sort of goal objective sentiment and also history because unlike a lot of other crypto projects, we&#8217;ve been around for nine years. We already know what we&#8217;re doing and we have a Web2 business in the US. And our objective is to make the world more physically active. And we do it extremely well. And we know that by extending the business into Web3 we bring in more behavior change, we&#8217;re shaving more inches of that proverbial waste of a nation. And let&#8217;s face it, the United States is not the leanest and the thinnest population in the world. And yeah, to be honest, it&#8217;s everywhere right now, but we do need to have every single bit of help to be more physically active, earn more calories and can it be in a better shape that we can get? So we are coming with that in mind and we cannot even physically cause damages to American investors because they earn our token by walking and burning calories. So when you realize this, kind of while risks always exist, I think it would be very strange if we were sort of singled out as a project that is actually kind of causing damage and is doing stuff that needs to be stopped. So we thought about it and which kind of went, okay, you know what? We can&#8217;t really continue collecting such a huge user base that we already have. And frankly, I got tired of trying to explain to people why they are not treated like everybody else. And frankly, personally, you know this, like if you are getting worse deal than others, it&#8217;s unpleasant. I don&#8217;t wanna be that person. Absolutely, and I feel that it&#8217;s just so unfair on US residents that this was going on. So we just needed to fix it. And it&#8217;s literally massive sort of holder off my shoulders that we are now there, that anyone who wants to literally walk into crypto can do it. But actually I would like to take a step aside from kind of XRP and tell you that once we started doing the research into crypto and our proposition, we realized that there are two reasons why mass market audience is struggling to engage. And that&#8217;s the reason why Web3 is not growing as fast as I believe it should have been over the last few years. And the reasons are user experience and language. So we&#8217;re so used and I&#8217;m sure that you know your crypto. This 24 words that we need to write down and then there&#8217;s a big text. Don&#8217;t even take a screenshot. And so people are really kind of feeling like, oh my God, this is too complicated and it&#8217;s too wondrous or it&#8217;s too scary. And there&#8217;s also language, you know, huddle, biddle, finality and all that, you know, staking people just kind of go like, you know, I don&#8217;t understand. I read the sentence, I read words, but I don&#8217;t know the meaning that is really emanating. And we&#8217;ve taken that on board. And over the last many years, we learned how to build really slick, simple, you know, very straightforward applications that just work, Sweatcoin. We took that experience and we built really cool app, Sweat Wallet. If you go into App Store right now, you&#8217;ll see that we have a rating of 4.8 with tens of thousands of ratings. So, you know, can be really good app. And the other thing that people always were citing as a barriers and issue was even if you must have that opsec and you went in, the first step that you&#8217;d always have to take is buy some crypto. And that means you pull your card and you have to buy some, but typically it doesn&#8217;t make sense to buy less than a few hundred dollars worth. And all of a sudden you kind of go, ooh, you know, yesterday they wrote about 600 million being drained from here, 320 million being drained from there. People kind of go like, oh my God, no way, my lot. It&#8217;s going to be my money that&#8217;s going to disappear. And they bulk and they take a step back and they kind of go, you know, I don&#8217;t want to risk that much cash. They literally want to get in there, learn the ropes and understand how it works. And then they can participate. And this is exactly our proposition, walk into crypto. You move your legs, you earn your tokens. Is it going to make your, you know, kind of crazy rich and you know, you&#8217;re going to be able to stop working? No, we never promised that, unlike some other projects that, you know, kind of were making crazy claims. But you can actually learn crypto tokens and you can learn ropes. You can understand how to transfer, how to receive, you can understand how to state. You can understand how Web3 gaming works. You can understand how trading for other crypto token works. And all of a sudden you&#8217;re going to go, oh my God, this, you know, I am using Web3. I am in it. I&#8217;m experiencing this. And all of a sudden you can start engaging with other protocols, other chains and potentially putting in your money because you are no noob anymore and you feel a lot more confident. That&#8217;s basically what we do. Make you walk more and be seated and healthier while learning the ropes and understanding how Web3 works. So health and wealth go well together.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100% health, wealth, and happiness. That&#8217;s my motto. Oleg, like you are absolutely on fire and we got to give a huge shout out to our sponsor to the show, PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to get into the move to earn industry and how Sweat Economy will overcome the classic inability of the move to earn coins, companies, and projects, their ability to succeed. So far we haven&#8217;t seen any, but if I&#8217;m a betting man and I am a betting man, it&#8217;s gonna be you guys. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, the longtime friends of the Cryptonews Podcast and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Pod.

Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50 to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with Oleg. Let&#8217;s get into the elephant in the room here. I&#8217;ve told my friends about Sweatcoin, I told my friends about Steppen. I was on Steppen, many of us were on Steppen. Again, the only similarity you guys have is that you&#8217;re both in the move to earn game. Well, I mean, they&#8217;re not really around anymore, but they were in the move to earn game. You guys literally are the move to earn game. You guys pioneered this shit. What everyone always asks me when I tell them about this, they always go, Matt, tell me about some cool DeFi applications. Tell me about some cool things in crypto. And I bring up things like, hey, a couple of weeks ago, I had a buddy who reached out, talking crypto, do you have any cool podcast guests coming up? And I&#8217;m like, well, if I tell him about DeFi Company One or ZK Tech Company Y, he doesn&#8217;t give a shit. But I was like, yeah, you know what? Actually, this super cool dude Oleg&#8217;s coming on. He&#8217;s the Founder and CEO of this company called Sweat Economy. And you&#8217;re a big walker. You love running. You run marathons. You literally get paid to run and walk. It&#8217;s pretty sweet. He goes, how does he pay me? Where does the money come from? So I&#8217;m going to throw it over to you because I&#8217;m sure this is not, I&#8217;m sure. This is the elephant in the room. Everyone wants to know, how does this whole economy work? On the outside looking in, it&#8217;s quite simple. People take their left leg, they put it in front of the right leg, and they get paid. And like you said, it&#8217;s not going to make you rich. Even if you&#8217;re running a marathon a day, you&#8217;re not going to be able to retire. But it&#8217;s not about that. It&#8217;s about giving you a very small piece of the pie. And in return, you get to participate in a really cool economy, get a little bit healthier, a little bit wealthier, and learn about Web3, learn about crypto. It&#8217;s wins, wins across the board. But I want to throw the ball over to your court. Tell me how the economy actually works. Where&#8217;s the money that you guys give? Where does that come from? Give me the whole nine yards here.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
There is a lot to unpack there. But you know where I&#8217;ll start? I&#8217;ll start with three steps back, because it&#8217;s always useful when there is an analogy, something that brings stuff to life, right? And there is an economy that is sort of XX to earn that has been, well, actually, there are two. There is one that has been going for thousands of years, and we&#8217;re so used to it, we don&#8217;t even think about it in the concept of XX to earn. And then there is one that was built by humanity over the course of the last hundred and fifty years to humongous size. The first one is work to earn, right? I mean, we all understand the concept and, you know, we&#8217;re all in it. The other one, the next one is pay attention to earn, or in other words, we call this attention economy. By some estimate, it is an industry of seven trillion dollars in size. Now, let&#8217;s unpack how does it work? I pay attention. A company gets the value of that attention that the third party advertiser pays them. And then that company gives them a sliver of that value in the shape of three products. And, you know, this product is making me spend more and more attention so that the company makes more money. And that&#8217;s how we have attention economy generating this big tech. And the reason why they&#8217;re so wealthy, this company, is because they&#8217;re giving us tiny little sliver of that value that they receive for your attention. Now, let&#8217;s unpack parallels between attention and physical activity. Both are useful and essential to you. Every bit of knowledge, every meeting of a person, every new transaction, or anything starts with you paying attention. That&#8217;s the value and the utility that you get. Physical activity, you are the primary beneficiary of physical activity, keeps you in a better physical shape. It helps you to stay in a mental health shape as well. It lengthens your life. It extends your health span. And it also makes you happier, reduces absenteeism, increases productivity. So, you know, it&#8217;s amazingly valuable to you. There are also third parties, like advertisers, in case of attention, that are willing to pay for your physical activity. Healthcare providers, insurers, employers, ultimately countries, because if you&#8217;re physically active, you put less pressure on healthcare costs. And you live longer, therefore you generate more tax revenue all the time. So, it is big business. And what matters most is both attention and physical activity, us cars, that are unlimited. You know, you can&#8217;t have an unlimited amount of attention and you can&#8217;t have an unlimited amount of physical activity. So, why would we not have a movement economy or physical activity economy very much akin to attention economy? Especially if we have this new blockchain technology where we can tokenize and actually turn, track and verify physical activity into a token that you earn, as opposed to mean getting all the value and giving you a tiny sliver of it in the shape of three products. This value exchange is going to make you go like, wow, okay, now I&#8217;m earning from my physical activity, makes you even more physically active, that creates more wealth in the world that again you earn. And that pushes us to create quite a lot of wealth because, you know, I already mentioned, there are a lot of entities that are benefiting from increasing the amount of physical activity in the world. In the US, average person walks 3,000 steps a day. That&#8217;s more than three times less than what, I mean, we have this data. In Europe, it&#8217;s 5,000, so we&#8217;re a million miles away from getting even 10,000 that is recommended, you know, on a daily basis. So, we can create an immense amount of wealth. And our thesis is, if attention is $7 trillion, seven times the total size of crypto, I bet you that movement economy will be bigger in size because it&#8217;s healthcare cost reduction, productivity increase, absolutely decrease, health span increase, higher amount of economic activity, etc. And why would it be less than $70 trillion? I don&#8217;t know the time horizon, but with the advent of technology, it&#8217;s certainly not going to take us 150 years to build this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Me playing devil&#8217;s advocate here, or like my only point in being the devil here would be the barrier to entry and the friction, right? Where it&#8217;s like for me to, for the movement economy to not be as big as the attention economy. Cause for the attention economy, I just pick up my phone and boom, I&#8217;m participating. But for the movement economy, actually I need to get my ass out of the chair and move. That&#8217;s my only thing. I do agree with you. It can be just as big, but that&#8217;s my only downfall.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
But everyone is moving already. It&#8217;s not that you need to fundamentally change your life. That&#8217;s what I started with, you know, and the nature plays districts on us. Everyone takes steps per day. You are not fundamentally doing anything different. You are just extending the period in which you are physically active. That is extremely easy to do. I&#8217;m not telling you you need to start going to your gym. That is a radical change. What we are telling you is every step is worth something. And all of a sudden, miraculously, you start putting one foot in front of another more times per day. That&#8217;s all we want. And the barrier to entry, the app is free. It does not consume your battery and you are getting paid to walk. Now, after we finish sort of this, you know, we are working on this analogy, which paints a very different picture from what a lot of people think about need to earn. We are building moving into Convay. We are creating sweat as a tokenized physical activity. In the future, I don&#8217;t want people to talk about, you know, sweat has increased price, decreased price. I&#8217;d like to have a headline that says, physical activity pumped 20% last week on the release of the recent obesity data. That&#8217;s the stuff that we are going for because physical activity has value. Everyone knows when we say that, but when you ask how much, everyone just kind of goes, but if something has value, it has to have tangible financial value. Let&#8217;s create it, let&#8217;s make it tradable and let&#8217;s figure out how much humanity is willing to pay for physical activity. They in and out very much like attention because we now know how much attention is worth. Let&#8217;s arrive to that answer in Movement Economy. Now, where does money come from? Very simple answer. Your moving has value and your attention as a physical person has incredible value as well. If you health, fitness, sports, vanity, fashion, makeup, dog accessories, healthy feed supplements, brands, talking to physically active people is fishing in the pond where you know all your users are because their mindset is already in the right direction. And you can target them extremely precisely. If you wanna target people who just started the journey, you put low price and all of a sudden you have tens of millions of people that can afford the product. If you wanna target people like yourselves, the athletes, you put high price and not many people will have those balances. So all of a sudden, you are dealing with the audience that you know is right customer, you can precisely target them and you also give them these products in a very different environment where they&#8217;re gagging, they&#8217;re interested in spending and getting your product as opposed to being interrupted with some advertising where they go, you know what, I was trying to chat to Matt and this video popped up and you know, again, it interrupted me, right? It&#8217;s a completely different mindset. So we are, you know, kind of, we, over the last nine years, nine years ago when I was telling the story, people were like, huh? What the hell are you talking about? This is a charity. You&#8217;re planning to pay people to walk. What kind of business is that? Right? Right now, especially after multiple years of us not just being sustainable and not just being growing but also being profitable, people are starting to get onto this. I&#8217;m like, oh yeah, I can understand how this works. So third parties are paying a lot of money to get in front of you and engage with you as a user. There are also third parties that are paying for your physical activity. We have a big contract in the United Kingdom with National Health Service and HHS to make people diagnosed with diabetes syndrome more active. If you diagnose with diabetes syndrome, you have six months within which you have to change your diet and your lifestyle. To change diet is easy, lifestyle is hard. That&#8217;s where we come in. The adherence in the previous program was 26%. It is in excess of 80% with our participation. And if you can stop people from becoming diabetic, you make them live longer, you grow quality of life because they don&#8217;t have to deal with insulin and constant checks. It&#8217;s absolutely incredible. And live along the huge cost that society bears by having another person who&#8217;s got serious medical condition and needs constant attention and support. So it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s happening. Everyone understands that pieces are starting to fall into place, but we can shave. I believe factor 10 in terms of trying to create the economy in comparison to attention economy by having blockchain because we can talk about physical activity. We can turn it into liquid asset. We can make it easily exchangeable from one party to another and tradeable independently without any party is able to influence.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. The reason why I have to play devil&#8217;s advocate and be the devil in the room here is because again, when people hear such an incredible value proposition like Sweatcoins, they are going to say and Sweat Economies. They&#8217;re going to say it sounds too good to be true. The only other thing we need to touch on is the data privacy, more specifically data privacy in the fitness industry. And when I&#8217;ve been asked about Sweatcoin and Sweat Economy in particular, your singular data, your own data is not being sold to anyone. When someone like NHS in Britain partners with you guys, they&#8217;re getting the data set as a whole. They are not getting anyone&#8217;s individual data. I&#8217;d love if you could just speak upon data privacy in the fitness industry as a whole and how you guys are protecting your users&#8217; data.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
So as I said, we never transferred or sold data. We don&#8217;t transfer or sell data now and we never will. And we&#8217;ve been asked plenty of times, especially insurance companies, that really wanted for their models. But you know what? Genuinely it feels like shooting out, if we were to consider this, that would be like shooting ourselves in the foot. Our objective is to make the world more physically active. And for that we need trust of hundreds of millions, billions of people. And selling data is, it feels like a dirty trick. It should not be practiced by any business. And it just really enrages me when I hear that businesses even got hacked and they were not taking care of the data enough so that my data got stolen. Leave along when they were willingly transferring it. And as I mentioned, this is one of the reasons why we keep all the data in Europe. Because that means that it is governed by the GPR framework. And we legally, even if anybody in the business were to consider it, legally we just wouldn&#8217;t be able to do any of this shit. So this never happened. And the reason for it is because, as I mentioned, we have really robust business models. Businesses pay to us, advertisers pay to us. And we also have premium subscription. And these three revenue streams work really well in Web2. In Web3 we have additional revenue streams because all of a sudden you have your own asset where you can charge your keys for transferring stuff. And in charge of trading, our Sweat hero game is also generating revenues for us. You know, it&#8217;s a battle and company charges battle fee. And this is not going into our pocket. This is going into a revenue pot. And if this revenue is in Sweat, the community votes on what to do with it. And historically they&#8217;ve been voting to burn it. So remove it from circulating supply. If this revenue is in other tokens in Fiat, we spend half of our profit on buying tokens on an open market. So this money effectively goes back to token holders. Web3 is incredibly flexible and very innovative space that represents more revenue opportunities than even Web2. Which is why from July this year we managed to become deflationary. As I mentioned, this nine years we&#8217;ve been spending, you know, kind of not just learning the ropes of move to earn. We also built sustainable businesses that were scaling and that were profitable. We took this into Web3 and profitability in Web3 is deflationary nature of your token economics. What does it mean? At the end of the month, our circulating supply of tokens is lower than at the end of the previous month. So that&#8217;s what we were able to achieve. And the reason for it is the fact that we&#8217;re paying a lot of attention to token economics, to token things, to revenue generation and making sure that we are not just telling you story, but we&#8217;re really focusing on building robust business and value for token holders.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Oleg you&#8217;ve been on fire today mate. I&#8217;m having too much fun here. I absolutely love this. One last topic, because I think we&#8217;ve covered almost everything here, just as sort of the gamification of the fitness industry as a whole. One thing that genuinely, I don&#8217;t want to say grinds my gears, that pisses me off a little, I have an Apple Watch. Is it a Rolex? Is it a Audemars Piguet? Is it a Patek Philippe? No, it&#8217;s not. But you know what? The reason why I like my Apple Watch is it gamifies health. I&#8217;m a very active guy. I&#8217;m fortunate to be in pretty good shape. I owe part of that to my parents who were very, who put such an emphasis on always being active and moving. When I was young, they put me in a bunch of sports. They gave me the opportunity to become a, you know, a physically fit human being. The reason why I have this Apple Watch on right now is it makes things fun, you know? It&#8217;s like, oh, if my ass is in the chair for 50 minutes on the hour, like it is right now in one minute, you know, we&#8217;re at the 50 minute mark right now. I&#8217;m going to get a little notification. Hey, time to get up. It&#8217;s just good little things like that. On the flip side, you have people going, what kind of human are you if you need a piece of technology to motivate you? It&#8217;s like, look, I would still get 20,000 steps a day. I would still be an absolute specimen without the Apple Watch, but it makes it fun for me. It makes it more interesting. It makes it cool. And it turns it into a game. Life&#8217;s a big, darn game. And if you can create many games out of life, you&#8217;re on the road to success. What do you have to say to the haters out there who are like, ah, who needs a friggin app in order to motivate them? Because for me, it&#8217;s a big old FU. I think it&#8217;s, I love it. I&#8217;m all for it. I&#8217;m all for health tech. And I think it&#8217;s going to really help us become a fitter, healthier, happier and wealthier society.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
Hmm. It&#8217;s a big topic for me. I was planning to have a TEDx talk on the topic of manipulation, because what you are talking about is, is it okay to manipulate somebody? And for quite a lot of people, they feel that unless it my sort of intrinsic drives and it somehow came out of me, it is unacceptable. You know, when my watch tells me to stand up, or when somebody tells you to do something, then it&#8217;s sort of an oppression and it&#8217;s manipulation, or it&#8217;s somebody else trying to change my behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What about the intent? If the intention is good, who gives a shit? You know what I mean? This thing is here to make me fitter. Who cares. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
Exactly. Now, that is precisely the talk, you know, kind of the story of my talk because my first ever memory is I am two and a half years of age and I see these spaces. One of them is my mom. Another one is highly concerned looking doctor that, you know, kind of somehow persuades me to swallow this liquid because it was very sweet. And apparently I told this to my mom and she said, oh, yeah, no, that was, you know, you had a temperature and they called it you were dead and you needed to get humongous quantity of this. I don&#8217;t remember the temperature dropping paracetamol, but you know, kind of version of paracetamol. And, you know, kind of in order to persuade me to do it, they put it into honey. So they tricked me by giving me something sweet and I swallowed it. And you know what? I lived because of that. Now, I have absolutely no problem with somebody manipulating or telling me to do something because it is exactly about that. It is intent. It&#8217;s not the action. But what does it do to me? And with what intent it is given to me? So if people are complaining that, you know, and they don&#8217;t want to use an app, God bless them. I mean, if they can find the discipline that, you know, kind of that great memory to every 60 minutes to jump up and move, who does to them and respect to them. And yep, but majority of us have a lot of other things to worry about. So if somebody nudges me and tells me to do something, I&#8217;m just thankful that I can actually delegate this means field task that I don&#8217;t want to use my brain for to technology. But I am still benefiting from those behaviors that are coming from those nudges. So if people don&#8217;t want to play the game, absolutely fine. You know, kind of, to be honest, it&#8217;s not like, you know, we&#8217;re selling you a really expensive NFT at the door and we&#8217;re dependent on you coming in and buying them. And that&#8217;s my revenue stream. No, as I said, everything&#8217;s free. The app is free. And everything works because of the scale and because you change your behavior. And there are a lot of companies are paying attention to that. I&#8217;m kind of going, these guys are able to make these people more active. I want to talk to them. And I want to attract their attention. And I want to have them as customers. So if you don&#8217;t want to participate in it, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Love it. Oleg what an episode, man. This has been an absolute treat. I&#8217;ve had a blast and can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two. I also need some of that Sweat swag. It is nasty. I love that. I&#8217;ll be rocking that. Just like I&#8217;m rocking the NEAR swag. I&#8217;ll be rocking some of the Sweat swag. But until the next time we speak, you got to let our listeners know where they can find you and Sweatcoin and Sweat Economy online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Oleg Fomenko</strong><br />
So open your iPhone or Android open apps or Google Play and just type Sweat. The top is going to be a Sweat when we have nearly 200 million installs. We deserve that top spot. Install the app and if you want to play crypto game then on the main screen just see a banner that says walk into crypto, follow prompts and you will end up having your crypto account and you will install Sweat wallet that will effectively manage your Sweat. That&#8217;s it. On Telegram we are @SweatEconomy. On Twitter we are @SweatEconomy. On Discord we are Sweat Economy.

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are Buzzing, as always, and I am super pumped to have the one and only Don Norbury on the show today, head of studio at SHRAPNEL, a AAA first-person extraction shooter with a creator ecosystem that empowers players to own their creations and shape the future of the game. From the genre-defining franchises of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Bioshock, Sunset Overdrive, and Crackdown to the sports superstars Madden, NFL, and NASCAR, Don has redefined creative boundaries across platforms and player experience for more than 16 years. Prior to joining SHRAPNEL, he held senior positions at companies such as HBO, Microsoft, and Electronic Arts, also known as EA. What a friggin&#8217; bio. Can&#8217;t wait to get into this one. Don, welcome to the show, my friend. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Matt, thank you. I&#8217;m doing great.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pump to have you on man. That is an absolutely wild bio right there. Someone who has played a multitude of the games that I just read off, and obviously, companies like HBO, Microsoft, and EA, I don&#8217;t think anyone on the planet who has an internet connection isn&#8217;t aware of those three companies. Super Pump to have you on. Can&#8217;t wait to get into this. Let&#8217;s go right back to square one before we get into some of the gaming and nitty gritty. A lot of people would absolutely kill, literally kill, to have their feet in your shoes and to have worked on some of these incredible titles, worked with these incredible companies, worked in the gaming industry. Gaming is so frigging big right now. It&#8217;s not even funny. People have no clue how big it is and how much time it takes up, how much of our bandwidth it takes up. But before we get into you, present day, and SHRAPNEL and GameBridge, let&#8217;s get into little baby Don all the way up to present day, walk me through your childhood, your past. Some of the cool things you worked on, and then we&#8217;ll get into why you made the jump from very cushy positions in Web2, taking a massive risk, jumping into Web3. But the floor is yours. Let&#8217;s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, little baby Don grew up in New Jersey actually my family moved to Florida when we were young because my dad wanted to play golf all year round.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. I already love your dad. Your dad&#8217;s a man.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, that was the up and down the East Coast experience. Ended up going to college for computing at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, which was a great like first city, you know, at that point in your life on your own first city experience. Not sure if I&#8217;d ever go back to live there. Ended up there for about seven years for a couple of years after graduating, just working there. And then landed my first game industry gig at Electronic Arts Tiberon, EA Tiberon, which of course is the studio that makes Madden at that time made NASCAR, worked on Tiger Woods and NCAA, worked on a title called NFL Head Coach. There was more like franchise management than it was that like, you know, you couldn&#8217;t play it. Like you could Madden, you couldn&#8217;t kind of like pick a player. So that was a great place to, you know, get my first launch off experience because you&#8217;re in a studio that not only is just pumping out hits like annual title after title, but because of that cadence of it, you go through this very compressed production experience. Right? You are guaranteed if you go there in your first couple of years, touching a whole bunch of titles, some of them completely from beginning to end because the design production, like shutting it down, shipping it has to happen in this very specific window. For that, it was great for me. They like head hunted me because I made a like a Neverwinter Nights mod, basically, back in, you know, I&#8217;m pretty old. Back in that day, Neverwinter Nights, like the original game, not the MMO that came out, had a great tool set and you could build your own campaign for it. So I did that and it kind of attracted their attention, you know, along with my kind of computing background and that&#8217;s what kicked me off in the game industry. And then it was the kind of tour de coasts, I suppose. After that, I went to LucasArts, now it&#8217;s called Lucasfilm Games, but LucasArts at the time worked on Star Wars and Indiana Jones and then to Boston where I worked at Irrational Games. I was the like team member number seven or something like that, six maybe, on the team that made Bioshock Infinite. So at the time, most of the studio was doing like DLC or something for the original Bioshock and we were kind of setting the architecture and the project and the team and everything that would eventually become the full, you know, Bioshock Infinite team. Then went back to coast again to Microsoft. So that&#8217;s when I ended up in Seattle, Xbox was like global publishing for six years. It was just great. It&#8217;s great like altitude change. Had spent so long building products and studios and teams and everything. And when you do publishing, you&#8217;re kind of over a large portfolio. You&#8217;re involved in the business decisions like having to look at the marketing and the biz dev and pitches and where things fit together. And for a place like Xbox also, like what the platform and company initiatives are and how you can orchestrate them into the titles that you&#8217;re making. So there I worked on a ton, you know, like Quantum Break, Ryse: Son of Rome, Age of Empires, like that stuff was a lead for Sunset Overdrive and a lead for Crackdown 3. And then after that went to HBO, where I met all the founders that we eventually created Neon, which is the company that we built in order to make SHRAPNEL. What was HBO we focused on, it was both publishing. So we did like Westworld and Game of Thrones publishing, but it was also R&amp;D, you know, HBO had this pedigree of just like entertainment technology being at the cutting edge of it. And we did a ton, you know, volumetric video, voice synthesis or like how we could use AI and voice fonts to put it in games so that you could more easily, right? Like have strong narratives and just not have to like do VO repeatedly again and again as you change like a script or something. So that sort of stuff we also did a ton of while over there. And I think that background and that kind of like who we are is what led us into blockchain gaming as well. Or like this is the nascent technology. There&#8217;s so much opportunity here. You know, this is, I always use the analogy of blockchain to me is like what TCPIP is for the internet. Like it&#8217;s this underlying protocol that enables something. Consumers don&#8217;t care. They just care about what they can do. They don&#8217;t care about TCPIP. They care about using Instagram or something like that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
They don&#8217;t care about the back end, they care about with the front end. What&#8217;s it for them? They don&#8217;t give a shit what is behind the scenes, what kind of engines in the car. As long as the car&#8217;s running and it&#8217;s fun to drive, that&#8217;s all that matters. That&#8217;s all it is.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
That kind of takes us to the present about two years ago. We kicked off SHRAPNEL in earnest as a project and started building the team and the architecture underneath and the game. And of course it&#8217;s like looking back, we feel so naive, like that we were so naive at the beginning and it&#8217;s become much more sophisticated and mature now on how we do that, you know, from an operational perspective as well as like the shape of the game design and what we&#8217;re actually building.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Such a good story. I mean heck we could not even talk about SHRAPNEL or GameBridge and probably chat for 10 hours here But we will get into that in a bit, but I do want to talk about your past just a bit more before we get into the Web3 stuff here I would love if you could just take it not a huge deep dive maybe just give a high-level overview on the differences of creating sort of games that have IP from shows like a Game of Thrones or like a Star Wars or Indiana Jones versus a Madden Just a sort of to set the lay the land for the listeners here. I&#8217;m a big sports guy I always dabbled played a little bit of the you know the Star Wars and the Game of Thrones not came through once but games like the Star Wars and Indiana Jones But when it came to the sports games, you know, I always played FIFA I always played Madden I always played NHL and it&#8217;s pretty much same but different very similar game. You&#8217;re adding a couple new things every year. You&#8217;re the biggest real changes is who gets traded to what team, right? I feel like you know graphics get a little better sounds get a little more vibrant. But how do you go about creating a game of thrones or a Star Wars. Like that&#8217;s wild. I love if you could just walk us through the process of how that happens from like, okay. We&#8217;re gonna create this game to actually shipping the game. And I know this is probably a four-hour question, but if you can just tell it into a couple minutes It&#8217;ll be lovely.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I&#8217;ll do my best. All of them have their own sets of constraints. I was to say, you know, SHRAPNEL is a title where we got to do all the world building and inception on our own.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah. You got a blank slate there. Yeah. Which I feel like is like sometimes easier, but sometimes harder, right?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
It can be paralyzing. We have a great set of people. We&#8217;re great at it here in terms of going from the blue sky to refining what it&#8217;s gonna be. Everyone&#8217;s kind of no ego. So we&#8217;re great at throwing shitty ideas out, like throwing bad ideas out, having them shot down, finding the next best thing. We&#8217;ll do that repeatedly until you have something where everyone can resonate with it. But that is a completely separate problem. To address your original question, it&#8217;s different with every license, with every franchise that you&#8217;re gonna interact with. So with a Hollywood franchise, you talk about something like Game of Thrones or Westworld, those were very much in development at the same time. So you have a show runner in the case of a show. And if that&#8217;s happening at the same time, that&#8217;s actually the most difficult example because making creative stuff is hard. And you&#8217;re always trying to de-risk everything. There&#8217;s so many places it can not happen and not launch along the way that you&#8217;re always just in this protection mode. And that applies to not just the show runners, but also the financing around shows. So they&#8217;re always trying to protect the show runners and everything from people like us who are gonna come in and make a game that maybe has conflicting storylines or conflicting plot elements. And they&#8217;re like, can&#8217;t do that. Everything&#8217;s gotta fit in the show is the shining example. They&#8217;re not always like that, but it&#8217;s something you have to be aware of when you&#8217;re especially any like Hollywood IP. With Star Wars and Indiana Jones, those were established IPs where the majority of Lucasfilm&#8217;s revenue comes from licensing, right? So like they&#8217;re used to this entire landscape. It&#8217;s a well-oiled machine. And even though nowadays, like the majority of us are licensed to external studios to build something and this was an internal studio, they still treated it relatively the same, which is we&#8217;re licensing and that&#8217;s internally, you still have to come up with the plot elements, what&#8217;s the story gonna be? And then we kind of like verify and validate that that&#8217;s okay. It has to pass all those checks, but it&#8217;s still like, once you&#8217;ve laid out the story and the characters, that&#8217;s the main part of what the licensing is gonna care about up front. And then as you move through, it&#8217;s sort of just like a check and verification to make sure everyone&#8217;s on the same page. But that&#8217;s actually the easiest one is because it&#8217;s already established and their business model is very much based on licensing anyway. Madden, as he brought up interesting, it was the first game I worked on in 2005. So it was Madden 2006. It&#8217;s very interesting because the sport changes too, right? And the NFL license is non-trivial. And I would say the amount of scrutiny and critique that they put on a game like Madden is actually extremely high. So perfect example, because it&#8217;s a brand image. It&#8217;s a premium brand image. You can have the same thing if you do like Formula One, right? Like there&#8217;s hundreds of millions of dollars behind this. They care a lot about the correct tone and the message in the brand. So the perfect example for that first iteration that I did, the first shipped game, horse collar tackles were made illegal that year, right? They banned them because it would injure, yeah, it would injure people&#8217;s knees, right? Most people think it was like a neck thing, but it was actually like a leg thing, right? We had to go in and modify the game so that there was no, because you have all these animations that trigger for various reasons to go in and remove horse collar tackles from the game, which is a non-trivial operation, right? You have decades of the game being built. There&#8217;s all sorts of code and data. Has some of it&#8217;s not named properly. And yeah, so you gotta go through and then the test team has to be like, oh, you missed one or this is causing some bug. And that&#8217;s an example of that same level of like ongoing scrutiny and quality. It definitely happens with something like Madden.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool. Last sort of, you know, old Web2 gaming related question, then we&#8217;ll get into Web3 stuff. Nowadays, it&#8217;s such a phenomenon for every sports game. I guess even FIFA 2, which is probably the, I assume the most popular sports game on the planet, but you have every single NFL player now, they get asked about the ratings and they go, do you believe that this is fair for your speed, your overall, your tackling, your jumping, your juke. Did the players give a shit back then? Or did we just not see it because of social media? Like, did you have players writing you guys and being like, don&#8217;t give your head a shake? Like I&#8217;m not an 85. I&#8217;m a 91 speed because I love that shit. I think that&#8217;s great. I think it&#8217;d be so cool to like be yourself in a game.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I would say some players care and some don&#8217;t, but they definitely carried back then. I&#8217;m glad I was not the person. I knew, you know, it was good friends with the designers that actually had to do that tuning and make those calls. I&#8217;m glad I was not that person.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so funny. Let&#8217;s jump into SHRAPNEL here. And again, I&#8217;m going to ask you some more question regards to creating a game, but you guys, and my apologies if I&#8217;m incorrect here, but it appears that you guys built this baby from scratch. And again, you guys are all very experienced game builders, developers, not just a couple lads, we&#8217;re like, hey, we&#8217;re going to make a game. You guys are literally world class. You guys are the best in the biz at this. Walk me through the like day one to shipping, because again, this is I&#8217;ve been fortunate to work with a couple companies. Who have shipped and are currently shipping games, more specifically mobile Web3 games. And I was in awe because I come from a marketing and sales background. I&#8217;m the guy you can help you, you know, get this in front of eyeballs and ears. But building it, I have no friggin clue what to do. And now I have a little bit of an idea and I am beyond baffled. It is absolute banana lands, the amount of work that goes into it, the size of the team that goes into it, the amount of hours, the iterations. And that&#8217;s just on like the building. Then there&#8217;s the creative side where it&#8217;s like, how does the guy or the gal wake up in the morning? The team of guys and gals wake up and think, we&#8217;re going to take this wacky dream like fairy tale story in my head and make this playable and visible and something you can hear. To me, it&#8217;s just as someone who&#8217;s not on the creative side, more of an athlete on the creative. I always think there&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re one or the other in life. This is so far in my wheelhouse and I&#8217;d love Don, if you could give us the lay of the land and talk about sort of the journey from day one to present day, because that I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s absolutely craziness.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, you&#8217;re absolutely right. It&#8217;s difficult. And we&#8217;re in like mid production right now, right? We have about 70 people internally and probably another 70 to 100. They were like external contracts, which is typical shape of the industry right now. That&#8217;s actually, you know, I&#8217;d consider us a, on the small to medium size studio really. Like, you know, once you get to your grand theft auto land or something like that, you&#8217;ve got 250 people internally, maybe more, you know, working on something. So it is, and it&#8217;s always a miracle that anything gets made. And it&#8217;s very difficult to keep people pointed at the correct North Star. I mean, it&#8217;s one of the reasons we have an in-person studio. You can see it historically in the industry during the pandemic, the reason so many games missed or like missed by a lot or just straight up canceled. There are not just inefficiencies, but it just straight up difficulties of getting everyone on the same page when you&#8217;re not in person.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s such a good point, such a good point.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
So, yeah, building a new IP, a new world building, you know, no good of story, nascent technology, new business model, like all of these things come together to increase the complexity of a already quite difficult process. The day one for this type of project, and they&#8217;re all different, right? If you look at like a $60 single player game like out of war or something, the creative process is gonna be a little different. The production process is gonna be different. For us, we&#8217;re taking much more of a like ship early unfinished early access style of things, get people involved way earlier. We felt it was kind of one of the things that attracted us like culturally on the Web3 side versus what people expect on the Web2. And I would say a lot of the people in that kind of like degen and gamer overlap tend to be more educated about how long good game production process is. So there&#8217;s a lot of voices that will come in and be very realistic. They&#8217;re like, dude, games take a really long time to make. Like you gotta be patient with the team, you expect like, you know, the impossible things basically from a timeline perspective for them to deliver. So we always appreciate those people who are kind of like doing it at the community level. But at the same time, we try and be as transparent as possible. So from the very beginning, when we kind of laid out at least for this project, we had the idea for a long time about just creator ecosystems. It was a creator ecosystems. And at the same time we thought extraction games were gonna be kind of the next evergreen design space in the same way Battle Royale had provided a construct for a lot of different games leading up to that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Sorry to interrupt here. Can you talk more about extraction games and exactly what they are and why they&#8217;re so powerful?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
For sure, you know, there&#8217;s a couple pieces and there&#8217;s different styles of extraction games. All of them involve having to get stuff out in some way or another, right? Some are a little softer where, example of the Dark Zone from the division. And actually one of our advisors, a guy named Terry Spear who created the division, who&#8217;s creative director for the division in Dark Zone. It was part of like in our early stages, how we were doing the game design was very much with him. That is the softest version where you don&#8217;t really lose anything, but you kind of go in and you try to get stuff. And if you die before you get it out, you lose just the stuff you&#8217;re trying to get out. And then you have the more hardcore version, which is like escape from Tarkov, which is closer to what SHRAPNEL is, where the stuff you bring in is at risk. It&#8217;s a lose your loadout game, right? So you&#8217;re always thinking about that risk reward that you want to take. Now, granted, we&#8217;ve done a lot of design work to say, like we always have the mantra, like we want people bringing in their dopest gear every time. We don&#8217;t want you to not want to bring in your stuff because you&#8217;re afraid of losing it. And a lot of it has to do with all of the other stuff that&#8217;s like much higher value, that&#8217;s the stuff that you really care way more about. And that stuff you can&#8217;t lose, at least in the like the default game mode, you can&#8217;t lose, but the weapons and equipment and everything that you have on your loadout, you can totally lose. That said, you can take it from somebody else as well. And there&#8217;s a bunch of high value stuff. Over the course of this session, the value actually increases of the stuff in the session. So you want to incentivize people to stay in longer and longer, but there&#8217;s multiple, and some people are gonna just like YOLO to the end. Some people are gonna be very careful. They&#8217;re going around the edges. And then we have multiple extraction moments to they&#8217;ll be getting out in an earlier extraction. While the wolves go after like later and later game stuff. You know, that&#8217;s kind of the like framework and context for at least SHRAPNEL as an extraction game. Is this like come in with your stuff, high stakes, treasure hunting, as you know, the studio pillar that we put against it. That was, you know, the beginnings that we knew we wanted to explore in that space, making a game like that. We knew user creation was also something important to us. And it&#8217;s a lot of it because like we&#8217;ve all, you know, I&#8217;ve been making games. I know you said 16 years at the beginning, I think it&#8217;s like 18 now. And we get a close to 20 years in gaming. Our CEO is getting closer to 30 years in gaming. And what a lot of us got our starts, like I was saying, getting hired for Madden, got our starts modding games, like creating our own stuff with tool sets and existing franchises that were out there and allowed us to do it. So we always have this like nostalgia factor against it. And it&#8217;s been great to see things like Minecraft, Roblox, you know, the creator mode for Fortnite. So we always wanted to do that. But we wanted like the aged out version. A lot of it&#8217;s in the kind of play pen sandbox child space. We&#8217;re not making a Sandbox. We&#8217;re making a fairly like serious themed, like adult level of, you know, of like fiction and intrigue. We didn&#8217;t want it to be a place where anybody can do anything that they want. We wanted to be like an intriguing universe where they could put their brand on it and create stuff that other people could experience. It&#8217;s a different shape than like a game like sandbox or something like Roblox, but we knew it was important. So when we came to the blockchain, started getting requests for advisement in blockchain for our game expertise, that&#8217;s where we kind of made the connection, started, you know, jumping as far down the rabbit hole as humanly possible. And it took us about six weeks. You know, we were start up at the time so you can dedicate time on the team to kind of go away, make your own conclusions about things, research things. I was very much in the tech side at the time. So it was like baby&#8217;s first solidity contract and looking at the landscape, the like technical landscape of what was available, what the L1s were, what the scalability solutions, et cetera, and came back and I was like, this is not if, this is when. And the gaming landscape is not that great right now. It&#8217;s especially in the time it&#8217;s getting better and better, but at the time we&#8217;re like, this is a blue ocean. Like we should take our expertise as game developers, make a really fun game and realize this kind of like vision that we think is the future of legitimate digital ownership, transportability, you know, interoperability and go as far as we can to add all of that additional agency to the digital, you know, assets that people have. And that&#8217;s, you know, that analogy of like the TCPIP, like we very quickly saw blockchain as just the thing that enabled these other things that we wanted to do. From that point on, it was kind of your typical like create enough of a design, start like going around pitching and trying to effectively get seed to get the actual company started. And that&#8217;s what took us to two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
You guys did all this before you got the first fund. For you got the first raise.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Design perspective. Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Wow, I guess I didn&#8217;t my apologies. I did my research wrong. I thought this was like idea right away, boom. And then darn, that&#8217;s impressive. I mean, I guess with your guys background, I mean, I&#8217;m sure it was probably difficult, but I guess with your guys background though, like, you know, that definitely gets you in the door. It must have.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure. I mean, our team, we have a very strong team and all the people we&#8217;ve hired are really strong too. I think I&#8217;ve worked on projects previously with like half the people at the studio and because we&#8217;re in-person studio, it was this like perfect personality filter of people who are at a right place in their career. So we ended up with a lot of veterans. Yeah, who are just like, yeah, that sounds like, you know, we were refined enough even though I was saying like, we were pretty naive at the beginning. It was refined enough to attract some very talented people to the studio, which just, it took our aspirations and kept making them higher and higher of what we were gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. Don you are on an absolute roll. We got to take a quick break and give a massive shout out to our sponsor of the show that&#8217;s PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we&#8217;re going to keep buzzing on the one and only SHRAPNEL and we&#8217;ll get into GameBridge as well and talk more about AAA games, blockchain games and some of the similarities and some of the things that make games go absolutely parabolic. Nowadays, one of the things that interests me the most is streaming and how you must create a game that is somewhat streamable. And we will get into that as well. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT. We love these guys, longtime friends of cryptonews.com, longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Now back to the show with Don. Don before we get into GameBridge and a couple other of the super fun things, I want to talk about streaming. It is absolutely blowing up. You have these 12 year olds to 23, 24 year old men and women, boys and girls who are literally making eight figures a year, eight frigging figures. And all they do is stream video games. It&#8217;s absolutely wild. I&#8217;m 28 years old. I never watched any of this stuff when I was a kid. Obviously now I don&#8217;t, but again, I have tuned into all of them. I need to because this is the field I&#8217;m in and it would be nonsensical for me to not know what makes the good ones good and what makes the bad ones bad. But it seems like the Gem Zers are absolutely hooked on everything streaming related. Instead of, you know, like you and I, when we were young, playing games or doing whatever at these kids still play games, but they just watch streams all day long, 24/7, walk me through the importance of streaming present day and why it&#8217;s so paramount for building a game to have easy streamability options for not just the gamers, but the viewers as well.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, I would say it&#8217;s not just streaming its social reach period as compared to like traditional media, right? But certainly streaming and the personalities kind of represented therein are a huge, you know, a huge place. Just it&#8217;s as much entertainment as anything, right? People find the types of personalities, like taste making that those people have. And then they become like super attracted to that person. And instead of just being a show that they can watch for 30 minutes or an hour or whatever, it&#8217;s this like constant connection that they have, you know, a human who has a ton of people following them. It makes perfect sense in the current landscape of like social connectivity. But this is the human video connection that people like look to and rely upon. There&#8217;s a kind of air of more genuineness to it as well, right? And especially in the Web3 space, I would say, it&#8217;s really important to the point where you almost see, we always feel like traditional celebrities are like a huge red flag in Web3, where it&#8217;s like everyone&#8217;s skeptical, meaning like, why is he snooping? Right? So they want to see the people they trust and have a connection with. And certainly in Web2, like gaming, it has become the thing. I think the other part for the streaming portion as well is it&#8217;s the best way. If you don&#8217;t know if you want to play a game or buy a game or whatever, it&#8217;s this really easy shortcut. This is how I use it most formally. Like I don&#8217;t have standard personalities that I follow from a streaming perspective either. I&#8217;m aware of all of them. And we certainly have, and they&#8217;ll speak to it in a second, like our approach with streamers. But I will go to people like streaming games to see like real legitimate gameplay. Not just see like commercialized imagery and video. I want to see them playing the boring part and dying. That is the very obvious reason it is the heaviest part of the actual, like not just marketing, but awareness and how you get people into the kind of like social network of a game. Myth is probably our biggest streamer that we&#8217;re associated with now that we have a partnership with. He&#8217;s a great one, at least in the U.S. because he has a kind of insatiable curiosity. When he&#8217;s come to the studio, he actually spend like hours with our designers just sitting in the editor. Like how does this work? How do I tune this? Like why does this feel the way this feels? So it&#8217;ll actually like get into the game making side of it as well as just playing and giving feedback. Yeah. So you don&#8217;t always see that in streamer and influencer. A lot of times it&#8217;s like very transactional. He&#8217;s been an absolute delight partnership. But we definitely see our approach of those types of people and the best sorts of personalities to just create awareness and to have people understand who we are and what we&#8217;re building. As well as the like micro streamers as well who are like looking to build their audience and have franchises they&#8217;re associated with. They represent also a really great opportunity for win-win on both sides of the line. We&#8217;re including that in kind of our marketing approach as well. So yeah, we think that mixed with the other kind of social networks is the way to go. Nowadays, it almost feels like your traditional gaming media is following behind. They&#8217;re like reporting on streamers or on social as opposed to leading it. Right? The traditional media is a good indicator of how you&#8217;re performing on these kind of front-running networks but not really like where you go anymore to try. You&#8217;re not like chasing reporters anymore to try and get some sort of article. It&#8217;s just going to happen once you get enough momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And it&#8217;s crazy how lucky you can get to. Like all it takes is like one, you know, I show speed or one of those guys who literally like find your game on whatever gaming platform you&#8217;re on and like literally the rest is history. Like you can go from five figures in revenue to seven figures overnight. It is that easy. And again, that&#8217;s the power of the internet. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
And it&#8217;s global too, like as important, heavy weighted and popular as it is in the United States and Europe, if you go to the Middle East, they have streamers who have tens of millions of followers, like 30 million followers, right? Like we don&#8217;t have anything close to that caliber in kind of the West. So, you know, that&#8217;s a more untapped region, I guess in this space, but like the avenue is there to immediately have tens of millions of people who know about your franchise or kind of like buying into it and becoming the players within that ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Crazy how it works. Let&#8217;s get into GameBridge here. You guys recently launched GameBridge, which is an advanced and versatile Web3 game developer platform. So friggin important. So Paramount for, not your guys success, but Paramount for, just Web3 as a whole. We need, you can&#8217;t build good shit without having highly talented, motivated world-class people on board. And if they are building things in which, in the fashion that is just a complete nuisance for them, it&#8217;s not fun. There&#8217;s too much friction and it&#8217;s just bullshit city, which is, you know, what it is a lot of the time right now. It ain&#8217;t going to work. And that&#8217;s why it ain&#8217;t working right now. So there&#8217;s a lot of incredible companies like you guys who are launching incredible products like GameBridge that allow Web2 developers to come to Web3 and actually move the needle makes shit happen. Was this a no brainer for you and the team? Why did you guys decide to launch this?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
I wouldn&#8217;t say it was a no-brainer from the beginning, that it would be something that we formalized the way that we ended up. In hindsight, it was an inevitability, especially with the kind of technical prowess that we have on the blockchain side here. There&#8217;s a couple of dimensions I always like to talk about here. One is, Web3 as an industry to us always felt over-weighted on infrastructure and underweighted on product. So for us, we were always 100% focused on product and what&#8217;s required to deliver trap, right? And there&#8217;s so many infrastructure companies who are building these services, but they aren&#8217;t doing it with their own product. So you end up with these tons of infrastructure seeking a very like, you know, a thin layer of products that are actually trying to make something. So we took the, it&#8217;s kind of the unreal, Epic made Unreal Engine to make Unreal Tournament. And it was just required to make the product that like we built GameBridge to make SHRAPNEL. And in doing so, kind of formalized an architecture that allowed our game team who know, you know, enough about blockchain to be dangerous, but mostly to themselves and the people around them. But you don&#8217;t, you know, they&#8217;re not like writing our smart contracts or doing any of the operational side. So our, we call it the Nexus team. It&#8217;s effectively our platform team. It&#8217;s very much, you know, taking the requirements from the game team and building the platform that&#8217;s required to support them. And as a result, built this sort of partnership, agnostic game architecting platform. And it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re building it for a game. It really the pattern and the architecture that it is could go way beyond games. It&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s a lot of existing services in the way things are glued together that enable games very easily out of the gate. But the pattern allows you to pick whatever partners you want. And when I say partners, I mean, like what L1 do you want to run your production chain? Or like what, you know, how do you want the actual like chain side and consensus mechanism to work? Who are your wallet solutions, right? Like these sorts of things that everyone has a different set of constraints and partnerships and trade-offs. We built it. So those things are, you can snap in and out. And still the game team can then just focus making game. We need, you know, inventory systems and cataloging and like this style of monetization and how the marketplace works on yada yada. They can just do that in a way that game developers are familiar with. And at that resulted in GameBridge. And we&#8217;ve got a number, large number of studios at also different sizes and calibers looking to utilize it. So we&#8217;re kind of teaming up those conversations right now. Want to do it at a responsible, like onboard people in a responsible way. Cause it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re still shipping SHRAPNEL, right? Exactly. You want to have that maturity of the product or else everyone&#8217;s going to go through the same pains that we are internally making sure our product works the correct way.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Don, this is an absolute treat. We are getting a little tight for time here. One last thing that I would absolutely love to discuss is, and again, this is a thesis of yours that you&#8217;ve discussed in the past, is how blockchain can be included as not so much sort of the forefront in the main piece, but an optional sort of additional element of AAA games, right? Where it&#8217;s like you have incredible teams like yours who are still building AAA games, but the blockchain tech isn&#8217;t front and center. It&#8217;s not, hey guys, come play our blockchain game. It&#8217;s come play our kickass almost Web2-ish, not almost Web2-ish, AAA game that looks and feels like a Web2 game that is actually built on blockchain tech. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about the importance of that and why that&#8217;s needed to enable things like true community participation. Gives it the ownership of course, the interoperability and how it really is the future of gaming as a whole</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure. And I think really the part that is required is for mass adoption because it&#8217;s a thin slice of people that are willing to go through the friction and the trial and error when you have technophile adoption. That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re talking about. But that said, GameFi and interoperability, transportability is why we&#8217;re doing what we&#8217;re doing. So like that part can&#8217;t get lost in the process either, right? So even though when you jump into SHRAPNEL, there&#8217;s no blockchain familiar terminology, right? We don&#8217;t have NFTs, we have whatever they are. We have skins, we have like an M4 or our variation of that like, you know, weapon itemization. Like we have those things and that&#8217;s just what they are. They&#8217;re not NFTs. I mean, they are in the smart contracts behind scenes, but that&#8217;s not like what you see. You don&#8217;t need to link a, you know, a self custody wallet. We have custodial wallet behind the account service behind the scenes. It&#8217;s handling everything for you in a familiar way that you would in any other game. That said, you can link your non-custodial wallet, your self custody wallet. You can transfer items into that. You can, you know, bridge, you know, whether it&#8217;s shrap itself or the items that are on the platform that you own onto other ecosystems. So that capability is still there. And it&#8217;s an important part of the cohorts that will come to SHRAPNEL and that are already coming to SHRAPNEL. But if you&#8217;re gonna have, you know, a million concurrency, you need like the wider gaming audience to come to the title and not have to feel like they need to learn or know anything that&#8217;s not in their, they&#8217;re like familiar space. So really it&#8217;s like, hey, that thing that you have is actually yours and you can trade it or equip it and you slowly show people the things they can do that they maybe weren&#8217;t as familiar with unless they&#8217;re like trading on the gray market for Counter-Strike or something like that, right? It&#8217;s sort of like showing, just showing them the affordances that they have now. And then they&#8217;ll get more deeply, some of them will get more deeply into what it really means to have like blockchain back digital assets, what the other marketplaces are, what other games are like interoperable with SHRAPNEL itemization. So that&#8217;s kind of like our approach of how you blend those two crowds. And the other part of that as well is working with other games and platforms to make sure our stuff actually works. Cause that&#8217;s a floating tides, like this all boats sort of thing. Whereas if you look at some of the more cynical game developers, like why would I do the work to support like somebody else&#8217;s stuff in my title? For me, the answer is obvious, which is it is a acquisition funnel, right? You&#8217;re now have a shared community. Like they can take your stuff and go there. It will come from those other platforms into your game because now they have stuff that works everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Don&#8217;t get greedy if you think your product is good enough. Just like for a lack of better terms, it&#8217;s one big circle jerk. Again, I hate the term, but like it&#8217;s one of the best ways to describe it. Everyone scratches each other&#8217;s back in a little way. And if your product is good enough, you&#8217;re going to be able to take that person&#8217;s attention. And that&#8217;s all the gaming industry is. We love an attention economy now. If you build a good enough game and Game X Y or Z is willing to share the sense that, hey, I&#8217;m going to give you my person and I get your person. And it&#8217;s not a matter of, oh, and if they like my game better than yours, they&#8217;re only going to play. No, it&#8217;s now they can play two different games. And you should feel grateful that, you know, you got to embark on that kind of partnership. I don&#8217;t get why people don&#8217;t mess with that. It makes no sense to me. It&#8217;s so close-minded.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Traditionally very zero sum approach to it. And I think you look at that, I love the way you&#8217;re putting it. It&#8217;s exactly the right mindset, which is if your game not good enough, or they just wanna play some other game, they&#8217;re gonna do that no matter what. Well, make everything easier and better and more valuable for them, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, Don, what an episode, man. I know we barely scratched the surface with the rate you guys are moving at. Gotta have you on for round two and round three, but this has been an absolute treat. Thank you so much for coming on. Really glad that we got to make this happen and would love to meet you in person one day. But until then, please let our listeners know where they can find you and SHRAPNEL online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, you can find us on the web at shrapnel.com, on Twitter at @playSHRAPNEL. And either of those, you can find our Discord. We have a lively Discord community. And we&#8217;re actually selling extraction packs right now that are basically, we&#8217;re doing kind of an early access rollout of the game. So they get you into the early access and give you a bunch of stuff, some of it cosmetic, some of it more useful equipment. So we&#8217;re launching that basically right now. So there&#8217;s a lot going on from now, really, to the end of the year. There&#8217;s no better time to take a look at what we&#8217;re doing and get involved, be able to get in and shoot people in the face and have a bunch of fun really soon.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And what about yourself? You gotta plug yourself here too.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Oh, I&#8217;m @DonNorbury on Twitter. I keep it real simple. You can always, you know, if you&#8217;re in the industry, you&#8217;re looking for, have a chat around game development or Web3 stuff. You can find me on LinkedIn, same name and same handle.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And last thing, bar behind you looks like a pretty speed bar. What&#8217;s Don&#8217;s go to cocktail?</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question. Probably the last word is my standard go to. So that&#8217;s equal parts, gin, maraschino liqueur, green shark truss and lime juice. That&#8217;s like a good&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s called the last word.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
The last word.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve never heard of that. I&#8217;m writing this down. Interesting. Okay, good to know.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, highly recommended. You know, it&#8217;s not complicated. It&#8217;s actually each cool proportions of each. So it&#8217;s mostly like how good is your lime juice? Like how good the limes that you bought, that&#8217;s gonna like define it. But any self respecting bar as well, you can walk into and ask and you&#8217;ll know. If they can&#8217;t make that, they&#8217;re not a self respecting bar.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I got a couple good spots in Mexico that I&#8217;d go to for a nice drink, not like the local watering hole because I mean, it&#8217;s strictly pretty much a beer in Tequila. But we&#8217;ll go to the Hyatt and shout out to Hyatt. Love the Hyatt. We&#8217;ll go to the Hyatt. They got a great bartender there and I&#8217;ll get him to make me one of those. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
There&#8217;s a version that uses mescal, I think instead of gin.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love mescal too. Love that. Don, what an episode. Appreciate you coming on, man. Can&#8217;t wait for round two. And, yeah, truly solid, wishing you and the team all the best. Can&#8217;t wait to play the game, and we&#8217;ll talk soon.</p>
<p><strong>Don Norbury</strong><br />
Thank you, Matt. It was a pleasure being here. I appreciate the invitation introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Folks what an episode with Don Norbury, head of studio at SHRAPNEL, he was dropping knowledge bombs left right and center if you guys are a fan of gaming and I&#8217;m sure you are this one was an absolute treat huge shout out to Don and the team for making this happen.

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, and I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, Ryan Gill, CEO of Crucible Network, also the founder and CEO of Open Meta. Ryan is a pioneer of the Open Metaverse movement, and he is the founder and CEO of Crucible Network, an enterprise offering easy onramps for developers to leverage Web3 tech, as well as a founding member of the Open Meta DAO. An organization supporting the delivery of products, experiences, services, best practices and tools underpinning the emergence of an Open Metaverse. I love this, as we need more of this shit in Web3. Ryan stands out as a visionary, leader and entrepreneur, and has been moving the first industry figures to promote the term Open Metaverse. Ryan, super pumped to have you on. How you doing, mate? Welcome to the show. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Thanks Matt. Glad we made this happen. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />I know it&#8217;s been a hot minute, pumped to have you on. Folks, we are recording on Monday, October 16th, and this episode is going to air a week today on Monday, October 23rd. But as we are recording, it is bright and early in the morning for myself. Ryan is across the pond in beautiful London. And we just had a crazy Bitcoin candle, not one of those red ones, one of those nice, fat, tall green ones. And everyone thought it was Bitcoin ETF approval. BlackRock is going to be dancing. Everyone&#8217;s so pumped. It ripped 7% in about four seconds. The Team at Cryptonews was doing our due diligence, looking around. Is the source legit? Cointelegraph, you should never shout it a competitor, but Cointelegraph, you can fire it out in articles saying it was true. And this is not true. How crazy is this? 2023, the fake news is still producing 7% candles. How freaking crazy is this? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I mean, fake news has been peaking all week, right? So I think this information is part of where we&#8217;re at now. I think it does reinforce how emotional all this is, right? And certainly can&#8217;t write off the fact that maybe these leaks are intentional, but yeah, at this point right now, they&#8217;re unverified. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Isn&#8217;t it wild though? Like 7%. And again, we&#8217;re not talking 7% on fake news for a shit coin. We&#8217;re talking 7% on the creme de la creme of all cryptos, the big bad boy Bitcoin itself. I can&#8217;t believe this is still happening. And again, I guess my follow up to that is, do you think there&#8217;s any warrant? Do you think this is a precursor to this actually happening? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I mean, I think the next chapter is ETFs, right? There&#8217;s not just this BlackRock one, the iShares one, but like multiple. And for sure, the next market swinging up will be catalyzed by ETFs, by institutional buy-in and adoption and then all the way up to the halving. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />That&#8217;s what the industry needs right now. We need a little light at the end of the tunnel. But enough about Bitcoin. We are here to talk about you, Crucible, and of course, the Open Metaverse. But before we get into that, I&#8217;d love to learn a little bit more about yourself. Walk me through your past, walk me through childhood, all the way up to present day, why you got into crypto, and then we&#8217;ll get into the fun stuff here. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Sure, yeah. Growing up, I was sort of first musician, self-taught musician, made a lot of music, but decided I never really wanted to do anything career wise with it. And then through school, kind of got really into filmmaking. So first and foremost, a creative, but really kind of found my footing in the startup investor world, the venture capital world in LA, being a part of like the very first movements around the blockchain have been through three cycles now. So certainly have paid the dues and seen the patterns, but truthfully, I think my story is really about the fact that I dropped out of college, and sort of made a commitment to myself that from 20 to 30, it would be kind of my workshopping years. I would just try everything, and really not look at the receipts so much, but by 30 really be building. And Crucible is the culmination of those years, and my own personal thesis of what now is the Open Metaverse. I incorporated Crucible in 2018, so I was actually two years ahead of the game on that, but now six years in, really committed. And also very early, to imagine incorporating a company for the Open Metaverse in 2018, COVID maybe sped everything up, but 2018 for those two years, no one really knew what I was talking about. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Hold up, sort of interrupt there, Ryan. Before you move on there, what sort of ticked you off that the Open Metaverse would be a thing? Because again, doing that in 2018 is unheard of. That&#8217;s absolute banana lands. Was there a mentor or a talk or a workshop or was it just a culmination of everything you&#8217;ve learned? Being in the arena, I hate that quote, but love that quote. But you know what I mean? It&#8217;s like, how do you know that this would be a thing? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />I always have a gift, I think I have a gift of pattern recognition extrapolation. So seeing patterns and then sort of extrapolating those patterns forward. And so, I mean, I&#8217;ve always sort of said, you could drop me at any timeline in history and I&#8217;ll be focused on what&#8217;s coming next. This is kind of who I am. And I look at what&#8217;s coming next and how it solves problems, you know, for the current day. So innovation is just sort of, I think, where my experience, my expertise is. I&#8217;ve put 10, 15 years in focusing on a career around innovation, many different places from creative all the way through to technology. But I think the most sort of seminal period of my life was working directly with Peter Diamandis in that whole world of, you know, now it&#8217;s commonplace to talk about AI and automation because we&#8217;re living through it. But, you know, this is a group of people that was sort of the canary in the coal mine of trying to like tell people that this is coming and also shape and frame the opportunity that exists. And Peter was somebody that I always really looked up to with XPRIZE. I thought, you know, XPRIZE is such an important framework in the world. And if you really understand his story, he&#8217;s been a part of all the innovation that&#8217;s taken place. And so he actually brought me in as a head of Web3 for him in 2017, whereas the sort of like ICO token fail, bull market was happening, everything was being thrown at him and he didn&#8217;t know what to make sense of it all. So he wanted to come in and have somebody really take the responsibility of filtering all of that. And so him and I sort of worked directly for a while and I got through that to sort of peek around the corner of the future and meet the people that are building it, spending a lot of time with people like Philip Rosdale, but also meeting the founders of self-driving cars and self-flying cars and really just, you know, that William Gibson quote, I believe it&#8217;s William Gibson where he says like the future is already here. You know, it&#8217;s just that like people haven&#8217;t caught up and recognized that it is here yet. And so, you know, to me, innovation is not about predicting the future, it&#8217;s about recognizing where it&#8217;s happening today and then sort of that extrapolation. So that&#8217;s where I cut my teeth, that&#8217;s where the expertise is. And in that time, getting to be head of Web3 for somebody who&#8217;s so important to the space of innovation. I just shaped it. And then coming back to like my own mental model of saying, I&#8217;m gonna build my thing at 30, I was always trying to hone in on what that thesis was. What could I dedicate 30 to 40 to, you know, cause I kind of think in chapters of decades. So 20 to 30 was the workshopping, 30 to 40 now is the building. And I&#8217;m, you know, I&#8217;m gonna be 34 in a couple months. So we&#8217;re still in it. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Man, I love that. What a great start to the pod here. So many lessons. And again, just for the young folks listening, I&#8217;m 28 and couldn&#8217;t agree more with everything Ryan just said. When you&#8217;re in your 20s, like your tolerance for risk should be just stupendously high. Oh my God, there&#8217;s no reason. It&#8217;s with social media and everything else and just tech, it&#8217;s so easy to have a moonshot. But again, to get that moonshot, you gotta spend time in the arena, you gotta get your reps in, learn as much as possible in your 20s. Then I love that point. I wanna go back to pattern recognition one last time here, because that truly is a skill. And I know you said you have a gift for it. And I&#8217;m sure you do, but I also wholeheartedly believe that that is something that you can actually build. And again, it takes getting reps in. This might be a theme of the pod, getting reps and being in the arena. But, and I&#8217;m gonna throw a shitty question at you here, but how does one get good at that? Like, would that be the equivalent of a trader who, and again, all good traders I know, and there&#8217;s only a few of them. Everyone says they grow on trees, but they certainly do not. All good traders I know have a journal. And every night and every morning, they&#8217;re always journaling, not just the quantitative, but the qualitative, because the qual almost has more emphasis than the quant nowadays when it comes to trading. And we just use that example, because it&#8217;s, you know, it has a parallel to what we&#8217;re talking about here, but how does one become good at pattern recognition as a whole? Not an easy skill to learn, but one of the most valuable you can learn in the whole world. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />So, I mean, you mentioned I said gift and you said skill. I think there&#8217;s the talent versus skill argument, which happens a lot in athletics. Like there&#8217;s nobody who has natural talent that&#8217;ll outbeat somebody that works hard. Right? Now somebody who has natural talent who works hard is great. You know, you start to get into the realm of greatness. And in the sense of what we&#8217;re talking about, pattern recognition, more intellectual things than athletic, things I think first principles is probably the first place to start of being able to break things DAOn to their absolute fundamental and not getting caught up in the external or externalities of what other people are doing. Right? And I think clearly the ones won the games with that kind of thinking that sort of first principles thinking. So pattern recognition, I think starts in understanding the fundamentals. So, you know, studying mental models, understanding how to think in first principles is the foundational cornerstone to that. And then it&#8217;s really understanding how things progress and how they change. And certainly with the internet, how you could recognize patterns that you start to put into a narrative. Right? And to me, pattern recognition is storytelling. So I come back to my creative roots. And you know, it&#8217;s pattern recognition is being able to put the story together from all the data. And doing it with first principles is one where you can be sure it has fundamental value. It&#8217;s not caught up in whatever the next trend or fad is. And in the sense of what I do, pattern recognition is very much about we are through the prologue and maybe the first three episodes and what does it look like in season two? You know, just to come back again, I wanted to be a TV writer when I first moved to LA, a showrunner, but I still, I flexed that showrunner muscle as a founder. You know, this is just how I do it. And I don&#8217;t know that a lot of people relate to that, but it&#8217;s certainly how it works for me. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Any resources, books, blogs, podcasts, audio books that one can dive into to learn more about First Principles? I&#8217;m a big First Principles guy as well. I mean, I&#8217;ve done it shit ton. Again, you have Elon Musk, you have all the famous philosophers, you have the Socrats, and of course everyone else, the Tim Ferriss podcast when I was younger, learned a shit ton from him. Shout out to Tim Ferriss. But any good resources to learn from? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, Shane Parrish was always my secret weapon. Yeah, Farnam Street Blog. And he&#8217;s even published mental model books and stuff. It&#8217;s really difficult once you get into mental models, not to end up in game theory. And so also like, you know, game theory is where it starts to really matter. That&#8217;s where the stories actually get played out into potential outcomes, you know? But yeah, look, it all comes back DAOn to storytelling. I have come full circle back to this place where I really think that narrative is so important. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Yeah, well said. Also, we don&#8217;t do any free shoutouts on the pod, but huge shout out to Shane Parrish. Obviously, he&#8217;s had a big emphasis on Ryan and myself&#8217;s life as well. And he&#8217;s a good old Canadian boy, so we love to see that. And he just released a new book. I might even plug that at the end. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Volume 2, right? </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Yeah, he did. Just a new book. So huge shoutout. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />But also just to get really specific, it&#8217;s the Farnam Street blog, is the website. Yeah. And his podcast specifically, his podcast and the way that like, it&#8217;s all around learning how to learn. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />The knowledge project. Yeah. It&#8217;s phenomenal. Which is like folks, if you can learn how to learn, you&#8217;re unstoppable. You know what I mean? Like that&#8217;s just the learning is the skill. What a start, Ryan. I love this shit. Let&#8217;s get into crypto for a second here. Talk to me about Crucible and the Open Metaverse. And then we&#8217;ll break DAOn everything. We&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty. You said you started in 2018. Why did you feel that there was a need for an Open Metaverse way back when? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />So in innovation, especially around technology specifically, focusing on exponential growth and how things have ended up to that point, you go through the three acts of the internet, Web1, Web2, and Web3. And if you understand story structure, it&#8217;s in three acts. And it&#8217;s been very helpful for me to draw that parallel because the internet, Web1 was actually, if you read those papers, it&#8217;s very much about the end user, the individual. And it&#8217;s about technology protocols that could network to share information. And this was like so hugely revolutionary at the time. Great shout out is Lo and Behold, which is a Warner Hairsaw documentary. You really get to see that. And it was really about the end user and the individual. And it wasn&#8217;t a great business model. I mean, like you get like the million dollar homepage that started selling little pixels by brands that would advertise, but wasn&#8217;t purely about business. It was about information. It really important to recognize that. And then you had the dot com, which brought all the business, right? Even to the point that there was a huge bubble and people were selling things that weren&#8217;t actually there. But from that point, you can say Web2 was more about the shareholder than the end user. It was about these companies being built on these protocols and how dot coms became an actual way, a source of business engine of economics, right? And I would argue we&#8217;re still in Web2, right? Like it&#8217;s whether it got, it went into mobile, it went into apps, but it&#8217;s primarily still about these massive corporations built on the protocols. And we got tricked. I think most people slept walked into this, but these companies started giving the products away for free. And so everybody used them, not realizing that the business model is the fact that you&#8217;re the product and everything&#8217;s being sold on your back from that lens. I&#8217;ve had a lot of really important people that are friends of my life that I got to see really close up like Kaiser&#8217;s one of them. She was the whistleblower for Cambridge Analytica. And there&#8217;s been these incredibly seminal events that where everything we knew about what was happening in this space that I have been in, which is combination of innovation and Web3 kind of new tech, it&#8217;s punched through into the consciousness of the public. And that was definitely one of them. If you go watch the Great Hack, that&#8217;s a documentary all about her story on Netflix. But that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at as the same time as everything sort of centralized into these businesses. And the cracks have shown quite a lot in the sense of where data brokers are targeting you to just buy products that you may or may not need versus change the way your mind works and what you would vote for. And so my experience of just seeing all this happen, I&#8217;m understanding that Web3 is the third act where we can bring it back to the end user again. We can bring it back to the people. And yeah, some of those people may be shareholders or founders of businesses, but the scales need to be rebalanced in the sense that it&#8217;s not so focused just purely on shareholder value. If it&#8217;s just that, then we&#8217;ve peaked at centralization, I think from this point, it becomes more and more damage on our minds, on the environment, on all these things. So as most people probably know, in your audience, Bitcoin was a direct response from a market crash. And this community of people who started in Web1 and moved into privacy and now W3C and all of these, they never went away, right? And these are the people who are cryptographers, cipher punks, and that&#8217;s what this is about. This technology is about a new system of more decentralized capitalism that balances away from this sort of crony capitalism of just pure centralization. And the internet is the way it plays out. So for me, I just saw really quickly on one hand, gaming as a business is growing and swallowing everything up. And on the other hand, these things in the protocol levels and under the surface of it all is happening. And so I just saw like the metaverse, this science fiction concept that Neil Stevenson invented, it is the internet built by game developers. And so that easy definition was one, yeah, you can probably sense that I have a good grasp on language and being able to kind of put things into simple terms. And that&#8217;s been a lot of what the early years of Crucible is. It&#8217;s like the metaverse is the internet built by game developers. Okay, so now we know where we focus. We focus on game developers and the field of game development. And that&#8217;s basically what it was. And I think my time with Peter inspired that. And then me recognizing really early in 2017, Tim Sweeney&#8217;s vision and Epic Games and this game Fortnite that changed everything and started becoming this catch cow for him. But ultimately who Tim was, what he believed and him being an important character in this. Like he was the only person that I ever heard. other than myself when I decided to execute on this call, like talking about the Open Metaverse in the terms that he was from his place in gaming, but no one was saying it in Web3. The people that predate me were Decentraland and the ICOs that were building virtual worlds, but even those people at this time were not mentioning those words together. And I think that&#8217;s probably the biggest sort of contribution that I&#8217;ve had is recognizing that Crucible is a company, but I&#8217;m starting a movement and I need to build this like a movement. And so while I&#8217;m building this business, I need to start to plant these ideas in other businesses heads as well and find all the right people and kind of catalyze this as a movement. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />I love the, and again, I know that&#8217;s your Crucible&#8217;s mission is to empower gaming developers and gaming creators. And there&#8217;s this famous graph, I mean, famous is perhaps a stretch of a word, but I think I saw it a couple of years ago and it was the growth of gaming as a whole. And I also love like the CEO of Netflix even talked about our competitor is not Hulu or any of the, you know, the Disney plus or whatever, Apple TV, Amazon TV, any of their competitors he&#8217;s like our biggest competitor is gaming companies. This is what in people&#8217;s free time, they do a couple of things. They spend time on social media, they watch Netflix, IE and streaming service, but more often than not, it&#8217;s people gaming. And then you got to think about the Gen Zers where it&#8217;s like, I always talk about my little cousin who she&#8217;s addicted to Roblox and like, like these virtual worlds going on, it is like outer worldly things that we, you know, could fathom, but also can&#8217;t because we&#8217;re not in the weeds every day. Like the younger generation, the Gen Zers and the Gen to follow them, this is all they do. They love this shit. When you and I were young, I&#8217;m sure you were like me, I was playing road hockey or basketball or soccer or football on the streets, you know, that&#8217;s what I was doing. And then I had to come home for curfew or else my parents would kill me. And it&#8217;s like, we were out on the streets screwing around having fun. Nowadays kids, these were my best friends. Now their best friends are, you know, kids from halfway across the world in different countries who they&#8217;ve never met IRL, but they spend four or five hours a night shooting the shit with them. Like it&#8217;s a wild world that we live in and it&#8217;s going to get crazier and crazier. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I mean we&#8217;re playing hockey and baseball and basketball and football, but we were also playing Golden Eye and Halo I mean, you know, yeah, it&#8217;s been a key part of you know It&#8217;s very nostalgic video games all the way I used to get you know every console and 64 Nintendo and so I&#8217;m not necessarily a gamer playing them all the time today, but I recognize why it is a thing and why it&#8217;s important and why it has swallowed up all of media. And it will shape the rest of our lives moving forward gaming is it. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Yeah, it&#8217;s powerful. And again, competition is so powerful in life. And that&#8217;s just such an easy way to compete with very low barriers to entry. Ryan, you&#8217;ve been absolutely on fire, but we got to take a quick break. And folks, when we get back, we are going to jump more into Crucible and Open Meta DAO, which I cannot wait to get into. Until then, we got to have a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. You guys know who it is, PrimeXBT. We love the team at PrimeXBT.

Credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Ryan. Ryan, let&#8217;s jump right into it. Before we get into some of the nitty gritty stuff, and I can&#8217;t wait to get into the self sovereign identity, which again, verification of ID gaming. Absolutely huge. You guys are buzzing on this. Also the Emergence SDK, a toolkit for game developers, building interoperability into game worlds, massive. And we&#8217;ll conclude with some feature of the metaverse stuff. But until then, I love asking our guests for a little elevator pitch. Give me the elevator pitch on Crucible Network, and then we&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Elevator pitch is that the metaverse is the internet built by game developers, and if it&#8217;s not open, it&#8217;s a problem. It has to be open, and that&#8217;s what we exist for. And because it is game developers, we&#8217;ve designed tools for game developers to do that. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Walk me through some of those tools. Let&#8217;s start with the self-sovereign identity verification of ID and gaming, which is absolutely massive because you have people being fugazy here, fugazy there, fugazy everywhere. Everyone needs similar to how when you log on to a social media platform, and the only way you can really, truly get rid of bots is to verify them and or connect them to something that is singular like a phone number. There&#8217;s only one phone number, you can&#8217;t really replicate phone numbers. So that&#8217;s a great little way to look at it, but I&#8217;m gonna throw the ball over to your court, walk me through what you and the team are doing on the self-sovereign identity aspect of what you&#8217;re shipping out. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />So the product is emergence. There are a lot of sort of different innovative infrastructure around how we built emergence, but we&#8217;ve really sort of that is the product line. It&#8217;s an SDK on both the Unity and Unreal Engine right now. And it has all of these elements, right? So you can think of gaming as sort of exploded. And there&#8217;s all this innovation happening around Web3 and AI. There&#8217;s important things happening and it&#8217;s hard to keep up with. And so what we&#8217;ve done for game developers is package all that innovation into a set of tools and design it so it all feels like game development. We probably in the engines have the most traction of any SDK like this. We have about 40,000 downloads on the Unreal Engine, which is 4% of their total active developers. Still early, you know, downloads are happening, but games are super early in their life cycle of where they&#8217;re at and they&#8217;re shipping next year. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />And folks, just to jump in here, games take so frigging long to build. I&#8217;d love if you could just sort of chime in and let our listeners know how long it takes that to truly build a good frigging game. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Well, and that&#8217;s a good point. I think I internally with the team use this word game space. And it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m gonna use more because what we&#8217;re talking about in the sense of the Open Metaverse is not video games. We&#8217;re really used to playing video games which are thousands of people and the games take thousands of hours to complete. And if you&#8217;re talking triple A quality level work, I mean. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Half a decade. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah. I mean, it can take years and hundreds of millions of dollars of budget. And that isn&#8217;t necessarily what we&#8217;re saying is all going to be intropropable. And I hear this argument quite a lot, which is like Call of Duty and all these titles that we know that are video games that we understand already. And I think game space is a new concept to think about, right? Which is it feels more like a website, you know, it actually feels like a game, but in reality is more like a website. They&#8217;re all kind of networked together. You know, so the way we navigate all these websites and all these apps, it&#8217;s more like that than a video game. But it&#8217;s the experience of it actually feels more like a AAA game because these tools are making it much cheaper and much faster. Like we are very close to the point where one single developer can create something that feels like a AAA game. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have thousands of hours in its experience. Just like, you know, with AI tools, there&#8217;s going to be billion dollar companies created by one person. We&#8217;re very much at the 10x founder level, you know, where like the thing that one single founder or a small team can do is 10xing. So game space is this concept that I don&#8217;t really talk too much about yet, but we&#8217;re definitely going to. And yeah, it&#8217;s like a meta game. Think of it more like a meta game than a video game. It&#8217;s something that NFTs sort of scratch the surface of like with loot and with the narrative side of these collections and these characters. Like everybody sort of draws the invisible line of Board Apes to a video game or whatever. And very few of them have been able to make that leap because it&#8217;s quite hard to do, but that&#8217;s the next phase of it all. So it&#8217;s game space. And I think game space is not going to take as much as a video game does, but in the ways that matter the most, it&#8217;ll feel like a video game.  </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Interesting. Game Space, are you the only one buzzin&#8217; on this term, because I&#8217;ve never heard, again, I think you&#8217;re episode 276, 277. I&#8217;ve never heard this before. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />Yeah, I didn&#8217;t coin it, it&#8217;s existed. In fact, it comes primarily from a book. There&#8217;s three books that I read, well, sort of shaping Crucible. And one of those is called Gamer Theory. It&#8217;s by McKenzie Wark. And he&#8217;s a computer science philosopher. He looks at computer science and code through a philosophical lens. And, you know, he&#8217;s in academia as well. And so this is like a academic type book that talks about the concept of Game Space in our life. It&#8217;s not a video game. Video games are the digital, technological version of this, but we&#8217;ve always lived in games, you know, war is a game, the strategy of it, the two sides together. That&#8217;s why like chess and military strategy are so tightly compared. I think the show Billions does this really well, where they like, you know, they run a hedge fund, but they&#8217;re constantly spitting out all kinds of references of military strategy and chess strategy and social dynamic strategy. Cause all we&#8217;re playing games. That&#8217;s what we do, right? And so we shrink wrap different things into games. Even Uber is a game to see what car can pick you up quickest. And, you know, we&#8217;ve designed all of these things in game mechanics and game space is something that McKenzie used as a term, but I&#8217;m using it more in the sense that these are things that we&#8217;ll create. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Well said there. Let&#8217;s jump into the Open Metaverse. When you started, I mean, 20 minutes ago, when you started the show, you had a great little pitch on why the Open Metaverse is so important. But let&#8217;s just draw, we&#8217;ve drawn a bunch of comparisons to the show. Let&#8217;s let&#8217;s keep the comparison train rolling. Let&#8217;s definitely not let it stop. Building an Open Metaverse with open standards is absolutely paramount to success for Web3. And this would be, you know, this would be the exact opposite of the traditional Zuckerberg closed slash gated metaverse where it&#8217;s all through one single vehicle that allows you to play these games that we&#8217;re talking about. Why is it so important to build an open one? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />I think it&#8217;s necessary. I think it&#8217;s impossible to do it without it because, for example, open infrastructure, Web3, whatever you want to call it, is the only way to scale AI. There&#8217;s actually no possible way to do it without it. I think we need to shift the narrative from it&#8217;s like a nice to have, you know, up until now it&#8217;s been a nice to have. It&#8217;s like, if you bought Bitcoin, if you bought Ethereum, great for you. You know, I&#8217;m not interested in it. You made a lot of money. Great. If you were into NFTs, you like art also, great for you. I don&#8217;t really care that much about it. And now even with game developers, it&#8217;s sort of like, I really don&#8217;t care about it. Don&#8217;t make me do this. So it&#8217;s always been this sort of like, if you&#8217;re in it, you&#8217;re in it and it&#8217;s nice to have. But I think, you know, we&#8217;re going to start to see really quickly, it&#8217;s a must have. You must have it. And for the first principles, reasons why it was started in the first place, why not the speculative purely like profit seeking thing. That&#8217;s more of the economic incentive engine that was designed to get it to scale globally. There&#8217;s a reason, there&#8217;s a first principles reason why this matters. And that is a must have. There is no optional way of saying like, this is kind of just nice to have if you like it, you know, but again, AI hasn&#8217;t scaled to that point yet. And digital property ownership isn&#8217;t mattered to that many people yet, you know, and when it does, it&#8217;s the only way. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />When will it? Again, we&#8217;ve been, I&#8217;ve been doing this show since 2021. We&#8217;ve had dozens of guests come on and I agree with all of them. I do believe that interoperable Open Metaverse is the future, but we still haven&#8217;t had that catalyst. We still haven&#8217;t had that domino fall that where people are like, shit, I need to be in this or I need this to happen. And part of the reason is because people don&#8217;t like change, you know, humans are creatures of habit. It&#8217;s tough to go to an Open Metaverse when you have so many incredible games like the FIFA&#8217;s and the Fortnite&#8217;s and the Madden&#8217;s and the 2K&#8217;s and the CODs. I can go on and on. But what domino needs to fall in order for people, the, I&#8217;ll quantify people as more so Web2 gamers who are the largest demographic of gamers. What needs to happen in order for them to be like, damn, this is legit. This is something I want to be a part of. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />It&#8217;s gotta be fun. People have to care about it. So it&#8217;s a combination of it just being fun and also not too complicated. And at the same time, there&#8217;s a big generational shift that&#8217;ll take place where not necessarily our generation, but though definitely the one that&#8217;s younger, I don&#8217;t know what we call them, Gen Z, I guess. Like they just get it. It&#8217;s hard, they already live it. So it&#8217;s like when they kinda, when they step up, it&#8217;s just a different paradigm, it&#8217;s a different lifestyle. The problem I think generationally is like those who control things are still very much of older generation that don&#8217;t understand this at all. And will likely never want to change their paradigm at scale. There&#8217;s a few that you find, I mean, I talked to older people in their 60s, 70s, 80s that like love this stuff, cause they&#8217;re just very optimistic. But in general, like there&#8217;s a difference generationally. And we&#8217;re caught in the middle. As millennials, I think we&#8217;re caught in the middle of like, there&#8217;s some of us, but it&#8217;s not all of us. But by the time it gets to Gen Z, it&#8217;s pretty much all. You start to get down to like high school kids and like, I don&#8217;t remember the exact number. You could look at, there&#8217;s a Jeffery Study by this, but it&#8217;s like between 95 and 98% to play in these games. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />What does the future of the metaverse look like? And this is a question I ask all the time. I&#8217;ve heard many different answers, but there seems to be one similar thread that intertwines everything. And again, this is really one of the main topics of the show, which is just it&#8217;s open and it&#8217;s interoperable. But that&#8217;s more on the macro side. If we could get more to the micro side of things, what is the future of the metaverse actually look like? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />It starts to look like a digital economy you can walk through like I we&#8217;ve had a physical economy you can walk through So it&#8217;s like a pretty easy concept to learn. But like the economy is just becoming more and more digital. Yeah, we have all these kind of buzzwords and terminology for it, but you look at the what the internet means to you today and you look at how the internet was defined in the 90s and it&#8217;s not a different definition It just actually resonates with you because you use it all all the time. So in the 90s, you&#8217;re gonna define the internet and email the same way that you define it today, and it&#8217;s not like those words do a better job today than they did in the 90s. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s become life, you know, so you don&#8217;t get so caught up on the words. You just inherently understand it, you know, and it&#8217;s a part of your life and it&#8217;ll be the same things. It&#8217;s like the words that we use to describe this stuff won&#8217;t change It just will become a bigger part of our life. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />What year do you think if you were to throw a bit of a hot take, we might as well jump in the hot take factory at the segment started, which is always one of our favorites and concluding segment to the show. But if you were to, if you were a gambling man and you were to pick a year or a stretch of years where the Open Metaverse is actually going to pop off, what&#8217;s your thesis slash bet there? </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Gill</strong> <br />I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a singular time, but I like this. I used to do this a lot. I used to get like 12 people together at a time to make bold predictions and start arguing with each other. So my bold prediction is that the Open Metaverse already started, but it&#8217;s the prologue of it. And that next year is the year where games start shipping that are fun that people like. And in the same way that like free to play in gaming was violently pushed back against, but created the space for mobile gaming and for Fortnite and grew that industry so meaningfully that like everybody that pushed back against free to play now just feels like that was a stupid idea. Cause there&#8217;s really nobody arguing against that anymore. The full interoperability is the next full measure, I believe. And I think next year is where these things start to ship and people spend time in them. And what is the Fortnite or Roblox or Minecraft of that? I don&#8217;t know. Part of the NFT game was like choosing, putting those bets donn and choosing who it will be. But I think to me, I&#8217;m built, what we&#8217;re built for, what Crucible&#8217;s built for, what Open Meta is built for starts next year. So even though I started it in 2018 and COVID sped us up, it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s just been plumbing, up until now. And I get it, it&#8217;s frustrating to put bets down and be early, but like, don&#8217;t get so caught staring down at the ground that you think it&#8217;s dead or that it&#8217;s wrong. Because I see a lot of like these articles like the metaverse is dead and people point to meta and people point to Decentraland and Sandbox and the numbers of people. And fine, let&#8217;s say the metaverse is dead, so long live the Open Metaverse. Let&#8217;s move on from that concept of the metaverse, which we say is dead, didn&#8217;t work, and let&#8217;s move forward to what really needs to be. And so like, that&#8217;s a great way to reclaim that narrative. But I think we will look back and say that 2024 was like the first year, and then the bull market that happens will be another huge rush into digital assets, digital property, new stories, new IP. Like NFTs failed economically, but a lot of great important kind of IP exploration and experimentation came from that. So I will make a bold prediction. I believe that new forms of narrative in digital assets, digital property as a new place to tell stories will be the focal point of the next bull market. It will be through what feels like gaming, but I really believe that narrative&#8217;s the more important thing. If you look, here&#8217;s basically my thinking on that. If you look at NFTs and say that was Wall Street, right? And NFTs was pretty much just Wall Street speculation with a glimpse of storytelling and character. And that&#8217;s kind of what hooked people about one collection over another one. But then you look at streaming and how much time everybody spends film and television and move like this sort of episodic storytelling. I mean, everybody on the planet is sort of hooked onto that. And as like storytelling has always been an important part of our species. And so I think the next part of this looks like where the NFT space moves away from Wall Street and starts to look more like what&#8217;s on streaming. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong> <br />Well said. Ryan, you&#8217;ve been on a roll here. We are getting tight for time. Gotta have you on for round two because we barely scratched the surface here, but this has been an absolute treat of an episode. Really appreciate you coming on. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you, Crucible and Open Meta online and on socials. </p>

It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We&#8217;re buzzing as always, and I am super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, the one and only Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global, coming in hot from Bermuda. Wow, that must suck. Oliver is head of CEO at Bittrex Global, one of the world&#8217;s most secure digital asset exchanges. He also has over a decade of experience as a financial regulatory lawyer, having advised major investment banks, exchanges, and leading financial institutions on regulatory matters across the EEA, UK, and US. During his tenure with a leading global law firm, he specialized in various areas of financial regulatory advisory work, with particular expertise in advising exchanges, clearinghouses, and other financial market infrastructure companies. Super pumped to have this lad on. Ollie, welcome to show my friend.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>A real pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m pumped to have you on. How nice is that, you know, going from UK to the one and only island? How, what&#8217;s it like on the island? How freaking sweet is it?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m here quite a lot of the time. We&#8217;re regulated in Bermuda. We&#8217;re also regulated in Liechtenstein. So, I get to spend some of my time in two of the most beautiful countries in the world. But what&#8217;s really exciting about being here is we&#8217;ve just had Bermuda Tech Week on the island. And there&#8217;s a real buzz, a real excitement about digital asset sector in Bermuda. And it&#8217;s really showing the way forward and the way that actually the future of crypto can be regulated, heavily regulated. But that can lead to its own level of enthusiasm and excitement. And it&#8217;s just an engagement here in Bermuda for digital assets for crypto in general, that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen anywhere else in the world. So, it&#8217;s a real pleasure to be here, not just because of the regulatory environment, but because of the business environment too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How would a place like Bermuda differ from, say, Dubai or Singapore, which are two spots in the world that are also very open to digital assets and crypto? What&#8217;s the vibe like? I know that&#8217;s a tough question coming from you on my end, but if you could sort of depict not so much the Kwan, but more the Kual, like how it feels being there, what are the main differences? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been to both those spots as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I have. I&#8217;ve been lucky to do a lot of work in those spots as well. I think the difference here is Bermuda was such an early adopter, the Digital Assets and Business Act, which is still in many ways the world&#8217;s leading light on how to do crypto regulation properly. That was adopted here in 2018. In crypto years, that&#8217;s about 50 years ago, right? So there&#8217;s just a real sense here of not resting on their laurels, building something up, but it&#8217;s difficult really to compare it to Dubai or to compare it to Singapore because we&#8217;re an island here of 55,000, 60,000 people. They&#8217;re not trying to compete as a hub in the way that Dubai might be or Singapore might be. What they&#8217;re trying to do is show that actually what you need to make crypto a success is a proper fit for purpose bespoke regulation that has been carefully designed with crypto first and crypto in mind, coupled with a regulator that has real world experience and knows how to actually supervise and monitor financial services firms. I don&#8217;t mean crypto firms, I mean financial services firms. In Bermuda here, the BMA has that experience when it comes to insurance. Lichtenstein again, the regulator there, the FMA, had that experience in that case in the case of private wealth and banking. It&#8217;s really that synergy, those two things working together. You can write whatever pretty words you want on a page. Anyone can do that. Anyone can copy and paste. What they&#8217;re doing here in Bermuda and what they&#8217;re really showing is how that can come to life and how that can be actually, of course, be good and respected around the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, well said. I mean, I&#8217;m all for these smaller islands, really making moves. And again, just like you spoke about two minutes ago, it&#8217;s such a large asset class, not even just financial, but in the whole world economy. It&#8217;s so important. We&#8217;re becoming more and more digital every day, and we really need some solid and legit regulatory framework. But before we get into a bunch of that stuff, I&#8217;d love to learn a little bit more about you the star, the show. Tell me about your career. Let&#8217;s even go a little bit before that childhood. Where did you grow up? What did you fancy? Sounds like you got that beautiful British accent with football team you support. Tell me a little bit about you, and then we&#8217;ll get into Bittrex Global, your career, and a bunch of the regulatory stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. I&#8217;m very boring because I&#8217;m a lawyer and lawyers are by definition just a little bit dull. Now, I&#8217;m kidding, but I am a lawyer. I grew up in London. I spent my whole life there. I&#8217;d like to say that when I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut or firemen or whatever it is. But I think something in me that always just thought I&#8217;d probably, I don&#8217;t remember when I was a kid, but at some point I&#8217;d be joined to the law. And the reason for that is I realized very early on that law has the potential to actually allow people to interact properly. And it allows everything. If I go to an apple coffin trying to buy an apple, I know that what I&#8217;m going to get is an apple and not a pear. I know that it&#8217;s not going to be poisoned because there&#8217;s going to be some kind of food standards. And the vendor knows it&#8217;s exactly. And the vendor knows he&#8217;s going to get 50 pence from me. And if he doesn&#8217;t, and he can sue and he&#8217;s got certain actions, those principles allow me to go and buy an apple from an apple cart. Without that, most of the time it would work. But when it doesn&#8217;t work, then we&#8217;re all at sea. And it&#8217;s become increasingly apparent to me as I&#8217;ve worked more and more in the crypto sector, that without that fundamental, and that&#8217;s the same rules that apply to buying an apple from an apple cart to multi-billion dollar transactions. Without that, you just don&#8217;t have the confidence to do anything. You don&#8217;t have the confidence, you don&#8217;t know what the rules of the game are to have any kind of interaction with any kind of person. So that&#8217;s kind of what sort of motivated me to get into law. And I spent then a decade plus as a regulatory advisory lawyer, I was fortunate enough to specialize quite early and advise some of the world&#8217;s largest banks, traditional exchanges, broker dealers, the whole gamut of regulatory environments in the traditional finance sphere, focusing on financial market infrastructure. So exchanges, clearing houses, data repositories, that was kind of my niche. And then I guess about, I don&#8217;t know, in the last five years or so of that, I started working more and more in the Middle East. I was involved in some of the mega projects out there, including in Saudi Arabia with the Neon Project and those were very tech focused. They were very tech focused and they wanted to be like, and still want to be very futuristic, bin tech driven. And so you sort of get, you get traditional exchanges plus tech, mash them together, you sort of get crypto. And so here I am. And I joined Bittrex Global, actually originally as general counsel in 2021, and then got to bump up to the CEO chair last year. So I&#8217;ve been doing both of those since then.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>What got you on about crypto Oliver? Like again, you, I assume, one should never assume, but here I am assuming, but I assume you were making a pretty penny and had a very cushy job. Again, there&#8217;s not many financial regulatory, world-class lawyers in the world, people like you definitely do not grow on trees. And moving to the crypto sector was definitely a massive, massive risk. Why the jump? Why did you do it? What, what tickled your fancy? What made you move to the crypto sphere?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think it was a combination of things, but at Root is the opportunity to be involved in, I think, the biggest conversation that has been had and will be had for generations to come. I think blockchain technology is genuine. Everything is described as disruptive these days. I mean, I got out of bed this morning and I stubbed my toe and I was disruptive. Everything is important and everything is meaningful, but I think blockchain technology is genuinely disruptive and meaningful and we&#8217;re only beginning to scratch the surface of it. I think the opportunity to be in, if not quite at the ground level, then pretty damn close to the ground level is something that really appealed to me. I wanted to be part of building something and be part of shaping something. I think the two years that I&#8217;ve been involved, we&#8217;ve seen a dramatic change in the ethos of the sector as a whole. We&#8217;ve seen regulators be that the EU with MECA, the UK with its consultation paper that came out earlier this year, Dubai you mentioned earlier, Singapore, Hong Kong. We&#8217;ve seen jurisdictions around the world realize that actually this stuff is important and it&#8217;s not going anywhere and they&#8217;ve got to get a grip on it. Being part of helping shape that is really important. That regulatory side of it is really important to me personally because if you don&#8217;t create a path for good actors to behave well and to show people how crypto can actually be used for good and to create opportunities for people that don&#8217;t otherwise exist, you don&#8217;t create that good path. All you really do is clear the way for bad actors to behave badly. For me, that&#8217;s the power of what regulation can do and should be doing. Ultimately, it&#8217;s important to remember these regulations and these frameworks aren&#8217;t here to make geeky lawyers like me feel good about ourselves. Although I do, they&#8217;re there to protect people. They&#8217;re there to protect the most vulnerable and those people that we&#8217;ve spent decades in the traditional finance sector designing a patchwork of protections around. To my mind, there&#8217;s no reason that those same protections, the same principles, should suddenly not be important or should fly out the window just because you put the word digital at the front of it. I think the opportunity is really here to create both the characteristics for these jurisdictions. The characteristics, people want to get involved in this stuff. They want to participate. They want to innovate. There&#8217;s some incredibly exciting opportunities that crypto affords people that the traditional finance simply either can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t. If they can capture a bit of that, and that&#8217;s what, say my native UK, when they talk about becoming a crypto hub, that&#8217;s what they mean. They want to capture a piece of that and say, yeah, we want to foster that innovation, promote that entrepreneurialism. That&#8217;s a great carrot. The stick is, if you get it wrong, there could be a scandal. There are jurisdictions that are highly motivated by the possibility of a scandal, are scared of that possibility, but actually are quickly realizing that the best way to handle that is not to stick your head in the sand and pretend the whole thing doesn&#8217;t exist, but rather to create a framework for it being done properly. The absence of rules is not a solution. It&#8217;s a cop-out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How does someone like me who has zero regulatory framework experience and obviously is not a member of the bar, a member of the law, how do we even go about thinking what types of framework rules and regulations need to be implemented in order for crypto to actually be legit? And I love the analogy used earlier. You know, well, I&#8217;m paraphrasing, but life&#8217;s a big game, right? We&#8217;re all in one arena. If you don&#8217;t know the rules, you can&#8217;t win. If you don&#8217;t know the rules, it&#8217;s almost zero sum. You&#8217;re automatically losing. As an industry, how do we set legit rules that actually have positive emphasis on all players of the game and let everyone have an equal share at potentially winning for a lack of better words? Like what needs to be done? And I understand this is very tough and nuanced question. And I apologize in advance for throwing this at you, but and I&#8217;ve asked this many times and it&#8217;s tough to get a really, really good answer. If you were, let&#8217;s say, head of, you know, global crypto for the whole world, obviously, that&#8217;s not a thing. But if you had that power, what would you do in order to make legit rules so people can participate and have a chance at winning?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I think at the end, you came really close to where my answer is, right? Which is, the real question is, how does the average person in old fashioned English law, we call them the man on the clapper mom, the bus, the guy just going about his business, right? How does he know that he&#8217;s protected and can engage in crypto in a positive and secure way? And the answer is, or the answer ought to be, because we&#8217;ve created minimum standards around the world that mean that he can enter into any transaction under the legitimate jurisdiction with the same confidence. So let me give you an example. If you want to go and buy shares, you might understand what shares are, you might know what you want to achieve, and you might even have a good idea of what companies it is you want to invest in. But you basically know that if you need to go and buy those shares in New York, or London, or Tokyo, or Amsterdam, or Australia, wherever it is, the rules are basically the same. Sure, there are local variations and there are slightly different ways of doing things, and there are maybe slightly different processes. But at core, you&#8217;re going to get the same level of protection, you&#8217;re going to have the same rules about transparency, you&#8217;re going to have the same rules about, you know, if they&#8217;re cooling off periods, you&#8217;re going to have the same rules about insider trading. It doesn&#8217;t really matter to you as an individual where it is you end up. And that&#8217;s because we have international sammlet setters, in the case of exchanges, that CPSS IOSCO, setting out the principles for financial market infrastructure that essentially you know, so long as you&#8217;re playing in a legitimate jurisdiction, you&#8217;re going to get the same general level of protection. We don&#8217;t have that in crypto yet, and we need it. And I think we&#8217;re getting there, but far too slowly. That doesn&#8217;t require a, what was it you called it, global world head of crypto, which all sounds a bit James Bond villain to me, but it does require a level of coordination to eliminate old -fashioned regulatory arbitrage. It shouldn&#8217;t be a feature of doing crypto any more than it&#8217;s a feature of transaction on traditional exchanges. So that&#8217;s what we need. And we&#8217;re getting there. Right? And the way we&#8217;re getting there, look, I mean, you just had the EU adopting MECA, that&#8217;s the largest legal jurisdiction in the world to have adopted a comprehensive regulatory framework. It can be done. It is being done. You know, the G8 is looking at it, G20 is looking at it, IOSCO themselves are looking at it. And I&#8217;m impatient. And it&#8217;s important to remember, like, it took decades to get to that stage in judicial finance. And we&#8217;re talking about doing that same thing in, you know, minutes, hours, years, maybe, in crypto. So we are impatient, but I&#8217;m impatient because I, you know, I see every day the opportunities that are there and the success stories that people want to be participating in. But yeah, we need to make sure that those protections are there and that people can do it against that backdrop.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Incredibly well said there. Is there it seems like an obvious question? And perhaps I&#8217;m incredibly wrong here. But is there one country, ie the USA that could potentially actually adopt proper crypto framework rules and regulations that would be that domino effect for the rest of the world to join in? Because again, it seems like you have the device that Bermuda, the Singapore&#8217;s, the Hong Kong&#8217;s that have been proactive and actually want to move the needle and make this shit happen. But, you know, without the UK&#8217;s and the United States of America&#8217;s, I mean, my country, Canada, where Joe come running and throw us in that ring. But you know, the big dogs, if they actually implement framework, will that be the catalyst and will that be the domino that sort of kicks off the parade?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;m not going to pretend that there is one catalyst that will solve the whole thing. I think the UK and the US are two really good examples at the moment. The UK is sending out somewhat mixed messages. The government is sending out these, you know, we want to be a crypto hub and we know the prime minister when he was trying to do at least with very pro crypto, we want to be a hub, we want to attract investment, some very high profile investment announcements earlier this year with A16Z and all that kind of stuff on the one hand. And then on the other hand, the new rules on financial promotions which came in last week are extremely difficult to comply with them. And we certainly have to put a lot of time and resources and effort into ensuring that we comply with them, even when they contradicted themselves and were very quite difficult to follow. And I think it&#8217;s really easy to forget that these things do need to be thought through very carefully and that solutions are not straightforward. But it just goes to show how it can be done. The US is a different problem altogether. Because the US, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone now that doubts that the US regulatory environment is so impossible to navigate as to effectively make business impossible. Like, you know, when I said earlier, if you don&#8217;t create a good path for good people to act, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s lacking. And Bittrex US, which is separate from Bittrex Global, but previously existed in the US and served US customers, they just looked at it and said, well, look, we just don&#8217;t know what to do here. We spent a lot of money on expensive lawyers and we simply don&#8217;t know how it is possible to comply. So we&#8217;re just going to get out of the US. And they&#8217;re not the only ones And it&#8217;s really sad. And it&#8217;s tempting. You know, I used to say, the great joy of being CEO of Bittrex Global is I don&#8217;t just worry about the US. I need to worry about the SEC. But that&#8217;s not true. That&#8217;s always naive, right? Because the US is still the single largest economy in the world. It&#8217;s still the place for entrepreneurialism, for innovation. You&#8217;ve got the best universities. You&#8217;ve got the infrastructure. And if the future of crypto is just part of the wider financial services sector, which is why I think it&#8217;s going, then to think you can do that without the US is I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s naive. You can&#8217;t just pull down the shutters and pretend the US doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s too important for that. So we do need some movement in the US. It looks like, you know, maybe we&#8217;re going to get some in the coming months or years. Who knows? But at the moment, the chaos, the confusion is just impossible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it&#8217;s truly banana land&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s a pure bread shit show. And again, it&#8217;s unfortunate because a lot of us, myself included, are like, oh, there&#8217;s a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. And now it&#8217;s like, oh, sweet. Now we have two wars on our hand, potentially World War III. We have one of the most bleak and terrible economical outlooks that we&#8217;ve had probably since 2008. And of course, we have an election next year. I mean, I often say we even though I&#8217;m not American, it&#8217;s just as a Canadian, you&#8217;re technically a byproduct of America. So even though you&#8217;re Canadian, you&#8217;re technically American.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think the king disagrees, but I&#8217;m not so sure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. But look, Oli, we got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor, the show. And when we get back, we are going to get into everything Bittrex global related, a little bit of history, the awesome win by you guys with SEC. And like Oli spoke about as well, Bittrex USA, which is now, I guess, no longer a part of Bittrex global. Well, it is, but it isn&#8217;t. We&#8217;ll get into that in one second. Before then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

And now back to the show with Oliver. Let&#8217;s get into Bittrex. Star the show here. Bittrex global, excuse me, not just Bittrex. You got to walk me through and walk our listeners through the SEC lawsuit. What exactly happened there? The split of, you know, Bittrex as a whole and then Bittrex global, Bittrex USA. It seems like many crypto exchanges have unfortunately followed, well, I guess, fortunately is rather the correct word, the same suit. And again, this is just cherry on the cake, fortifying your point from about two minutes ago. America has no clue what they&#8217;re doing when it comes to crypto regulation. And if you have an exchange there, you either pretty much only operate there or you operate for every other country in the world. It&#8217;s absolute bananas. The floor is yours. Tell us what happened. And I guess start with a little bit of history of Bittrex because you guys are indeed one of the longest and, you know, in most secure exchanges on the planet as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I think the history helps. So Bittrex was set up in the US, established in 2013, 2014, and serviced US customers. And then as the global footprint got bigger, in 2018, 2019, they decided to set up an entirely separate company, which became Bittrex Global. And so Bittrex US was never part of Bittrex Global. Bittrex Global was never part of the US. They were entirely separate companies, still are entirely separate companies, different boards, different staff, just sharing the name Bittrex. Now, here&#8217;s what was the case. And in Bittrex US, earlier this year, decided that it could no longer continue to operate in the US. And so it shut down and it&#8217;s going through its mind down process at the moment. Bittrex Global, which only serves rest of world customers, doesn&#8217;t allow any US customers onto its platform, doesn&#8217;t offer its services into the US, and has always operated in that way, continues to operate unaffected by the shutdown of Bittrex US. The SEC case, they came and they said that both Bittrex US and Bittrex Global were operating as an unregistered exchange in the US. Now, from my perspective, we&#8217;ve settled that suit with the SEC on a neither admit nor deny basis. So we&#8217;ve neither admitted nor denied the charges. We&#8217;ve decided to draw a line under it and move on. We&#8217;re doing one of these that we do best, which is serving our customers. And we were pleased to have been able to just draw a line and move on. And others have not been so lucky, have not been able to do that so far, and are still subject to the confusion that we were talking about a few minutes ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, the couple year&#8217;s down the road if the USA gets their ducks in the row. Is there a way back in? Like, could it happen? Will it happen? Or is it is it so far gone that it&#8217;s like, eh, c&rsquo;est la vie, we&#8217;re going to move on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t know. I mean, Bittrex Global will never be in the US. That&#8217;s for sure. I don&#8217;t know whether anyone at Bittrex will still be around and want to get involved. But I think the question is more about the industry as a whole, right? Which is like, what can the US do now to keep those people that haven&#8217;t yet fled or reattract those people that have? And I think the answer there is actually quite straightforward. We need clarity. We need rules. We need to know what we&#8217;re doing. We need that apple cart. We need to know how to engage because without that, you couldn&#8217;t possibly set up a new business in the US without that regulatory clarity. And it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re asking them to reinvent the wheel. We know what it looks like. I can go and write it for them if they want. But it&#8217;s a political, not a legal problem. They only need to look as far across as Bermuda to have a regulatory framework that works. And if that&#8217;s not enough, and I&#8217;ve, of course, acknowledged that there&#8217;s a big difference between Bermuda with its small population and the US, but its global financial clout. So Bermuda doesn&#8217;t work. Look at the EU. The EU managed it with MECA. Nobody has ever accused the EU of being nimble. No one has ever accused the EU of having straightforward political processes, but they managed it. So I&#8217;m not naive enough to think that one lawyer shouting into a microphone is going to change anything. But we have to recognize that it&#8217;s a political problem, much more than a legal one. When people say it&#8217;s too difficult or there&#8217;s, you know, we don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s left or right. Like we do. We know what it&#8217;s going to look like. We know what it needs to look like. It comes back to what we were talking about with global standard setters. Like this isn&#8217;t reinventing the wheel. This is getting it done in the US. And I don&#8217;t know enough about the US political process to know who needs to crack, who&#8217;s heads together. But they better get on to it quickly. Otherwise, the US is really going to suffer. And ultimately, you know, the important thing to note here is that it&#8217;s the US citizens to suffer. And they&#8217;re being failed twice. They&#8217;re being failed twice. They&#8217;re being failed the first time because they&#8217;re not going to be allowed access and not going to have access to all of those opportunities that DLT, blockchain technology and crypto is affording people around the world. So they&#8217;re being failed on that level. And they&#8217;re being failed because they&#8217;re also not going to be getting the protections that a proper regulatory regime can afford them. And exactly those people that are most in need of a regulatory framework are being left hung out to dry by the complete refusal to engage in a proper regulatory framework. So, you know, it&#8217;s sad for the industry, but it&#8217;s even more sad for those people that are most in need of actual action.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said. A little off topic here, Ali, but one thing that I want to say partly gets my blood boiling, but partly just literally makes me laugh out loud is all of the political members in the States who do insider trading. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen the Nancy Pelosi stock trader on Twitter. She&#8217;s up like what, 150% in the last year. Last week you had multiple governors, multiple people in politics who bought army and war stocks before Saturday. And for the listeners, this episode is going to air on Thursday, the 20th of October, I believe, but last week you had Palestine and Israel and you&#8217;ve had senders and legitimate political people in the States buying, like how the hell does this keep happening? Like, what do you think about that? To me, I think it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s laughable on all ends. I&#8217;m a bit jealous as well, because I&#8217;d love to make some cake on that, but what&#8217;s your two cents in that regard?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, I don&#8217;t know enough about the US political system or about the specifics of what&#8217;s going on there, but I think the principle is really important, which is that whenever you have rules about trading and about transparency, clarity is the most important thing. People need to feel not only are the rules fair, but they&#8217;re being applied in a fair way. I don&#8217;t know whether X, Y, or Z person or I should say Z person has done it, whatever it is they&#8217;re accused of having done. But I think the lesson that we can learn across the financial services sector is people get really annoyed about this stuff. It really creates this them and us mentality. And it&#8217;s not just politicians. There&#8217;s a sense that, and this is something that the crypto can really help with, the sense that if you&#8217;re rich, you play by different rules. And actually the financial services sector is designed like that. There&#8217;s a whole suite of products in the traditional finance sphere where we say to people, sorry, these are complex financial products. You can&#8217;t have access to them. You&#8217;re too poor or too stupid. You&#8217;re not allowed to play here. And no wonder they get annoyed at that. No wonder they think the system is stacked against them. And actually no wonder then they look to crypto and say, well, look, help us out here. How can we get involved? We&#8217;re not too stupid. We want some exposure to this kind of stuff. We&#8217;re willing to educate ourselves. We&#8217;re willing to play by the rules. But we&#8217;re just being shut out of the door. We&#8217;re not even getting a foot in the door. We&#8217;re just being told no. And that&#8217;s one of the many opportunities that the crypto is affording people around the world. And that&#8217;s before you even come to the issue of people that can&#8217;t get bank accounts and don&#8217;t have access to traditional banking at all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. Let&#8217;s jump into Bittrex Global here. Give myself and listeners a little primer about what you guys are working on and what&#8217;s going to pop off for the next couple of years. I know you got a shitload of stuff in the pipeline. Already one of the most established and secure global exchanges on the planet. We&#8217;d love to see that. We need more guys like you and more exchanges like Bittrex that actually take care of customers and not the FTXs and the other scumbags that are in the space. But give us a quick primer on what exactly you guys are doing right now and what you have planned over the next couple of years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. Obviously, at the moment, we&#8217;re suffering through this bear market. So when I say it&#8217;s an exciting time, it kind of sounds weird, but it&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s an exciting time. And it&#8217;s exciting because I think the scandals of last year have bossed people back to basics. People have realized that actually the Bittrex global approach, which has always been focused on our core products, focused on our principles of security, innovation and regulation, and provide to people a straightforward but incredibly robust spot exchange is actually now seen as a breath of fresh air to people. And it&#8217;s all of the additional bells and whistles and complications and bright neon lights and headline grabbing that we&#8217;d never engaged in. That seems to have got a lot of people into a lot of trouble. And actually, even down to things like, look at the structure charts coming out of the FTX hearings, and obviously, the trial of Sandbank Mifru is coming on now. Yeah, I spent my time as a regulatory lawyer. I&#8217;ve seen some pretty damn complicated charts in my time for entirely legitimate reasons. I&#8217;m not going to say, wow, it&#8217;s not just one company. They must have been not something nefarious. I&#8217;m not an idiot. But even I and my close friends and people I&#8217;ve worked with for a long time looked at them when, poof, we can&#8217;t make heads or tails of this. How was anyone supposed to know who it was they were trying to act with? When FTX said they were regulated, you weren&#8217;t actually facing that regulated entity. You were like the services being provided from God only knows where. Actually, Bittrex Global, if you&#8217;re a customer of Bittrex Global Bermuda Limited, you go on the website and it says you&#8217;re a customer of Bittrex Global Bermuda Limited. And then you go on the BMA&#8217;s register of authorized regulated companies it&#8217;s Bittrex Global Bermuda Limited. And it&#8217;s so stupid that I have to say that. I&#8217;m saying something novel or exciting. That&#8217;s how it should be. But there are people receiving services and they just don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re getting them from. They don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re getting them. And so what we&#8217;re focused on is, as I say, our three principles, security, innovation, and regulation. Security is at the heart of everything that we do. Our founders are security engineers. By background, the entire premise of Bittrex was they wanted to get involved in crypto, looked at what was out there from a security perspective and realized it all sucked. And they could either lose all their money on other exchanges or they could write their own. So they decided to write their own. And the foundation method the company, I say method, it almost certainly didn&#8217;t happen like this. But apparently over the course of the weekend, they sat down in one of their basements and wrote the code that became Bittrex. Like, okay, maybe it was a couple of weeks, but it&#8217;s a good story, right? And in the wake of the scandals from last year, people are suddenly massively animated by that as well as they should be. Innovation, similarly, are we going to go for the headline grabbing, but ultimately empty promises? No, absolutely not. What are we going to do? What are we going to work with in our regular issue frameworks, engage deeply with our customers on what it is they want to see, what features they want, how to make the platform work for them, and provide them that. And I think there&#8217;s people that try and say that there&#8217;s a trade-off between regulation and innovation. I don&#8217;t buy that at all. I don&#8217;t agree with that at all. I think regulation provides you the framework within which to innovate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>You need to know the rules. You can&#8217;t know the rules. You can&#8217;t win. Like it&#8217;s as simple as that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think that&#8217;s right. And it gives you a framework and it says, right, here is some space in which you can innovate, go out and do it. And then finally, of course, regulation, working in conjunction with the other two, that&#8217;s how we run people&#8217;s trust back. There&#8217;s a complete lack of trust at the moment. There&#8217;s a complete antipathy, I think, towards a lot of crypto, especially in the retail space. The institutions are different. Institutions, I think, is still really interested and still really engaging in crypto. But at the retail level, we need to win people&#8217;s trust back. And we&#8217;re not going to do that by being showy and having more culture personality and SBF like nonsense. We&#8217;re going to do that by being deliberate, concise, conservative, calm. And dare I say it, just a little bit boring.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, no, very well said. Oliver this has been an absolute treat. One more thing on Bittrex here. Next couple of years, what do you guys have popping off? Anything for us, people on the outside to look forward to?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>There&#8217;s an awful lot on the pipeline right now. They say during bear markets you should build. And so we&#8217;ve been building away. We&#8217;ve got a lot of interesting features coming up, some product lines coming up. You&#8217;ll have to watch this phase.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love it. Sounds good. Quick little segment in the hot take factory and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. I feel like you&#8217;ve got a bunch of spicy ones, which I can&#8217;t wait to hear. It doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto, blockchain, regulation related, can be health, wealth, happiness, AI, space, politics, war, you name it. But any Oli hot takes before we let you go.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Hot takes I mean, the one I&#8217;m going to come back to is always do your own research. The joy of crypto, the joy of this space is the unlike traditional finance. With enough time and effort, you can actually find out what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;ve spoken to some of the most sophisticated derivatives traders that the city has to offer. And at heart, they can&#8217;t always really explain what of this they&#8217;re trading. That&#8217;s not true of crypto. The information is out there. It can be done. And that&#8217;s how you gain confidence in what you&#8217;re doing. So you can never read enough, you can never learn enough. And if that has to be in a sweet little phrase of do your own research, then so be it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Just added that to the show notes. DYOR folks, one of the, probably one of the best and most underrated term in all of crypto. Oliver, what an episode. Thank you so much for coming on. Truly appreciate it and knee jump for round two as we barely scratched the surface here. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Bittrex Global online and on socials.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Absolutely. So our website is bittrexglobal.com. Our Twitter handle is @BittrexGlobal, unless you&#8217;re in the UK, because of those new UK rules that come in, where you have to go to @BittrexGlobalUk, and you can find me @OliverLinch. Hey, it&#8217;s important. You don&#8217;t mess around with these things.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I know. No, it is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>And you can find me @OliverLinch, both on LinkedIn and on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Hey, when are you coming to my homeland? When are you guys gonna open up shop in Canada? Or you&#8217;re like, nah, we don&#8217;t want that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>You know, we have a good partnership with a firm in Canada. And, you know, you guys are doing some interesting things out there. There&#8217;s actually a Canadian association in Bermuda that are working lobbying on how to make some waves in Canada too. So, you know, maybe next time we have this conversation, I&#8217;ll be able to put you guys up there with the EU and Dubai and Singapore and those jurisdictions that are really pushing to make grips or a thing. And, you know, I&#8217;m not kidding on that. You know, there&#8217;s going to be jurisdictions around the world saying, how do we get in on the action?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. I mean, very unlikely for my country, but c&rsquo;est la vie. Oli what an episode. Thanks again, man. Truly appreciate it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oliver Linch</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thanks, Matt. Really appreciate it, sir.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global. He was dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center. Anything regulatory framework related security, innovation, regulation. He talked about it, learned a ton. Guys, I hope you enjoyed this one. I certainly did. If you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I. Speaking to the team, love you guys so much. Thank you for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor. You are the GOAT and you know it. I love you. Back to the listeners. Love you guys. Thank you for always as listening. Keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy and keep on growing those bags. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.&nbsp;</p>

We are buzzing as always and I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, the one and only Adeniyi Abiodun. He&#8217;s the Co-Founder and CPO of Mysten Labs, a true product leader with experience spanning from financial services to crypto. He has also led engineering and product teams across Big Tech companies, including Oracle, VMware and Facebook, ever heard of them before. Prior to founding Mysten Labs, he also led many of Meta&#8217;s R&amp;D initiatives in blockchain and crypto, including the Diem, aka Libra Network, cannot wait to get into that and the one and only Move programming language. And we&#8217;ve been going back and forth for a hot minute. Super pumped to have you on my man. How you doing?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>Doing great. Thank you for having me on, really so pleasure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Pump to have you. You said you&#8217;re living in Cali right now, one of my favorite places on the planet. I mean, has its ups and downs like everything else, but since that beautiful accent of yours, we&#8217;ll brought you over to the West Coast in Cali.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>Interestingly, I&#8217;m born in Nigeria, left when I was 7, went over to the UK, my dad is doing his PhD, so the whole family moved over to the UK and lived in London for almost all of my life since then. In 2014, actually, if I say 2011, I found out about Bitcoin and I built my first company in Bitcoin Space in 2012. And that company actually, I moved that over here to California and I&#8217;ve been in the Bay Area ever since.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>San Fran, is it as bad as everyone says it is? Not bad. Beautiful again, one of the most beautiful spots on the whole planet, but like the homeless, the shits on the street, all that kind of stuff, is it still&#8230;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>It is all that and even more. Luckily, I live in the Bay. I live south of that. I&#8217;m in San Jose, so offices in Palo Alto, we don&#8217;t have to deal with San Francisco by regular. But it&#8217;s a beautiful city. It&#8217;s just a shame to where it&#8217;s gone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, no, I feel that. Walk me through, before we get into the crypto stuff and the Facebook stuff, tell me a little bit about childhood, you know, growing up, a little bit of experience, you need the whole nine yards and then we&#8217;ll get in. Before we get into crypto, we got to touch a good amount of the show on the Facebook stuff because I remember, I mean, everyone remembers this was non-crypto people, heck, my parents, you know, friends and family and everyone in the network. As soon as Facebook now Meta started talking about Diem and Libra, it was like, holy shit, this is going to change the world. And obviously present day, not a whole lot has happened there, but to speak with someone who actually built that and was on that team is so incredible. So I can&#8217;t wait to get into that. But before that, give us the, you know, the whole nine yards in regards to your childhood, where you went to uni, passions, just so myself and the listeners can get a little lay of the land here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, so born to Nigerian parents, grew up in Nigeria till I was seven. I have three siblings, one brother, two sisters. We moved over to the UK, actually, started off in Scotland, where my dad was doing his PhD in Aberdeen University, then moved over to London, and where we spent most of our lives. I actually went to university in London. I studied at Queen Mary University, studied electronic engineering with computer science. I actually started my university degree doing astrophysics, to be honest, and realized it&#8217;s not going to make much money. Did an astrophysicist, I took the experience and said, okay, well, I need to do something that&#8217;s actually going to make me somebody. So I did electronic engineering. And after studying that, I actually went on to do a job that&#8217;s very well-aligned. I was a software engineer working with software and hardware. So I worked on hardware, put hardware together for monitoring oil wells, and then the software that managed the systems as well. So I wrote all the software, including some of the operating system elements that was required. But that got me very into the world of hardware and software. But my passion ended up being mostly on the software side. So I went over to work in banking to build risk systems, risk management systems for hedge funds and investment banks. Quickly after that, one of the JP Morgan was building trading systems for credit risk. Basically the credit derivatives, the stuff we call the things that cause financial disasters many times over. But that was a lot of fun. I actually had a great time at JP Morgan, but due to that time, I found out about Bitcoin. And then HSBC, when I was running software for managing risk for market makers, and the prime brokerage side of our business, I decided to build a Bitcoin mining company, interestingly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>What year was this when you built Bitcoin mining company?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>I started mining Bitcoin in 2011, but I built my Bitcoin mining company in 2012. So I did pretty well on Bitcoin. I wish I didn&#8217;t sell the majority of my Bitcoin. I probably won&#8217;t be here. But that got me the bug. I mean, reading the paper, the Satoshi White Paper really brought some things over about what I was doing in the world of finance and I became enamored by what this tech could potentially do. It wasn&#8217;t just a crypto side that interested me more than anything. It was actually more the decentralization aspect of having an infrastructure that could be run by disparate organizations that don&#8217;t have to trust each other but can now have this decentralized trust and if this leads to a whole heap of possibilities. And I really wanted to get involved. And the way I knew how at the beginning was solving the problem of mining because I was mining for myself, my friends were interested in mining. I just started running hardware and eventually they asked me to run it for them. And then I started having equipment in data centers. And very quickly it became the scenario where I put up a website and people started paying me to mine on their behalf. And that started my world of crypto.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Who introduced you to Bitcoin?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>I found it interestingly. There was a colleague of mine that told me about it. And when I heard about it, I kind of ignored it because it sounded kind of out of the world, right? The fact that you could solve this problem of trust seemed a bit out there. I never dealt into the details that I read the paper myself. It was one of my colleagues, at JP Morgan. And then at HSBC, I dug into it a lot more. And at that point, I became convinced. I got my first win. I started mining it and it became like a drug. It became addicted to it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Now you also worked for some massive tech companies like Oracle and VMware. We&#8217;re going to skip those bad boys. Let&#8217;s jump right into Facebook, right into Meta. What did that call sound like? Walk me through that whole process of you, I assume getting poached and joining Meta&#8217;s R&amp;D team for initiatives and blockchain and crypto, and then walk me through everything that happened with Diem, Libra. And again, just for the listeners back at home, I forget exactly what year this was, but this was, I want to say 2020 perhaps, but this was like the talk of the town. This news was insane. You had massive headlines, Facebook launching their own cryptocurrency, we&#8217;ll wipe out everyone else&#8217;s, Facebook launching their own blockchain. The hype was real. It was hype city population you guys. Walk me through everything that happened. I can&#8217;t wait to get into this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. I remember when the news came out that Facebook was launching its own blockchain. I was blown away that that was even a possibility, knowing the kind of company Facebook was. I would never work in Facebook unless it was something related to crypto. I was at that point working at the end, actually that was an Oracle. Then I moved over to VMware to work on their new consensus algorithms that they were building for their own enterprise blockchain service. They ended up taking one of our best scientists, Dalian Maliki, who is a very good friend of mine. I dug into the project a lot more and from my conversations with them, I was like, yeah, they did want to make their own blockchain. They did want to have something that others can use, making it as easy as sending email. It should be that easy sending money. That was the ultimate goal. So I interviewed at Facebook specifically for the role. In fact, I was recommended by one of the VPs there to come in to help on the project. I made it through the interview stage and that&#8217;s when they exposed what they&#8217;re really working on in detail and I was like, oh my God, I&#8217;ve got to get in on this project. If there&#8217;s anything I&#8217;d like on in my career, I&#8217;ve done all these amazing things in crypto, but if I could help Facebook or work on this Facebook project and launch a global chain for everybody to use for value transfer, I had to be in that project whether you pay me or not. I&#8217;m excited. But I made it in and I got to work on, I actually came in to work on decentralized identity first. Very quickly, I realized that was not a priority. I shut down that effort quite quickly and I looked for a team to work with within the Libra project. Evan was leading the R&amp;D work at Meta. So Evan, who listens in, is the CEO of Mysten Labs. He built the entire R&amp;D arm at Libra that built the blockchain. The promo language move was developed because we took a look across all ecosystems, across all promo languages and what could be used to build safe smart contracts. Because if you&#8217;re going to tell a regulator that you&#8217;re launching a chain for value or for money and you want to give good assertions that this chain is secure, we want to go way above the curve of what people are doing and actually offer good forward guarantees. So we had to invent move. That was Sam&#8217;s idea and Sam is the CTO of Mysten Labs. We came up with amazing crypto technology, things that basically allows you to email money to people directly, allows you to basically have more compressed signatures to do things in a more parallelizable way. A lot of that work was costless charquess. He actually is our Chief Cryptographer at Mysten Labs. So the brains behind the work we&#8217;re doing at Libra from a technical side all came to Mysten George Deniz&#8217;s startup was actually acquired by Facebook to help build out Libra. And he&#8217;s behind all the wonderful work we&#8217;re doing in R&amp;D, especially on our consensus algorithms and things related. He&#8217;s one of the most famous scientists in Greece where it comes to even just period as a whole. And I feel we have a really unique team. I was a product lead. I led a lot of work we did for a product side in R&amp;D. My strong point is turning hard science or hard technical marvels into product. Like I care about consumers. I really want things that consumers can use and I can realize things that are very technical in nature and how to boil it down to something the average person can use day in, day out. And I think that team is so unique in crypto. All the different expertise in languages, compilers, crypto, consensus algorithms, products, marketing. It&#8217;s that massive element of diversity and skill that really makes Mysten then Sui very unique.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Geez, talk about a sales pitch, holy, not bad. I mean, I sort of want to throw some money at this now. Yeah, I mean, yes, folks as stated many times, this is not an investing show, no financial advice, do your own research as always, but holy shit, what a pitch that was. Before we get more into Sui, let&#8217;s just go back on the Facebook side of things again. Any, did you guys have any conversations with Zuck? Were there any classic Facebook ritual stories, you know, the crazy perks you guys had, the work-life balance, anything like that? Like walk me through the actual days of building it. Were you guys, I don&#8217;t know, perhaps some super wrong here, but I feel like you guys were almost alienated in the sense that you had 99% of Facebook working on non-crypto stuff, then you had the crypto and blockchain guys, like walk me through the whole, everything that happened. Give us some good stories here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>I met someone who&#8217;s crazy, but Facebook is probably one of the best companies in the world you can work for. It&#8217;s got great engineering culture, great product culture. It&#8217;s got a drive for growth that I&#8217;ve never seen anywhere else, and everything is scale. Forget small things, it&#8217;s all about scale. It had amazing benefit packages. You walk through the main campus, it felt like Disneyland. It literally was modeled after Disneyland. I kid you not, you walk there, there&#8217;s free ice cream, there&#8217;s free food everywhere. You want to be there, you want to enjoy it, and then you want to build community there. I think it&#8217;s a great place to work, and it&#8217;s a great model for people to build across. Libra itself was a project that was very highly regarded within the company, but we were separated from the majority of Facebook. We had our own building that was private that you needed a special key card to access. Our pass allowed it anywhere else in the company, but no one could get into the Libra building because of things that worked on were very secretive in nature. We had a payment element that we were doing that we wanted to be sufficiently distanced from Facebook, the prime business itself, which is a right way to set things up. There&#8217;s a lot of a lure to the majority of Facebook that wanted to actually work on Libra. It was one of the highest-browed projects that you actually want to work on in the company. Then I felt like we worked with some of the smartest people I&#8217;ve ever met within my life, Love Work with Kevin Wheel, who was VP of product for Libra. Maron Colbecki, Love Work with David Marcus. These are the smartest people I got to work with across the world on this project. Still in contact with the majority of these folks, I classified them as great friends. I felt like we really built a great culture of innovation, a great culture of trying to solve problems that we really cared about. Anybody you speak to on a Libra project was very passionate about the mission. You can&#8217;t do it and not be passionate. There were easier ways to make money, easier things to do, a little disappointment. You had to be sold into the vision. I think if you spoke across the board, did a really good job of selling the mission in the vision, and that&#8217;s really what hooks people in. I loved every moment on working on a project. I mean, look, the thing has sucked, right? In reality is we never got to launch it. We never got to see the light of day. Look, you can classify it as some of it was regulatory. If I had to classify it, the reality is you could look at Facebook history on privacy. You can name it something related to that, but I quite frankly think there is a fear, right? Overnight, two billion people have a bank account. That is bigger than any country in the world. It makes Facebook probably the most powerful company in the world, period, right? I think there&#8217;s an element of fear that is probably well founded to be quite honest. And I understand that concern. I think there&#8217;s a world where the infrastructure, the tech can be separated from the company, from the Facebook, the company itself, right? I think maybe Libra launched that as a smaller company would not have had as much scrutiny, right? But I think the bar that Facebook needed to meet and get out of the door, even though it was managed in a decentralized formula in a sense that there are multiple pretty much a coalition of companies that came together, or consortium, the right word for coin here, came together to put Libra together and launch it. That, the Facebook story was always behind it, and it was very hard to get away from that. No matter whether you have someone on the board who&#8217;s not related to Facebook in any way, shape, or form, you do all the best you can on the code to make sure that it&#8217;s highly secure. You do everything you can on the compliance front. I think just that narrative was strong enough to really derail the project, which is a shame, you know, if you&#8217;re working on something for like years and years and you&#8217;ve poured your passion and energy into it and see it go light, it really hurts. But I think the reality of it is even since the project has been disbanded, multiple people have let and succeeded highly since then. I think that&#8217;s a great success story.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>100%. Quick question for you here. If now no longer Facebook, if Metta wanted to flip the switch and launch away, like I assume that I mean, it&#8217;s Meta. There&#8217;s no way they let you guys take any of that tech. I mean, there&#8217;s no doubt it&#8217;s still in your heads and you brought a lot of that over to your current endeavor. But if they wanted to flip the switch and have that, you know, two billion person bank and payment rail system, could they not do that tomorrow if they really wanted to?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>They could do that and they don&#8217;t need a blockchain to do that. I mean, they can leverage any chain to make that happen. The problem is, met it looking at the skill that they&#8217;re at, and looking at all the solutions out there, nothing scale. Nothing. Even Libra, Marvin, Arla, Arngrman, we built it, right? Libra isn&#8217;t scalable to manage Facebook scale, right? So the way in which we solve the problem is you go through a VASP, or virtual as a service provider to transact, and they will submit it to transact on your behalf. That is one way to change transactions. Whereas when we left Facebook, we thought, OK, now we know what we know. We built the system, we know the mistakes we made, we know the shortcuts we had to take to make it to market. What would it take for the Facebook of the world to launch their own virtual background chain where billions of people can literally use this thing at its scale to the scale that Facebook cares about? So we took those same engineering principles that we&#8217;ve used to build highly scalable systems, the most highly scalable systems that power billions of users day in, day out. And we applied that to Sui Tech. Sui Tech is very unique in the sense that it&#8217;s the only technology that&#8217;s horizontal scalable. People talk about TPS. That doesn&#8217;t matter, right? Honestly, that&#8217;s a stupid metric. What matters is if I demand more bandwidth or I demand more capacity, can you provide that, right? And still maintain the system integrity at scale? Yes, Sui is the only one that actually does that. And that&#8217;s the design principle we put behind Sui.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m sorry, I was just gonna say, is that, that&#8217;s actually a great point. And I mean, heck, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re gonna be guest number 273, I believe. I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever brought that up on the show before. Is TPS such a vanity metric or such an important metric bunny ears just because it&#8217;s quantifiable, because it&#8217;s measurable? Whereas with your argument in regards to, you know, needing bandwidth when it&#8217;s available is more subjective. Is that why TPS is so sexy in people&#8217;s minds?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I mean, so imagine this, you go to Google and you are a multi-billion dollar company and you say you want to launch a map. And Google tells you, we could always support 100 apps per second. Or we could always support 10,000 apps per second. Doesn&#8217;t matter what number you tell that business, but the fact that you have a cap on that number is a freaking red flag, right? That&#8217;s a red flag. So anyone telling you our TPS is this or X or Y, you should run very fast away from that solution. It means there&#8217;s no scale. And all of crypto, every blockchain, you name it, Solana, Aptos, Avalanche, you name it, all have that problem, right? So our story was like, we cannot build a system like that. Our system effectively needs to take that story away. Yes, even if we had to compare our system with existing systems, it&#8217;s already orders magnitude faster, right? But like, we don&#8217;t want to stop there. That doesn&#8217;t matter. What matters is our system, you can throw in more hardware and it has unlimited TPS. That is what the Googles and the Facebooks and the massive organizations of the world want to hear. Can you do that issue? In the cloud, we call it like share a tendency or multi-tendency, right? So share a tendency is where everybody shares a single resource or shares a single machine. Blockchain see that all as a world where they&#8217;re all sharing a single machine. And you really try to get multiple people to leverage just a single resource, which is really a multi-tenant system, but it&#8217;s built as a single tenant utility, right? Whereas Sui is really multi-tenant for multiple users, right? Like anyone that writes a small contract, my small contract performance has not affect yours, right? And that&#8217;s why we add more machines, more small contracts from the process in parallel, right? So it&#8217;s really a multi-tenant system, not a single tenant system, pretending to be a multi-tenant system. So we have unlimited scalability. We can keep scaling and add more TPS. It sounds like BS, but reality is you don&#8217;t question Google. Google says keep bringing more apps and Google figures it out. We have the same infrastructure. And that&#8217;s why I think we&#8217;re built different and our ideology and what we believe is required for the ecosystem is completely different from others.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. We are absolutely buzzing right now, but unfortunately, Adeniyi we need to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor, the show PrimeXBT.

Let&#8217;s go nitty gritty Sui. But before I&#8217;m going to start with a perhaps a bit of a comedic sprinkle on the cake. Ronaldo, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen that Sui. Everyone loves it. When I first saw you guys, that&#8217;s the first thing I thought of. I&#8217;m not even a huge football fan, but again, it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s part of pop culture now. Everyone does it. How often do you guys get that? You must get it a little bit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>All the time. I mean, Sui is Japanese for water, right? In fact, it&#8217;s in many cultures, that word, Sui, means water, not just in Japanese. And the reason why we chose or coined that phrase or we use Sui is because when we&#8217;re building a system, we want a system that&#8217;s boundless, doesn&#8217;t have a litter. And water at our view has no bound or limit. So be like water in the last scheme of things. So yeah, it wasn&#8217;t for the Ronaldo Sui, but actually it has been quite helpful, interestingly as well. But a big Ronaldo fan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>You guys must get some residual advertising and marketing from that, eh?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>We love it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How hard is it like snagging a bunch of three letter domains and not just three letter domains, but like when you create a business, everyone&#8217;s always said, less is more. Were there really any other good candidates for a name or was it just like, you know what, this is exactly what we want to go with where the bandwidth kings of blockchain and crypto, the name sounds clean, it&#8217;s sexy. Like, was there any other options or was it just Sui it is, fuck the rest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think addressing really helps, right? Because there&#8217;s no way, you know, I would have figured out that name or most of the people in the company where we have a very diverse team and that helps. We had a lot of terrible names. Like, I didn&#8217;t want to go through names that we have. Never asked like, you know, I&#8217;ll see two big names, like he&#8217;s terribly weak in. But, you know, we had terrible names. I think the one name we had came up with a Sui and new and everybody immediately knew it was the right name. Like it&#8217;s always great when it was like, ah, that&#8217;s actually it, it&#8217;s great. And I think we&#8217;ve been very, it&#8217;s hard to find three little names for sure, but this one I felt was a bit of luck.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. So one of the questions that I usually ask, and it&#8217;s a bit of a cop-out question, is the founding story. But I think people can put two and two together here. You and a bunch of absolutely incredible, very switched on and smart people from the Facebook team, from the Diem team, came over and formed Sui. And again, you guys are a bit of a solution for the unbanked, preventing fraud, capital mismanagement, whole nine yards. What makes Sui unique? Because there&#8217;s a bunch of companies that are trying to do the not exact same, but similar niche of crypto that you guys are. And I love when myself and the listeners can sort in, okay, we have a couple thousand blockchains right now. We all have our ideas of what blockchains and cryptocurrencies fit into bucket X, Y, and Z. What bucket do you guys fit into? What problems are you looking to solve? And how do you differentiate from the competitors?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, lots of pack there. I think the thing that makes Sui unique one is a team. Our team background, I think, is on parallel to anyone in crypto. We&#8217;ve actually systems that people use day in, day out. And I think it&#8217;s hard to say that any existing team with Web3, that allows us to come in with a new lens of what&#8217;s required for the next stage of crypto. And I think we&#8217;re talking about bringing important band to crypto. Like we are fiber optic. And I think 56k is what we have today in this crypto and our goal. If you create more bandwidth, you have more interesting apps. Now we have Netflix, we have Amazon, we have wonderful applications that can be built now. I think in the world of dial up, we are very restricted, but it&#8217;s still successful and it&#8217;s done really well. But in that, they expect to bring in a billion users, needs builders who are accustomed to building things for the next billion users, right? And I&#8217;m happy to talk through some of the tech. Some of the things also that&#8217;s very unique about Sui is our view on scale and gas. One, we think gas should not be this number that goes up and down like yo-yo, right? And should not be spiking depending on demand, right? The fact that 500 people is using the network and 2000 people using the network should not change my price. Just like when I go use Amazon or a website, they don&#8217;t change my fees depending on the traffic from other people I&#8217;ve got, nothing to do with me. So Sui is designed to have flat pricing dollar wise. So Sui is the only network where gas would always be a flat number, dollar wise. In fact, gas will probably go down over time as we find more efficiency in hardware, right? But from a dollar perspective, as a user, gas should always be the same. That is a unique element of Sui. It&#8217;s object-based. So most developers in the world write in object-oriented languages. So the idea that everything is an object, my phone is an object, my pen is an object, that is a paradigm that human beings are accustomed to, not bits and bytes, which most probably languages you find in Ethereum or Solana will drive you to. I can have a smart contract and I could throw an object into it and I can use that object and smart contract and pass it back out and respect all the rules around that object. That is very Sui unique. And we believe Sui has the shortest learning curve of any blockchain because a proper language is very accustomed to what every other developer does. I think in a world of Web3 where there are only really about 15,000 depths in Web3, that is less than departments in Facebook, how we say, right? Like of developers with Web, there are 9 million JavaScript developers. We want to have a language that 9 million JavaScript developers can tend to. So every point that we have is scale. How do people build faster, cheaper, leaner in the ways that make sense, right? Also, we don&#8217;t have a max TPS as I mentioned and that&#8217;s also because of our object structure. Because everything is an object in Sui, we statically know it is something else contention versus not. So because of that, it means we don&#8217;t have to queue everything up in a queue just to process transactions, which is a bottleneck of every other chain. In Sui, I know that my transaction dealing with me sending money to you has nothing to do with someone doing land sales in the magic kingdom or wherever they be, right? So there are two different events. They should be queued separately. They have nothing to do with each other. We can still paralyze them and the more machines we have, the more transactions we can do. So it&#8217;s unique. The most unique element of Sui is the team and our minds in how we build. Everything we do is augmented towards growth. And the tech itself is very unique. We have something we&#8217;ve launched recently. Oh, before I go into ZK login, sponsored transactions, we think also the idea of gas is pretty much stupid for most users, right? Like the fact that I want to onboard into a game, and you say go and download the wallet, first download the wallet, then go and buy some token and then come back at an onboard. Well, we know from our experience in building systems for major organizations that flow doesn&#8217;t fly for 99% of use cases. So if you want to onboard games, you want to onboard, things that people really want to use, they have removed that friction. And there are two pieces of technology that Sui uniquely has that is ingrained in the protocol itself that doesn&#8217;t need middleware for it to work. One of them is sponsored transactions, which means accounts can freely transact in the Sui blockchain without any concept of gas, but it&#8217;s paid by another account in the B app and it&#8217;s completely transparent to the user. It&#8217;s just using the blockchain, which is more like SAS. Separately, we have something called ZK login, which is very unique and it&#8217;s only possible on Sui. And what we do is we effectively allow you to use any existing open ID account that you have in Web2 to authenticate an account on Sui in a decentralized way. What I mean by this is you don&#8217;t need to sign with some third party service or have someone constantly keys on your behalf for it to work or have some SAS agreement. No, you take your existing Google account, you basically use that to create a zero noise proof and you have an account on chain instantly. And a single API allows users to do that. Now, the most important thing is this means any website in the world that allows login with Google, login with Facebook, login with Twitch, which is a majority of sites of the world that basically can now serve billions of people across the world with assets natively on Sui. Now, it means anybody in the world with a Google account, a Facebook account, WeChat, anybody with an existing Web2 account that supports open ID, which is a myriad of them, has a Sui account, which means Sui is probably going to be the highest growing chain when it comes to reaching Web2 users that any other in the space, right? What&#8217;s important about that is now imagine a world where you have a global Venmo. I know your email address. I can simply write a transaction on Sui to your email at whatever.com. By the way, you can claim it, right? Like if you even claim it, the funds are either locked or the user can claim it back if they choose a withdrawal or a return mechanism in the contract, right? So it means I could send any asset in the world if previously I was delivering tickets, concert tickets using email. Now I can deliver them using Sui. I simply do a mass delivery by email on Sui. People receive their assets and it&#8217;s completely encrypted. And they can transfer those to people directly without having&#8230; Like how do you secure a ticket today, right? And you can even build secondary markets where if you want to transfer, here is a royalty fee. There&#8217;s required for secondary transfers. That&#8217;s enforceable. Now, programmable assets, I think, are going to be the future. I think Sui set up to do that at the skill is what we&#8217;ve seen. So you imagine experience in Sui where you don&#8217;t have to worry about gas. You don&#8217;t have to worry about wallets. You don&#8217;t have to worry about private keys. You simply use your email account or whatever account you have. You can use that to send value to anyone in the world that you already know or friends with. That is the use case that we care about. And that&#8217;s the use case that Sui enables uniquely at a scale there&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve seen before. So you don&#8217;t have to worry about high gas fees or have to worry about scale. You know, I think the kind of user profile or build a profile, you&#8217;re going to see on Sui, will be inherently Web2. It&#8217;s going to take us to, you know, we&#8217;re not concentrated on stealing market share from existing Web3 chains, which we are actually doing really well. Sui is the highest growing chain by TVL. There&#8217;s non-EVM related today. I think we just surpassed some of the chains that have been around for like two to three years. And we&#8217;ll continually grow that, but our interest is growing at pie. Adding net users in Web3, they&#8217;ve never used Web3. But more importantly, we do not want them to know anything about Sui or tokens. We just wanted to know that they&#8217;re using the infrastructure. How you choose to build on Sui or build using the Sui set of APIs because it offers you this flexibility and this composability that just throwing it on a database doesn&#8217;t offer you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I absolutely love that. Speaking of the new generation and Web2 users, we have to discuss the Gen Zers and their prominence of the digital economy, more specifically gaming. Every single one of these Gen Zers I&#8217;m generalizing here. 95% of them are absolutely addicted to video games and are on their phones 24/7. I have a cousin, she&#8217;s absolutely incredible. She has more friends on her Roblox than she does IRL. These are good friends of hers. This isn&#8217;t fugezzy. When I was her age, my best friends I was playing hockey, soccer, running, causing mischief, doing dumb shit in the schoolyard, running around streets. They&#8217;re online 24/7. You and the team understand the importance of gaming and the digital economy, that the newer generations are part of. How are you guys planning on onboarding the millions and millions and the new economy folks.</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I mean, you make the point and that&#8217;s clear. Like for us, gaming is the use case to bring the next billion users into web3. It is by far, a large way to do that. And the reason why it makes sense, gaming is always ahead on the technology curve. Like they innovate faster than they always adopt technology.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So true.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>And on top of that, when it comes to monetization, figure out monetization, think about the free to play model, gaming that at work, we were able to re-experiment openly and be willing to fail, whereas other industries are way slower to adopt this kind of tech, those kind of models. I think gaming for us is our biggest focus, and then next finance and commerce. So if you think about what we&#8217;ve done, we have 60 studios signed up to launch games on Sui, and these are from billion-dollar companies all the way to experienced studios who have been building games with some of the largest companies in the world. So we&#8217;re going to own, most of these games are high-quality Web2 games that users are already accustomed to the element of ownership. Ownership in games is already something users are accustomed to. And now Sui frees up that ownership model where they could do more interesting things that previously weren&#8217;t possible, whereas when they just store in assets on AWS or GCP. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re very excited about. I think that&#8217;s going to be where the hundreds of millions of users come from all the way to the billions, because they&#8217;re using it for extended shelf life of the game. They&#8217;re using it to enable it to charge closer to what the customer is willing to pay. They&#8217;re using it to also build new form of engagement and retention that wasn&#8217;t possible, and also new forms of marketing and targeting that just wasn&#8217;t possible previously. That was very expensive to do. So it isn&#8217;t an over-financialization of games, which I&#8217;ve seen others do to their detriment, because I think it&#8217;s one thing to lose a game. It&#8217;s another thing to lose a game and use money at the same time. But it&#8217;s making the games more fun, more engaging for people to play and keeping you around the game a lot longer, because it&#8217;s a more fun and inviting way for you to play and other assets. So that&#8217;s why gaming is huge for us. In fact, three of the largest gaming companies in Korea who previously led the way in free to play models are building on Sui already. And we have some of them who are fitting gaming studios and we&#8217;re all building on Sui. So there is a massive portfolio of games coming onto Sui, even some in Hollywood. Games from major Hollywood titles are coming onto Sui exclusively. That I&#8217;d love to share in the future as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Well, we&#8217;re definitely gonna have to have you on for round two. A couple more things and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. We are getting a little tight for time here. You discussed big brands, corporate brands, more specifically how they are currently partnering with Sui. I mean, we&#8217;ve heard the song and dance for what, four or five years now. How, oh, every Fortune 500 company is not gonna have a choice, but to join the blockchain world, joining Web3. I have seen very few actual use cases that are legit and have traction and have the magic word of crypto utility. You guys are actually moving the needle in the space. You got to get into this before we let you go.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh yeah, so you see a lot of press releases all the time, like, oh, this blockchain is partnered with X and Y and nothing really happened, all you read into it is really contract. You&#8217;re signing to pay the vendor to do something. And I&#8217;m just saying, there&#8217;s a lot of hype that we see. We don&#8217;t like wasting money and we don&#8217;t like to do partnerships that don&#8217;t make sense. I think our goal for us is to work with major brands, more key brands, to solve problems that are key to the way they do business. If it&#8217;s not an important thing for them, we&#8217;re not interested in working on those projects. But if it&#8217;s something related to their core business, and I think one of the biggest areas that we&#8217;re seeing companies care about more is fandom, right? Petronage, that&#8217;s the stuff that really matters with the big brands. We&#8217;re doing work where official sponsors and technology partners with Alka Red Bull, we&#8217;re going to be building a lot of fan-based, engaging tools for that ecosystem, for people to own assets, to trade assets, to basically level up and use NFTs and tokens and even digital assets as a way to create fans, or at least build fandom in a more engaging way that&#8217;s crucially possible. And this extends to lots of brands across the board, right? So it&#8217;s really the utility element of using the chain to solve business problems that we care about. Because what do we care about as a chain, right? We care about, you know, TPS. We want demand for the block space, which is infinite in suite. So the more block space, the more reviews the network makes for the participants of the network, we care about the daily active users. We think daily active users will come from massive existing ecosystems who can be onboarding into suite. And if you have a world where they don&#8217;t have to worry about wallets, they don&#8217;t have to worry about private keys, they don&#8217;t have to worry about gas, they can onboard into our ecosystem very quickly and gain value in the ecosystem very quickly without the friction or the barrier that 3 brings in most cases. So there&#8217;ll be a lot more polishes we are announcing that effect, but these polishes are specifically focused on business use cases that are paramount to their core business.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. Adeniyi, what an episode, man. You absolutely put my head in a blender in the best of ways possible. I got a lot of homework to do. This isn&#8217;t a show where guests come on and pitch their product. You didn&#8217;t do that, but you sort of did just because of how well-spoken you are and were and everything you said about Sui. This was an absolute treat. I really appreciate you coming on and non-negotiable. You must come on for round two, especially at the pace that you and the team are moving and grooving. This was a lot of fun and we barely scratched the surface. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you personally and Sui online and on socials?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m on Twitter, my username is @EmanAbio, E -M -A -N -A -B -I -O. And you can check us out at sui.io, very easy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>What&#8217;s the ideology behind the Twitter bio? Or Twitter handle, rather.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>My Christian name is Emmanuel, so Emmanuel Abio, then Eman Abio. But I go by Adeniyi for the time anyway.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Gotcha, love it. What a treatment. Absolutely incredible episode. Can&#8217;t wait to have you on round two.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeniyi Abiodun</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s an honor. Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with Adeniyi Abiodun, the Co-Founder and CPO of Mysten Labs. He was absolutely on Fuego this episode. We&#8217;d love to see it. Drop in knowledge bombs all over the place. What an episode, folks. I hope you enjoyed this one. If you did, it would mean the world to my team and I if you would subscribe. To the team, love you guys. Thank you so much for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor. You&#8217;re the GOAT. I appreciate you as always. And back to the listeners. Love you guys. Keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.&nbsp;</p>

We are buzzing as always. Before we get into the intro today, we have to go over the elephant in the room, and that is the current war that is happening. Obviously, we&#8217;ve had Russia, Ukraine for the last couple of years, which has been terrible, and we now have a new one with Palestine and Israel. Stuff that&#8217;s going on is I have goosebumps just doing this intro. It makes me sick to my stomach. Absolutely hate every little bit about this. We just want peace. That&#8217;s all we want. And hopefully we can have that and just sending my thoughts and prayers to everyone involved. Bob is sending his as well. And we hate this shit and our world&#8217;s a great place to live in, but sometimes it&#8217;s a very scary and not good place to live in. So wishing everyone the best that is involved, sending our thoughts and prayers, and hopefully this ends sooner rather than later. Let&#8217;s get into the crypto stuff here, though. Super pumped to have Bob Bodily on the show today, the Provo Utah Bay CEO and Co-Founder of Bioniq, a BTC Ordinals Wallet and Marketplace. Bob has a bachelor&#8217;s degree in neuroscience and a PhD in educational slash instructional technology from the one and only BYU. What a football squad they have as well. Bob also has 25 articles and 1,000 citations. He is a true data engineer with over 100,000 plus lines of production Python code produced. That is absolutely absurd. He also has two previous software startups, including an EdTech SaaS that sold in 2021. Super pumped to have you on. Bob, welcome to show my friend.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, thanks so much for having me. Really happy to be here and chat all things Bitcoin. I think it&#8217;s gonna be a pretty good time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>I&#8217;m pumped man. A couple of things on the bio that stand out here. First and foremost, BYU. Now, I am obviously a Canadian. I&#8217;m not an American. And there&#8217;s a lot of Canadians like myself, sports fans who do love college football. It&#8217;s such a treat. You know, role is in on Friday, takes over all of Saturday. BYU, beautiful, blue and white jerseys, crazy atmosphere. But then you hear the like Christian only school and you&#8217;re like, how is a team this good with only like, what&#8217;s the whole deal there? I&#8217;d love if we could start by you just give me a quick rundown of what goes on at BYU and how did they become, how did you guys become such a powerhouse in football?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, I mean, BYU has kind of always had a good football program. I mean, and I think they had one of the nation&#8217;s best programs back, you know, way back in the 60s or 70s or 80s, whenever it was, I think they basically went all the way one year. And since then, you know, always been a good football team, never been like the greatest football team, but always, always a good football program. And exactly like you said, like the fans, you know, BYU because the majority of people at BYU and maybe like half of the people in Utah are members of the church of Jesus Christ, the Latter-day Saints. So because of that, there&#8217;s a really excited fan base all across the country. And so it doesn&#8217;t really matter where you go. You&#8217;re going to find lots of BYU fans. So yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So cool. And the other thing we got to talk about in regards to education is having a bachelor&#8217;s degree in neuroscience. What made you get into neuroscience? Like that is, again, someone like me who doesn&#8217;t have a big science background. That&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s way above my pay grade. I couldn&#8217;t even fathom to understand how one gets into that or how one becomes an expert into that. When you were in high school, what made you be like, you know what? I&#8217;m gonna get into neuroscience. I&#8217;m just gonna understand how the friggin&#8217; brain works.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, I mean, high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I did all sorts of things in high school. I wasn&#8217;t really until, you know, after my first year or two or three of college, then I kind of just tried a bunch of things, tried business, tried statistics, tried exercise science, and then ended up in neuroscience because I really like learning and understanding how learning and memory work. And so understanding the like biological foundations of how the brain works was really fascinating. And then that continued over into my PhD in educational technology, where I took more of a less of a scientific and more of an applied approach, where now I wanted to learn about, you know, the psychology behind learning and how we can improve learning and took a kind of data analytics path through my PhD, where I leveraged, you know, my data science, data engineering skills to use data to improve teaching and learning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>It&#8217;s so cool. One last question on this kind of stuff before we get into the fun crypto and Bitcoin related stuff. Actually two more, but Elon Musk and Erlenk, you&#8217;re probably one of the few people who actually can have a pulse on this and an expert opinion on this. Does this have a chance of actually happening? Are we gonna have chips in our brains that allow us to, instead of me typing out some show notes, I can literally just look at the screen and my brain will compute to the computer what the hell is going on. Is that a possibility? Are we gonna see this in our lifetime?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s a great question. There&#8217;s something called a P300. It&#8217;s a specific kind of brain wave that happens when you decide to do something. And so we&#8217;ve already had for a long time, brain devices where you can stick an electrode in a specific spot and it can just listen for this kind of wave pattern. And then that&#8217;s how we get like, you know, eye trackers that just go on the screen based on what you&#8217;re thinking or even like a chair that moves based on what you&#8217;re thinking about. It&#8217;s really hard because if you think about every neuron in the brain and you think about different activation potentials, meaning different kinds of electrical signals you get like, you know, millions and millions of all of these things happening. So it becomes very hard to isolate the ones that you want. And so you have pretty applicable like topical ones that just go like on, but if you were able to get inside and get a closer attachment to the specific areas that you care about, then you would have a lot more granularity. And so there&#8217;s definitely potential here. It&#8217;s pretty messy. If you look at like EEG or if you look at like MRI data, it&#8217;s just very messy data because it&#8217;s just so much data. It&#8217;s the problem of big data. And so maybe, you know, maybe applying some kind of innovative AI could get you there. But again, you might just have a bunch of false positives because there&#8217;s just so much data.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Of course. Would you get one?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>If it worked, I mean, I&#8217;m kind of a tech geek in the sense that, you know, I can buy it if Elon makes it because why wouldn&#8217;t I?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I love that. Last thing, the Python lines. How the heck does one code 100,000 plus lines at that? Like that is absolutely bananas. Walk me through your coding journey, how did you get into being a programmer? And what was it like hitting that milestone? Because I, again, if I&#8217;m a betting man, I would say that a very small percent of the developer population has even touched like one tenth of that. How did you code so many lines? That&#8217;s actually bananas.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I mean, a lot of it was because I was doing quite a bit of work during my PhD, doing various analytics projects, also partly because I joined a couple startups and I was kind of a one-man data team. One-man data team meaning I was the data analyst and I was the data engineer and I was the data scientist and I was the VP of analytics that communicated everything back to the company. And so I was essentially running analytics for the marketing department and for a product and for sales and for the CEO. And so I just the nature of doing all of that means you just write a ton of code. So yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>And you&#8217;re just right in the way. That&#8217;s awesome. Let&#8217;s get into Bitcoin here. We are what are we today is Monday, October 9th. This episode is going to air in three days on the 12th, on Thursday, October 12th, fresh and hot off the press. We have what? March, April, I believe, is the halving scheduled. I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through the sort of present day Bitcoin 101 outlook, 360 degree outlook and overlook. What&#8217;s going on right now? What do we have to look forward to? Is the halving going to have the impact that it had on the future? How can we use RGP, Taproot, Lightning, DLCs? And after you give us all that good stuff, then we&#8217;ll get into ordinance, which is obviously still a very hot topic right now. But let&#8217;s start with just present day Bitcoin. What&#8217;s going on? If someone wanted a quick two to three minutes appeal to get them up to speed. What would you have to say about that?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, I would say some people are calling 2017 to 2022 the great stagnation on Bitcoin. That might be a bit strong, but with the rise of Ordinals, we really do have a renaissance on Bitcoin happening right now. January, Casey Roddermore released the 0.4.0 release of the Ordinals client that came as an indexer and an explorer. And with that, we had a massive renewed interest in building on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for builders again. If we were having this discussion in early January of this year, there would be a whole bunch of, maybe we could do this or maybe we could do that or maybe some of these things would work, but there would be nothing like concrete to point to. And now there&#8217;s so much to talk about that we could sit here for 10 hours and just dive into all of the things happening on Bitcoin right now because Ordinals really did kind of jumpstart Bitcoin again in terms of making it interesting for builders, for entrepreneurs, for developers, for people who always love Bitcoin but can never build on it. So, into other chains, build and now they&#8217;re coming back to their mother chain.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>And the OG, hold up, Bob, sorry to interrupt here. Before you get to your next point, can you just give a quick little primer on Ordinals? Just so our listeners and myself are fully up to speed on how important the Ordinals update was.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, Ordinals is the simplest way to think about it is NFTs on Bitcoin, where the image and the metadata and the token are all fully on chain. On Ethereum, a lot of times you have a token that&#8217;s just a pointer to IPFS or some other storage, so you don&#8217;t have the image actually on chain. There are only a few examples where all the data is stored on chain on Ethereum. On Bitcoin, by default, Ordinals are what you could call them digital artifacts, meaning stored forever on chain on Bitcoin, inheriting all the full decentralization and security of Bitcoin. There&#8217;s a way to connect a token to an asset that&#8217;s stored on Bitcoin, and then it&#8217;s tradable in UTXO fashion. That&#8217;s the gist.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>The biggest sort of value problem point on that was when we talk narratives, the narratives have so much power in crypto. Narratives have so much power in life, but especially in the crypto world where it&#8217;s so tech, prominent and very difficult to understand. There&#8217;s so much lingo. When you have a narrative, it allows you to simplify things and sort of have a better bird&#8217;s eye view of what the heck is going on. When I, before Ordinals, when I was pitching Bitcoin, and again, I obviously don&#8217;t have the tech background that you do, but my whole pitch was it&#8217;s really store value. And I couldn&#8217;t sort of give a whole lot of a better explanation than that, because if you look at it, you can&#8217;t really do shit with Bitcoin besides store value and send it to people. Now, again, people like you can obviously do a lot more with your tech background, but with the launch of Ordinals, now it&#8217;s like, okay, this isn&#8217;t just digital gold anymore. You know what I mean? So that was something that&#8217;s very powerful and I&#8217;m sure you agree. And I can&#8217;t wait to see what else is being built on that. Talk to me about RGB and Taproot, Lightning, what&#8217;s going on with those three big things. Because again, those are huge sort of layers of Bitcoin that we also need to keep building on in order for Bitcoin to not just be a store value.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, so like you mentioned, you know, Bitcoin&#8217;s always had this store value medium of exchange values or use cases. But now we&#8217;re starting to see people build fungible token protocols on Bitcoin, NFT protocols on Bitcoin, building DAO functionality, building governance tools, building identity services with name services. A lot of these things have existed for a long time, like we have counterparty going back to what, 2013, 2014. You know, counterparty had fungible tokens, counterparty had NFTs, but it wasn&#8217;t until Ordinals that we finally saw the big shift. You know, I don&#8217;t know what it was about the timing or about, you know, people sick of losing money in the bear market on other chains, but because we&#8217;re now seeing so much renewed interest, we kind of have to look back at all of the tech that we have that we&#8217;ve built on Bitcoin over the last, you know, 10 years. And we look at how can we leverage all of these technologies in light of what&#8217;s happening right now. So there&#8217;s some interesting synergies here between Lightning and RGB and Taproot assets. Taproot assets is currently under development used to be called TARO. And, you know, it&#8217;s essentially ways to do fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin. So, Taproot assets would essentially allow you to use Lightning to swap NFTs per se. Could be Ordinals, could be a different standard. I haven&#8217;t seen enough from the Taproot assets standard to know exactly how that&#8217;s going to fit in. But we definitely have, you know, there&#8217;s some combo of like Lightning, RGB, Taproot assets, maybe DLCs as well. DLCs leveraging essentially Bitcoin script. And then you have some kind of like third party oracle that gives you some kind of private key to unlock Bitcoin that&#8217;s been locked up in with some set of conditions. So there&#8217;s, you know, in terms of like actual developments, I think it&#8217;s all still in the works. Like I don&#8217;t have, on the ordinal side, I can point to fungible tokens with traction. I can point to standards with traction, different name service, metaprotocols, other things going on. With like rollups, sovereign rollups, basic rollups on Bitcoin. On the RGB, Lightning, Taproot assets side, I don&#8217;t really have anything to point to yet. So we&#8217;re getting there, but we&#8217;re not quite there yet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So shit is still being built, but nothing has been shipped yet. Gotcha. And that&#8217;s, yeah, that&#8217;s like one of the, not one of my issues per se, but I just, that&#8217;s something that we need. I hate talking price here, but I, again, I feel like we have to get into it just for a sec. What will it take Bitcoin specific to actually get Bitcoin to rip again? Because what again, when non-curtial people are asking me, Matt, when is Bitcoin going to rip again is now a good time to get in. One, I always tell them I&#8217;m not a financial advisor and I don&#8217;t know shit about shit. Yeah. You know, I&#8217;d be lying to my teeth if I told you, I have any clue where it&#8217;s going to go or how it&#8217;s going to go. Like anyone who does is, you know, again, people like you, yes, you have some merit there, a lot of merit, but who am I to tell you what the price of Bitcoin is going to do? I always say that it&#8217;s mostly non-Bitcoin related issues, i .e. World Wars, like what&#8217;s happening right now or inflation going rampant or something of the like, which would make the price of Bitcoin rise or fall. And it&#8217;s sort of unfortunate because it&#8217;s not, you know, you like when things are in your control and the price of Bitcoin is realistically out of Bitcoin&#8217;s control. Is there anything that can happen over the next six months, perhaps besides the halving that could actually impact the price of Bitcoin?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, I mean, in terms of price prediction, I always say, you know, just dollar cost average into the things that you believe in, and then you&#8217;re safe. And if price goes up, you can dollar cost average out if you want. But, you know, there&#8217;s, in terms of like price prediction, I mean, we&#8217;ve seen all kinds of people predict all kinds of things, and some of them will end up being right, you know, maybe due to chance, you know, it&#8217;s kind of a, trying to time the market is kind of a fool&#8217;s errand. I mean, maybe if you&#8217;re, you know, day trading for your job, you know, 10 hours a day, every day, then maybe you can, you know, start to see some signals there, but otherwise, I mean, just dollar cost average in. One thing I will say though, is with all of the renewed interest on the Bitcoin side, now we have applications being built on Bitcoin. We have lending protocols, we have marketplaces, we have DeFi, we have, you know, essentially all of the, if you think about the Ethereum ecosystem and think about the different kind of main categories of blockchain services, you have Governance DAO, you have identity, you have DeFi, you have NFTs, we&#8217;re seeing companies in all of these sectors currently building right now. So we&#8217;re seeing the beginnings of tons of interest in this application layer on Bitcoin, where previously we&#8217;ve had, you know, we&#8217;ve had RGB, we&#8217;ve had Lightning, we&#8217;ve had counterparty for a really long time. And, but we&#8217;re finally starting to see all of the pieces you need for a healthy ecosystem, blockchain ecosystem, come in, like more and more VCs are starting to have a Bitcoin thesis. Normally, you know, people would, a lot of VCs would avoid Bitcoin, because it&#8217;s just hard to build and there&#8217;s not enough interest there. And so, you know, we&#8217;re seeing funding, we&#8217;re seeing builders, we&#8217;re seeing users, users coming from all sorts of chains. You know, it&#8217;s almost like the melting pot of crypto right now is all of the people on Bitcoin, because a lot of people are Bitcoiners and just wanna build cool things. And so now that it&#8217;s easier to build on Bitcoin again, tons of people coming back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. I totally agree with you there. Bob and listeners, we have to take a quick break of a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. And when we get back, we are going to talk about side chains. We are going to talk about Ordinals Marketplaces, ZK Rollups, and the one and only Bioniq.

It&#8217;s still one of the areas of crypto that I still have a good amount of trouble understanding. It&#8217;s just so friggin complex. I get how it works. You get to give a piece of private information to the other party without them knowing who you are or that actual piece of information. It&#8217;s more of like a binary. Are they verified or are they not verified? A great example is always the ID thing where it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m, you know, now you and I, I assume don&#8217;t get ID if we go to the bar. You and I both got beards going on. We&#8217;re both, you know, elderly looking men. But back in the day, you know, when we were 21, 22, 23, instead of giving your ID to the bouncer where he can then see, oh, Bob lives in Utah at address X and is born on date X and has X color eyes. It&#8217;s binary. It&#8217;s Bob is of age. And that&#8217;s all that matters because that&#8217;s all they freaking care about. So it&#8217;s a absolutely brilliant piece of tech. I&#8217;m giving a real life example and not so much a tech related example, but ZK Rollups, we can&#8217;t really get these going until we have a Bitcoin upgrade. What&#8217;s going on in regards to the whole ZK Tech/Bitcoin thing right now.</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah. So you highlighted a really good use case for why is the ZK Rollups are great from a privacy perspective. You can have private data and verify that it&#8217;s true without revealing any of the information. So for KYC, for identity verification, for credentials, it makes perfect sense. And there are lots of really interesting companies doing this. There&#8217;s one I came across recently called Reclaim. Reclaim is not Bitcoin specific, but they connect to any Web2 endpoint. So you could say, I want to know if you have ever played a verified golf game, you know, an officially sanctioned game, and you could verify it by just going to the website and verifying the specific score. And then you would have this ZK proof that you could then get to this application saying, yes, I have a, you know, par or better score on this particular course or something without giving up who you are or when you did it or anything like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>Love that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Another interesting use case for ZK Rollups is scale. And so people are using it to scale. So the way that works is right now you have a replicated compute. It&#8217;s essentially a consensus layer on the compute side to verify that something is correct. So if I&#8217;m going to give you $10, that transaction is going to be propagated to thousands of people, and they&#8217;re all going to run that computation, and then they&#8217;re all going to agree that, yeah, this is the final resultant state, and this is correct. Instead of doing that, with the way that ZK proofs work is we just send the transactions to a sequencer. The sequencer is just like a collector, a transaction collector, and it orders them all and gets them all in a row, and then it sends them off to a prover. And the prover essentially proves that all of these things are valid and gives you a proof. And that proof then goes on Ethereum, and then Ethereum would validate that proof and say, yes, this is correct. At that point, you don&#8217;t care who did the proof or who did the computation, because instead of having thousands of people do the computation, and they all agree that it&#8217;s correct, you just have someone somewhere that does the proof and posts it on Ethereum, and then we can verify that it was done correctly without having to know all of the details associated with it. And so from a scaling perspective, ZK Rollups are all the rage. Right now, I would say on the Ethereum side, you have base, which just came out from Coinbase. So FriendTech, we have others like Arbitrum, ZKsync. These are all on the Ethereum side, and it&#8217;s easier to do L2s on Ethereum because Ethereum itself can verify those proofs. Ethereum has the computational capacity to do the proof verification. Bitcoin does not currently. And so because of that, you can&#8217;t do a true Layer-2 ZK Rollup on Bitcoin right now because Bitcoin can&#8217;t verify the proof. What you can do, and there are probably six or seven teams doing this right now, is you can do something called a sovereign rollup, which is a user verified proof system, rather than a L1 verified proof system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>Interesting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>And so sovereign rollup is nice because you still get all of the benefits of a, well, almost all the benefits of a Layer-2. And then as a user, maybe you run a light client in your browser or something that has all the block headers. And then you can verify yourself without trusting anyone else. You can just look at the proofs on the blockchain and you can verify yourself what the current state of this L2 is. That&#8217;s probably the best you can do on Bitcoin right now is a sovereign rollup.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>It&#8217;s very interesting. Quick little funny side story, because you gave obviously, you know, I&#8217;m a big golf I mean. I dress like a golfer for all my pods as well. And especially while I&#8217;m not traveling, but working remote, you know, I don&#8217;t have a lot of dress shirts. And you know, I, yes, I&#8217;m the same as you. My whole wardrobe is black, T&#8217;s, white T&#8217;s, blue T&#8217;s, red T&#8217;s. I&#8217;m a plain T. I&#8217;m not a logo guy. But anyways, back to the funny golf story and with verification. And this is, could have been a great use for ZK Tech IRL in real life. There was a store in London, like a bougie, you know, shoe store that got 200 pairs of the new Jordan Travis Scott Lowe&#8217;s, which, you know, they go for like 500 pounds, 500 British pounds, a pop kind of thing. And of course, like anything else, when it comes to the shoe game, you have a bunch of resellers. These guys, true golf fans, they&#8217;re like, screw that. We don&#8217;t want people to come in, buy them for 500, flip them for a grand or a couple grand. So we&#8217;re like, we&#8217;re going to give it to golfers. What did they do? They made you go to their golf simulator in the store and actually show that if you&#8217;re a male, you have to hit the ball 200 yards. And if you&#8217;re a female, you have to hit it 150. And that&#8217;s such an easy way. Cause if you don&#8217;t golf, it&#8217;s not that easy to hit a driver 200 yards. So I think they gave you like two or three shots and anyone who&#8217;s at decent at golf can most likely do that. But if you&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s not happening. So just a great example, IRL, when, you know, they kind of just rolled up, showed the piece of tech and boom, it would have worked. So I love that. That&#8217;s just a great segue. You put that on a platter for me. That was a great layup. What about side chains? We have tons of work going on with decentralized Multisig bridges. What&#8217;s going on in this regard? Again, this is a little bit above my pay grade. I&#8217;ve seen this on Twitter. I&#8217;ve seen you talk about this on Twitter, but Bitcoin side chains. What&#8217;s going on in this regard right now?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, so I&#8217;m currently building on a Bitcoin side chain. Bioniq is built on a Bitcoin side chain named ICP, that&#8217;s Internet Computer Protocol. ICP has a lot of really great kind of protocol primitives that make it really easy to build Bitcoin solutions on. The reason we&#8217;re building on a Bitcoin side chain right now is because it has everything we need right now and it&#8217;s ready to go and it&#8217;s in production and it&#8217;s just there and ready. If you look at sovereign rollups on Bitcoin, they&#8217;re in development, really exciting tech that I&#8217;m staying up on and there&#8217;s a chance that maybe we push to kind of like transition Bioniq from side chain to like a sovereign rollup in the future, but the tech just isn&#8217;t quite there yet. Similarly, we talked about Lightning and RGB and teppered assets and DLCs and I think all of the tech there is also really interesting, building in a more Bitcoin native way, but you just can&#8217;t do the things that I wanna do there yet. And so I&#8217;m watching it and keeping up to speed on it because I think it&#8217;s all really interesting, but currently I&#8217;m building on a side chain because it&#8217;s here and it&#8217;s ready to go and we have a nice decentralized Multisig bridge for Bitcoin as well as for Ordinals. We&#8217;re thinking about expanding that in the future to maybe like BRC20s or other fungible token protocols or maybe even other asset protocols like stamps. So for all of those reasons, just makes sense for us to build on a side chain right now. Like let&#8217;s leverage Bitcoin for everything that we can right now and let&#8217;s make a product that users want right now. That&#8217;s really easy to use, that can grow the number of people using Bitcoin and then as the tech matures, then we can think about, find ways to remove some of these trust assumptions that we&#8217;ve built in by building on a side chain. So that&#8217;s kind of the path right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>Well said, could you give a quick primer on ICP? We&#8217;ve had a couple of guests from the ICP team who have been absolutely incredible. And this is one that I wasn&#8217;t to, I&#8217;d always see it on like the sort of top 100 coins on CoinGecko or CMC, but you know, it was never really front of mind until I had a couple of guests on the show. And then after reading and doing research and learning from my guests, from my incredible guests about how powerful it is and how much potential it really has, truly a friggin pretty darn awesome sidechain. I&#8217;d love you to give just a quick primer on what ICP is and why it&#8217;s such a good partner with Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, the best way to think about ICP is decentralized web services. So it&#8217;s like Amazon web services, but decentralized web services. What that means is you get compute, just like Ethereum, but you also get storage and you get hosting all in one. So that means with a smart contract on ICP, you can have compute layer like a smart contract. You can also host data directly, like store data directly in your smart contract. You pay $5 per gigabyte per year, so relatively inexpensive. And you can host front ends or make HTTP calls directly from a smart contract. So it&#8217;s more like Web2&nbsp; web services platform, but it&#8217;s a blockchain. It&#8217;s a sharded chain. So there are a bunch of different subnets. I&#8217;m gonna call these native subnets because you use the same token across all the subnets. On other chains like Avalanche or even like STAX, STAX has a subnet architecture that they&#8217;ve been talking about. Generally those are like separate blockchains where you have to peg in and out of the subnets. You have to have a different token. You have to have new nodes. On ICP, it&#8217;s all kind of just a cohesive, horizontally scaling blockchain. There are a couple other nice things about ICP, like a reverse gas model. Reverse gas model means users don&#8217;t pay gas fees by default. The developers pay all of the gas fees for the users, and that&#8217;s because of the subnet architecture. The gas fees are so low that it makes sense to just abstract that complexity away from the user. So for a user, it&#8217;s really nice. You can sign up and do on chain interactions with no tokens. And so the user experience is just really beautiful. By having to go and, in order to do a transaction on Ethereum, you have to go and KYC with Coinbase and get some Ethereum, get a MetaMask and transfer the ETH over and then figure out how to hook everything up. So the fact that users can just click a button, sign in and go is incredible from the user experience side. You get other benefits like transactions are fast, two to five second finality on all of your transactions. So yeah, I mean, that&#8217;s kind of the gist of ICP as a protocol. And then they&#8217;ve been building a couple different Bitcoin integrations. So there&#8217;s a Bitcoin light node that&#8217;s running fully on chain on ICP. So if you want to query and get balances or get the UTXOs in a particular address, you can do that all on chain. There&#8217;s also a threshold signing algorithm called TCDSA. This is just a signature scheme, but basically means you can sign Bitcoin transactions directly on chain. That means a smart contract can create and sign and broadcast a Bitcoin transaction natively from the smart contract, which is also really cool. And then there&#8217;s also a wrapped Bitcoin on ICP called ckBTC. That&#8217;s the wrapped Bitcoin on ICP. It&#8217;s essentially a glorified Multisig bridge. It&#8217;s a little bit better than that, but yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>Great primer. That was all world. Thank you for that. Let&#8217;s get into Bioniq, the bread butter, the show that is your baby. To my knowledge, it is a sort of a different Ordinal&#8217;s Marketplace, but the friendliest, cleanest, sexiest UX UI, no fee transfer to Ordinals, 10 sat to transfer to ckBTC, just like a user friendly. Perhaps I&#8217;m butchering this, but almost like a G suite where it&#8217;s like very reasonably priced, super powerful, super user friendly. It just makes life super easy. What&#8217;s what&#8217;s good with Bioniq and why did you guys create that with the ordinal&#8217;s marketplace already being such a powerhouse?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, so it was probably February 6th. This was like two weeks after Casey released, or at 0.4.0 and based on everything I was seeing, I was convinced Ordinals were gonna be absolutely massive. So then we started building Bioniq. Bioniq is basically done at this point, ready to launch in the next week or two, or three or four depending on the technical complex. We just, of course, in the next week. But yeah, our focus is, there&#8217;s already lots of infrastructure on the Ordinal side. There&#8217;s wallets, there&#8217;s marketplaces, there&#8217;s lots of collections, lots of good volume going on. And our goal is not to diminish or even fight for any of that. Our goal is like, how can we grow the pie for everyone? How can we bring more people to Bitcoin? How can we bring more volume to the ordinal&#8217;s ecosystem? And the way that we&#8217;re gonna do that is just by having a really nice, easy to use, easy to access Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace that just is a nice experience for people who may not be very technical on the crypto side. So, goal is if you&#8217;re holding Bitcoin on Robinhood or Coinbase or Binance and you don&#8217;t own Ordinals yet, that&#8217;s our target market. We want those people and try Bioniq. And our login experience is really nice. Like if you want, you could log in with Google. We&#8217;re using Web3 Auth, which is a, it&#8217;s a best non-custodial key management while still leveraging something like login with Google. So click login with Google, either transfer your Bitcoin over or pretty soon we&#8217;ll have just like a top up with Stripe option just right there on the wallet, top up with credit card or whatever you want. Now you have Bitcoin, just one click to convert from Bitcoin to the wrapped Bitcoin. And then you&#8217;re off to the races. You can buy Ordinals, you can transfer Ordinals, you can receive and send Bitcoin. We have a wallet that&#8217;s just built in. So you don&#8217;t have to have a Chrome extension, you don&#8217;t have to go anywhere else. It&#8217;s just all right there for you. And then we have a couple other kind of interesting features coming down the pipeline as well that&#8217;ll make it really affordable for people who want to launch collections on Bitcoin but don&#8217;t want to have to pay to inscribe their full collection on Bitcoin. So yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>Oh, that&#8217;s awesome. The whole logging in with Google and buying Bitcoin to Stripe, that&#8217;s what we need. And I&#8217;ve said this so many times on the show, I&#8217;m probably, I&#8217;m beating a dead horse right now, so my apologies to all the listeners, the OGs who tune into every episode, but it&#8217;s still in my eyes, the absolute biggest problem with crypto. On one end, you have the bad actors, and on the other end, you have the shit show user experience getting someone. I always use my parents as an example to go from Canadian exchange onboarding to MetaMask over to Protocol XYZ. It&#8217;s just like, what are we doing here, folks? It&#8217;s got to be cleaner, it&#8217;s got to be sexier, it&#8217;s got to be easy. And it&#8217;s just that this is why I love having people like you on the show, because you guys are actually moving the friggin needle. And again, just something huge that I absolutely love. Bob, this is an absolute treat. We are getting a little tight for time. Last subject that I would love to get into. And this is one of your best tweets. I mean, your Twitter is fire. Definitely going to have to plug that. And you will be able to plug that in a couple of minutes. But Bitcoin&#8217;s Meta Protocol Layers, you developed an absolute fire infographic. I&#8217;d love if you could just do a quick little deep dive on the Meta Protocol Layers and why they&#8217;re so important and what we have to look forward to in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. So if you think about Ordinals or BRC-20 or ORC-20 or ARC20 or BRC-21, like there are a million metaprotocols on Bitcoin now because it&#8217;s so easy to do. And metaprotocols are essentially layers that sit on top of Bitcoin. They use Bitcoin as a data availability layer. So a hundred percent of the data is stored on Bitcoin. And then you have an off chain indexer that actually indexes all of those. And then, you know, gives you your final L2 state. I call it L2, but it&#8217;s like a metaprotocol state. For this reason, metaprotocols are more centralized than Bitcoin itself, more centralized because you only have a single indexer, maybe a few indexers. And, you know, if one of these indexers gives incorrect information, then if you&#8217;re trading, you know, you could actually lose funds. So metaprotocols are more centralized than Bitcoin itself, but it&#8217;s a really easy way to spin up a new protocol. So we&#8217;ve seen all kinds, probably dozens and dozens of fungible token protocols, other kind of non fungible token protocols like Ordinals. We&#8217;ve also seen stamps and we&#8217;ve seen others as well coming down the pipeline. And so metaprotocols is largely the reason why we&#8217;ve seen this renewed interest and excitement around Bitcoin. We&#8217;ve had name services launched as metaprotocols. We&#8217;ve had, I mean, essentially anything you can think of, new services, anything a smart contract could do. We&#8217;ve seen people try to do it with metaprotocols on Bitcoin. So I&#8217;m really interesting. You know, I&#8217;m always plugging for, you know, trying to figure out how we can decentralize this kind of more centralized metaprotocol indexing layer. And I think there are a couple of ways to do that, but kind of challenging.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>I love that. Bob, what a treat of an episode. You sort of put my mind in a pretzel here. It&#8217;s definitely a bit of a blender. Got a lot of homework to do and I&#8217;m grateful for that. Thank you so much for coming on. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you, where they can find Tonic Labs and where they can find Bioniq online and on socials.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily&nbsp;</strong><br>Yeah, I&#8217;m very active on Twitter. Please DM me if anything I&#8217;ve said today is interesting. It&#8217;s just @BobBodily on Twitter. I&#8217;m very responsive to DMs. And then Bioniq is just @bioniqMarket. You can find it in my bio as well on Twitter. You know, hoping to release Bioniq soon. We&#8217;ll see how quickly we can get all the final technical things in order. I&#8217;m really excited to get Bioniq out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab&nbsp;</strong><br>Thanks a lot for coming on man. This was an absolute treat. Can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two and when I&#8217;m in Utah next year, gotta hit you up. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re a golfer or not, but if you are, the golf on me will gotta go to one of the nice tracks in Utah. It&#8217;s too nice there, too nice to not golf there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily</strong>&nbsp;<br>I got par on this whole once. I had a beautiful drive. I had a beautiful approach. I was like, you know, I don&#8217;t know, five feet away and then I triple putted. And so heartbreak.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s the thing with golf. As you start out to be a beginner and continue to get better, there&#8217;s always, and I have this theory that the golf gods, they always give you one or two shots. All the beginners who are shooting 120, 130, you have one or two shots that sends this electric rush through your body. It&#8217;s an absolute electric factory feeling and it gets you hooked. There&#8217;s a reason why once you start, most people don&#8217;t stop. As you continue to have those good, couple of good shots every round, you just get hooked. And my whole thing with golf, what better way to spend four hours in nature with your friends? Like, you know what I, it&#8217;s just, you get to, you get a couple, you get 10,000, 12,000 steps in, you get some time away from the lady or whoever it may be, which is again, super healthy. And you get to spend some time with your boys. It&#8217;s just like, there&#8217;s nothing better. And there&#8217;s nothing better. Bob, I appreciate you coming on, man. Absolute treat of an episode and can&#8217;t wait for round two.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bob Bodily</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, thanks so much.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with Bob Bodily, Utah Bay CEO and Co-Founder of Bioniq and Tonic Labs. He was dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center. Everyone loves Bitcoin and this was a great primer and catch-up episode for what we have to afford to in the future, what&#8217;s going on and what has happened in the past. Huge shout out to Bob and the team for making this happen. Listeners, love you guys. Thank you as always for tuning in. If you enjoyed this one and I hope you did, please do subscribe. To my team, love you guys. Thank you so much for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor. You are the GOAT. Appreciate you so much. And back to the listeners. Love you guys. Keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.&nbsp;</p>

It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always, and I am super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, the one and only Toby Rush, CEO and Co-Founder of Deem. Toby is a 20-year industry vet with extensive deep tech experience as both a founder and investor. Before getting into all of the fun crypto stuff, Toby led international technology investments team for Ant Group, the payments subsidiary of Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group, ever heard of them. Prior to that, he was the CEO of ZOLOZ, an Alibaba digital identity platform. And also did EyeVerify, which was acquired by an affiliate of Chinese tech conglomerate Alibaba for 100 mil in 2016. Holy shit, that is crazy. Toby also Co-Founded Rush Tracking Systems. I love that through a little last name in there. A computer vision and RFID solutions venture to a successful exit to a private equity firm. Toby also has a BS in Engineering from Kansas State University and lives in the one and only Kansas City, Kansas Go Chiefs. We love to see it. Toby, welcome to the show. My friend, pumped to have you on. How you doing?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>Awesome Matt, excited to be here. Thanks for having me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think we got to start with the elephant in the room here. Your background is so fricking sweet. For the listeners at home who are most likely in your car or on a walk or doing chores or whatever, what most people do on a podcast, do tune into the video version. You guys have to see Toby&#8217;s background. Toby, what is going on there? It literally looks like a fake background.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it has been very blessed. Yeah, so I was a starving artist, entrepreneur for a time. And the home office was the spare bedroom. It was the basement. It was the van. Look, literally the bathroom. It&#8217;s like, where have you can find a quiet spot in the house? And my last exit, we did well financially. I was like, hey, let&#8217;s go build a house. This is back in 2017. And they were like, dude, I&#8217;m gonna build a house. I&#8217;d like to have at least a decent home office. Well, come 2020 and COVID, all of a sudden everybody&#8217;s working from home. So when I built my office, I had no idea anybody would ever be seeing it on Zoom. Every day or things like this. Like these were always done at the office, right? So yeah, so ended up being really sweet. I love my office. I spent a ton of time here. I&#8217;m huge into woodworking. So I got a lot of my pieces around the office as well. And it feels like home.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s pretty crazy how much of a flex a good office background is or just Zoom or Google Meet or Teams background is nowadays. Like everyone gets judged on it. And it&#8217;s not one of those like good or bad judging. I feel like it&#8217;s only good if you have a shitty background. It&#8217;s like, I mean, they&#8217;re just working good for them. But if you have a sick background, it&#8217;s like, man, this slaps. Like this is it. It&#8217;s crazy how times have changed. I love that though. It&#8217;s too good. Let&#8217;s jump right into it here. You have, I mean, that&#8217;s a bananas bio, quite the bio, tons of acquisitions, investments, big groups working with Alibaba. Before we get into the crypto stuff in present day at Deem, which huge shout out to you and the team. Obviously you guys had the raise earlier this year and the recent rebrand from Redeem to Deem. But again, Redeem is now gonzo. It is just Deem. So we&#8217;ll be sticking to that. But before you go into that, give me the quick sort of two minute elevator pitch. The TLDR, your childhood, you know, how did you get into bed with Chinese tech giants like Alibaba? All the tech you&#8217;ve worked on, you know, the ins and outs of getting companies acquired, walk me through that whole spiel, then we&#8217;ll get into the star of the show, the crypto stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>No, it&#8217;s actually, it really leads into just the framing of the world for me, how I understand the world. So this is actually very helpful, even as kind of what we&#8217;re doing here at Deem. So I grew up in the most entrepreneurial environment you could ever hope for, and it&#8217;s called the family farm. Like so I grew up in a kind of a farm in the Northeast of Kansas. And my dad was a CEO and the CFO and the COO, and he literally ran a business every day. And so they just kind of grew up and allowance wasn&#8217;t a word that my family used. And so if you wanted any sideline, you better go figure out a hustle. And so I was always hustling, I always had little side businesses and companies growing up. And so that just really stuck with me. Very technical, engineering early days. Got into doing my own startups 20 years ago. So we put, and all three of my companies, you&#8217;ll see a theme of about using advanced technology, but all around simplicity, convenience, taking steps out of the equation, letting convenience and intuitiveness. My first company, we ended up putting cameras and technology on forklifts and warehouses. Because what I realized was that forklift drivers really want to be race car drivers. They don&#8217;t want to drive like bats out of hell, but they always have to slow down to barcode scan everything. And I&#8217;m like, I bet we could put cameras on the truck and eliminate all that barcode scanning, which we did. So we put a camera in the front of the truck to automate the pallet pickup and put down. And then we put a camera on the top of the truck. So what we realized is an unobstructed view to the ceiling, and I could put 2D barcodes in the ceiling, and it was like my own indoor GPS system. Right? And so we basically tracked all of the automated, all of the data collection that the warehouse operator needed, and literally forklift drivers could drive as fast as they wanted. And everybody was happy. So that went to a private equity, kind of computer vision was the link to the next company. And this was back in 2011, came across a professor, and he was doing an eye-based biometric but using just regular cameras. So most biometrics take special hardware, they&#8217;re pretty expensive. Back in the day, biometrics were really the only military airports and immigration. And I came across this professor, and I&#8217;m like, whoa, that&#8217;s fascinating, you can do that with pure software. Hey, we should look at doing passwords on smartphones and use these literally new selfie cameras at the time on these smartphones. And everybody was like, why would anybody do passwords and biometrics on smartphones, like no one&#8217;s doing that. And I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know, man, if I could just look at my phone, the convenience and the simplicity and the intuitive nature of being able to look at my phone, and that logged me in, I could do painting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sorry to interrupt, what year was this?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>This was 2011. So to put it in context, Apple came out with Touch ID in 2013 and Apple Pay in 2014. Right? So we were, got lucky, right place, right time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sorry, last thing on this, and my apologies for being a brutal interrupter here. What was the catalyst? What was the aha light bulb moment that was like, holy shit, why aren&#8217;t we doing this? Was there a specific time and place or was just like, many times where you thought, oh, this would be a much more efficient and simplistic way? Like you started the show with, you&#8217;re big on simplifying and efficiencyizing technology.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think there was always this inherent if I could just use sensors that are already present and fully deployed and build on top of that, right? So I didn&#8217;t have to sell hardware. I didn&#8217;t have to encourage people to upgrade phones. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about, do I have cellular connectivity? I didn&#8217;t have to, like all these things were built in. So how do you then kind of leverage, widely deployed, adopt that accepted platforms and then build kind of incremental benefits on top of that kind of for that consumers? That just felt like, like this should happen. We got lucky, totally lucky, and that Apple came out with Touch ID a year and a half after we launched the company, right? And that consumerized it and made it normal. So now biometrics on smartphones are like, of course people would do biometrics on smartphones. Of course that makes sense. And then Apple pay and kind of Touch ID, kind of being able to go into banking, that was the big unlock. Because otherwise, oh yeah, biometrics on phones cool, biometrics on phones used for payments and for banking and movement of money, brilliant. And that&#8217;s kind of what kind of, again, so much of entrepreneurship is, right place, right time, and we got lucky. Again, we had 60 banks in production, kind of using kind of our tech and platform and then mobile apps. AliPay was one of our customers that we were working with. They said, hey, this is fascinating. We wanna bring this in-house and really scale it globally. And so when I joined Ant Group, which think of it as kind of a PayPal and a Geico and a bank all together, right? That&#8217;s kind of what Ant Group is. It&#8217;s like, hey, we could really solve the identity problems for so many of the people you&#8217;re bringing onto your platform. And I think China, India, Indonesia, Southeast Asia, who really have, they don&#8217;t have computers, they don&#8217;t understand tech, but if they always have their phone, and if we could biometric and verify them into their payment wallet, we could serve kind of all their buy and match your identity needs. And so that&#8217;s kind of the charge. And so my charge when I joined Ant, and kind of working with executives there, like the goal is two billion users. Two billion users, that&#8217;s a lot of users.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>A quarter of the population.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>But what&#8217;s crazy when you take just China, India and Indonesia, that&#8217;s half the world&#8217;s population. And just those three countries. It&#8217;s a crazy volume. Anyways, we had a blast loved it. They asked me to join their investments team with a specific focus on blockchain. But in China, there is no cryptocurrencies and there are no crypto punks. Like there are no speculative NFTs. And so my always the focus is about, hey, how does blockchain make things better, faster, stronger, cheaper, more intuitive? How do we use Cortech, not as a speculative asset, but really as Cortechs? That was kind of what I was with kind of Ant and Alibaba. But a year and a half ago, again, still very much in the kind of the Web3 in blockchain world, as it began to look at the market and really understood it more deeply, became a huge believer in this idea of open ecosystems. Right? And so in fact, I usually open ecosystems more than decentralization could be like, wait, what is decentralization in like their heads? Like don&#8217;t get it. But when you say, you know, there are five tech companies, at least in the US, that absolutely dominate everything and they make all the rules. You got Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. But they make 90% of the rules, if not more. And they&#8217;re only gonna make rules that benefit them. But if you can have data that could live in open ecosystems, you get innovation, you get creativity, you get thousands and thousands of companies and startups that are able to innovate and create on these open data that aren&#8217;t confined by the walled gardens of the big tech companies. And so that idea is always fascinating. It&#8217;s whether that&#8217;s ticketing or titles or policies or credentials or certificates or there&#8217;s so many things that effectively you could put online, let live in an open ecosystem. But then the question, how do you trust it? Like how do you know this is real? Like who are you from? Because I can&#8217;t go to Apple and say, hey, does Matt really own ABC123? Because we all know the number, who owns it? That&#8217;s exactly what NFTs are. And those NFTs go into wallets. Yeah, so digital ownership, I think is there such a massive unlock that I think somewhat unfortunately, the two use cases that got out of the gate first were just buying and selling cryptocurrencies, which is a use case on blockchain. And then buying and selling of digital collectibles as NFTs. And those are great use cases, but there are so many more. And those two so dominated the market, and everybody hears blockchain and they think, oh yeah, those Ponzi schemes. I&#8217;m like, no, they&#8217;re not Ponzi schemes and no all cryptocurrencies aren&#8217;t bad. And so there&#8217;s a lot of education we have to kind of help the market understand. And frankly, we just stopped selling technology. We just start selling use cases and benefits.</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said, very well said there. I mean, that&#8217;s always as a marketer, that&#8217;s one of the first things you always learn. And I always tell the story of going back to when I, you know, helped scale a startup from 100K to 50 mil, that was Hush Blankets, we saw way to blankets. And then, you know, eventually got into the whole bedding vertical. And when you sell someone on 500 dread count, 25 pounds, XYZ, which are all the features, they don&#8217;t give a shit. But when you go, it&#8217;s gonna make you fall asleep quicker, stay asleep longer and wake up more refreshed. I mean, come on, that&#8217;s sexy, that&#8217;s in your face. So I love that, you get it. That was a great little spiel. Before we get into Deem, one last question. I&#8217;m always curious, I don&#8217;t know why, I have a lot of weird, you know, curiosities that really don&#8217;t have a reason. But I mean, c&rsquo;est la vie, what&#8217;s it like working for a company like Alibaba or Aligroup? Because you hear about, you know, it&#8217;s the Chinese Amazon, it&#8217;s an absolute behemoth. Like, what was it like, any very crazy, like cultural differences, working differences, just differences as a whole. Give me some of the big like, aha moments, where you&#8217;re like, holy shit, what is real life right now? I&#8217;m sure you got some incredible stories.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>So one, I have massive respect for Alibaba and a number of other tech companies. I mean, China gets a bad rap. I mean, clearly there are some bad actors in China. Like they&#8217;re bad actors in every country. And people assume like the Chinese government is very authoritarian. They do a lot of stuff that, you know, I don&#8217;t agree with a lot of others don&#8217;t agree with. And they assume that all Chinese are equivalent to their government. Like the US wouldn&#8217;t be very happy if we were always represented simply as our government, right? Because our government doesn&#8217;t do that nice things up. But no, I was super impressed, super innovative, aggressive. Their scale, like it is really hard to impress upon people who don&#8217;t live in China. How big Alibaba and Tencent are, like they dominate that particular landscape. It was by far the hardest leadership job I&#8217;ve ever had. So I was cool. I was able to be on the top 350 kind of executives across all of Alibaba group. Right? It was pretty cool. I&#8217;m getting to hang out with Jack Ma and Josai, you know, and votes for him. I really good to see a lot. And the cultural disconnect is crazy just because the vast majority of Alibaba is of course in China. I&#8217;m like, just to give you some really funny examples. So one of the things they really talk about is, hey, you need to work hard. You need to care for your family. Make sure you always have like your family in mind. And so the US interpreted, so I had teams in Beijing, Singapore, San Francisco and Kansas City. Right? So my US team, they would hear that and they&#8217;re like, oh, I need to care for my family. I need to make sure I&#8217;m not working 16 hours a day and care for my family because I&#8217;ve got to have a little bit of a balance here. The Chinese understood that very differently. I got to care for my family. I need to work 17 hours a day because I need to make sure my generation can have a next level up. I need to commit more time. And it was like, again, words and they were totally, and when I realized this, I&#8217;m like, holy smokes. Like same words, very different interpretations. And I&#8217;ve got a story. Yeah. Again, good intention, well-meaning people, but whoof. Cultural and language differences.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How many trips to China did you take?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh my goodness. I was with them for three or four years. I played probably every six weeks. I was over there, which is a lot. I actually was close to moving to Singapore, kind of at one point, just to make it so easier.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, that&#8217;s crazy, man. Good God. Let&#8217;s get into the start of the show. The second start of the show after Toby, which is Deem. Give me the quick TLDR, the quick elevator pitch on Deem, and then we&#8217;ll get into some of the fun stuff. Things that interest me the most is your take on how the future of Web3 is via mobile, which I absolutely love and completely agree with. We are addicted to our phones all the time. Quick little funny story. I&#8217;m actually at my parents&#8217; house. Just house sitting right now. My parents are in Switzerland enjoying their lives. Someone&#8217;s got to look after the crib. So me and my brother take our turns. Nonetheless, my grandma had a problem with her iPad. So she came over, I fixed her iPad. Guess what her screen time was for last week? Zero. She gets the notification. I&#8217;m like, I would do bad things to have zero average screen time per day. We are glued to our phones, man. It is bananas. But anyways, walk me through what you and the team are doing at Deem. And then we&#8217;ll get into some of the NFT ticketing and the future of Web3 mobile.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yep, absolutely. So as I began really diving in and understanding Web3, again, as I mentioned before, fascinated by this idea of open ecosystems owning your own data, innovating creativity, composability of what we can do. And as again, folks listening to the show have been in the Web3, it&#8217;s getting better, but holy smokes, the UX is terrible. And just normal people don&#8217;t understand, it&#8217;s a big mental shift. Like we&#8217;re asking you, not only is it a different mental model, but the way that we onboard into Web3 and then continue to engage with Web3 and all the way this is a wallet, why do I keep signing and why do I have to go out to my wallet and then kind of come back into my app and there&#8217;s all these things go crazy confusing. And so there&#8217;s like my thinking of like there&#8217;s gotta be an easier way just to make the engagement and ongoing transactions in the world of Web3 a lot easier. And then it kind of actually went back a little bit to my days of with EyeVerify and Alibaba and like, why don&#8217;t we just use our phones? Like how come someone hasn&#8217;t wrapped a really simple scaffolding and infrastructure around your phone to make it like this connectivity layer into all things digital, right? Because the cool thing about your phone is it has a globally unique number bound very tightly to that phone number through the SIM card. Whereas you have a cryptographic proof that there is one number in the world that can be on this device in my hand right now. That&#8217;s pretty crazy, right? I&#8217;m gonna put the country code in front of it globally. There&#8217;s only one device and this device also happens to have a biometric scanner. Right? There&#8217;s actually pretty convenient. I set it up, I use it for a lot of things. They all have browsers, they all have messaging app and now some of the newer things carriers allow you to call kind of an API with, you know, T Mobile Verizon, T Mobile AT&amp;T or Vodafone O2 wherever you&#8217;re curious. I can call any, there are API and say, hey, is this phone number active on this device right now? And it&#8217;s the same API they use as a, can this phone access my network? Right? so again, they&#8217;ve spent hundreds of billions of dollars saying, hey, we got to make sure that this phone number on this SIM card can access my network, but now they&#8217;ve opened that up as an API. So what we&#8217;ve done is really turned your phone into what we&#8217;re calling an OAuth provider, right? So when you log in with Google, Apple, Facebook, what you&#8217;re doing is you&#8217;re going to Google, Facebook, Apple, Facebook, say, hey, log this person in and let me know that it&#8217;s really Matt. And then they&#8217;ll give the calling app back a token. So yep, we confirmed that this is Matt. We&#8217;ve turned your phone into that. So if you possess your phone, you have your security, you have your password, right? In fact, what&#8217;s cool about it is we can also tell because with the carrier, we know it&#8217;s not a virtual phone, right, it&#8217;s not a Google phone, right? And so you actually get proof of humanity, proof of humanhood, you do a biometric scan, you have proof of ownership with a globally unique digital identity that nobody else can have, right? But you can maintain the privacy because we don&#8217;t need to give your phone number out. We give OAuth tokens, like we give these, just again, random, not random, they&#8217;re unique tokens, but it is OAuth framework that all the other applications know and understand. So we&#8217;ve made it simple on two sides. From a user, hey, the story is, if you have your phone, you have your password. You never have to change your password, you never have to worry about it. As long as you have your phone, you can have access to these various digital assets, there would be NFTs, we also do a lot of stuff in payments, it&#8217;s the same problem with digital payments, how do I know that you&#8217;re really you? So if you have your phone, you have access. On the backside of that, you also have to make it easy for the app developers, right? Whether you&#8217;re a pure Web3 dApp or you&#8217;re in the Web2 world wanting to do token gating, wanting to do other things kind of with NFTs. And so being a really simple OAuth, again, if your app supports login with Google, which every app in the world does, you can log in with your phone. But when you do that, that account is then linked to, you can link a MetaMask or a Rainbow or your Phantom or whatever these other wallets are linked to, but your phone is your link into them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Interesting. That is exactly what you said it is. And that is removing the nonsensical UX and UI that is presenting crypto. Do you remember the first time you got someone to set up a MetaMask that isn&#8217;t to tech savvy? Like that is just folks, what are we doing here? What are we doing? And then explain to them, hey, there&#8217;s, you know, we&#8217;re gonna be 12 to 24 little words. You&#8217;re gonna have to write down, like don&#8217;t lose them. Don&#8217;t let them burn down. If you lose them, they&#8217;re like, whoa, wait. Crazy. Make sure you don&#8217;t, you know, take a picture of this. Don&#8217;t type it in your computer. Make sure you write it down. If your house burns down, make sure it&#8217;s just like, what are we doing? It&#8217;s absolutely crazy. Let&#8217;s talk use cases. You&#8217;re a big use cases guy. You&#8217;re a big screw features. Let&#8217;s talk about benefits and use cases here. You and I are in the same camp. One of the biggest use cases for NFTs. And a lot of firms are working on this. A lot of really incredible people, guys and gals, teams are trying to build an ecosystem for ticketing and sports, which I think will be sort of the first major NFT breakthrough to go mainstream. It&#8217;s such a no brainer. There&#8217;s so much utility, so much value, so many use cases. I love if we could jump into this and walk me through sort of the 360 degree view on what&#8217;s going on in the whole NFT and ticketing sports landscape right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love the, and really it&#8217;s kind of IRL with digital, right? So in real life, it&#8217;s supporting events, it&#8217;s concerts, it&#8217;s events because I show up in person, right? And I want to engage in person, but I also have this whole of the digital world and letting those two worlds merge together, I think is crazy powerful, right? So there&#8217;s clearly, I think folks have looked at, you know, tickets as NFTs, they can&#8217;t be game, they can&#8217;t be scalp, they can&#8217;t be, there&#8217;s not as much fraud. Sure, those are good. I think the bigger unlock is again, when people have purchased a ticket, and we say it&#8217;s either to a game, again a sporting game, and in Chiefs we&#8217;re in Kansas City, everybody loves the Chiefs, you know, any of the sponsors or folks that are engaging with the Chiefs can now say, yep, we know this person went to the game, therefore we want to engage with them on either marketing or some sort of program or some other activity. Entertainers are also really interesting, because again, those entertainers are saying kind of ticketing issue but now those entertainers can engage directly with cost consumers and both sporting events and entertainers can now engage with those people even while not at the stadium. So it used to be very much like, you got a ticket that let you into the stadium, there&#8217;s a physical event, then you leave the stadium and you kind of done, like that particular engagement is finished, but when you can use NFTs as the bridge, the engagement continues. In fact, the engagement can start before you show up at the event, like you clearly have engagement at the event, then after the event, it&#8217;s not like the engagement is done, right? So artists and teams can still engage with fans, it&#8217;s just a much richer experience and you&#8217;re not blocked by Ticketmaster, right? Because whoever happens to control the venue or the ticketing, and so again, I want to go back to these open ecosystems, innovation and composability, and those live events, again, in particular sports and any kind of a concert or music, I think are crazy powerful and I do believe that they will be one of the first big use cases that go out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Toby and listeners, we have to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor to the show PrimeXBT and when we get back, we are going to keep buzzing on mobile and its ongoing impact on payments, of course, NFT ticketing and sports and some good old power of open ecosystems, which Toby is a big believer in.

CRYPTONEWS50 to get 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account and now back to the show with Toby. NFT ticketing and sports. A couple more questions then we will wrap up and go to the next topic here. And I hate to be the bearer of bad news or just the antagonist pessimist prick here, but so that will be the cape that I put on. But and this is something that hits hard to me just because I&#8217;m such a big sports fan and I do believe that the experience would amplify and would be infinitely better if we did have some really cool, organic ways via NFTs and blockchain to sort of lengthen that whole relationship and partnership of the person and the entity being the sports team. But what is stopping Ticketmaster from coming in and ending the party? Does Ticketmaster not want this to happen? And they have the tech to rule this out themselves. Again, I hate to be this guy, but it&#8217;s just this is something I often think about.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>You know, Ticketmaster actually has a really savvy internal team that&#8217;s all Web3 and blockchain. So they are, clearly working on this. I don&#8217;t have any insider information. So I can speculate. I think Ticketmaster wants to use ticketing as a much broader play into non-ticketing world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So you said the non-ticketing world?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yep. So here&#8217;s where, again, Toby&#8217;s, I guess, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s a crystal ball. We&#8217;ll call it a murky ball. But you put it fast. They have a, not a front or a seat, like they are the choke points for tickets today and they have like 20 releases on these things. So they&#8217;re going to be around a long time. And if they can say, hey, we&#8217;re going to do tickets as NFTs, but you got to use our wallet. But you have to use kind of the Ticketmaster wallet in order to be able to do this. Then Ticketmaster can now go to the sports team, the artist, the fan, all of those. And they continue to be the hub for now, how all those other people want to engage. So you think about, they&#8217;ve typically sold tickets and they&#8217;re very venue bound. So if they are the wallet and the hub that can now say, I&#8217;ve got a marketing platform, I&#8217;ve got all these other digital consumer engagement platforms, think about it again, they have all these stadiums. They know now a consumer and their wallet has gone to this event and that event and gone these other things. Then they can start building profiles like, oh, now this user has also shopped at this place. So they went to, you know, this restaurant was sponsoring an event for everybody who went to the game last night and Travis Kelce gets four touchdowns. You can come in and get, you know, four burgers for free, whatever the thing is. So some of the cool things you can do with NFTs. Like, I don&#8217;t know if you saw the crazy hub up this last week of Taylor Swift was at the game to watch Travis Kelce, right? And there was like all the crazy. So imagine, you know, someone would be like a clothing manufacturer like, hey, everyone who had a ticket to that game can come get this special Taylor Swift shirt. You only can get this shirt if you&#8217;re actually at the game. That&#8217;s pretty cool, right? Well, if Ticketmaster can be the gateway to say, oh, well now I know they bought this shirt and they&#8217;ve done these other things. It really, it&#8217;s a viable business strategy for Ticketmaster, right? Now again, are they going to be an honest broker or are they going to simply build a larger walled garden kind of around the referee space? You know, hopefully there will be more open. So I do think Ticketmaster sees the, I&#8217;m going to call it the tactical benefit of simply less fraud, better experience at the venue. But that is such a small potato is when you look at the larger scale of what you can do pre-event and post-event. I mean, that&#8217;s where Ticket and gets to be so fun.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, no, it&#8217;s a very good take there. One of the topics that we also need to discuss is mobile and its ongoing impact on payments. Even I think of myself, I rarely use a credit card anymore. I mean, I&#8217;m using a credit card, but it&#8217;s on Apple Pay. Like I have my business cards, my personal cards, all on Apple Pay, it is such a treat. And then there&#8217;s just the obviously payments on mobile. If you&#8217;re doing some work for me or I&#8217;m doing work for you, vice versa, and I need to pay you. I&#8217;m just going onto my bank and Apple on my phone and firing away. Like everything is done on mobile right now. You&#8217;re obviously deep in this space. You have experience in this space. What&#8217;s your take on the current sort of impact of mobile on payments? And what&#8217;s that going to look like in the future? Maybe a couple years down the road, 5, 10 years down the road.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>There&#8217;s actually a lot of parallels to ticketing, right? So old school ticketing, you got a piece of paper and you handed just one at the door, there were clip-overs, tear it or whatever and then you went into the stadium and that was the experience. Well, when we went from paper to credit cards, this is 40 years ago, by the way, credit cards were a pretty amazing piece of thing. I got a physical card, I can go up and tap at a terminal, swipe a terminal. Again, 40 years ago, we didn&#8217;t get iPhones until what, 2007, 15 years ago. And so the advancements that we&#8217;ve had with mobile, I mean, the best we&#8217;ve done is simply digitized this old school card, these old school rails into a phone, which that&#8217;s better, but Holy smokes, we&#8217;re still beholden to all the rails and all the fees. Like we value money every time, every time you send a transfer, you&#8217;re gonna pay 2% or 3% so you&#8217;re losing 2% or 3% and there are like seven or eight layers of people taking little bits out of that 2% or 3% and so everybody&#8217;s on the take. Everybody wants to be the one who gets a little piece of these fees that are being charged with credit cards, including Apple, right? They wanna be the front like half use Apple Pay and then your credit, right? So my argument, we&#8217;re still being hemmed in by too many rules set by the incumbents, which are always going to favor the incumbents. Like that is the nature of business. So the thing I love about just Web3 and more open ecosystems of like, how do we unlock creative potential and alternatives and better in different ways of doing things? Like payments are one of those. And so if I&#8217;ve looked at, it&#8217;s funny, when we first did Deem, it was in vector, when we did Redeem, it was very much Web3 focused. As I&#8217;ve really began to look at the space, the reason we rebranded to Deem is realizing like, Holy smokes, we have the same problem in payments as much of the stuff we&#8217;ve done in ticketing or with Web3. And so if we can help basically solve both problems at once, because the whole idea of like, if I have my phone, I&#8217;ve got a super secure yet very simple way to prove that it&#8217;s me. And one of the reasons they justify higher fees and digital payments is fraud. Like, well, we don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s really you. How, what if someone just got your credit? What if someone went, and so they charge you a lot of money and my argument is like, if I can tell you with, again, 100% confidence that this phone number, global unique on this phone that it biometrically verified into, that&#8217;s not a fraudster. Like there&#8217;s zero reason why you should take any discount for fraud, because this transaction cannot be fraudulent, right? But there aren&#8217;t good frameworks yet to work with that. So true. Yeah, so we&#8217;re currently, there&#8217;s a multi-pronged approach. So we&#8217;re, actually we are working with some of the big card companies right now, because they&#8217;re recognizing this. Hey, we can&#8217;t keep charging these really high. They call it card not present. So when your physical card is not present, we&#8217;re 30 years ago, that was much higher risk. Like, wait, well, where did that card come from? Someone&#8217;s just typing in numbers onto their computer. Granted, that&#8217;s higher risk. And so they&#8217;ve got programs rolling out that if you do things like SIM card binding and biometrics, you&#8217;re gonna be able to get better rates, which makes a ton of sense. And so we&#8217;ll work with those where we can, but also going directly account to account, right? So why don&#8217;t I simply pay directly from my bank account? So I&#8217;m beginning a lot of my time over in China, credit cards aren&#8217;t a thing, right? People don&#8217;t get credit cards, right? They don&#8217;t even have banks. So it&#8217;s all mobile app, think PayPal. They&#8217;re all PayPal-ish. That&#8217;s what Alipay is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>These are these super apps though, right? Toby where it&#8217;s like chat, like WeChat where you have like your bank account, you&#8217;re shopping, you&#8217;re messaging, like you got it all in one, right?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, and going to account to account, right? So it&#8217;s going from your WeChat account directly to your bank account. You&#8217;re paying this bill directly with your bank account, right? So you&#8217;re not writing the traditional card rails. You&#8217;re going to get, it&#8217;s called account to account, right? The US has been pretty far behind. Historically we&#8217;ve had something called ACH, right? So ACH was selling a couple of days. Well, they&#8217;ve got newer frameworks, generally called RTP, real time payment networks. So FedNow just rolled out a month ago, two months ago. And it settles instantly 24/7 for four pennies, right? So just the delta, there&#8217;ll be fees based on top of that. So I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;ll always be four pennies. There&#8217;ll still be a few fees on top of that. But the benefit and the expense to merchants, like that&#8217;s a full 1%, 2%, straight to your bottom line. That is very significant. But here&#8217;s the catch. And this has Web3 parallels as well. You don&#8217;t have Visa in the background, traditionally saying, hey, someone told my card, or I didn&#8217;t make that purchase. Visa put a stop on it. But to that, that&#8217;s what Visa will do. Like if you don&#8217;t like the charge or whatever reason you, it&#8217;s called charge back, you can go to Visa and say, put a hold on that charge. Right? Well, if you&#8217;re going bank account to bank account, you don&#8217;t have that protection.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Same as crypto once you send the money it&#8217;s gone to the abyss baby&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>It is far more efficient, but it&#8217;s a little bit riskier. And in particular around fraud, like how do you know someone didn&#8217;t, you know, think of all the account takeovers, right? How many passwords do you have and how many people have gotten into your account? Well, if someone can get into your account and just start buying stuff, okay, that&#8217;s a little scary. Like how do I know it&#8217;s through a person? How do I know, you know, someone just didn&#8217;t go find my data on the dark web and do an account takeover and log in, right? So what we&#8217;re trying to do is like, hey, we can stop that cold, right? So we can actually make sure that kind of your account linked to this bank account is the only one that can issue any kind of payment, whether that&#8217;s writing the traditional card rails or is going direct account to account. But really, again, it&#8217;s a very similar, you might say ethos, themes, thesis, as is for Web3. How do I know that I own this wallet and approve this particular transaction? Whether I&#8217;m token gating or kind of making transactions in the Web3 world, I can&#8217;t simply go back and rely on Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook to authenticate. But so it&#8217;s a similar to both spaces,&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Very well said. Toby, we are getting a little tight for time here. Last topic and then unfortunately we have to wrap up, but I do need to have the on for round two because this is too much fun and we barely scratched the surface. But let&#8217;s get into sort of the power of open ecosystems and token gating activity. Token gating activity, huge. Again, like you said, something as simple as being at the Taylor Swift KC game where you guys, I believe, was the Bears that you absolutely trounced with Taylor Swift and absolutely crushed the Bears, which I&#8217;m sure you guys absolutely loved. I mean, the Bears are trash. So I wouldn&#8217;t look into it too much, but either way, you guys do look scary and good as always. Walk me through the power of open ecosystems and token gating activity, more specifically, token gating activity and how it really has a shitload of use cases present day and moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, I ain&#8217;t token gating people this. When I talk to folks, I am saddened by the lack of vision. There&#8217;s so many, like a key to your car could be a token. Right? Like a key to your house, a gem, a marriage certificate, an academic certification. I mean, so all those things, you can have cryptographic proof. Oh, this, Matt has done these things. Therefore, I will give them either a certain level of trust or give them access to other things because of this cryptographic proof of data. So token gating isn&#8217;t just, I wanna go to a website so I can buy some piece of merchandise because I have some thing in my, yeah, that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s a use case, that&#8217;s real. I think much bigger around, so many things that we do in life are so hard to go back and prove. How do I know that, again, I was there, I did this thing, or I worked for this company, or I actually went to the school. Holy smokes, this is a blew my mind. We were interviewing first and folks, this was probably six or eight months ago, and we put it out on LinkedIn. And my COO had like three or four people he talked to, and as he dove in, he&#8217;s like, man, this doesn&#8217;t feel right. So he starts asking really specific questions about their resume, and they hung up. There were total scams. People just trying to say, oh yeah, I went to this school and I did this thing and I worked for this company, but if it&#8217;s on LinkedIn, you can put anything you want. The ballziness and what they would do, the scam is they&#8217;ll work for two or three months, do a minimum amount of work, and then just leave.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Go to the next company. That&#8217;s greasy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Rush</strong>&nbsp;<br>So again, kind of back to trust, opening systems in the digital world. I mean, I think token gating has so many, powerful use cases that is much beyond just getting to some data on a website.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, well said. Toby, what an absolute treat. Pleasure meeting you, pleasure spending the time with you, an open invite on for round two.

We are buzzing as always and I&#8217;m super pumped to have the one and only Phil Harvey coming in hot on the show today. He&#8217;s the Founder and CEO of Sabre56. The leading hosting provider and digital asset mining consultant is a cryptocurrency mining expert. Phil has been active in the space since 2014. Wow. Coming up on 10 years that has bananas with a background in military operational planning. He&#8217;s been devising solutions for the most complex problems facing blockchain companies for years, including growing one of the largest miners on the North American market. Sabre56 today has consulted on over 700 megawatts, I believe that&#8217;s megawatts, of computing power across North America, the Nordics and the Middle East. And the company also builds and operates the most technologically advanced blockchain data centers and acts as a trusted hosting partner for leading miners globally. Phil, pumped to have you on. Welcome to show my friend. How you doing?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m good. Thanks for the intro, Matt. Appreciate it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Pumped to have you on, man. Before we get into Sabre56, let&#8217;s jump right into Phil here. The star of the show, I&#8217;m a big military guy. It&#8217;s hypocritical of me as I&#8217;ve never been in the military. And I just, I love it. I have friends and family in the military in Canada, friends and family in the military in the States. Don&#8217;t actually know anyone who is in the British military, but now I know you. So we got all the countries covered, walk me through some military stories, childhood, Phil&#8217;s journey from a little British lad into the CEO of Sabre56. Give me the whole TLDR. What happened from Phil as a young lad all the way up to present day? And I&#8217;d love if you could touch on some military stories while you go on that speil.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, sure. I&#8217;d say I was always one for trying something and pushing the envelope, as if it were. So I worked in a warehouse when I was a kid at school. So Wednesdays and Thursday evenings, I&#8217;d finish school, then go work till 8, 9 o &#8216;clock in the warehouse, and then continued on the weekend. I assume mum and dad thought I was going to be just working in the warehouse for the end of my days, which of course, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. They just expected me to do something else. I wouldn&#8217;t say that I was showing huge levels of business or life acumen when I was at school. I wasn&#8217;t really into it. I didn&#8217;t have an aptitude for learning. And then joined the military. Both grandparents were in the military. We had national service back at that time. So they would be telling war stories and how it was a great time and I should go and so on and so forth. And I recall watching the news and it was Desert Storm. It must have been at the time. And I remember watching it with my grandfather. And there was some American soldier, all his gear on, kicking a door down, helicopters in the background, real bullshit. And I was like, okay, good. So I saw that and I was completely brainwashed. I want to do that. The reality is it&#8217;s tough. You don&#8217;t see it on the TV and then you can go home at night time. There&#8217;s a bit more to it. So I joined the military at 16. I did okay at school. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily learned. I got by. And then following that, I was in Germany and I specialised as a radio operator, a communicator. And through my loathing of PT physical training, I ended up navigating having to do the PT to go and play rugby because it was an easier option. Little did I know that the master training instructor had other plans and he said, listen, if you play rugby, then you&#8217;ve got to move that and you&#8217;ve got to do PT. So I became exceptionally fit. I&#8217;ve always been pretty skinny and lean. So I was playing on the wing at rugby, lots of running around, then was doing PT at the same time. And through a series of events of application, I was put forward for UK Special Forces. And through successful application was the youngest to pass at the age of 19, which I believe to this day still stands. And then ran around the world, pretend to be a soldier and went to Iraq, Afghanistan, and just learned a multitude of life skills. And it was incredible. If I were to restart the clock, I&#8217;d do everything again, exactly the same. It was phenomenal. But everything has to come to an end. I was tired of being told no. And I was ahead of my peers for promotion and wanting to do different jobs. And I just got tired of, yeah, next year. So I handed in my notice, I left and was in the civilian world. And it&#8217;s a culture shock, you know, having been clothed, fed, watered from 16 to 22, 23, getting into the civilian world is a rude awakening. You believe you&#8217;ve got it all together, then you realize you&#8217;ve known nothing. So that was a big learning exercise, very fortunate to have some great business mentors, even through failures. You know, I never look at anyone that traditionally did me wrong, because, you know, a bad person, you know, learn a plethora of lessons from everyone. Moved to Dubai maybe 10 or so years ago. And from there, found Bitcoin through a very good friend of mine, Cal McDonald, shout out to Mr. 150.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>What&#8217;s the name? What&#8217;s the reason behind the nickname there, Mr. 150?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Mr. 150, I have no idea. It&#8217;s probably because he likes to go 150 miles an hour everywhere. Yeah, he&#8217;s a good guy, apart from being Australian, but we can forgive that. So, yeah, he said, listen, you got to get into this dash, this dark coin, as it was at the time, back in 2014. So I was like, yeah, sure, whatever. I was working at a bank at the time. And I went on local Bitcoin, went and transacted with some random crypto gentleman at the time. I put $1,000 into an account, no KYC, AML, due diligence, nothing, just completely trusted some guy. And I got, I think it was like five or six BTC at the time. And I was like, right, yeah, we&#8217;ll move this because of course, back in 2014, BTC had already gone to the moon and it was already as high as it was going to go. So instantly sold out of that and bought dark coin and inevitably that just disappeared into many stats at the time. Then, then Cal calls me back up about a year later in an absolute panic, he&#8217;s like, bro, you&#8217;ve got to look at what&#8217;s going on with Dash. I said, dude, I have no idea what Dash is. What are you talking about? And he&#8217;s like, dark coin, it&#8217;s now Dash and this has happened and so reloaded the wallet and so on and so forth. And then that $1,000 had turned into $60,000. And then that obviously beat my interest. So from their on it was, yeah, that was it. It was like, right, how do I get the next state of this? So then was managing a few portfolios for guys and went to Canada and built cryptocurrency mining farms and grew a couple miners and then moved and started Saber.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. What a great story to kick things off. Hey, fellow Canadian here, where&#8217;d you go in Canada? I assume Quebec most likely?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, a little bit. We had operations there, but I actually, base for me was Calgary, and then I spent some time in Toronto. But it was very beautiful to live there, just disappear into the mountains at the weekend. It was very fortunate to be able to spend a couple of years there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I mean, the West Coast, the Canada is a special place. So, I mean, that was a treat. Thank you for that, Phil. Let&#8217;s jump right in the Sabre56. Tell me about the company and let&#8217;s start off with the name. What&#8217;s the name behind this? Cause, you know, most of the time I get guests come on the pod and it&#8217;s insert blocks here or crypto here or whatever. You know what I mean? It&#8217;s pretty straightforward. You could at least picture in your mind, you have a good depiction of what the company name means, but Sabre56, I&#8217;m sitting here like, what the fuck is this? I have no clue what this could be. I love the name, it&#8217;s catchy, but give us the lowdown. What exactly do you and the team do? And what&#8217;s the vision behind the name?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. So the reason for Sabre56 rather than Saber56 is that was my call sign out in Iraq. So you never pronounce it name numbers. You know, I was always Sabre56 for freeze of recognition. So that&#8217;s where it carried over. And a couple of my fellow partners were also in the military and shared the same or similar call signs on their operations, which is why also the call sign is although logo is white on a black background, same as how we would wear it if we were to wear our target recognition flashes. So that&#8217;s where the name comes from in terms of the company. So when I was deployed in Canada, you know, building farms, we very quickly realized that, you know, by and large, there was no rulebook to how farms were being built. They were very haphazard. They didn&#8217;t follow policies or procedures or any kind of process. And as ex military guys, we were indoctrinated to be, you know, follow the steps, achieve success. So it was disheartening to be in an industry that we were passionate about and see the disarray, you know, guys were being sued or just ultimately pissed off because the operations were just not to the level that was required. And look, it&#8217;s fine in an emerging industry, I guess, up to a certain level as you&#8217;re finding your feet, but people are spending serious money, you know, even during S9 times and then into the S17s. And there was no excuse for the facilities that were built at the time to be just, you know, below standard and not following any kind of outline.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Can you touch on this for a sec? For someone who&#8217;s not in the arena like you are, what makes something up to standards or not? Was this just like a complete and utter banana land shitshow, like unsafe, not efficient? Like how was it not up to standards?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>If you go into a clothing store and there&#8217;s shit everywhere, you know, the trainers on the rack, at different sizes and shapes, and they&#8217;re not together and the t-shirts thrown on the floor. I mean, yeah, you can go into the store and you can buy the clothes, but are you going to go into one that&#8217;s got a shit together or are you going to go into one that looks like a fire sale? So, you know, if we look at filters and fans, you know, a lot of the facilities weren&#8217;t running filters and were wondering why so many machines were having board issues or fan issues. Airflow wasn&#8217;t modeled at all. Cable management, it&#8217;s basic stuff. If you&#8217;ve got cables in front of machines, the airflow is going to be hindered and therefore the operations uptime is going to be subpar. So it&#8217;s just little things like this that weren&#8217;t implemented, weren&#8217;t being followed at all. And it just looked like, you know, I&#8217;ve described as a bag of dicks and it shouldn&#8217;t do. So we set about trying to build farms that looked legitimate and operated in that way. You know, we are a company that has tier one operators in it and we understand what&#8217;s required in order to achieve success and it&#8217;s uncompromising. I mean, our company StrapLine is the unrelenting pursuit of excellence and that&#8217;s absolutely what we believe in. I mean, we are bred on that. So we saw a big gap in the market where we could deliver consulting services for miners wanting to enter the space for us to build facilities. And very fortunate that the team is made up of leaders within projects, commercial and design management. The guys and girls have worked at very senior levels within extremely large consultancy and construction businesses globally and delivered hundreds of millions of dollars worth of projects. So as a company, as you alluded to on the very kind introduction, we&#8217;ve consulted on projects globally, massing over 700 megawatts from design, build and commercial engagement. And that was really our entry into the space and the idea from there was to amass some cash, build a reputation and communicate the right message to the industry that there is a pioneer, there is a leader within the space that has got their shit together and can deliver projects. So the next iteration for Sabre was then to build our own facilities and stand by our own code. And to showcase that this is the standard that you can expect to receive from Sabre and anyone that sees or recognizes the brand, it&#8217;s always with #sabre56standard. And that&#8217;s what we live by. So yeah, build our own facilities for hosting. I think we will only host due to any conflicts of interest between us and hosted entities, so no mining from a Sabre perspective. And we now obviously operate Client Sites, which was released a couple of months ago with the award of the 300 megawatt project down in Corpus Christi in partnership with Bootstrap and the SACSA project.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s wild. One point I&#8217;d love to touch on is obviously what you concluded with the location in Corpus Christi. Getting into the States for you guys was absolutely massive, obviously as a mining company with just the plethora of resources and people and energy and economy in the States, of course, this was massive. I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through how you guys actually got into the States and doing research for the show. Didn&#8217;t know there was that much involved in sort of the landmark consulting and construction deals. It makes total sense after reading about it, but as someone who&#8217;s on the sidelines, it&#8217;s like, you just whip it up and you&#8217;re good to go. It&#8217;s like you buy the piece of property good, but there&#8217;s so many complexities. I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through the shit show that it takes to get into the States and getting those landmark consulting construction deals, the whole nine yards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, sure. There&#8217;s a very intricate path to walk on and to find a site to conduct due diligence and feasibility on sites, understanding the requirements from the utility, the counties, the approving bodies, engineers and such, walking that all the way through into the design, build, commercial, procurement arrangements, managing contractors. A lot of it, the team have delivered before in previous lives, so it wasn&#8217;t a big stretch for them to consult on these projects. It was majority copy-paste, but the more intricate elements such as the utility and learning some of the language there and understanding what the requirements are to plug in from utility meets facility perspective. But again, we&#8217;re educated guys and girls that have learned different backgrounds in the past, whether that be military or banking, environment or whatever. So there are buzzwords that you learn and research and it&#8217;s not overly cumbersome or difficult. So we were able to navigate that path successfully. It took a number of attempts and I&#8217;m sure our early clients were annoyed at some of the reasoning behind the process that we implemented, but we were also learning and that&#8217;s everyone needed to understand that. No one knew how to deliver these things. So we managed to consult on a number of projects in the US and Canada for a number of clients. We&#8217;ve been known in the market. I was former CEO and COO for Phoenix. They&#8217;ve gone on to build large facilities now in Oman and Abu Dhabi, which I was involved on before I left. So I was known in the industry, obviously for the role I facilitated there. So once I started my own thing, it&#8217;s the same contacts and connections and similar discussions, but letting the guys know that we were there to support them. And obviously one thing leads to another and you put your strategy together, you get the guys on board and then you go from building facilities for others to building facilities for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>And what are some of the differences between building facilities in the US versus Canada or other spots? Or would it just be the obvious answers like zoning bylaws and construction bylaws and all that stuff? You know, like is there any non-energy specific things because we&#8217;ll get into energy on sort of the second half here, but are there any non-energy specific nuances that deal in certain countries versus others?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. There&#8217;s only a few locations where we&#8217;ve seen minor deviation, but generally, once you&#8217;ve figured that process out, you can have the discussions. And that&#8217;s not to say that once you have a process mapped out that it&#8217;s a route to success, there&#8217;s obviously a number of different times and you&#8217;re working with different entities all the time. Different people and they&#8217;ll still follow a similar process, but a different way of getting for me to be. So it&#8217;s generally the same and I feel comfortable in saying that, but there are obviously the usual nuances associated with working in different states or countries.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Of course. Phil, we got to take a quick break and folks, we have to take a quick break. Give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to talk energy usage 101 and the current state of the crypto, more specifically, Bitcoin mining market. Who&#8217;s entered the space?

Everyone wants to know about the current state of the Bitcoin mining industry. Who&#8217;s moved into space over the last couple of years? Of course, we have the one and only halving, which I believe is March or April of 2024. I want to say we&#8217;re six months away, give or take, which a lot of people just had Gracy Chen on the pod, the CEO of Bitget, and she is in the camp that the halving doesn&#8217;t matter as much as it used to because, again, it&#8217;s the halving matters less and less every single time. That&#8217;s her point. A lot of people agree. Some people don&#8217;t. Can&#8217;t wait to get your opinion on this, but give us the TLDR. What is the current state of the mining industry? What players have moved into the space? Will the halving affect anything? Let&#8217;s get into it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>The best response I ever received about halving was the last halving cycle. I was chatting with a facility operator and he asked me a very similar question, you know, would you think about the halving? Gave my opinion at the time and said, what about yourself? And his response legitimately was, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to happen. Which is disturbing to say the least is the facility operators. So, yeah, I don&#8217;t know what he was smoking, but clearly it did happen and it will continue to happen. So that&#8217;s the initial response. The mining industry is fragile, I would suggest. There&#8217;s been a lot of movement. There&#8217;s been a lot of rushing into the space in previous years. And we saw that unfortunately with bankruptcy this year, last year, of some of the major players in the space. And I believe unfortunately that&#8217;s going to continue. Mine capitulation will be something that we will continue to experience over the next 6 to 12 months. And main factor for that is that everyone jumped on board by machines at silly prices. They weren&#8217;t building the infrastructure quick enough. The debt management was poor. And we still have clients now that have tens of thousands of machines that are sat in warehouses or with bankrupt partners that weren&#8217;t deployed and that need to be redeployed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>These machines still aren&#8217;t redeployed. They&#8217;re still just chilling.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>There&#8217;s still a large majority of machines that are not the worst yet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Remember 2021 when people were just paying arms and legs to hold these? How are these not being put into use? Is there just not a need for it or what&#8217;s the deal there?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>A couple of words I would use there is recklessness and stupidity. And that&#8217;s unfortunately, yeah, I mean, that&#8217;s the crux of it. There was a huge rush for buying a chunk of aluminum with some hashboards in it and not thinking about where you&#8217;re going to put these things. I mean, we&#8217;re not talking 5, 10 machines you can throw in the garage. It&#8217;s tens of thousands of machines that listed entities and the like were rushing out to buy. We had zero idea about where to put them, how to facilitate that. And there was also some greedy players in the industry that, quote and quote, had space but didn&#8217;t. And they weren&#8217;t able to put them online, which then impacted with penalties and it was just a complete shit show. So that really just accelerated a lot of issues that we saw. And unfortunately, you know, that aftermath is still being seen across the industry. So to get back to it, the current state of the industry is fragile but stable. But I think there&#8217;s also a lot of naivety and guys just hanging on, waiting to see. And there&#8217;s also still a lot of hope, which is not a strategy or for running a business. The, you know, Bitcoin will increase and it&#8217;s just ludicrous that people still think that. Of course, it will increase over time. That&#8217;s, you know, how the network is designed, but it&#8217;s not guaranteed and it takes time. If you look at the revenue at the moment, so if you look at hosting prices, if you look at, you know, what guys are paying for power, we can assume that within S19 XP at the moment of let&#8217;s say $0.4 that guys are making 30% to 40% margin currently. That&#8217;s not going to be enough post halving for guys to continue making money. So we will see the same as we did in the last halving. Guys will continue to mine at risk until those that can&#8217;t afford to pay slowly turn off. The other issue that we get into them is obviously the more efficient machines that are coming in to the market, which is good efficiency increases are positive. But that obviously bumps up the overall hash on the network more, which makes it harder for, you know, less efficient machines to make money. So that race continues. And, you know, if you don&#8217;t have capital to deploy in order to buy the latest machines, you&#8217;re going to struggle. And capital at the moment is extremely short in the market. There are a few players that have access to it, but there&#8217;s a lot of waiting going on. And the more efficient miners that we&#8217;re seeing on the market at the moment are the hydro and the immersion machines. And a lot of the facilities that have been built are air. So even to convert them, there&#8217;s a big capex requirement that people don&#8217;t already have, let alone to deploy hydro machines. So I would disagree with the comments that the halving is just another, you know, event and that it&#8217;s getting less and less important. It certainly is not. I&#8217;m certainly not here to be doom and gloom, you know, but you&#8217;ve got to be realistic against this. And a lot of people aren&#8217;t. So I&#8217;ve got no issues in saying it&#8217;s going to be rough for the next, you know, 12 months moving into and then out of the halving. And it&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s a good perch and the industry needs it. And we should be looking forward to it. It should be a positive time for, you know, the least efficient players and the guys that didn&#8217;t pay attention at school to be moved out the way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said there. Have any big names moving in the space over the last two years? Because again, I want to say when did the bull market end? End of 2021, early 2022? I mean, give or take, right? Any big dogs jump in from during the bear market? Any big bear market dogs that are like, wow, just moving and grooving in the space?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re under NDAs with various groups that we work with. What I can say that there&#8217;s large hedge funds that are now moving in. So what we&#8217;ve seen from a market maturity perspective is initially you&#8217;ve got the hobbyists moving and the mining. Then you&#8217;ve got a few of the entrepreneurial bankers or fund managers that were able to get some cash together and build some of the early mining farms and miners. From there, you&#8217;ve got some institutional money that was looking in, dipping the toe in from the side and would invest in the soon to be or listed entities. Now what we&#8217;re seeing in this next iteration is those companies taking over or starting their own. So they&#8217;ve kind of been dipping the toe in reviewing and viewing from the sidelines. Then I&#8217;ll get it in themselves. We are seeing that institutional capital move into the space from real estate, hedge funds, large family offices, sovereign funds, and the industrialization of Bitcoin is well upon us. I believe, unfortunately, that the retail mining is going to become a thing of the past, just natural market progression and as industrialization kicks in. It&#8217;s sad, but it&#8217;s inevitable.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So, the way she goes, it&#8217;s like anything else in life, the bigger and badder you are, you&#8217;ll come in and eventually grab some of the cake. Honestly, I think, I mean, look, yes it&#8217;s sad that the small guys and gals are getting knocked out, sure, but I&#8217;m all for this. You know, if we want to really move the needle here, I&#8217;m all in for the big corpse coming in. Phil, last thing we really need to get into is energy use as a whole. This is something that&#8217;s way above my pay grade. Admittedly, I do need to do my homework in this regard. Of course, I obviously understand how Bitcoin mining works and all that, but the whole energy use stuff, like even when I&#8217;m reading the bio, I&#8217;m like darn, I read over your bio a couple of times to make sure it was good before I read it. And then I get over the 700 MW and I&#8217;m like, is that million watts, mega watts? Like how much is a megawatt? I got to level my game up, fully admitting that. But walk me through the sort of present day energy use. How do we conceptualize Bitcoin&#8217;s energy use and how is computing infrastructure of the future going to affect, you know, digital assets and renewable energy?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Big questions. Okay. Where to start?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, let&#8217;s start with conceptualizing Bitcoin&#8217;s energy use. Cause a lot of people still don&#8217;t, myself included, still don&#8217;t have a full, full understanding of like the, you know, X amount of megawatts that it takes to produce X amount of Bitcoin. I know it&#8217;s obviously very nuanced and depends on where you are in the world and how cheap you get that electricity for and for that energy rather whole nine yards. But walk me through how all that works strictly in regards to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>So S9s, you could have a 5 megawatt facility back in the day, which would have been a large facility for S9s. And they were producing or they require about 1300 watts. So you would have had in there about 3,000 machines, 3,500 machines roughly, which would have been considerable. So if we look at, let&#8217;s call it 3,500 machines, S9 was producing what? Maybe 12 terahash? So that would have been 42 petahash, which is pitiful in today&#8217;s hash power for machines. So if you look at that 5,000 kilowatts or 5 megawatts at the moment, that&#8217;s going to be, let&#8217;s call it 1,500 machines. It&#8217;s a little bit over, but 1,500 machines and then let&#8217;s use an S19 XP. That&#8217;s going to be 210 petahash that you are now producing. So in terms of an uplift, it&#8217;s considerable. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got to focus on when we look at efficiency. I mean, that&#8217;s a 200% increase in efficiency from the S9 to the S19 in terms of the power draw that you can get from a facility. So one of the misconceptions or one of the common issues that we come across in the industry is, you know, Bitcoin&#8217;s consuming lots of power. Yeah, you&#8217;re absolutely right. It does. But don&#8217;t compare it to a country because there&#8217;s a number of other industries that consume more power than a country. Review Bitcoin&#8217;s energy usage against the banking sector. And you will see the blockchain network is hugely more efficient than the banking sector is. Not only from a consumption perspective, one to one, but also from construction perspectives. So these are the comparisons that we should be looking at. And once we are building large facilities, you know, it&#8217;s obviously building a one gigawatts or a thousand megawatt facility, the SACSI project, again, that we know is 300 megawatts in Corpus Christi. And then we&#8217;ve got Moonwalk in Oman, which again is a couple of hundred megawatts, same with Phoenix in Oman and Phoenix in Abu Dhabi. These are hundreds of megawatts of facilities. We&#8217;re following up on and chasing the data centers, traditional data centers. And the data centers use massive amounts of power. You would be blind and naive to think that we are not going through the digital evolution of our existence. And to be digital means to go online. And if you&#8217;re going to go online, you need infrastructure to support that. Where&#8217;s that going to come from? So, you know, that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re heading at the moment. And, you know, the reason why I noted the S9s at the start is that efficiency. So we are able to sustain the network in a smaller condensed allocation of power, even though we are growing. So there will become a point where we do reach equilibrium in terms of the amount of power that we need to allocate towards this, because the efficiency of the machines will increase to a level where we no longer need to expand into new facilities of power. And then after mass expansion comes refinement. And then it&#8217;s looking at your operations and how you can make that more efficient. It&#8217;s looking at the grids and looking at how we can, you know, support the infrastructure of the grid, how we can, you know, support the green initiative to not consume carbon or reduce the consumption of fossil-based fuels. But the other misconception is that, you know, Bitcoin is bad for the environment and it uses fossil fuels. We connect to the same grid that everyone else does. So if that grid produces 90% coal, that means everyone that&#8217;s connected to that grid is also using 90% coal. We don&#8217;t go to the grid and say, hey, we only want fossil fuels. We go to the grid and say, hey, what spare capacity do you have that you are not able to utilize? What can we take from you and pay for and support the economy in order to run our business? And if they say, hey, you can take this power, it&#8217;s 90% coal. Okay, it&#8217;s not great. And thankfully, we are seeing, you know, ESG strategies that are now focused heavily on not supporting 90% coal as an example. But in the same breath, if we&#8217;re taking that power that the grid is producing and not using, we&#8217;re increasing the revenue upstream. So we&#8217;re increasing that for the economy and we&#8217;re increasing that for the government and for the utility, which then goes back into the government&#8217;s initiative for them going green. So if they weren&#8217;t using 200, 300, 400 megawatts of power, and they now are, that&#8217;s more revenue for them to accelerate their own requirements to turn down coal and turn down gas and go into hydro or nuclear or wind or solar. So you have to take a holistic view towards all of this and realize that it&#8217;s not just one dimensional, which is what a lot will unfortunately view it as and it comes down to education.</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said. Yeah, you got my head spinning on that last one. I mean, it&#8217;s such a good point. All the Bitcoin haters, it&#8217;s always one of the first things you hear about, oh, terrible for the environment. But like you said, I remember reading an article in 2021 where it was like, dryers and washing machines consume infinitely more energy than Bitcoin mining does. It&#8217;s like, are we going to go back to the 40s and 50s and start hanging up clothes on a, you know, on a clothesline and throwing our shit in a bucket and throwing in some soap and wash it? No, it&#8217;s just like, it&#8217;s just something else to narc on. Phil, this has been an absolute treat of an episode, though we are getting a little tight for time. We do need to wrap up. Last thing before that, this is a personal question for myself. Have you ever been told you look like Penn Badgley?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>No, but if he&#8217;s looking like me, then I suppose good for both of us, I guess.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#8217;t even know who he was until like three years ago. And then I&#8217;d be at a bar or I&#8217;d be wherever. And it&#8217;s mostly girls cause he&#8217;s from the show called YOU, but I actually watched it with my ex just cause she was like, you&#8217;re in this. So they say I look a lot like him and you and I look sort of similar, but you are a literally mirror image of the lad. Google him his name is Penn Badgley. Now that I&#8217;ve shown you, it&#8217;s probably gonna be stuck in your head for a while. So I apologize. And I would also bet if you want to do a little friendly bet, I&#8217;ll bet you that in the next six months, someone will walk up to me like, you look like Penn Badgley. I&#8217;ll bet the house on it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Done. Okay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>But that&#8217;s it. But before we go, Google him cause I want to see your reaction. Penn Badgley, check him out. Am I up to lunch or am I right here?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Let&#8217;s see.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>He&#8217;s good looking lad too, so it&#8217;s a compliment, but you know what I mean? He&#8217;s pretty similar. Twins.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>If you want to agree with that, then that&#8217;s fine. But yeah, I mean, why not? He can look like me rather than me look like him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. Penn looks like you. There we go. But Phil, appreciate you coming on. Absolute pleasure, learn to ton, and definitely have some homework to do. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Saber56 online and on socials?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure, so you can find us at the usual platforms, so LinkedIn and Instagram under Saber56.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>And yourself, you online anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>I am a ghost. I only appear as the company. I&#8217;m away from social media and focusing on person to person interaction, something I&#8217;ve done probably for the past 12 years.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks on grand and I love that. Phil, thanks again man. Appreciate it. Would love to have you and the team on for round two. Wishing you guys all the best and we&#8217;ll keep in touch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phil Harvey</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thank you so much. Appreciate it, Matt.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with Phil Harvey, Founder and CEO of Saber56. What a great episode on everything Bitcoin mining related. The current state of Bitcoin mining, the future of mining energy usage. You name it. Phil covered it. Huge shout out to both of our teams for making this happen. To the listeners, love you guys.

We are buzzing as always and I&#8217;m super pumped to have the one and only Gracy Chen coming back on the show for round two, the Managing Director of one of the top crypto derivatives and copy trading platforms. That is the one and only Bitget. Gracy oversees market expansion, business strategy and corporate development. Under her leadership, Bitget user base has quadrupled, not a big deal, propelling the exchange to the top five positions among all other crypto exchanges in terms of crypto derivatives trading volumes. Before that, she held executive positions at the Fintech Unicorn Company Accumulus and Foxconn backed VR startup XRSPACE. Gracy was also an early investor in BitKeep Asia&#8217;s leading decentralized wallet. She&#8217;s also been honored by the World Economic Forum, graduated from the National University of Singapore and is currently in the one and only Dean Town, Boston, Massachusetts, where she is pursuing an MDA degree at the one and only MIT. What a bio, Gracy, super pumped to have you on. Welcome back on the show.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thank you, Matt. Always happy to be on this show.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Great to have you back on. You are in Boston right now. Such a good city. I mean, I have a love hate with Boston. I love Boston because the vibes are great. I think the people are very animated, very funny. They all, you know, where their heart on their sleeves and I love that grit that&#8217;s in Boston. It&#8217;s also very beautiful city. You have all the incredible universities like the Harvard&#8217;s and the MIT&#8217;s. But then you have the sports teams, Gracy. And it seems like Boston kicks the shit out of Toronto sports teams every year. And that is something that breaks my heart time after time. Boston wins everything, whether it&#8217;s the Bruins or the Celtics or Ton Brady winning, you know, five chips in New England. What is life like in Boston right now? Give me some good stories at MIT. How much are you enjoying the one and only Beantown?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Okay. Sadly, I don&#8217;t watch sports that much other than football. I mean soccer, because I love Leo Messi. He&#8217;s our ambassador, the one and only ambassador that we really love. So other than, I guess, football team or soccer team that I can talk about my past work cup experience, I can&#8217;t really chat that much about, you know, Boston sports teams. But for the life in Boston, it&#8217;s getting cold. It&#8217;s raining right now and it&#8217;s just like a great season. I mean, I like actually autumn and fall and spring, not that cold. You live in Toronto, so you know what I mean with this winter. So it&#8217;s a great city and it&#8217;s very intellectual, especially in MIT. I have a few friends who are very like postdocs and doctors in various fields. AI is a very hype word right now. And I&#8217;m also studying something about AI Web3 in general. So one great experience I just had last week was when I was visiting a friend at MIT and we were playing with his dog, which is a robot dog. We&#8217;re chatting about AI and robotics, and that&#8217;s a quite interesting experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s wild. What are the people like at MIT? I&#8217;ve heard all these stories like on the internet and from the stories I heard and my apologies if I&#8217;m offending anyone here, but I&#8217;ve just heard it&#8217;s a bunch of nerds and it&#8217;s not a bad thing. It&#8217;s just again, you got to be a very smart cookie like yourself to get into MIT. Of course, it&#8217;s the one and only MIT where brilliant people go to school for post-secondary. What&#8217;s it like? Is that what the people&#8217;s like? Like the people party at all? Like what&#8217;s the lowdown on MIT?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re party like hell. So I work hard, study hard, and play hard is the key. So yes, there&#8217;s lots of stereotypes or saying MIT students are nerdy, which my experience is not really true. Like I said, we&#8217;re partying a lot. And also for gender ratio, I was surprised when I came and I realized that there are so many intelligent women and the students profile in the school in terms of gender and in terms of diversification like where we are from, international students, racialized, etc. Everything is so diversified. For example, at our MBA cohort, female to male ratio is like 45 to 55. So it&#8217;s quite neutral. Basically, I met lots of interesting intelligent people here and also we&#8217;re partying like hell.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. I absolutely love that. I&#8217;m going to pop down and come come party for a week with you and the squad there. A couple more questions on the travel topics and then we&#8217;ll get into the crypto stuff. I mind you, this is crypto as well, but you just went on a crazy journey, obviously Boston, then over to Singapore for TOKEN2049, then you hopped on a jet went to Hong Kong and then flew back to Boston. That&#8217;s quite the rip. How was token? What was good in Hong Kong? What was the sentiment like in the biggest, I guess it is probably the biggest crypto conference in Asia. How was that?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, so TOKEN2049, I had a keynote and a speech. We also organized a whole day event, which I call Bitget EmpowerX Summit. And we launched a fund called Bitget EmpowerX Fund that we can talk about later. So the event, our day, our summit, that&#8217;s actually the first time that Bitget is hosting a summit. We will sponsor some and we participated in a lot, but it&#8217;s the first time that we hosted an event. And the reason of us hosting this event is number one, we&#8217;re celebrating our fifth year anniversary. And then number two, we felt we are a leader in the space already. And we wanna provide the stage for our ecosystem to flourish. And also for us to connect to more people and more leaders in the space. And I had great conversations over there. As for TOKEN2049, this is my returning speech and panel already. I really enjoyed it. I had a panel with all major exchanges. There&#8217;s KuCoin, Bybit, OKX and us. So for big crypto exchanges and leaders from these exchanges, we had a great discussion around the most topics that people know or people interested in knowing how we do token listing, how are we ensuring more transparency and security for our users. And we always thought about starting up an exchange alliance. This is, by the way, still cooking. I will let you guys know if it&#8217;s confirmed. But there&#8217;s been some very interesting conversation. TOKEN2049 in general, I think we have fewer people this year, fewer participants or fewer audiences this year. Because I guess, bear market, last year TOKEN2049, that&#8217;s right before FTX. And there were still lots of hypes, lots of people from traditional finance industry or traditional tech industry, or just people interested in knowing the space. But right now, I felt there are less hypes or less window shoppers, but there are more builders and more Westerners traveling to Asia for TOKEN2049, I guess, due to regulatory reasons. So that&#8217;s my general experience in token. And then I went to Hong Kong for a closed-door event. It&#8217;s organized by Dragonfly Capital. They actually are investors and we&#8217;re their investors as well. So that&#8217;s a very interesting event. It&#8217;s like a 60 people closed-door. The founder of Dragonfly Capital literally hand-picked up everyone. I&#8217;m the only representative of Bitget. And I get to meet all the leaders, and they invited some very interesting speakers, and their portfolio company founders. And we had some further introduction and further conversation flowing. And I&#8217;m still meeting some of them online and offline right now to discuss further cooperation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, I absolutely love that. You gotta, Gracy, come on, break some news on the Cryptonews Pod. At least give us a little snippet. What&#8217;s going on with this exchange coalition or this exchange group that you discussed? Give us a couple details. Don&#8217;t let the cat out of the bag, but give us a little snippet here, Gracy. Come on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well this is hard because I literally, I think my PR people will scream at me because this again very un-started. But I&#8217;m happy to share a bit of at least what I&#8217;ve been thinking. Honestly, there are lots of issues that centralized exchanges are facing together, like number one, hacking and security things that we need to deal with. And number two, to build stronger standards amongst changes, such as when and why do we list a token and deal with the token and also among auditing, among proof-reserve, among protection funds that we have but some other exchanges may not. All these things that our users in the industry care about. So this again very preliminary discussion that I had with some of the exchange leaders that we thought it&#8217;s a good time to build an alliance so that we can battle some of those things together. And the reason that it took such a long time and it&#8217;s still, after two weeks, it&#8217;s still a preliminary discussion is that I do want this alliance to be meaningful and to be selective and to make real impact rather than just setting up an alliance and announce that and that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t want it to be just a PR thing and I really want it to be meaningful. So that&#8217;s why we want to take it slowly and talk about details and how to make it sustainable and how to make a real impact, things like that. But again, you are the first person that I talked to outside of Bitget and outside of other exchanges.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Of course. So folks, you heard it here. Nothing, this is obviously strictly preliminary and Gracy and the leaders of the exchanges might whip something together and create a potential crypto exchange alliance. But don&#8217;t look too much into it and potentially get your popcorn ready for the future, as this could be something very special. So we&#8217;ll leave it at that, c&rsquo;est la vie. One topic I can&#8217;t wait to get into is everything AI related. A couple of minutes ago, you discussed how AI is the big buzz word at MIT right now. Seems like it&#8217;s the big buzz word everywhere still. The trend still definitely has legs. You guys and the team at Bitget are doing some incredible things in that regards the innovation zones expansion. You have the artificial intelligence based martingale, CTA and grid trading strategies. You guys have been released some incredible products to allow your users to become better traders by piggybacking off of AI. I&#8217;d love you could touch a little bit more on this subject and just sort of segue into how you see AI shaping the future of crypto.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. So first of all, like we discussed, AI is a buzzword. And it&#8217;s not just a buzzword, it&#8217;s also a fundamental and very important technology that is changing and shaping how we live, how we work, how we interact with one another. Actually, we also invested in a virtual boyfriend, SocialFi company or GameFi company a month ago. And other than virtual boyfriend, they are also developing virtual girlfriend and virtual pets. So it&#8217;s all about emotions and taking care of the user but through AI. So it&#8217;s really different about, you know, it&#8217;s, and by the way, that company is called HIM. So if you have watched the movie, Her, it&#8217;s basically the opposite. And it&#8217;s the same idea. It&#8217;s just opposite gender that they are serving. But this aside, I felt in terms of trading, right? Because Bitget a crypto exchange and we look into how to use AI in crypto trading more. There are lots of positive aspects, obviously, like speed and efficiency can be increased. There is like powerful data analysis capability that we can talk about. For example, AI algorithms can, you know, analyze various data and a big set of data sources, including marketing trends, new sentiment and social media activities and historical price and then come up with certain pattern correlation trading opportunities, etc. And then there, we can also use AI in risk management because especially something like some strange behavior of like anti money laundering and trading like some, if we define the AI tool on some predefined risk parameters, then we can use AI to establish some stop loss order to determine like take profit levels and execute trades accordingly. So these are some great aspects that I kind of see in terms of applying AI to trading. But there are also lots of drawbacks. Number one, I will highlight is over reliance on historical data because AI narrates lots of by data, right, by history. And that&#8217;s quite dangerous. And then another thing is data security. What I mean is like data breach and cyber attack threats. So these are dangerous. And by the way, I experimented with ChatGPT the other day and I asked it to pick up 10 cryptocurrency that I should look into if I&#8217;m a risk averse investor. And in that 10 cryptocurrencies list, there is Terra Luna and that just happened a few months ago. So that&#8217;s what I mean by like historical data or data security concerns. And that&#8217;s just, you know, bad. And if you are relying your investment strategy things like ChatGPT, it can be very dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Such a good point. I mean, I haven&#8217;t, to be honest, Greece, I haven&#8217;t really thought about the lack of qualitative, the lack of emotion and empathy that AI has, you know? Like in trading, you obviously, there&#8217;s a lot of qual that goes into it as well. And when these AI algos are simply looking at, you know, previous historical data, like just like you said, they&#8217;re gonna spit out stuff like Terra Luna, which is wild to think about. It&#8217;s very interesting. Another topic that we gotta get into before we get into some more Bitget stuff. Obviously I lurk all of my guests Twitter before every single show. And a couple of days ago, it was actually yesterday, you had a great little tweet on some end of 2023, crypto trends, insomation, or some crypto predictions, rather, insomation, you put three points and these are great. We&#8217;re gonna attach this in the show notes. Number one is that high interest rates might not make crypto go to the moon right away. And I can&#8217;t wait to get into that one because that is definitely a bit of a hot take. Bitcoin ETFs could be like a superheroes arrival. I definitely agree with that one. And number three, more regulation could mean more people discovering crypto&#8217;s magic. Also agree with that one. The only one that I don&#8217;t fully agree with is high interest rates might not make crypto go to the moon right away. What is your take on that? Why do you not think that&#8217;ll make crypto rip if the gov continues to rise interest rates?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Okay, this requires a little bit explanation of how finance world works. I personally love to do this analogy of traditional financial world such as equity and bound market and monetary market. They are like a big pool, so swimming pool, like big pool, and crypto where like a small pool. And when money flows out from big pool, it flows to small pool. And vice versa, when the big pool is like pumping the so called inflow of cash or of investment fund, it&#8217;s also taking lots of effect on the small pool. Then why this relates to interest rates? So when interest rate is high, people will want to put more money in the bond market. So that&#8217;s exactly what we saw in NASDAQ, in NYSE, in the equity market. It&#8217;s also going down in general in terms of those market index. But that also has strong effect from crypto because when interest rate is high, people will be less willing to invest in alternative asset classes such as cryptocurrency. So what I meant is because FED and FOMC, the very last meeting that they had, they kind of indicated that there will be another interest rate rise end of this year. So because of this, crypto can very hard enter a bull market right away. That&#8217;s what I meant. I mean, very hard to do it right away. And by right away, I mean this year or earlier last year, due to this high interest rate and this strong correlation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices versus the interest rate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said. And are you in the camp that a Bitcoin ETF is still the absolute best thing that could happen to the market right now?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, I am. And I also think it&#8217;s not about whether or not, it&#8217;s more about when. So I&#8217;m a strong believer that Bitcoin spot ETF will be improved, likely earlier next year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>The only issue I have next year is the election. And it seems like in election years, a lot of big financial events often get pushed after the election just to see which party gets in. So, I mean, I&#8217;m hoping that doesn&#8217;t cause any issues, but we&#8217;ll definitely have to see. Last question before we get back into the Bitget stuff. What are the areas of crypto are really tickling your fancy at the moment? Obviously you are a leader of one of the best exchanges in the world. I&#8217;m sure you get asked this all the time, but what areas of crypto excite you, get you going, have you and the team, you know, putting eggs in that basket?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Right now I&#8217;m studying and looking into some projects in the so called new public chains, especially the Layer-2s. And then another thing that I&#8217;m studying recently a lot is TG bots. We see lots of growth on TG bots and the users. And you probably have heard that TG Telegram user has been reaching an all time high recently. And there are lots of TG bots working on Telegram. And also Telegram they issued a token talk to you. Although it&#8217;s like a little ambiguous, they don&#8217;t really say it&#8217;s their token, but everyone thinks it&#8217;s their token.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Which token is this?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>TON.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh, yeah. I just looked it up. Telegram is the fourth most popular messaging app globally. After WhatsApp, we chat in Facebook Messenger with an estimated 1.068 billion total users and 700 million monthly active users. That is insane, Gracy. In North America, you&#8217;re in North America now, more specifically in Toronto. Unless you&#8217;re in crypto, you don&#8217;t use Telegram. Like I don&#8217;t speak to one friend on Telegram who is not in crypto. And so it&#8217;s crazy to think that there&#8217;s that many active users, 700 million active users on Telegram in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, exactly. So you will be surprised. I agree. I also use Telegram mainly for crypto community and talking to some of our partners. Maybe WhatsApp is more used for friends and then looking for social network career wise. But you will be surprised to see how many people are joining Telegram. Like lots of crypto friends that I saw because I had their numbers saved earlier. So when they joined Telegram on vacation and I saw a lot of those recently.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So, sorry, why are you guys going so hard on the bots then? You just because of the influx of telegram users, you guys wanna be more efficient and more proper with the bots? Is that the whole ordeal there?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Not really. We are still operating mainly on our exchange and our app. The reason that I brought up Telegram bots is not because of Bitget. It&#8217;s just because I saw lots of trends and all these tokens like TON, Unibot, Banana Gone, that&#8217;s another crypto TG bot project. And we just listed their token, by the way. So all these companies or these projects, these tokens have been quite strong recently. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m studying. So I didn&#8217;t do it just because we at Bitget, we are doing something around. Not really a lot. And you will be supporting like TON. I think TON is like number 12 token right now. I would say the valuation is really high. Market cap is 7 billion for that token.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s crazy. Yes, 7.3.</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, you don&#8217;t know TON at all, like a couple.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Interesting, crazy volume on it too. I assume it&#8217;s listed on Bitget.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Uh, yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, of course, I love that. Grace, you&#8217;ve got to take a quick break, give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT, and when we get back, we are going to dive in to a couple of super fun things. Bitget&#8217;s EmpowerX Fund, some community engagement, and the big rebranding, which even the team, absolutely crushed. And before that though, got to give a huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime sponsor of the show, longtime friends of cryptonews.com.

Let&#8217;s get right into the rebrand. I&#8217;m a marketer, I love rebrands. I think unless you have a brand that is so cliche, like McDonald&#8217;s or a BMW or a Mercedes Benz, where everyone knows your logo and you&#8217;ve been established for dozens of years, I love a good rebrand. It gets the people going. It&#8217;s good to bring some new blood on the front end. Why did you guys rebrand? Was it just, oh, we&#8217;re getting sick of it? Was it we did some, you know, community studies? What was the purpose behind it? I love it, but I&#8217;m always curious to know why you chose to do it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, so the rebrand, we started that earlier this year. The main reason was number one, it&#8217;s been a while that we used our logo and our UI, UX, all these color things that we felt some user might be a little bit tired of it. It was mainly blue, black, and white that we were using. And right now, if you see our brand image, it&#8217;s much more colorful, with steel blue being the thin color, but there&#8217;s lots of purple, green, even pink, red, etc. to supplement blue. And we want to indicate that we are a careful, colorful brand, and with some new filling and new images. And also for the slogan, we used to call it, our logo used to be &#8220;Better Trading Better Life&#8221;. It was still like, what do you mean by Better Trading Better Life? Why Better Life? Yeah, so we want to be very straightforward, to be smart, and we want to define what is smart and have Bitget as a smart platform for our users, because it&#8217;s all about making wise and smart decisions. And again, another thing is five years. So Bitget was established in 2018. Many people were not aware of that. So we want to use this rebrand as an opportunity to emphasize that Bitget is a wood exchange also. Not a nobody who just came up on the street one or two years ago. Although we did become much more famous since one or two years ago, because the team, honestly, before, I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s my credit, but honestly, my team, before I joined, it&#8217;s a bunch of people from product, technology, and operation. And they are so down to ground and get hands dirty kind of person. And they don&#8217;t really do much marketing before I came in. So while we signed up, Leo Messi last year, and we did this rebranding, we had lots of things flowing. Our team also grew tremendously within the one and a half year, for the past one and a half year, from 200 to right now, 1,500. So there&#8217;s been lots of growth in the company, and we just want to use rebranding as an opportunity to showcase that we&#8217;ve been here for a while and let people know what we are focusing on. And we want to continue being this great platform with tools and knowledge to help our users confidently navigate the world of crypto.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said. Another thing we have to get into is the Bitget EmpowerX Fund. You guys did a nice, fat, $100 million fund, not a small amount. 100 big tickets, 100 mil, dedicated to fostering the platform&#8217;s ecosystem development, and the fund seeks investment opportunities in regional exchanges, data analytics firms, media orgs, other entities. Is this just we&#8217;re taking some of the profit slash rev that we have and investing it in our whole ecosystem to grow all legs, all verticals of Bitget? Is that the sort of the TLDR, the summation of it?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, correct. And the reason that we are most interested in these sectors, such as regional exchanges, data analytics firms, and media organizations, are twofold. Number one, they are actually two sets of companies. Like regional exchanges, it&#8217;s just like our smaller competitors that in some regions, they are stronger. But we have a global and famous brand that with that acquirements or investment, we can each leverage on the small exchanges can leverage on our platform, and we can leverage on their local experience and localization and their user and maybe license as well. And then media analytics firms and data analytics firms and media organizations, this I call it a whole group, like consider it being together because these are for mass adoption and or drive mass adoption and for us to grow with ecosystem synergies. And there will be a very big announcement coming up soon, maybe a few, within a few months or even faster, a few weeks that we get to acquire a major media firm, a top one. Yeah. So basically,&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Like crypto media?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Don&#8217;t bite me into this. You want more it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re just so many names out there, right? There isn&#8217;t many big crypto media.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. Well, I mean, you&#8217;re talking to the biggest right now. You&#8217;re talking to the one only cryptonews.com. So, you know, I&#8217;m joking, but you know what I mean? Well, hey, we&#8217;re top eight. You know, we&#8217;re usually, we range between five and 12, depending on the month. So, but that&#8217;s awesome. I mean, that&#8217;s just gonna, you know, that&#8217;s just gonna increase the scope. And you&#8217;ve seen this happen time after time, all the big business leaders and companies always end up buying media companies because it just expands your reach. Like you saw Jeff Bezos by the Washington Post, right? For Amazon, not for Amazon, but I mean, if you have the money, why wouldn&#8217;t you? Especially in today&#8217;s day and age, where every company needs to be a media company, right? Like you either pay for media or you create media. It&#8217;s pretty binary. And if you can have an entity, it does both. I mean, that really does move the needle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>And also we felt right now it&#8217;s a bear market. The valuation is relatively low. I keep saying that bear market or crypto winter is the golden window for growth, while also people don&#8217;t really believe so. Still, I&#8217;m a strong believer that when valuation is low, you should invest and be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy. And I think right now it&#8217;s generally people are more fearful and we are being quite aggressive and greedy in this climate. So lots of investment, lots of acquirement. We just did our announcement of acquiring BitKeep. That&#8217;s one of the firms that I invested in early days as well. And that&#8217;s how I get to know the Bitgetting. So BitKeep was rebranded to Bitget Wallet and we acquired BitKeep actually last year, but we just did announcement this year during the Paris Blockchain Week. So all these are activities that we have been doing and we are continually doing in order to strengthen our competitive edge in this centralized exchange domain because the competitions between exchanges for us is not just about DAU trading volumes. As the last cycle, right now it&#8217;s a lot about ecosystem and how we can have synergies among the whole supply chain and how we kind of help each other grow stronger.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, well said. Gracy, this has been a treat. We are getting tight for time. Last topic that I really want to get into is Bitcoin. You always have a bunch of really good takes on Bitcoin as a leader of an exchange. What&#8217;s going on with Bitcoin right now? What key resistance level do we need to hit or surpass? What sentiment like is it different in Asia than it is across the pond in North America? Give me the quick sort of 360 degree birds-eye view on present day Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s hard. And this is impromptu. You should give me more time to prepare. So that I can give it a more concise presentation on Bitcoin, hopefully a 360 degree, maybe a 180 degree.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, give me 180 or just the 90 or 90 degree works to just a nice little nice little Bitcoin snippet.</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Okay yeah, so Bitcoin obviously there are a few things happening or going to happen that people care. Number one, halving. Halving is quite, is a certain thing, right? And it will happen next year, very likely March, April 2024. Why this is not an accurate day? Because you know, Bitcoin, so it&#8217;s all about when this blocks is built and the 3.5 to 4 year Bitcoin cycle or crypto cycle, bull market and bear market cycle is there mainly because of halving. But honestly, I myself don&#8217;t really think halving is that important. Because, well, right now the change, the marginal change is just not that much.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it&#8217;s not as big as it was before. Every year it gets less and less. Well, not every year. Every halving it gets less and less. Yeah, good point.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Although next year might still be the year when we kick off the next bull market, but it may not be because of halving. It&#8217;s just a coincidence that all these things happened in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Same time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, but it doesn&#8217;t really guarantee that halving will drive the same pattern that it saw before. However, other than halving, spot ETF, BTC spot ETF is something that I think more meaningful. So for some of our audiences who might not be like have a full picture, you probably have heard that BTC spot ETF, this was firstly initiated by BlackRock and then followed by WisdomTree, by Fidelity and some other institutions. So there&#8217;s like seven institutions earlier, which is perceived by the market that, at least by me, that the approval chance is pretty high. Yeah, so I think I also read, I listened to this interview of CNBC versus the former SEC Chairperson Jay Clayton, that&#8217;s like the first of September or something like just 20 days ago, that he said that an approval is inevitable because that could tell me between a futures product and cash product cannot go on forever. Yeah, so I mean, listen to him if you don&#8217;t believe in me, agree, I personally agree with him that BTC spot ETF is going to be approved. And once it&#8217;s approved, the core beneficiary would obviously be the price of BTC, but you will drive some of the sectors such as real-world asset, RWA and all the Altcoin, Ethereum coins together because BTC is like the index of our industry. So these are the two things that I think is going to happen around BTC.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I would love for all those things to happen. Might not be as big as everyone thinks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Halving might not be bad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, as impactful as everyone thinks. That&#8217;s honestly a really good take. I like that one. Last thing we didn&#8217;t touch, two huge things. The bread and butter of Bitget is obviously the derivatives platform and the copy trading. When I had you on last year on the pod, I think you were one of the first guests who talked about copy trading and I absolutely not fell in love. It&#8217;s definitely a bit of a boost, but I just went down a bit of a rabbit hole and saw how efficient and sweet that is. I&#8217;d love for our last sort of segment of the show, just give me the quick TLDR on what Bitget does in regards to derivatives trading and copy trading and how easy it is for traders or non-traders like myself who just want to come on, get started on the platform and use Bitget&#8217;s incredible features like derivatives and copy trading.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, so Bitget is number one in derivative trading, I mean, among all the crypto exchanges. Bitget is strong in derivative trading because we started off in 2018 and 2019 with derivative market, especially in East Asia. And then for copy trading, this is something we started in May of 2020. And there have been lots of users. I think there are 110,000 elite traders that we have. Elite traders are the traders who have strategies and have opened up their portfolio for sharing, for subscribing. And then the follower or other traders, they can just copy trade and subscribe to that trading strategy and then copy trade. So whatever the elite trader is doing, the followers will be copying that trade or strategy, will be making the same sailing or basically long and short positions. And also for copy trading, we used to have only derivative offered in this, but we also have spot copy trading earlier this year. And that&#8217;s quite an innovation that we had because we are probably one of the very first exchanges to offer spot copy trading. We have this because we realize some of the users might not be very comfortable with derivative trading because it&#8217;s leveraged. Many users just prefer to buy and hold and sell when the price goes up. And they just don&#8217;t like leverage. So we offer copy trading for a spot market as well. And also this year, we actually put lots of effort and resource into growing the spot market. Because like I said, we are stronger in derivative. If you look at data like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, we are top five in derivative market among all centralized exchanges, maybe top 10 around the spot market. So we are stronger in derivative market, but we want to use this crypto venture as a, again, golden window for growth to grow our spot market as well. Some of the strategies around that is to offer uniquely a valuable asset. And again, another thing is I have our research team monitoring the unchain data. And we want to offer some cryptocurrencies earlier than our competitors do so. So for example, we listed PEPE three weeks before Binance did that. And we also listed Bitron, ecosystem tokens, even before ARB was there. Because we realized that this loss of unchain data, like GMX has lots of volume, driving about 80% of the Arbitrum growth. And we talked to all those, like there were 10 plus crypto tokens that were ready before ARB launched, or Arbitrum had their airdrop, etcetera, March this year. So these are some of the actions that we are taking in order to grow our spot market, because at that time, users can only buy Arbitrum, ecosystem tokens, or only be able to buy PEPE at Bitget before our competitors do so. So our listing strategy evolves, and we want to make sure that we are working with the most legit, most wanted crypto projects as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Amazing. Gracy, always a pleasure. Love having you on. Hopefully we can meet in person one day and can&#8217;t wait for round three. We&#8217;ll have to do a little sooner this time. The whole year, hiatus is a little too much. So hopefully we can make that happen over the next couple of months. Always a pleasure. Thank you so much. And before you go, please let our listeners know where they can find you and Bitget online and on social.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I&#8217;m very active on Twitter, now X, I still can&#8217;t get used to that name.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I call it Twitter. It&#8217;s still Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gracy Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>So @GracyBitget feel free to add me.

We are Buzz and as always, and I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guests on the show, the one and only Omer Amsel, head of Web3 at Fireblocks. Also the Director of Product Management at Fireblocks. As head of Web3, Omer is responsible for the strategy and product development enabling access and building of the emerging digital economy, including DeFi, NFTs and GameFi via the Fireblocks platform. For over a decade, Omer has been adapting cutting edge tech such as blockchain, solar energy, machine learning and computer vision to great products that solve real world challenges. Prior to Fireblocks, Omer led product at UVeye. He also Co-Founded Slice RE, a blockchain-based real estate equity firm, and has done a whole bunch of other stuff as well. But that bio will be eight minutes long, so we&#8217;re cutting just the good stuff here. Omer, pumped to have you on. Welcome to the show, my friend. How are you?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thank you, Matt. Happy to be here, big fan. So really happy to be here. That bio is like, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s like too long for me. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m very, so I&#8217;m humbled. Thank you so much for everything.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>No, I love it. It&#8217;s great to have you on, man. I know we&#8217;ve been trying to try to make this happen for a while. Let&#8217;s get right into it here. You co-founded a couple of different companies. It seems like you&#8217;ve dabbled in a shitload of different industries, blockchain, solar energy, ML, computer vision. I don&#8217;t even know what computer vision is, but a lot of really big boy and big gal stuff, walk me through sort of your childhood journey, any sports growing up. I know you said that you are from Israel, walk me through everything that went on and how that brought you into present day Omer working at Fireblocks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, so that&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t think anyone ever asked me that. But I was born in Israel, born in Tel Aviv, one of the biggest cities in Israel, as far as cities go in Israel. It&#8217;s only like what currently a 9, 10 million citizen country, so it&#8217;s pretty small. You know, I grew up, I think since the age of five, I had a computer in my room. My parents are very like a gadgety. So they were always trying to see what&#8217;s the new tech and buy that my father more than my mother. So I got into computer super early and admittedly it was mostly around basic coding and computer games. I still play computer games to this day, so it&#8217;s a big love of mine to do that. I grew up, nothing too remarkable, and I really have to do mandatory army service. So I did that and then I took my girlfriend, then now my wife, to 10 months in South America, explored different cultures, and we went to South America, Central America, and then the US. And then I studied computer science, got involved in the startup industry. Israel is like super hectic in terms of tech startups, as you might know. I think you&#8217;ve had a few Israeli co-founders and CEOs on your pod. Yeah, so you know, we&#8217;re big on entrepreneurship. So during studies, I helped another startup. I founded a startup right after in the travel industry. From there, moved on to the solar industry as a first employee in another startup. And then obviously didn&#8217;t draw any conclusions. So jumped right in into another startup that I did, mostly around real estate and equity fundraising, trying to automate that. That&#8217;s where I actually got exposed to blockchain technologies somewhere around 2013, 2014. It was super interesting. It&#8217;s not every day that you get to kind of see new tech, and kind of the foundation is a little bit different. Because you grow up, you know, you learn about computers, you learn how they operate. And then suddenly it shifts a little bit. So it&#8217;s not necessarily only like, oh, you can do computation locally. And then, oh, there&#8217;s cloud, which means that you can do computation in a distant environment, which was great and amazing. This kind of shifts, you know, opens up a new, a totally new mindset. You need to adapt to it. And it was super interesting to be in a position where I could take my startup and pivot towards blockchain technologies. So I did that. What we tried to do is basically do security tokens for real estate. It&#8217;s a little bit of a cheating because, and we did that all regulated. So if the audience knows what a Reg D is and a Reg A, and all these SEC words, that means a few different things, basically it&#8217;s just taking what we call an SPV, a special purpose vehicle, or an LLC at the end of the day, and tokenizing the LP rights, the limited partner rights. And then that represents ownership within the real estate. And this is what you tokenize. Obviously, it was too early then because you have to get investors both on board with actually investing in the real estate and also say, oh, you know what? And it&#8217;s also tokenized in blockchain. And, you know, during 2017, 2018, blockchain went from like being a bless to being a curse, in a sense. So during the ICO phase, it was a very interesting and challenging time to be in blockchain technologies. So I decided as the founder that we weren&#8217;t at the right place. And the right time to do what we wanted to do. So I kind of took a hiatus from blockchain technology, went to lead product for a company that does automated vehicle inspection called UVI. And, you know, you ask what machine vision is, machine vision is basically how to teach a computer to see what we see and understand what we understand based on images that are fed into that machine. So it involves a lot of machine learning. We did that. That&#8217;s why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Is that the classic CAPTCHA? Like when you&#8217;re logging into your bank or whatever and they&#8217;re like click on all images that are a bus or a road or a stop sign. You hasn&#8217;t then taken that data, putting it into the algo and boom.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Correct. So yeah. Yeah, it involves a lot of tagging, a lot of data being taken in. Yeah, basically teaching a machine how to spot what we think is interesting specifically for those use cases in order to output something meaningful for our customers. And companies still going in a great shape. I love those guys, but the offer from there to be part of Fireblocks and to go back to what I love, which is the blockchain technology and being at the location or being at the time and a place where you matter, allured me to do that. So that&#8217;s how I wound up at Fireblocks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Very cool. I love that. Great intro. Now myself and the listeners definitely know a little bit about you. A couple questions that we need to go over before we get into the Web3 stuff, before we get into obviously Fireblocks and everything Web3 crypto blocks generated. I love to travel as well. You grabbed the lady, you took her over to South America. What are the best or most underrated countries in South America that you visited?</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Wow. I don&#8217;t want to upset anyone. I think, but so I&#8217;m only speaking from like a very subjective experience, right? So I think the consensus between my wife and I is that we really like Bolivia, which sometimes goes a little bit underrated. Think Bolivia is great, really enjoyed there. I guess one of the most amazing places we went is Patagonia, the land of fire, Tierra del Puego. South of Argentina and Chile, getting all the way down to like the most southern city of Ushuaia, that was super amazing. And of course, the Galapagos, which are always great and like really extremely awesome wildlife where you get like face to face with it. I remember like I went snorkeling from the boat and like a pack of seals just surrounded me. So I don&#8217;t know, these experiences are like, we have the time of our lives. So like South America is like, I super suggest it, like I recommend it. I couldn&#8217;t recommend it enough.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. What about Espanol? To speak Spanish a little? A little, a little. Yeah, me too. I&#8217;m grinding. I&#8217;m working on it right now. I&#8217;m trying to, you know, I&#8217;m just using Duolingo, a couple other apps, calling my, I have an aunt who speaks Spanish. So just trying to, you know, build this streak 20 minutes a day, keep the doctor away. And then when I go back down to Mexico, just hopefully be able to actually speak a little because French, you know, I speak French, English, French is nice, but I don&#8217;t speak French with anyone, man. And like, you know, especially in Canada, everyone&#8217;s like, all French, this French, that. There&#8217;s one province that speaks it and no one else does. So trying to get on that Spanish grind, but very interesting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, Spanish is amazing and it really helps out. Again, I was in Israel, right? You actually get a lot of Israelis speak Spanish because after the army, you take what&#8217;s considered in the US as a leap year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>You&#8217;re a vacation. Yeah, just travel rip it up&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, and like for a year. So like probably 50% go to the far east and then 50% go to South America. And then so you have a lot of young people actually speaking like very broken Spanish, but they understand they can speak a little. But it doesn&#8217;t really help you in Israel. There are not a lot of like Spanish speaking, but here in the US it&#8217;s super helpful to kind of, you know, speak a little bit of Spanish. It&#8217;s really helpful. So I&#8217;m glad I did so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>And my last point before we question, rather, before we get into all the crypto stuff is Israel. I have been a part of many teams with Jewish founders and it just seems like not seems, but you guys, haul ass, you guys work incredibly hard, you have such a high tolerance for risk. What is it? I&#8217;ve never been, again, I feel like I understand the religion and culture pretty well, just because, again, Toronto, very large Jewish population, whether it was hockey teammates, friends at university school, and now being in business with a bunch of Jews as well, learned so much, and the one thing that I still can&#8217;t put a thumb on is how hard you guys work and the want to succeed in business. And I don&#8217;t know if this is such a shitty question on my end, but if you could try to articulate it, what is the reason why? What&#8217;s the sauce behind it?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I probably don&#8217;t know enough about Jewish people, kind of in what we call the diaspora, like all over the world and specifically in the US. I can say something about Israeli founders and kind of the state of mind that we have in Israel. You know, we&#8217;re a fairly new country. So if we didn&#8217;t have the entrepreneurial spirit built into most of the population, then we probably wouldn&#8217;t have survived and thrived. You know, Israel is only like 75 years old and you know, you need to make it up as you go, right? And that&#8217;s the mentality, right? Sometimes you feel like if you know all the challenges that are in front of you, you might decide not to do it because there are too many. But if in a sense you&#8217;re kind of ignorant to all the challenges that come and you&#8217;re good at, I wouldn&#8217;t say improvising, but you know, kind of dynamically changing and being very fluid in terms of like, you are very motivated, you know what the goal is and you&#8217;ll find the solution, no matter how many challenges and how much like bad stuff are being thrown your way. I think that&#8217;s the mentality of like an Israeli entrepreneur. And that&#8217;s why we see a lot of them succeed. And I&#8217;m not saying by any means that, you know, other cultures and other countries do not share the same mindset. Just for me, within the Israeli community, that&#8217;s what I see people who are very focused, very motivated and you know, we cannot dismiss the fact that the army gives you some tools, you know, to cope with hardships and, you know, accept that there are certain things that are above you. And then like you need to just make do with what you have and find a creative solution in order to achieve that. So I think these, again, we can go into a long conversation. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m like the most fit to talk about it. This is kind of what I feel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Just something that&#8217;s always been curious. And even with Shabbat, with, you know, not using one of the companies that worked for Hush, shout out Aaron and Lior, Lior, one of the co-founders, Jewish, he took Shabbat very seriously, Toronto. And from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, I believe, my apologies if I have that wrong. He wouldn&#8217;t use technology. So it&#8217;s like he would work his balls off from Sunday to Friday at six, five, six, seven p.m., whatever you want to call it, grinding, but then Saturday was a day to spend with family, eat incredible Jewish food and read books and not use tech. So it&#8217;s like, I feel like a lot of entrepreneurs don&#8217;t also get that full day break because you&#8217;re grinding seven days a week, burnout. Whereas that day off, you know, when you&#8217;re taking off a day every single week, I feel like that moves the shit out of the needle. Again, these are just weird things I think about over. Weird things I think about over time.</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>I kind of agree. I think that the other thing that you can think about is that it&#8217;s not necessarily the fact that you&#8217;re not working is you have this time where you can kind of hear everything. Yeah, you have the time to get more perspective on what you do because once the technology is there, you know, it&#8217;s all about like push notifications and emails and Slack messages. So you&#8217;re you&#8217;re devoted to the day to day, the minute to minute the hour to hour. Once you can get a you can go a step back and think about it, then you kind of process more and you have more resolutions and resolve into what you&#8217;re going to do next week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s like a restart of your computer. You know, just take the hard drive, give it a little clean. So, anyways, let&#8217;s let&#8217;s go into the crypto stuff. These are the things that always pique my curiosity. And this is a crypto pod though. So let&#8217;s dance here. Let&#8217;s put our top dancing shoes on. Let&#8217;s get right into it. What exactly is Fireblocks? I love throwing the ball over to my guest courts. You can explain this much better than I can. Give me the sort of 30 second one minute elevator pitch on Fireblocks, the TLDR, and then we&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Right, so first and foremost, Fireblocks is a wallet provider and enterprise-grade wallet provider. What we do is provide an abstract of blockchain for any company that deals with digital assets to do that safely and securely. Starting with the most basic component, which is the wallet, and then expanding from that into in -depth security, giving you all the tools that you need in order to build your business on top of blockchain technology, facilitating a myriad of use cases and segments in the blockchain industry, the crypto industry. So that&#8217;s, I would say, like 20 seconds about that, but we can elaborate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Of course. And as head of Web3, it appears that one of your main roles is onboarding Web2 companies into the Web3 space using the myriad of tools and applications and piece of software that Fireblocks has. Walk me through some of these conversations, what do they sound like? What are the big value props on your guys&#8217; end? What are some of the big roadblocks on the Web2, Fortune 500 companies&#8217; end? Just give me the overarching scope of what these conversations sound like. How would they actually get moved from point A to point B, walk me through that whole situation?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Awesome. So super interesting question. I would say I&#8217;ll take a step back in order for us to be aligned on kind of the definitions. What does it mean for me to be the head of Web3? Because I think everything is Web3. I always like to give this example that I was in a panel about a year and a half ago when I was still in Fireblocks and the panel title was DeFi Security. A year later, I did probably the same panel with probably the same people and the same question. It was only titled Web3 Security. So as a company, as a big company already, we need to understand what does it mean when we say Web3. So Fireblocks originally, as I&#8217;ve said, what we provide, we provided it mostly for the financial industry. You can think about it of anyone that wanted to deal with crypto as a speculative asset. So prop trading firm, hedge funds, banks, VCs, all these companies that dealt with digital assets for trading purposes, for investment purposes. And we built the entire foundation for them to deal with those digital assets, as I said, safely and securely. The same rails, the same suite of products that we&#8217;ve developed can also facilitate and also facilitate companies that not necessarily their intent of using blockchain technologies is strictly financial. It doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s non-profit or anything of that sort, but the products and the nature of the companies are not ones that provide financial tools. They don&#8217;t provide investment opportunities or they don&#8217;t provide, they&#8217;re not fintech per se. So here we talk about companies such as consumer brand, marketing agencies, gaming companies. So what we call Web3 basically internally, we define as non-financial use cases for blockchain technology. So this is my role within Fireblocks to own those segments that utilize blockchain technologies for non-financial purposes. And sometimes there&#8217;s a very big overlap between that and utility of building or creating assets that provide utility for the consumers. So one very simple example is NFTs as loyalty programs, token-gated experiences, and so on and so forth. These might have value, but the companies that actually produce the consumer experiences are not providing financial tools to those end users, to those consumers. So this is kind of how we define it. You can think of a gaming use cases of minting on chain tokens that represent something within the game. So use cases such as that, this is what I deal with. And it&#8217;s been super interesting, from the bull run of 2021 into a little bit of 2022, and then kind of the bear market that&#8217;s lasting in, I think it might be cliche, but it&#8217;s super interesting to be in the industry right now because there are two things. One, big companies are taking their time to actually devise a strategy and are not stressed out to do, oh, we need to capitalize on this super fast. Like let&#8217;s do something, let&#8217;s like put a token out there and like.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>No more rushing in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Exactly. So they&#8217;re taking the time and this is part of our job to also help educate and onboard them as an enterprise, not necessarily on the technology itself. So it&#8217;s super interesting to see how these conversations, very deep conversation of wait, so what&#8217;s the actual use case? What strategy can we build? What are the KPIs that we measure success with? And how does this benefit either existing revenue streams or new net revenue streams, which is super interesting as a business to have these conversations. They&#8217;re not very rush, but on the other hand, you see a lot of belief that no matter how long it takes, the next bull run and the next like this thing, this trigger will happen to trigger the next bull run. So everyone is very convinced that it&#8217;s going to happen. From one hand, they cannot be super complacent, but from the other hand, they don&#8217;t see like a lot of rush to do it right now. So how do we build for the future without like rushing anything and then neglecting it once it doesn&#8217;t meet the standards and the expectations of the leadership or steering committees that they have internally within the company?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said. So you obviously are in a fortune spot where you get to have these conversations with you know, C-suite execs and VPs and leaders and board members at Fortune 500 companies who want to enter Web3 and want some, perhaps some is the wrong word, a lot of peace of mind and you know, clarity on how to enter the space. And that&#8217;s why I go to someone like you at Fireblocks. What do these conversations sound like? What are their big questions to you? How do you sort of put the cherry on the cake and get them to start using Web3 tech like NFTs and token gated communities instead of the traditional Web2 stuff?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Right. So I guess the, you know, it really much depends where are they on their, what we call like the crypto journey or the Web3 journey. If they&#8217;ve just heard about it and they, you know, they&#8217;re super skeptical and they say, Oh, you know what? Convince me. That&#8217;s not a conversation that we usually have, right? We need our counterparty to have a little bit of resolve when it comes to Web3. We need them to have a little bit of a motivation to do that because we&#8217;re not making up things for other companies as they come. So usually our conversations are with, you know, either innovation teams or project managers or VPs, C levels that have a resolve of doing something, transforming their business into Web3, but they have concerns. They have a general idea of what this is. We help them, first of all, mitigate any risks that they might think of and plan that out from a technical perspective. How do they get to kind of a production grade feature, hopefully using our technologies? So I guess maybe this is a good segue to understand what are kind of the main challenges that these companies look at. I guess the first one is regulatory and the second one is more about the user experience. They are interrelated, right? Because if these companies could go to their user base and say, Hey, you know what? We&#8217;ve built this awesome Web3 product. All you need to do is plug in your wallet and then I don&#8217;t know if sad truth or it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s a good opportunity and it&#8217;s a positive is that most of their existing customers and more specifically the target market of their Web3 product is not aimed towards specifically the ones that already have a wallet. And as we know in this industry, creating a wallet while it became much easier, you know, in the past, probably, you know, it&#8217;s a really great slope, I guess, upward training of how easy it is to actually have a wallet. It&#8217;s still not very friendly in that sense. So, you know, if you think about, I don&#8217;t know about your parents, I can say about my parents, they don&#8217;t have a wallet, for instance, they might have an account in an exchange, but they don&#8217;t have a wallet. So basically what you do is you kind of cut your addressable market in probably 85, 90 percent. If you don&#8217;t have a way to kind of give them a good experience into onboarding into your product, right? So now here&#8217;s the catch 22, because if you embed that entire onboarding process and you want to make life as easy as possible to your consumers, then you&#8217;re running to regulatory issues, right? Because you would say, Hey, you know what? You don&#8217;t need to own your keys. You don&#8217;t need to own your wallet. I&#8217;ll open a wallet for you. Give you the entire experience. Don&#8217;t worry about it. Like it looks like Web2 for you, but you do have NFTs. You have some measure of control over them. You might be able to go to another Web3 application and connect your wallet through my wallet. But then these big enterprises say, wait, so who&#8217;s the custodian of these assets? Who takes custody over these assets of the consumers? So we provide, Fireblocks provide different custody mechanisms, but up until now it was like you as a corporate customer or as an enterprise, you&#8217;re the custodians of these assets. Now, if you go to FinTech companies, if you go to the financial space, that&#8217;s mostly fine because they are regulated entities. They might be qualified custodians. They might have MTS. They might have like all these different. They&#8217;re already deep within, you know, with the regulator. If you look at FinTech companies, so companies like Itoro and Revolut and all these, you know, you had an interview with the Itoro person also. So they are used to being to take custody over their consumers assets. But then when you go, you kind of cross the, you know, the cross the street and you talk with consumer brands, they don&#8217;t have any appetite to actually be the custodian of the assets. They don&#8217;t want to, you know, kind of step into that regulatory mess, as we know it is right now, specifically in the US.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>You can&#8217;t blame them either.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>No, I don&#8217;t. So it&#8217;s kind of a UX issue that leads up to a regulatory issue. And then to cap it all up, you have also the internal, I guess, compliance and regulatory issues of, Hey, I am a publicly traded company and I&#8217;m going to put ETH on my balance sheet. How exactly do I do that? Does that warrant any, any special like a consideration? So all these are concerns that these companies have. I didn&#8217;t even touch, oh, how do we make it secure? How do we make it easy? How do we orchestrate it? How do we automate it? These are like for me, like a second order of magnitude problems. It&#8217;s not like the first order of magnitude. So these are kind of the main challenges and obviously shamelessly self promoting. This is what we set out to solve, right? For these companies. How do you manage your treasuries without necessarily having to pay gas fees in ETH and keep like ETH on your balance sheet? How do we provide you with a custody model that will appease your internal compliance and regulation officers through what we believe is a non custodial wallet and then unlocking the way to onboarding your consumers into these types of wallets while not affecting the UX too much, allowing you to access that a target market that you want. So this is kind of the suite of products that we have and obviously providing security in depth and guardrails to actually keep your consumer safe and use you as an enterprise safe and secure, dealing with those assets for your users. So yeah, it was a long pitch, but this is what we do here.</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>No, I love that. And I appreciate that.

One more thing before we get into our next subject here, the next million users, you&#8217;ve obviously been on the little bit of the podcast circuits, you have stuff written online as well. You and the team at Fireblocks are big on onboarding the next one million users. This is going to be extremely tough. You just spoke about how tough it is. Not only are you guys, you know, pitching these Fortune 500 companies on your software, but you&#8217;re also pretty much a friggin consultant. Not pretty much. You are a bloody consultant and you are teaching them how to navigate regulatory shit shows and the whole nine yards all the way down to the full kit and caboodle. With that being said, how do we get the next million users on boarded into the big bad Web3?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I&#8217;ll tell you what I advocated my strategy is. Think the honest truth is that we need a killer application. It might be a game, it might be&#8230;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I completely agree. You need that. You need the one thing. Similar to how Facebook, you know, not Facebook, I guess MySpace was the catalyst for social networks. We need that one big boy that sort of sets the stage for everyone else. Sorry to interrupt, keep going.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>No, you&#8217;re 100% correct. And I would say for me, I&#8217;m not vain enough to say, what is exactly that application? You need to fuel the industry, right? You need to empower VCs to make good decisions in order to spread capital for smaller teams to work. You need to equip those smaller teams with really great tools so they can focus on product and not just kind of a mess around with, wait, how do I do key management on blockchain and how, right? We wanna take this abstract idea of how blockchain works and then apply it to an application on a consumer level, which is not financial, like not a trading app per se, right? It can be something very similar to it. But I want to get to a point where I say, hey, how come no one thought of this before? This is like a perfect fit. This is like great for me. I love it and it&#8217;s built on blockchain rails. And this is what we need, we need that killer app. And it might come, I have my own ideas of where it will come from, but we truly believe that it will come, right, from one of these applications. Once you have that application, you&#8217;ll start to have best practices. How do they do it? Wait, how can we replicate it to maybe a different segment of the market or maybe a different use case? So we&#8217;ll see that as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Hold up, Omar, before you keep going, what&#8217;s your, give me your idea. What area, what sector do you think it&#8217;s gonna be in? It&#8217;s gonna be financials, is it gonna be a game? Is it going to be a social network?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m going to be crucified for this. Maybe I&#8217;m going to rub a lot of people the wrong way, but as I&#8217;ve said, I come from a gaming background. I think that a game that will do it in what we are seeing right now, partly with like the, you saw with DraftKings, what&#8217;s going on there, which is kind of the border between game and financial, but it will cross over. We know of a lot of like super amazing, very talented teams. If you look at Shrapnel trying to build like a loot extraction game over Blockchain, which makes a lot of sense for me. It might be like a good use case. We see, we know that Zynga now announced that they have a blockchain based game that is set to launch by the end of the year. Maybe even next month, I don&#8217;t remember. You see a lot of interest. Square Enix started with, Blockchain is interesting to the fact that they announced like a game, Square Enix, the creators of Final Fantasy, which they announced that they&#8217;re experimenting with it and they&#8217;re going like with it. There are a lot of different companies, right? That are taking that and trying to build something. I&#8217;m not saying that all of them will succeed and I&#8217;m not saying that the games will be great, that all of them will be great, but some of them will. And you look at that industry, that industry is like monstrous, right? The gaming industry is just simply monstrous. And look at what Nike announced, right? With EA games and Epic and Fortnite, right? So it&#8217;s slowly creeping in. It might come really from the consumer logo brands doing composable interactions with games. It might be a pure game use case, but I feel everyone&#8217;s kind of eyeing towards that like super engaging industry and trying to build something that will accommodate gamers. The current sentiment is awful towards like Blockchain and NFTs. But I feel it&#8217;s only because they haven&#8217;t experienced the utility side. They only experienced that, oh, wait, I bought this NFT, I lost 95% value on it. So, you know, the NFTs are crap. So sorry for my language. But this is what I feel is the sentiment, but I feel like giving a good use case, it might be turned over. So my bet will be something around the gaming industry, either a game or a high profile collaboration between a game and maybe like a huge consumer brand. So that&#8217;s what I would say.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I also think it&#8217;s going to be something gaming related, but I feel like the most important and most valuable piece of that puzzle will be something in regards to micro payments. I feel like with the prominence of gaming and obviously, and this is Gary Vee&#8217;s term, not mine, but we do live in the attention economy nowadays. And the CEO of Netflix on a, I don&#8217;t know, three, four years ago was like our biggest competitor is actually YouTube and gaming. It&#8217;s the people that spend their time. It&#8217;s not the other, it&#8217;s not Hulu or Prime or whatever. It&#8217;s literally other verticals of attention economy. I think that it&#8217;s going to be something in regards to kids or people like us gaming all the time with some type of micro payments baked in where you have X amount of people watching your stream. Boom. You get their native coin or you get a chunk of Bitcoin, a chunk of ETH, a chunk of Tether, a chunk of whatever. But I feel like it&#8217;s going to be some type of combo in there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, creation economy is super interesting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it&#8217;s huge. The other big one is what you already worked on is I feel like tokenizing real world assets, homes, cars, whatever the case may be. When your car breaks down, you go to the mechanic, you don&#8217;t know who did what before it. There&#8217;s no actual log, right? Like blockchain can fix that. What about healthcare, same shit? So I feel like it&#8217;s gonna be some either massive industry that has nothing to do with the attention like healthcare or auto, or it&#8217;s going to be something attention related like gaming, but it has to be baked in with finance. I feel like gaming alone will not do it. That&#8217;s just me. But those are my tricks on that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, man. I appreciate that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So what other areas of crypto really get you going at the moment? And what other areas of crypto is Fireblocks really honed in on, zoned in on present day that you guys think is gonna be huge over the next five, ten years?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I think, and this is kind of the me, not as part of my responsibility, but what I see in the market. I think like CBDCs and stablecoins are going to be amazing and a huge catalyst for the entire industry as well. Maybe like the existing industry and bringing on more on the traditional finance space to have that. We do offer products around that. I&#8217;m not the most qualified to talk about it, but being able to issue stablecoins and working with governments on CBDCs. There&#8217;s a super interesting space right now. I feel like this is what we needed to onboard the traditional finance into the blockchain rails. Once that is done, the gap between kind of the traditional finance and what we call it, the crypto finance or the crypto native finance is a shorter hop than what it used to be. So the more we can get like these traditional financial institutions on board, creating those tokenized assets. So as you said, right, I mean, it&#8217;s also relates to real world assets being tokenized, but let&#8217;s start with kind of the deep financial facilitation layer and then see how it leads to kind of a more adoption and more synergies between kind of the traditional finance and the new finance, I would say.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I like that. Omar, this has been a treat man. We are in all tight for time. One last segment before we wrap up. Hot take factory, preferably non-crypto related. Give me a couple of Omerhot takes before we let you go. Health, wealth, happiness, space, race, AI, aliens, food, you name it. But give me a couple of spicy hot takes, preferably non-crypto or blockchain related, and then we&#8217;ll wrap this baby up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Wow. I&#8217;m, you know, I have three kids. I&#8217;m such a dad. Like everything I think of is like, how great it is to have kids, but sometimes, you know, banging your head against the wall. So I would say my hot take is to dedicate time for your family. Like for me, that&#8217;s the best thing that happened to me. I know everyone watching is like super hectic and like have a busy schedule and me too. And I don&#8217;t do that enough, but like really, my hot take is like spending time with your family. It&#8217;s probably the best investment that you can make in the short term. Sorry for being such a like ready, told some, you know, subreddit. So, but really, that&#8217;s what I have for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That one hits hard. I&#8217;m 28 man. I would, if I met the lady of my dreams tomorrow and obviously she&#8217;s the one who&#8217;s gonna be pumping out the kids and not me, I&#8217;m only half the equation, realistically like 1% of the equation. But I mean, I&#8217;d like to have a family with three kids, 10 years down the road as well. So, but Omar, this has been a treat. Really appreciate you coming on. Before you go, please let our listeners know where they can find you and Fireblocks online and on socials.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>So yeah, I mean, find us at fireblocks.com. We&#8217;re hiring. Look if you have any interesting jobs. It&#8217;s a really awesome company. I know I&#8217;m biased, but I don&#8217;t know for what it&#8217;s worth, believe me. And you can find me on Twitter @OmerAmsel. And yeah, you can find Fireblocks at Fireblocks. So always happy to engage in conversation. DM me if you need anything. If you have any questions, talk to you also.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Love it. Omer, thanks again man. Appreciate it. Pumped to have you on for round two and we&#8217;ll keep in touch my friend.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Omer Amsel</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thanks, Matt.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with Omer Amsel, head of Web3 at the one and only Fireblocks.

It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always, and I am super pumped to have the one and only John Reynolds on the show today, Product Manager for Aleo. John is an absolute ZK tech expert with years of experience as a cybersecurity professional. After three plus years in the United States Air Force as a Cyber Operations Officer, he gained an understanding of the need to safeguard autonomous systems apart from central authorities, while also upholding privacy and fostering accountability. At Aleo, John is responsible for product development and product management prior to joining Aleo. John was the Strategic Deployment Lead for Blend. He also holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science from the one and only United States Air Force Academy and has a master&#8217;s degree in Software Engineering from Southern Methodist University. Never heard of that place, but I&#8217;m sure it was a treat. John, welcome to show my friend Pump to have you on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, thank you so much. I&#8217;m super excited to be on. Appreciate you going through all the accolades. Super excited to be here. Yeah, I have kind of an interesting background. You know, our CEO at Aleo actually is also military. So he went to West Point. So him and I have a nice rivalry during football season. He was a Green Beret though. So he kind of has me on some of the foot traffic legitimacy. But yeah, glad to be here. Excited to talk about ZK and Aleo and you know, how these can have a massive impact on the world of computing as we go forward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. It&#8217;s sort of standard protocol standard procedure on the Cryptonews Pod. I&#8217;d love to jump into the start of the show, which is you before we get into Aleo and ZK Tech and all the nitty gritty crypto stuff. Obviously the standout thing on your background is being a United States Air Force member. Thank you for your service. Even though I&#8217;m Canadian, I still obviously love everything military related in the States. And if someone were to ever invade us, I mean, we&#8217;re calling you guys first. So we need you guys to selfishly, obviously. But besides that point, I&#8217;d love to get into some story time, pretend we&#8217;re around the fire, get old nighttime campfire, maybe a couple of pints shooting the shit, telling some stories. You&#8217;ve got to give me some good Air Force stories, whether it was being at school and going through the grueling training or actually being deployed, whatever the case may be. But John, you got to kick us off with some good military stories before we get into the nitty gritty crypto stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>For sure. Well, I actually worked at a joint Air Force base when I was like first stationed and it was an American and Canadian base. So it was in Colorado Springs, Cheyenne Mountain. So I got to work with a lot of Canadians as well. So I&#8217;m a big fan of the Canadian Air Force and it&#8217;s been, you know, it was fun getting to work with those individuals too. Yeah, the Air Force was, it was exciting. I actually went to Texas A&amp;M for a year before I transferred to the Academy because I was doing track and field. So before all of the crypto stuff and cybersecurity, I was actually a track and field athlete. I was a triple jumper and a high jumper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>You got hops.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I got hops. Yeah. So I still actually have the school record in the triple jump at the Air Force Academy, which is pretty exciting. Honestly, like I think the coolest probably story that I have, or maybe like the most interesting as it relates to, you know, our discussion today is, you know, some of the trials and tribulations that I ran into while I was at the academy. So after basic training, I actually had a what&#8217;s called a pulmonary embolism. So it&#8217;s a blood clot that&#8217;s in your lung. And as a result of this, like, you know, it can be, you know, very life threatening. And they found out, you know, I had some predisposition to blood clotting. But as a result of this, like they were going to try and kick me out of the academy. They&#8217;re like, you know, we can&#8217;t risk having you stay in the Air Force. We&#8217;re, you know, we&#8217;re going to have to medically discharge you. So you go through like this series of appeals, and you sit in front of like these different generals and try and plead your case. And so I was like dead set, I&#8217;m going to figure out a way to get them to allow me to stay like to get them to let me finish my education at the academy and become an officer. And so I started to look into like, what are the need that the largest needs of the Air Force right now. And you can see kind of like the different personnel realities that exist in different career fields. And what I saw was that one very small portion of individuals from graduating classes at the academy were graduating with computer science degrees. And then one of the largest personnel shortages was around cybersecurity. And so I thought, okay, I&#8217;m going to figure out a way to funnel my focus and energy into becoming something that can be extremely valuable to the Air Force from like a technical and, you know, job opportunity perspective. While also still trying to shine athletically. So like, look, I&#8217;m in shape. I can do all of this stuff, the physical standards and better than some of the, you know, my peers. But also, hey, like I have maybe this education that could be unique and special and valuable to the Air Force. And it only requires me to sit behind a desk. So that&#8217;s what I did. And ultimately, I was able to plead my case to a board of generals and they let me stay. And so I was able to finish my education at the Air Force Academy and then and then commission has an officer where I had, you know, now the blessing to serve and get like a ton of skill sets and in the real world. And I actually got stationed like I mentioned earlier in Colorado Springs, Cheyenne Mountain. And this is one of like the, in my opinion, like the coolest Air Force bases that exists. Because it&#8217;s literally inside of a dugout mountain. It was a cold war shelter back in the day. So for like nuclear explosions, the idea was like, you could take like high valued individuals and they could be protected in this blast or facility that could survive a nuclear attack. Crazy facility. Some people listening may have heard of this. Stargate, it&#8217;s all often called, we&#8217;ve seen this in different movies. But yeah, we&#8217;re inside a mountain and I was helping to like direct different information from satellites relating to missiles and aircrafts and air traffic. So I worked alongside NORAD. Again, some people might know the Santa Tracker, but North Atlantic Air Defense System.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s so cool. Is that the building that looks like a big church almost? I just Googled it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Okay, so the Air Force Academy has like a notorious like church that&#8217;s like very popular for people to go visit. And then just like probably like 20 miles behind the Academy, there&#8217;s like a huge peak, Cheyenne Mountain Peak. And they&#8217;ve literally dug out the inside of this and they have like, I mean, several stories of buildings and tech and it&#8217;s a full operational facility like thousands of people back in the day. Yeah, inside of the mountain, no windows, nothing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s crazy. I love that. So what a great story to lead. So just again, just putting two and two together, you gain this incredible tech experience and security experience, working for the United States Air Force. And obviously I feel like that&#8217;s a job where you don&#8217;t really get second chances. Like if you know, if you screw the pooch, you&#8217;re done kind of thing. You&#8217;re on top of your game. Walk me through the sort of trajectory and joining forces to Web3 and crypto. So did you learn about ZK tech there? Were you working on crazy privacy tech that just led to, you know, present day you joining Web3? Like what was the whole spiel in that regard?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. So I think I start, I was doing a lot of deep work in networking. And what you start to realize when you&#8217;re networking is all of these nuances that go into data security. It&#8217;s like sending data, data at rest, and I didn&#8217;t have a huge crossover into crypto yet when I first initially got out. But I was well aware, okay, there&#8217;s these systems that are protecting international safety, which is one part of this. But then there&#8217;s also like our citizens, like our people who have like personal information. And if like the problems are the same, right? Like maybe the outcomes or the impact if somebody like steals this international classified information is much larger. But like what&#8217;s allowing this to be stolen at the base level is very similar. These paradigms exist all over in different capacities across the web. And so I think I got out of the Air Force and I started working for a software startup in the mortgage space blend. And I was helping some of their strategic partners in banking with a KYC solution. And I immediately started to realize like, look at how much friction this the compliance and regulatory aspects here are creating for the tech. It&#8217;s like, we can&#8217;t even provide a meaningful user experience, because it&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s so much regulation. And like, and like the way the tech is architected, it&#8217;s just not, it&#8217;s just not easy for it to like meet those. That was kind of that moment where I was like, maybe like, I need to try and do something about this, right? Maybe like, this is like the direction that like, I should start focusing more of my energy, because this feels like it could have a very substantial impact. So I started kind of like messing with Ethereum. I started mining before proof of stake. I was mining Ethereum. I feel like most people will say this. So maybe it&#8217;s a little cliche, but I was mining Ethereum in my basement, trying to just kind of understand like what this whole blockchain crypto thing was. I&#8217;d been like a little bit jaded by it earlier on, just because I just didn&#8217;t get it. Like, I was like, this seems like the currency aspect was a bit confusing. There&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know, the blockchain ledger, all these big words were a little bit like, wait, what? Like, is this just the facade? But you know, I thought, okay, I need to get my feet really wet. So started diving in. I built a gaming application actually on Ethereum called Fishbags. It&#8217;s just like a simple, smart contract NFT that allows you to play a mini game and save your score for your NFT and update it on chain. So you could have this NFT and it&#8217;s associated with some gaming score. So that was kind of like my first chance, like, okay, I see like, there&#8217;s like a larger opportunity here for like really making a meaningful impact to how people interact online. And then that&#8217;s what kind of drew me. And I met Alex through like a connection in the military and he happened to be the CEO of this ZK company. In that time, I didn&#8217;t know a ton about ZK outside of just like the privacy preservation aspects. From there, it&#8217;s just really, I dived in deep. I did a hackathon in Portugal when I first started with Aleo. And that kind of launched me into actually like focusing on some of the identity and identity related product concepts for Aleo.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. That&#8217;s a great story. Before we get into Aleo and ZK Tech, just to sort of set the stage, I always love asking non crypto questions, especially when it comes to privacy, because we have so much privacy and data that&#8217;s spread so far and the reach is so large and wide and we have no clue what and how and everything about our data. It&#8217;s out there, it&#8217;s everywhere. You are obviously a privacy expert. What are some of the like most no brainer, but non obvious things that the average Joe or Josephine should do to sort of level up their privacy game a little.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think one of the biggest ones, and I&#8217;m a victim of like forgetting to do this, but if you&#8217;re on public networks, turn on your VPN. If you&#8217;re on public Wi-Fi, like you should be using a VPN. If you&#8217;re at the airport, if you&#8217;re at the airport and like you&#8217;re about to get on a flight, you have to do something real quick on your computer, like take the extra couple of minutes to turn on your VPN. I think like we too heavily rely on the frameworks and infrastructures we&#8217;re using. And we should, like there needs to be a dependence. Like I personally think and this is subjective, but I think that, you know, there needs to be a foundational understanding of security for users. But I think that there is a reliance that the infrastructure and the platforms are doing the majority of the thinking for us. Right? So like, I think it&#8217;s fair to make those assumptions, but also like you should better equip yourself if like you&#8217;re working with sensitive information. So yeah, I think the VPN thing is a big one. And then like, yeah, just like don&#8217;t like, don&#8217;t use your passwords. Like everyone does this. Do not use the same password over again. There&#8217;s so many tools now in place and even unfortunately, like they&#8217;re vulnerable to getting attacked as well, obviously. But like you&#8217;re going to be better safeguarded if you have like, you know, separate passwords. You&#8217;re not using the same exact stuff across the board.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, use a password manager. One that I always say is anything finance related where it&#8217;s like and again, most people when it comes to privacy, I feel like the biggest and baddest is if they get a hold of your bank account and knock on wood. Thankfully that I&#8217;m fortunate that I haven&#8217;t been subject to any crazy attacks yet. I&#8217;m sure they will happen. But guys and gals do not please for the love of God, do not have face ID for any banking or crypto apps. If you have a Web3 wallet on your phone and it is connected to your face ID and you get mugged one night or whatever the case may be, all they got to do is a quick little boom and the floodgates are open and it&#8217;s crypto. It&#8217;s not your bank. You can&#8217;t call crypto and be like, Hey, this is what happened. You know, once the transaction takes place, it&#8217;s gone before we move on any other very basic sort of non obvious privacy tips that you recommend.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think that those are good ones, honestly. There&#8217;s always something else that pops up. Someone&#8217;s done something silly, but I think like most of it is just kind of common sense and slowing down. We&#8217;re always in such a rush. Sometimes we need to slow down. Oh, actually, you know what? I have one more, that&#8217;s good. Be thoughtful about backup emails that you have in place for different platforms. Because I think one of the social strategic attacks is like, if I can find an account where you&#8217;ve used an old email where maybe you don&#8217;t have it as protected and I can access that, then I can force a backup password reset to that and then I can get into the main account and then we have an open door. So I think that&#8217;s another good one to call out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, really good call there. Okay, time for crypto time. Let&#8217;s get into Aleo in the start of the show. But before Aleo, and I&#8217;ve asked this question so many times on the pod, this is something that I do understand but still need to do my homework on. And that&#8217;s ZK Tech, zero knowledge proofs. Every single guest who&#8217;s come on and is an expert in ZK Tech, describes it in a different and nuanced way, which I love, because again, when you&#8217;re describing something as complex as ZK Tech, you gotta use analogies. You gotta like show the actual use cases. If you just talk in the, you know, Web3 security, verbiage and lingo, a genius isn&#8217;t gonna understand this stuff, right? So, John, I&#8217;m throwing the ball over to your side of the court before we get into the nitty gritty. Give me like the TLDR elevator pitch primer on ZK Tech and why it&#8217;s going to be so important moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, absolutely. So ZK Tech, I think at the highest level, the idea is like you can prove you know something without having to reveal what that is. I focus on like the identity side. So I think like a good analogy for me is like, you go to a concert, let&#8217;s say, and the concert has different vendors that are serving alcohol. And so when you first go into the concert, you show your driver&#8217;s license to somebody and they look at it, they feel confident that it&#8217;s a legitimate driver&#8217;s license. And they see your age and you&#8217;re over the age of 21. So what they do is they give you a wristband. The wristband signifies that you&#8217;re over the age of 21. And now you can go up to all of the different vendors within you know, the concert and you can just show them your wristband to receive alcohol. And so in this essence, like you&#8217;re proving to these different vendors, hey, I am over the age of 21. I have been verified and I have the right to be able to receive this service or this product or you know, for this instance, a beer. And so this is like a very good example in my opinion because what it does is it shows you the different players involved. So the people when you&#8217;re going in through the concert, this would be like an issuing authority. So like in the world, we have a variety of different authorities that we trust just innately because they&#8217;re the government because of the reputation that they hold. And so, you know, when you&#8217;re going through the concert, you show your driver&#8217;s license and you know, the government is the issuer in this case, but the person looking at this verifies you and then issues you the wristband. And so for the concert, the vendors view that wristband as a trusted issuance of a credential, proving your age and that you&#8217;re the right person to be able to receive these funds. And so ZK is similar in this essence, right? I can prove certain things about myself. And then I can provide representations that convince other people, hey, this is legitimate. That person has been verified without exposing it in my personal information. So none of these other vendors to give me a beer need to know that my date of birth is, you know, whatever and my address is this and my nationality potentially my eye color. All of that&#8217;s irrelevant. They just need to know, hey, this person is over 21.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s binary, it turns a complex privacy based situation into something binary without disclosing all the info that&#8217;s needed. It is John of age yes or no? Is person X, Y, or Z of age yes or no? And it works for, again, a multitude of use cases, but that was a good one. Why do you think people have such trouble sort of understanding ZK tech? Because again, on the front end, what you just described, it makes sense, but like on the back end, and we&#8217;ll get into this, the whole tech is crazy in how different validators need to speak with each other and everything. It&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s not easy to understand, is there anything we can do, or will ZK tech be much more consumer friendly moving forward? Like what is the future of this look like?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, that&#8217;s a great point. And I think one of the things that just gets to me when I talk to people about crypto is there&#8217;s value in understanding things at a high level. But I also think we have to respect the reality that some individuals are meant to build these things. Some individuals are meant to build these things. And then some individuals are meant to actually just speak to them and simplify it so that consumers can understand. But a great example of this is transport layer security, like HTTPS. Nobody, I don&#8217;t have a single friend that understands TLS, transport layer security, or SSL, or where did HTTPS come from and how does it provide us a safe means to interact on the web?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t get it either. I just know when I look at my, you know, my Chrome tab up there, my Brave tab, when I see the, when I see the, like the green little certificate, I want to save site. That, I don&#8217;t know how it works though.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>And the thing is you don&#8217;t need to, you know, it&#8217;s good to understand and like, you know, as things evolve, more, more reputational trust accrues. And so it&#8217;s like, it becomes more natural to not feel like, oh, I got to know exactly what&#8217;s going on or else it&#8217;s not secure. There&#8217;s that piece of it. But then I also think like there&#8217;s a lot of puzzles to ZK that people are mixing into one even though they&#8217;re separate pieces. And so like zero knowledge circuits and the computation portion of zero knowledge, like providing inputs, like private inputs, running a computation on those inputs and then having some output. That is like the end to end aspect of like producing a zero knowledge proof, producing a proof of execution. But like this is a closed system if you think of it as a single unit, right? So like now we have to think, okay, I&#8217;ve created a proof. How can I share that proof with somebody? How can I receive proof from somebody? How can I verify a proof that I received? And so there&#8217;s operational realities that exist and engineering realities that exist that aren&#8217;t always delineated when we talk about ZK at large, right? We think like, oh, ZK is like, you know, all of this and it&#8217;s not ZK is one piece of the puzzle. The communication aspect of all of this is a larger piece that requires not just Web3, but also aspects of Web2. So people have something to go and access, right? On the internet, some sort of gap. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons. Like we try to boil the ocean with ZK. If we actually kind of got a little bit more narrowed with our focus, but still stayed high level with the explanation, people might have a better shot of getting some of this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well said. I also hate the name. I mean, it&#8217;s like blockchain. Like what the hell does blockchain mean? At least blockchain makes some sense because, but then again, I guess ZK does as well because it&#8217;s zero knowledge, but it&#8217;s just one of those words where it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s such a big and scary word that it almost veers away a lot of the people who perhaps would have dabbled and wanted to learn a little bit. They&#8217;re like, ah, this is way above my pay grade. Screw it, I&#8217;m out. You know? Things you gotta work on in the future. But John, we&#8217;re gonna take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we&#8217;re going to get into the start of she show, Aleo. Unique differentiators, use cases, progress to date. Talk about the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z-Prize, and I can&#8217;t wait to get into that. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50 to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with John. Mate, let&#8217;s jump right into it. Aleo, give us the TLDR, the elevator pitch. Unique differentiators, use cases, progress to date. You name it, and then we&#8217;ll get into Zee Prize and some other fun stuff, but the floor is yours.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sweet. So Aleo is a Zero knowledge Layer-1 blockchain. And there&#8217;s a bunch of really great things that it does from privacy to also like unlimited run times of scalability opportunities. And honestly, I personally believe like, you know, I&#8217;ve done a fair amount of development on Ethereum. I think some of the solutions, the ZK solutions that are getting built on Ethereum are impressive. But I think from a developer perspective, if you want to be working with something that&#8217;s more natively introducing these privacy preserving aspects, Aleo is the way to go. We are based off of what&#8217;s called the ZEXE model, zero knowledge execution. And so the idea is we push all of the proof generation portion of the execution of programs or smart contracts. We push that off chain. Users are able to run either on their local commodity hardware or outsourcing it to like highly efficient hardware. They&#8217;re able to execute these programs with their own private inputs and then produce a zero knowledge proof and then an output. So the proof is proving that the program executed honestly, according to how the code is structured in the smart contract. And then the output is what the result of running that program is. So you have proof that it was run honestly, and then you have an output. And so if we verify this proof and it comes back saying, yes, this is valid, then we can trust the output of this execution, the output of executing the program. And so that&#8217;s another thing that I think is often left out in some of these like thought processes. But yeah, again, like that&#8217;s pushed off chain. And so essentially like you could run a program for eternity and then finish running it, bundle that into a single proof, integrate that into a transaction and send it to Aleo, send it to the blockchain, validate our nodes, verify the proof that&#8217;s in that transaction. And then that gets published to the chain where any third parties can go and verify the validity of that proof. And the value of the zero knowledge aspect here is that anyone can verify it, but the proof is zero knowledge. So nothing of relevant value is output unless it&#8217;s added as a public output. And so like it provides the privacy, but then the verification guarantees too, which is huge, right? Like you don&#8217;t need to know anything about me just enough for what you need me to give access or you need to give me access to what service you&#8217;re offering. But Aleo, we&#8217;re still in testnet phases. We have mainnet coming at the end of the year. And again, like this is really like the opportunity for developers to get their hands dirty with ZK with a Layer-1 blockchain. And with a lot of different opportunities that you can avoid like gas, for instance, is another one you get to avoid on Aleo. So a lot of opportunities for building privacy and compliance into applications on chain.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Then correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but Aleo is a developer based platform, right? Like you&#8217;re not going after the guys like me who can&#8217;t code, you&#8217;re going after developers and providing them with bulletproof ZK tech so they can then build these dApps with ZK tech in them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>So yeah, I think twofold. Like one, I think that the primary target is developers. So that way we can provide them with the toolkits to build out these applications that hopefully can start to reshape these different frameworks and dynamics of the web. But we also actually have developed a language, a DSL, a domain specific language called Leo. And so what Leo is, it extracts all of the confusing stuff. So like if you&#8217;re a developer, you know, maybe not like a super skilled senior developer, you don&#8217;t really understand ZK in depth, but you want to start leveraging this tech. We have this domain specific language that which I think gives you an upper hand potentially in like the space because like, you know, if you&#8217;re not super skilled and like ZK is new. Like so you could become an expert without having to like become an expert in coding.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, and this is all done on Leo and that&#8217;s your guys. Well, I mean, I just Googled it, but on your website, actually, aleo.org, it&#8217;s a functional statically typed programming language built for writing private applications. Interesting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yep. And so what happens is like you code at this high level, it compiles to AVM instructions, which is like a low level code form. And then that gets synthesized into what&#8217;s called R1CS or rank one constraint system. And those are systems of equations. And so those are like, this is, you know, obviously, we&#8217;re getting a little bit more technical here, but these systems of equations are essentially these circuits that allow us to prove and verify information without having to actually know the information itself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Interesting. So what&#8217;s the grand vision for Aleo? Like what&#8217;s obviously there&#8217;s a couple, not a couple, there&#8217;s dozens of companies in the ZK tech space. Talk to me about what makes you guys different and a lot of use cases down the road.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think right now, you know, we&#8217;re laser focused on getting live, getting mainnet live by the end of the year. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of moving pieces to this. We&#8217;re very close. We have a series of audits that we go through, um, and then we&#8217;ll have like the final adjustments before, before going live from there I think, you know, the opportunities are really endless. We have a product focused kind of org within Aleo that like I said, I&#8217;m specifically focused on the identity piece and subjectively. Again, I&#8217;d say that like I see a ton of opportunity, but also I think that this is like the core of the applications infrastructure outside of like the blockchain piece. Like we have to be able to identify people who are using our applications. And so making sure that there&#8217;s a framework to allow for that, that really nicely integrates with like these ideas of ZK. It&#8217;s important and it&#8217;s also complex. And so I think like the identity piece is a huge one that will be a big focus going forward once the blockchain is finalized and we were able to launch mainnet. But for me personally, yeah, that&#8217;s also our focus and then expanding developer toolkits and trying to continue to strengthen opportunities for new developers and existing ones to start building.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, well said. I love the privacy aspect as well. A bit of a cop out question on my end, so I apologize in advance, but dream client, would it be like identifying age for the US government? Would it be age identification for someone like Ticketmaster, who has just such a crazy monopoly on all ticketing in North America? I probably worldwide too, but definitely North America. Would it be some type of bank with a KYC system? Like what&#8217;s John&#8217;s dream client?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. Yeah. I mean, you hit on like some really good industries and verticals that could be focused on and that could also be supported by ZK. I think the KYC one is a really great one, being able to like identify different thresholds around identity and anti money laundering to help, you know, individuals get verified in privacy. So platforms don&#8217;t have to worry about all this user data, you know, overflowing there and having to secure and manage that too. It&#8217;s just like it becomes expensive. So there&#8217;s like a user benefit for privacy, but then also these platforms like don&#8217;t have to. But yeah, I honestly like you brought up like the US government and not to go back to the stories, but like I do have a personal affliction around this. I had my top secret security clearance compromised in the OPM, the Office of Personnel Management hack that happened in 2000. And it was either 2013, I believe, yeah, 2013 over, I think like 20 million military records were compromised. Our CEO, Alex, his were compromised as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How does the US military get hacked? Like, that&#8217;s like, besides the US government, that&#8217;s like the biggest organization in the world. Like, how does that even happen?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>That is exactly the question that I asked myself. But the answer is, it&#8217;s a honeypot and centralized servers in general act as honeypots and the greatest honeypot is the US government&#8217;s honeypot. Because who doesn&#8217;t want to just be able to flex and say, Hey, we got in. I mean, seriously, like these, that&#8217;s what these four nations, like they love that. They just, they don&#8217;t even, like the first big flex is just, Hey, we&#8217;re here. Now what? Get ready for the show. So yeah, I think like we are creating centralized servers that are acting as honeypots and decentralized tech can help spread that attack surface across individuals to make it way harder to realize this massive amount of value by getting in. But then ZK can even add an additional layer of security that gives people personalized control. Like this is a very user centric model. The idea is like you as the user hold information about yourself. Somebody asks you to prove information about yourself and then you decide how you want to share, how much of it you want to share. And it may not meet the requirements that person, you know, needs. And then maybe they need you to share more. Maybe you decide you don&#8217;t feel confident enough to share, but you should be the one deciding that, right? Like you go through an SSO flow and that&#8217;s not the case. Like Google has your information and then the platform, if they decide to like go under or change things, change the rules on you, it doesn&#8217;t matter. Like they have it too. Yeah, it&#8217;s changing. You have no control over that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I just want, when I think about like potential use cases, I think that the ZK tech, and again, I&#8217;m probably wrong here. You obviously know infinitely more about this than I do. But I feel like this is one of those areas of crypto or just tech in general, where it&#8217;s moonshot only. Like a small partnership in my opinion won&#8217;t really move the needle, but again, a partnership with a government or a Ticketmaster or a JP Morgan, that would move the shit out of the needle. And I feel like it&#8217;s a dual headed monster because on one side, if it does happen, that moonshot is present. And sort of the discovery phase will almost be non-existent because everyone will use it and love it. But on the flip side, the potential of that moonshot happening is so minuscule that it&#8217;s like, is it gonna happen? That&#8217;s just, I don&#8217;t mean to be a Debbie Downer, but yeah, that&#8217;s how I feel it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t think its a downer though. I think there&#8217;s ways to approach the moonshot strategically for banking. You&#8217;re right. A small partnership isn&#8217;t going to move the needle massively, but if you can get a few banks using this, then that might be enough to make the comfort level start to grow and grow. Look at 2020 and 2021. We saw what momentum looks like in crypto and it is insane.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, that&#8217;s a fast roller coaster.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. So like, I think like, I agree, like it is the moonshot, the moonshot&#8217;s gonna be required to change the architecture in a meaningful way that we can all realize and benefit from. But like, we do need to strategize like around the moonshot, right? Like, okay, maybe there&#8217;s like some, you know, banks we can start using as proof of concepts. And then that can help make other people in that industry more confident, can shift to healthcare. We can start looking at how people are sharing their records from different hospitals, you know. Huge one, right? Like, if we could just get two that can act as a proof of concept that&#8217;s saying, hey, look, this is working. Like this is protecting the data and it&#8217;s making our customer experience better too. And then yeah, like I think just identity verification across KYC is like, you know, just a massive one. Like we&#8217;re seeing with GDPR, CCPA, there&#8217;s so many regulatory like pressures that are coming into play. Facebook, they just had that billion dollar fine and they have to come up with some unique strategy for like how the data is getting transferred from the UK to the US, depending on where their users are. I mean, the engineers said something like, they don&#8217;t know how the tech works. Cause like it doesn&#8217;t make sense, like what they&#8217;re saying because of the current paradigms. But ZK definitely helps change this pretty dramatically from like not just the user centric, user control point of view, but also through this like more curated like data minimization opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, well said. John, this has been an absolute treat. I&#8217;ve had a blast here. Unfortunately, we do have to wrap up soon, and I cannot wait to have you on for round two when you guys launch mainnet in a couple months. But we got to do the hot take factory, my favorite segment of the show, you and I jump in the hot take factory and let a couple of hot takes fly. It doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto or ZK tech related. Can be health, wealth, happiness, alien, space, AI, you name it, but give me a couple of John hot takes before you go. Give the listener something spicy here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh gosh, hot takes. Oh man, okay. Hot takes. You gotta give me a second here, Matt. Let me think.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, you can, I mean, I&#8217;ll give you a couple of mine right now. One, as always, I&#8217;m a big believer of happiness is a choice. And that definitely pisses people off. But like I think at any given moment, you can just fake being happy and eventually be happy. I think hangovers are a choice. I mean, I&#8217;ve had some pretty rough nights where I wake up the next morning and it&#8217;s like, okay, I can, you know, if it&#8217;s a Saturday night, go out, Sunday morning, wake up, I can sit on the couch and watch 12 hours of lovely God bless NFL Sunday in order to pizza and just be a fat sack of shit. Or I can, you know, I can take a cold shower. I can go for a run. I can hit the gym. I can sweat it out with a sauna, drink some electrolytes. Like those are two. I also think the whole, you know, all the UFOs and everywhere. I think that&#8217;s got to be the US gov. I know you&#8217;re a gov guy, you&#8217;re a military guy, but that&#8217;s got to be the military with some new crazy tech building shit in mountains, like where you actually worked. So those are a couple of mine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Okay, all right, fair enough. All right. Yeah. So I think, all right, I have some hot takes. Yeah. So I think the crypto market in general, like the engineers and stuff, like one of the big things in my opinion that can help us is like figuring out a way to avoid some of these like massive waves. I think the waves of crypto is like the killer of crypto.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I agree. Yeah. slow and steady focus. Crypto&#8217;s all about like how can you get from zero to one as quick as possible when I think it should be like go from zero to point one, point two, point all the way up. Like slow and steady wins the race. It&#8217;s a marathon, not a sprint. I completely agree with that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>And then yeah, the stigmas, like the stigmas in crypto, like our stigmas that exist everywhere else, we&#8217;re just not vetting the people as much. Like I think that&#8217;s another big one that I just can&#8217;t stand. And then I think my biggest hot take of all is like you decide what your outcomes are. And I don&#8217;t care like what your situations are, where you come from, there is always an opportunity to make the best of your situation and then to dream bigger. And I internalize that every single day. I went through that life threatening situation when I was at the academy. And I thought everything was gonna get taken from me. I thought I meant to, I worked so hard to get to the academy. Now I have something that I have no control over, like it just happened to me. You don&#8217;t have to continue to live that roll out. Like you can start to think bigger and push forward. And I think internalizing that can change your life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love one of my buddies says this, you know, whenever, he&#8217;ll ask something and then if we say no or whatever, it&#8217;d be like, come on, he&#8217;s like, who do you report to? He&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re the CEO of your own life. You can do whatever the hell you want. And it&#8217;s, you know, he usually says that when he&#8217;s trying to get us to like go out on a Saturday night when, you know, I&#8217;d like to have a chill night in with the lady or something. And then he&#8217;s like, he&#8217;s like, Z, come on, you&#8217;re the CEO of your own life. Who do you report to? So obviously bad example of the context, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s true. Like, you know, you&#8217;re the own boss, you can do whatever the hell you want. You can create an incredible life or you can create a shitty life. You know, some people are more blessed like you and I than others. We probably started on second or third base, right? Whereas there&#8217;s tons of kids in the world who start at, you know, not home plate is in home run, but like literally got a battle to get to first. So make the most of it and go from there. I love that one. That was good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, put your goal out there. Don&#8217;t have any sort of expectations on what&#8217;s gonna happen to get you there, but just keep focused on that goal and you will get there and you&#8217;ll be surprised on how.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, just a couple of 15 minute chunks a day, consistency and momentum, baby. John, this has been an absolute treat, cannot wait for round two, and hopefully can meet in person one day. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Aleo online and on socials.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, again, thank you so much, Matt. It&#8217;s been a pleasure. Super fun conversation. You can find me on Twitter @gweiworld, so G&nbsp; W&nbsp; E&nbsp; I World. You can find Aleo, aleo.org.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s such a good handle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m on medium too. I do some blogging, just like some personal stuff. And that&#8217;s also Gwei World. So follow me, follow Aleo. And then we didn&#8217;t get to touch on Z-Prize, but maybe next. But yeah, follow Z-Prize.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sorry, throw that in quick. My apologies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>But Z-Prize is an international competition. We get the best developers and engineers around the world who are focused on ZK. All of the different verticals from hardware, software, cryptography, and we bring all of these players together for a six month competition, half a million dollars in prizes for each category. The first one we did, seven million in prizes this year. I think we&#8217;re doing like three, but yeah, to motivate the problem. You got to put a big care in front of these individuals who are some of the most impressive engineers in the world, honestly. So check out Z-Prize. We&#8217;re in the midst of this year&#8217;s competition right now. If you&#8217;re listening and you&#8217;re a great engineer and you know hardware, you know Wazum, you know anything around ZK and you&#8217;re interested, you can still join in. Yeah, so, there&#8217;s a big opportunity.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>John, thank you so much. Truly a pleasure. Can&#8217;t wait for round two, man.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John Reynolds</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thanks Matt, all the best.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with John Reynolds from the one and only Aleo. What a treat. Learn so much. Love the military stories. And as always, I have so much homework to do on anything ZK tech related. Folks, as always, thank you for listening. Hope you enjoyed this one. If you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I. Speaking to the team, love you guys. Thank you for everything. Justas, my amazing sound editor. You are the GOAT. I love you, man. And back to listeners. Love you guys. Keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.&nbsp;</p>

It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always lovely day in the city, even better day to record a pod with the one and only Arno Bauer, Senior Solution Architect at BNB Chain, who has over a decade of experience in data management across diverse international environments. Arno focuses on enhancing business operations through the research and application of innovative technologies. At BNB Chain, he specializes in enhancing the core blockchain landscape of the BNB ecosystem and helping its growth through innovation, particularly focused on governance model enhancements. Arno, it&#8217;s been a minute. We&#8217;ve been rescheduling this for what it seems like years, but we finally got you on, pumped to have you on my friend. How you doing?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>Doing great. Thanks for the time to them. We look forward to and discussing about what&#8217;s happening right now in the BNB Chain and in the whole crypto world as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. We did indeed have quite the digital game of tag trying to get each other on the pod here. And we finally did it and I love that. You guys have some huge news. We are recording on mid September. This episode will release around September 21st. And a couple of days ago, you guys launched Mainnet for opBNB, which is huge news. We&#8217;ll get into that. But before we do, give the listeners what they want. Tell them a little bit about yourself. Obviously, you are working at BNB chain, which is the Binance related actual chain. Binance is in the news 24/7 for mostly good, but some bad. One of the biggest, if not the biggest companies in crypto. We love to see that. Tell me about your past. What did you do before you got into crypto and why did you make the jump to Big Bad Web3?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. I mean, it&#8217;s a good question. We all have our story on why we jumped into crypto and how we jumped into it as well. I mean, initially, I was mostly working with databases. So that&#8217;s when you mentioned this one, like I developed a history into data management. So I was always kind of passionate about how to handle data, how to make them more secure, more reliable. And this is where I naturally jumped into blockchain because at the end, blockchain is just a specific ledger which is really here to store data and to make it like resilient. And let&#8217;s see, proof against any attack as well. So this is what reattracted me back in the days. I joined like most in 2016, 2017. So this is when I started jumping into more into the technical aspect of it. And when I started really working on it, I come at a daily basis. So it&#8217;s been like a good journey, so far for me, like really being able to run one or the other. It&#8217;s the core aspect of why we have as well those decentralized ledger, all the consensus is playing a role within the security as well, the resilience against censorship, potentiality as well. So this is what I&#8217;m really looking forward to, try to contribute as well. And this is why I joined like recently, BNB Chain, really focused more on how we can, knowing that BNB Chain is one of the mostly, let&#8217;s say used L1, in terms of daily active users, like how we can really secure those data that is transiting as well and making sure that people want. Let&#8217;s say using Web3, we can let an edge against application of which our own Web2 was sometimes, it&#8217;s hard to justify why we own Web3 and on the cost it as well when you want to run transactions. Even if we&#8217;re in the BSC network, it&#8217;s kind of low versus other L1s, but still it&#8217;s the expensive to run, so the use cases need to really be like, we need to justify the use of like this technology as well and why we need to have like a decentralized database, decentralized validator, like censorship resistance as well. So all those different problematic and one data and something that we attracted me into the space.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Besides what you just mentioned, what else about crypto got you going? What&#8217;s your inception story? Was it a friend who bought Bitcoin and got you into it? Was it a book you read, an article? What got you into crypto as a whole?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>So, you know, it was hosted by community. I was so at that time I was living in China, in Shanghai mainly. So it was more about like the community that was as well around that time. So we had a lot of discussion about AI, about blockchain as well. So I was hanging up to a lot of different events trying to get more knowledge myself about these different, let&#8217;s say new technology. And this is what I really like. Let&#8217;s say ticked on me that here this is definitely let&#8217;s say the next, I don&#8217;t want to see it as a way but then it&#8217;s evolution of data as well. We had like books in the day, like, or even like at Cedar Rocks or people when the music is growing on the mountain or like when they had caves. And then we had books now, we had like internet, like if you wanted the computers, like their own storage, then they had like cloud solutions. And I think it&#8217;s more like a standard evolution of all those different architecture. And this is where we are at Web3. I think Bitcoin was really a great example of how decentralized nature can work out. It was like before Bitcoin, they had a lot of trial and errors while in this specific industry of like people trying to find out how we can then decentralize storage network which are resilient, which is not something that is easy to build. And I think that Bitcoin really was the first one to really be able to handle all those complexity around those entire storage, privacy and security. And definitely like the utilization of let&#8217;s say proof of stake, it&#8217;s something that is helping on that adoption of blockchain technology because it&#8217;s easier for some people to easily jump on top of it and participate to a network as well. So it&#8217;s a cost of entry and might be a bit easier to scope of stake. So it&#8217;s interesting that we are seeing so many consensus ideations. to them as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s a great point there. The number of choices you have in regards to building on multiple Layer-1s and Layer-2s, it&#8217;s becoming crazy. And I mean, this is a perfect segue into opBNB. But before we get into that, I&#8217;d love if you could give our listeners and myself just a quick primer of BNB. A lot of people confuse BNB Chain with Binance, obviously same same but different. I&#8217;ll let you explain this. Please give us the TLDR on what exactly BNB chain is and then we&#8217;ll get into some of the fun stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, back in the days, we first had like the beacon chain, which was like Binance creating, we created this beacon chain, which was more like a blockchain for decentralized, that&#8217;s it, finance trust that they basically and then they created like Binance Smart Chain, which was more like the smart layer on top of it, like the BNB Chain that we know today, which was even compatible. But then of course, naturally, like, it&#8217;s kind of split. So now like the BNB ecosystem is really in dependent and is not leading to violence anymore. So the city is more like, say, two, three years ago that this separation will like took place. So now it&#8217;s really two different entity were balances with infocusing on a centralized exchange and BNB ecosystem is really on its own, trying to build tools like Layer-1, which is like the BSC, which is the BNB Smart Chain that we have opBNB, which is more like the skittables rich on top of it. Then we have currently BNB Grinchfield as well in development, which is more at the Decentralized Storage Network, which is still connected and which is having an 18 integration with BSC. So having programmability on top of data as well. So BNB ecosystem is quite diverse, but it&#8217;s really like a different put it&#8217;s quite separated from Binance in a way if I can say so. But definitely the name might still be confused for some people especially that net history was called like Binance Smart Chain. So if you just say BSC, people tend to think of it, but now it&#8217;s more like BNB Smart Chain.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it&#8217;s tough. Cause again, with such a prominent name in the space, like Binance, it&#8217;s like you automatically just sort of pair the two together, right? I mean, they&#8217;re both, it&#8217;s comparing apples and oranges both through, but definitely on apples to apples. So very interesting stuff. Before we get into opBNB and again, everything OP related is massive right now, obviously cutting the transaction costs on L2s, more efficiency, more speed. It&#8217;s just, it seems like a no brainer through and through on all ends of the spectrum. But before that, just give me a quick sort of outlook on what you and the team have done over the last three years. Cause I think you&#8217;re a guest number two or three from BNB coming on the pod. You guys always have so much stuff to offer, some great alpha and so much news always moving and grooving. So in your last couple of years at BNB, or at least just BNB as a whole, what exactly has gone on in the last three years? And we can then get into some of the future stuff as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I think one of them really like let&#8217;s say focus on the BNB like side initially was really provide a strong and reliable infrastructure, which means like that&#8217;s why that&#8217;s one of the reasons why that&#8217;s the number of value data might not be as large as other chain initially, because the focus was really on providing something which with high throughputs and really something that is reliable. So let&#8217;s say the capacity of the BNB Smart Chain is four or five times higher than the one on it. So it&#8217;s something that is quite drastically like enhanced versus that&#8217;s a quarter L1 way like and this is where we saw as well the boom during DeFi where like we get a lot of transactions happening because for people, I mean, if you want to do a swap of let&#8217;s say 50 or 100 USD, you don&#8217;t want to pay like 200 USD in fees, you know, and it&#8217;s what it&#8217;s nature like right now on ETH, but it&#8217;s actually like for the use cases and for people, it was not usable like that. So this is where like BNB Smart Chain was really the home for those like users and those retail users who had the possibility to interact on-chain with the low cost and especially the high throughput, which means that the finality was here as well. So like whenever you sign the transaction, some get reverted because the gas fee was not set correctly or like then you need to increase the fee, send it again, but meanwhile we&#8217;re still using some ETH polls or so like on the BNB chain, like due to this high throughput, the capacity were like increased drastically and like the transaction look like it&#8217;s affordable for most of the people. So it&#8217;s something that you worked heavily on it or delivered as well heavily on trying to provide more resilience of the network itself, which means that being increased drastically as well don&#8217;t know what value nature. It doesn&#8217;t seem a lot versus order, but it&#8217;s still like a lot like when you in terms of percentage for example of increase and as well in terms of let&#8217;s say providing more consensus updates in order to provide what we call the fast finality because as you know, for example on Bitcoin, like whenever you send a transaction, you need to wait once it&#8217;s in a block. So first you need to be lucky to be in a block if the transaction is increased recently. Like thank God we have more activity as well right now, which I&#8217;m quite happy with because it&#8217;s showing that there&#8217;s a utility as well. So definitely like once it&#8217;s validated, you still need to wait like six, seven or eight blocks usually to have the true finality or that&#8217;s what usually exchanges are waiting for before you can really like trade it on an exchange like when you&#8217;re sending or withdrawing Bitcoin. On it, it&#8217;s still like you need to wait as well but now on the BSC, with this new fast finality consensus that you&#8217;ve updated, you need to wait between three and four blocks, which is for example between eight and ten seconds, which is something that is really fast for in the more finality. So it&#8217;s something that can drastically like increase the usability and the experience of the usability of our AR1 and now we are trying to focus more on expanding and connecting from those capabilities how we can even extend further with opBNB that we discussed earlier and with BNB Queenfield as well that we&#8217;re going to discuss further. So now that we have a strong base foundation, that is like how we&#8217;re trying to connect to it and try to expand it as well. It&#8217;s kind of a universe, like it&#8217;s not stopping at one and it&#8217;s like growing and growing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s truly an ecosystem. That was very well described. Thank you for that. And obviously congrats to you and the team. Huge launch, smooth as usual, as per anything, Binance and BNB related. You guys processed more than 35 million transactions on chain and have deployed over 150 decentralized applications on Testnet. opBNB is officially launched, moving to Layer-2 for the main reasons of alleviating congestion, reducing transaction costs, with an average fee of 0.005 cents, considerably cheaper than other chains. This is huge. Was this just a no brainer by the team to be like, hey, our community, our users want something cheaper, more efficient, quicker, the whole nine yards, and you guys were like, okay, it&#8217;s time, build it out, launch it? Like OP that has blown up, obviously Coinbase related, did that have anything to do with that? Were you guys looking at them and being like, wow, look at the growth and trajectory and potential, the ceiling they have there, how much good conversation is happening in regards to OP? Was this like, okay, we got to do the same? Like what was the whole rationale behind launching opBNB?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>And we had experience and congestion today, for example, on the L1. So it&#8217;s not something that was necessarily due right now due to congestion. But it was more like the overall community developer were discussing about it, like having a lot of feedback on projects as well, which are running on top of BSC. Having positional right now is the kind of abstraction or other project as well. It&#8217;s a sponsorizing transaction on behalf of the user. So of course, as a project, the more you grow. And if you are a sponsorizing, let&#8217;s say, the fee for your user, it&#8217;s having a higher cost as well for you to run, for example, in game or you specifically like social data. So we had a lot to say that community developer, which we discussed a lot about which problematic of like, sure, we are not having congestion today. We are not so expansive today, but we still have a struggle to on board more people because the more people on board, the higher the cost will be for us. So we need to get ready and be prepared as well, like before we have a new wave of user coming. And then like the community of the developer really started looking as well. What&#8217;s happening on the ZK event, on the ZK side, on the OP side. And definitely I would say that the OP stack was opBNB based. The OP stack as well. So we like huge congrats to OP stack for delivering what they delivered. But it&#8217;s something that is really, it&#8217;s a replying to a lot of questions that that currency industry has and OP stack is really able to answer most of them. So first of all, it&#8217;s EVM compatible, as you know. So it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s great for developers and builders. They can easily like redeploy on the Layer-2 and be more scalable as well. Or deploy even their own, let&#8217;s say, fork of OP stack and have their own Layer-2 for their own users. So there&#8217;s a lot of, let&#8217;s say, added value to utilizing search and decentralized and community driven solution as OP stack and like EVM compatible. So this is one of the reasons we decided to build on top of it as well. Because it&#8217;s like really like something that we believe right now is the go to solution when we are talking about scalability and higher throughput as well for community.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I agree. Which of the sort of main three being speed, transaction, and efficiency of those three things, what did the community ask for the most? Because I always wonder, for me, again, it depends on what transaction I&#8217;m using. It&#8217;s very nuanced. It&#8217;s very subjective, but I feel like anything else in life, price, finances, money, freedom, all synonymous, whatever you want to call it. I find like that usually is the number one reasoning, but was there one that outweighed the others in regards to, you know, actually launching this and making it happen? But was there one value prop that the community really kept asking for?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>The takeout stays more efficient, which means efficiency in forecasting as well, the cost of using it. You know, usually on L1, there is a lot of variation in like transaction piece as well. So usually the more activity, the more like increasingly you have. So having that system seen that it&#8217;s more efficient, then we&#8217;re like, okay, we know that there&#8217;s going to be a block every one second because of the BNBs, like a block every second. There is this specific gas thing that we know that based on the current that&#8217;s in on chain activity, the price is quite fixed. So there is no extra fluctuation in price as well on opBNB versus let&#8217;s say other L2 on ETH. So it&#8217;s more like the efficiency of like being able to forecast, for example, for project, the cost of running or for a retail user to forecast, okay, if I want to do a hundred transactions per day for the next six months, I can already kind of understand what&#8217;s going to be the cost today, but what&#8217;s going to be the cost in six months as well. Because that&#8217;s more like a late efficiency on that site, when you&#8217;re able to have a stable infrastructure in terms of like throughput and in terms of costs of running as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Interesting. Really good points there. Arno, we&#8217;re gonna take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to discuss Ethereum killers, the present day summary-ish of L1s and L2s, and how Greenfield is a leader in programmable storage. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT. We love the team at PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Again that is CRYPTONEWS50, to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with Arno. Mate, let&#8217;s jump into Greenfield. Candidly, I honestly didn&#8217;t even know this was a thing until I started doing research for the show. And this is one of the things I love about crypto, where I will find out something so interesting or I will find sort of a side product of the main product from the guest that comes on. And I&#8217;m like, I never heard of this, I didn&#8217;t know this was a thing. And now I have knowledge of a new product or service in the crypto space that is an absolute behemoth. And that is very useful. I&#8217;d love to flip the ball over to your side of the court. Give me the TLDR, the quick elevator pitch on what Greenfield is and how it is a leader in programmable storage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>Basically, we have a lot of research in the community as well about what is the use of storage, what are the trends, the solution that is provided by the community. We really saw that there is some kind of a missing link in order to solution, which is more about how can we really extract the value of data. Like the Creator, for example, or the one which is loading the data, how can they really extract the value of the rates in that transparent and programmable way, such as, for example, we know that you have a solid entity contract on the Layer-1, which is people can use DeFi, can have NFT, but this is more on a smart contract basis, but there is no economical value on top of the data itself. So this is where Gruntfield is going, where you can really see, upload your data on the disamplified network, which is like multiple what we call storage provider. But on top of that, there is like a direct native link with the VMB Smart Chain, which means that, for example, if you, for example, you are uploading your podcast to Greenfield, you could basically ask someone to subscribe to a specific smart contract if they want to be able to have access to the specific podcast that you are uploading. So for the exchange of value of access can be done through a smart contract way. So it can be monetized either at BNB or in stable coins, for example. So all of those, let&#8217;s say, access management can be programmable, programmatically be programmed in a 3D contract, for example. So this is where everybody that can renew or resumize the way that value can be extracted from data. It&#8217;s not necessarily that data, the value is not in the amount of data that you afford, but more in the value that the data contain in a way. So that&#8217;s more like what we are looking at.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Very interesting there. Another topic I&#8217;d love to get into is the multitude of options we have in blockchain currently with all the L1s and L2s. You&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s deep in the weeds in this. You are a back end guy. You actually understand how these things are built. This is way out of my pay grade. I just use them, but I obviously cannot build them. If you&#8217;re a builder right now, what&#8217;s the workflow? Like how do you go about choosing which L1 or L2 to choose and to build on? I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through this because it just seems there are so many options and often in life you&#8217;d like not a lot of options. I always think of the classic, you know, any type of SaaS where there&#8217;s always three options, right? You have your super cheap free option. You have your most common middle used option and then the expensive enterprise option. It makes things nice and easy. It only gives you three choices. It turns it into a no brainer and boom, you&#8217;re off to the races. But there are hundreds of options to choose from and it seems like nightmare fuel. As a developer, how do you go about choosing which L1 or L2 to build on?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>Right, I mean, usually what I said, like you want to choose based on your use case, what kind of community you want to touch base. It was right now at the end, like I want a different community, but for example, on the BNB Smart Chain, knowing that we have such a high daily active user number, like usually it might be easier for you to find people which are running to try your application, for example. So if you want to change, on the alternative Layer-1, which has for example, only 10,000 users, it might be hard for your project to survive. So usually as a builder, you first want to join. And you want to join a work community where there&#8217;s a lot of discussion on development. And a lot of experts, for example, if you go to Discord, there&#8217;s a lot of developer, you can easily find support as well. Because usually like when you are starting the problem, the issue that you are going to encounter, usually other people have already saw it before. So they can probably help you to easily like pass certain bridges or like speed up your development as well process in this chain. I don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;re going to have any net sales for ETH killer or BSC seller. I think there&#8217;s going to be a multitude of different Layer-1s as well. But potentially what we might see in the future is maybe like each of them might be more heavily connected than they are today. And maybe they&#8217;re going to share, I don&#8217;t know, maybe some security feature for one can be shared with the other and so on. So I think this is what we&#8217;re going to move ahead in the future where like currently we have bridges between each chain, but maybe in the future we have like that&#8217;s a more closer, let&#8217;s say native connection between each Layer-1 in order to strengthen as well the security of each network. That could be like an angle of work as well for the community.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, nice value prop. And then we got to talk about Ethereum killers. And just even looking at the BNB chain socials and everything, people commenting Ethereum killer. It&#8217;s like people can launch chains without them being Ethereum killers. And realistically speaking, without ETH, like all of crypto was hooped, like we&#8217;re EFT. So I don&#8217;t really get the fud behind this. I understand the term and why it was coined because it&#8217;s sexy, it&#8217;s right to the point. It enhances discussion, which is everything you want in a term or a meme. But I think it&#8217;s false 99% of the time. What&#8217;s your take on Ethereum killers present day? Do you think there are any Ethereum killers? Do you think they&#8217;re all just supplementary chains to Ethereum? What&#8217;s your TLDR on Ethereum killers?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t know why it could be for like to kill other stuff for first of all, I mean, actually we should like first of all, like we&#8217;re like in walking or like together to try to be like better narrative. Cause at the end we still need to think and focus on like, we are just at the start of this technology. I mean, the killer might not be an least killer, but might be a killer of the whole industry. So I think we have bigger issue to focus on like in self-hype trying to kill ourselves. So I see we really should we do what I&#8217;d say, walk together and trying to build a whole robust and stronger industry in order to only be able to survive and attract more users. Cause at the end like Web3 is nice, like we know the utility of input we really need to be able to find a strong utility and incentive to help like added security and resilience for users. Like for is a lot of Web2 application are going to stay Web2 cause they&#8217;re really easy to use and not scalable, but how we can for example, migrate some to a Web3 environment, knowing that there is a cost that&#8217;s just a two it as well. So that&#8217;s like some problematic that we do need to focus on. And this is where as tools are something that is quite interesting as well. In order to like lower the transaction fee, like having a more scalable solution can really bring more you, let&#8217;s say new use cases into Web3.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, and the L2s that are created that have enterprise use cases, I feel like will be the thing that brings in mass adoption when you have the Fortune 500 companies incorporating L2s into their everyday tech stack, where it&#8217;s built on blockchain tech, but on the front end, it looks like Web2. You know what I mean? Like the interface is very clean, sleek, easy to use, very simple UI, UX, but on the back end, it&#8217;s complex, Web3, you know, L2 shit. I feel like that&#8217;s what we need for the next step with mass adoption.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, definitely. I don&#8217;t think that we see a lot of users on L1s. Because I think at the end, let&#8217;s say, there&#8217;s quite some&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say security concerns. You know, like it&#8217;s taking a lot of ownership. If you want to be on L1, you want to hold your current and your crypto, like your private keys or your Mnemonic Fraser, you need to save everything. So, and usually people don&#8217;t need to take ownership as well. So I don&#8217;t think that we see a lot of people on L1, but I think like all those L2 or even let&#8217;s say higher solution can really help on mass adoption. Because I don&#8217;t think that we can&#8230; Unfortunately, like I do like owning my own private keys, but I think that for a lot of solutions going to be through cost-added solutions, or like where people might&#8230; It might be easier for them to own, let&#8217;s say, hold on-chain asset, but without necessarily fully owning the keys as well, to it goes at the end. The risk associated to it is quite high. I mean, we can easily, let&#8217;s say, lose our access as well, or either lose it by burning the paper when we should not have burned it, or like in a specific half. So I think that&#8217;s still like the risk is still here. So it&#8217;s not for everyone to be on L1, I think.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, very well said. Arno, this has been an absolute treat here. A couple more questions and then we will wrap up, mate. What other areas of crypto get you going present day? You know, besides obviously L1s, L2s, ETH killers, everything, database related. But what else gets you going in crypto or any crypto related hot takes you have? We&#8217;d love to hear them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>I wouldn&#8217;t say crypto because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s crypto, but I would say more like Bitcoin. I would say something that&#8217;s currently interesting to me, more like trying to understand more, let&#8217;s see why it has been created as well and why some specific design has been chosen when it was built and why it&#8217;s still resilient as of today. So I think that something that&#8217;s really interesting into why this specific network is so valuable and so high in years. I mean maintained in a sense that it&#8217;s not moving. So it&#8217;s something that I really like as well. I&#8217;m trying to understand why it&#8217;s not moving and why maybe it&#8217;s good as well for this specific network that it&#8217;s not moving in terms of functionality, but it&#8217;s staying more as it is today. So that&#8217;s something that is really intriguing me as of today.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I mean, you and I are in the same yacht there. I often think about this as well. I mean, I&#8217;d love to hear your two cents, but I think it&#8217;s the classic, and I don&#8217;t really love the term, but I do believe it&#8217;s almost digital gold desk where it&#8217;s simply a store of value. Like what, besides sending Bitcoin to someone, like yes, there was ordinals and there are a couple other NFT use cases and other use cases, but most of them are bullshit. Like the only actual use case for Bitcoin, in my opinion, right now, present day is holding onto the coins for a store of value or transactional, sending Bitcoin, like let&#8217;s say, I owe you a thousand bucks. I send you a thousand bucks in Bitcoin. Like what else do you see as for a use case for Bitcoin right now?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t like the term of digital gold as well. I think maybe that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t link to it too early on, because I think this made me look a bit outside of it. I think it is much bigger than that, based on what I understand as well. I do like the idea of what I&#8217;m trying to do as a workman, to spend and replace, so basically not all to it as well, but to try to find the utility. Whenever I can spend it, I try to spend it with button exchange address, to buy what I&#8217;ve just spent with the USD, for example. That&#8217;s the way as well, of looking at it and bringing value to it, to the network as well. But definitely, I think it&#8217;s a&#8230; I mean, I will keep looking into it, and trying to focus on what&#8217;s more technical side as well, because I think it&#8217;s quite more complex than, let&#8217;s say, L1, but what I would like as well, is the privacy feature that it has in build as well. It is, as we know, like a blockchain is regrade, but everything is public, so whatever you do, everyone can potentially see it, or find your mind as well, and link all the different activity that you have with your own profile. So trying to find some, let&#8217;s say, privacy feature within L1, and something that I think the community could look into as well, and what I like as well about Bitcoins, that there&#8217;s already a lot of privacy feature that are in build, and how to potentially utilize it, and pay attention to it, is something that is quite personal to me, I believe.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br>Do you see any consumer related use cases that aren&#8217;t already here for Bitcoin over the next one to two years? Like me personally Arno, I don&#8217;t see anything Bitcoin related that can make the price of Bitcoin or the utility of Bitcoin rise. I hope and I do think the Bitcoin will rise just with the lack of trust in government. Every single day we learn more and more about how the government continues to drop the ball and inflation and the continuous nonsensical printing of money. Again, we can go on for days. We don&#8217;t need to. Everyone gets this. I do think that will impact the price of Bitcoin in a positive capacity. I feel like people will continue to understand that this is fully decentralized. No one knows who created it and there is a store of value based on its scarcity and hopefully future utility and present day utility. But my question to you is, are there any consumer or enterprise related use cases that are actually in the roadmap and could come out over the next year or two that could really help Bitcoin both price discovery wise and utility wise?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think Bitcoin is going to be used not necessarily as the Bitcoin itself, but more as a medium of exchange towards and do like for example, I try to search more about the Lightning Network as well. But I think as a medium of exchange, where it&#8217;s not the Bitcoin exchange, it&#8217;s a little bit exchanging, but it&#8217;s more like something else that you exchange, but you are utilizing the network to exchange. Like for example, what I like about the Lightning Network is that it&#8217;s quite like lightning speed, but like maybe the exchange can be done utilizing SaaS. But in reality, for a user, you are not exchanging SaaS, you are just exchanging something else, but the underlying security is based on the network itself. And I think what there is a flip as well, once people start to realize that it&#8217;s not that Bitcoin, which is increasing in value, but it&#8217;s all the rest, which is decreasing in value against Bitcoin. So I think that&#8217;s like the point of reference as well, where I try to focus on the base value for me, like for example, BTC versus orgy orders. So that&#8217;s something that I like to do as well, for example, on Coinmarket cap or Coingecko, instead of putting the base value, like say in USD, I put it in BTC, for example, so you see it in a different angle as well and in a different perspective as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Interesting. I like that. Very interesting. Arno, this has been an absolute treat mate. I&#8217;ve learned a ton and definitely have some homework. Really appreciate you coming on and big congrats to you and the team with opBNB I know that was not a light launch. That was absolutely massive and you guys crushed it. Can&#8217;t wait to have you on next time But until then wishing you in the team all the best before you go Please let our listeners know where they can find you although you are a ghost on Twitter You would be great on Twitter listeners. Let&#8217;s hammer Arno. Blow them up on LinkedIn blow them up wherever. Making get to Twitter account because he would be producing some fire But before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and BNB chain online and on socials?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>You can find us especially on Twitter and Discord for BNB Chain, so we have a lot of community which are like especially for the developer side as well, like on Discord, I think it&#8217;s the right place. Follow us on Twitter for the all the latest news. On my side, it&#8217;s mainly on LinkedIn, where you can find me and then not tell the public.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Amazing. Arno, thank you very much mate. This was an absolute blast and can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arno Bauer</strong>&nbsp;<br>Thanks, see you next time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with Arno Bauer from the one and only BNB Chain. He was dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center. Huge shout out to my team and his team for making this happen. To the listeners, love you guys. Thank you so much for everything as always. If you enjoyed this one, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I. Speaking of the team, love you guys. Thank you for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor. You are the GOAT. Love you and back to the listeners. Thanks again guys. Keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.&nbsp;</p>

We are buzzing as always. It&#8217;s your host Matt Zahab, live from Toronto. We have a little bit of a heat wave today. The AC just went capoot and it is 79 degrees in my office, which is pretty hot. And for my, I don&#8217;t even know what the conversion is from Fahrenheit to Celsius. I&#8217;m Canadian. I should know that. But nonetheless, we have a bit of a sweat game going on today. So bear with me here, folks. Super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on Elena Nadolinski, computer scientist, software engineer, and the CEO of Iron Fish Foundation, the organization supporting the Iron Fish Network, a dedicated privacy layer for Web3 with built-in compliance solutions. Prior to founding Iron Fish in 2017, Elena worked as a software engineer at companies including Microsoft, Tilt and Airbnb. Wow, ever heard of those three? Elena is also a Forbes 30 under 30 alum and has been honored with awards from both the White House and the CIA for her outstanding achievements. Holy shit. I cannot wait to get into that. Super pumped to have you on Elena. Welcome to show my friend. How are you?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m good. Thank you so much. That was a great introduction. Thank you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, I mean, your team also put on a platter for me, but nonetheless, I will graciously accept the compliments. So thank you very much. But let&#8217;s jump right into it. Before we get into the crypto side of things, we need to touch on the White House. We need to touch on the CIA because that is bananas. And obviously all the companies you worked for before that, you and I were shooting ship for the show. You were located in the one and only San Fran, or as the locals like to call it SF and not San Fran. Is it as bad as everyone says it is right now? Give me the lowdown. What&#8217;s going on there?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, SF has been largely impacted by COVID for sure. I think it&#8217;s one of the cities that is making the slowest comeback. And I mean, I love the city to death. Like that&#8217;s why I moved here. I&#8217;m, you know, I&#8217;m probably a Bay Area life or, well, I say that with asterisk at the moment, but yeah, the city itself is in a pretty rough spot. I&#8217;m pretty optimistic though. I think people are realizing how bad it is and there&#8217;s positive movement in their interaction, but if there are tourists out there, I would recommend that you wait to visit the city.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Because I&#8217;ve never been, again, I&#8217;ve had probably 20 or 30 people in the pod, some close friends who live there. They all tell you the same thing. They&#8217;re like, it is from a sort of physically and nature standpoint. Absolutely stunning. One of the best in the world. Beautiful, perfect weather. You name it. But just homeless people running everywhere, dropping number twos in the middle of the street, shooting up in the middle. Everyone says it&#8217;s just its nightmare fuel there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. I&#8217;ll second all of that. Bay Area is gorgeous. In terms of quality of place to live, due to nature, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a city that can top that, honestly. I mean, you go 30 minutes on your bike and you&#8217;re in the most beautiful part of nature that you&#8217;ve ever seen. Like, it&#8217;s quite incredible. It is hilly, for sure, but you get amazing views, like, extremely stunning views. And the culture, the people that SF attracted are just, you know, the best in their field. And I know it&#8217;s a very, like, monotone city in the sense that everyone is in tech, but if you are yourself in tech, like, that is the place to be. You know, you go to a coffee shop and you overhear somebody talking about crypto or AI. And then you, like, chime in or maybe, like, you even drop it a bit more and you realize that it&#8217;s like the co-author of, like, this revolutionary paper for, like, transformers or whatever that is, like, next to you talking about the topic. And so, like, that is extremely special. And there is no city in the world like it, like, a dead stop. Even now, even what, you know, as it is getting much more or worse with, kind of like you said, you know, all AI companies are here, right? So it&#8217;s still, like, a very special place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>One thing I need to fact check, as you are a lady, I have one close friend who lives there. He says when he goes to the bar, he says the ratio is, like, 9.9 to 0.1 guys to gals. Is that bad?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, it doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re not that bad, but this is a huge ratio.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Not like New York City.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it&#8217;s a little bit like the same exact thing. New York is definitely different, you know, skewed gender in different direction. I mean, it is bad. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that bad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, Tech Bro is going to Tech Bro. It is what it is. Before we jump into Iron Fish, we need to go over your past super cool work for massive companies, Microsoft, Tilt, Airbnb, 30 under 30 Forbes alum, and White House and CIA. We&#8217;ll get into White House and CIA in a bit. First we got to talk about Microsoft, Tilt, Airbnb. How cool is it working at companies like that? What are some of the biggest lessons you&#8217;ve learned, biggest takeaways, things where you were like, holy shit. I never knew this happened or just some of the best things or worst things that you did take or didn&#8217;t take to your present day as a you know CEO and founder of a world-class crypto company. Would you learn at these world-class companies?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>I went to Microsoft for several reasons one is I actually do love Microsoft I think it&#8217;s a great company they make real products great products and it&#8217;s a revolutionary company I think a lot of people have kind of went into the CS because of the Bill Gates story right? So I think like historically it&#8217;s still like an amazing company for me personally. I would join a team call like that was within the office work. But it was like a incubation team and the focus was how do we build products that are indirectly associated with Microsoft? But kind of like a more start-up environment and that was very attractive to me and that team in particular attracted a lot of great minds from Microsoft and I always wanted to start my own company one day. So it&#8217;s kind of odd to go into Microsoft with that kind of focus in mind. But that particular team was actually a great fit. Other big companies have kind of experimented with like incubations within a larger company before. And most of the time that model does not work out because you can&#8217;t quite have a true startup experience within a large company like Microsoft. And so my team actually was re-ordered like four times and morale was extremely low. And that&#8217;s when I went to a company called Tilt, which was a Bay Area company startup funded by Andreessen. And my manager, my engineer manager was from Rackspace where I interned previously, so that was a great fit. And that startup experience was very valuable for me as well because seven months after I joined Tilt, Tilt was actually acquired by Airbnb and part of the reason is because they couldn&#8217;t quite get their business model to work. So, which is a very valuable lesson to learn about startups is, you know, paid acquisition doesn&#8217;t always work because that&#8217;s what Tilt really relied on in order to get its numbers up. And yeah, like just seeing kind of a lifespan of a startup almost flash before my eyes within that time period, you know, was obviously somewhat stressful at the time, but looking back was actually a pretty great lesson. And then Airbnb is an amazing company to work for. So I was there for about a year and a half and when I left to go join kind of crypto full time, only good things to say about it. It&#8217;s an amazing company. If you&#8217;ve ever been to their physical office in San Francisco, it&#8217;s probably one of the most beautiful offices of all time. So I remember while we were acquired and we had like that first tour, like our jobs were on the floor. Like it was like, we get to work here. Amazing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>We made it. Yeah, that&#8217;s so cool. And then what about like why the jump? Again, I guess before the jump one thing that and I always ask my friends this, who work for the Fortune 500 big name cliche companies with clout that everyone wants to work for with the crazy offices. Is just like you discussed, obviously you are a very talented developer, but what else do you need to crush that interview process? Because these guys interview thousands of candidates and it&#8217;s so difficult to get in. What&#8217;s the secret sauce for getting in? Any tips or advice in that regard?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Luck? I know it&#8217;s probably an unsatisfying answer, but we were acquired. We still all had to get interviewed, which was very stressful because basically I think the news that Tilt was going to shut down and be acquired by Airbnb was delivered on Friday and that we were all going to be re-interviewed on Wednesday. So if you have ever kind of studied for a technical interview, it takes more than a weekend to prepare for that. And I remember the entire engineering team, the VP of engineering and the CTO, we were all at the Tilt office on that weekend studying lead code questions for this interview. It&#8217;s truly stressful. Luckily, I did actually study before I joined Tilt because I was interviewing before I joined Tilt. So that was somewhat fresh in my mind. But those are hard questions. And so I remember at some point, I put my hands up in the air and I said, well, I&#8217;m not going to have enough time to do a proper studying time for to memorize all the 400 link code questions. So I&#8217;m just going to go into the interview and do as best as I can and whatever happens. And I remember on the Uber ride to Airbnb for my interview, I got really nervous because I was not prepared. And I was like, well, maybe I should look at some link code questions. It was like a 15 minute Uber ride. So I opened up lead code on my phone. And back in the day, I don&#8217;t know if this is still the case, but lead code would have like tab questions like, oh, this question was seen at Airbnb, like at Airbnb before somebody reported they&#8217;ve seen it. And so I looked into the Airbnb tag and there&#8217;s like a lot of questions. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to have the time to go through all of them. So I choose one at random, which was actually a very hard question. It was the alien alphabet, like the build order question. If anyone&#8217;s familiar with that, I look at it and then my first interview was that question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, what? Hold up. You got to take a step back. What&#8217;s the alien alphabet code or whatever you talked about? That seems wild.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. So the question was, imagine you found an alien dictionary. Okay. So all the words that you see are in alphabetical order, but you don&#8217;t know the alphabet. So given a bunch of words, recreate the alphabet. So an example is like, let&#8217;s say you have like Abbott, apple, bike, creator, dead, whatever. So you have these words. And so, I kind of made it a little bit more obvious that like first, then you have A and then B and so on, but you could have an incomplete, like, what you have to figure out what the alphabet is. So if you look in a dictionary and you see like, you know, Abbott and apple, so A B, B is first, Apple, P is second. So you kind of have to understand that like, you need to recreate the alphabet from these letters. And so it&#8217;s a graph problem. So you have to build a graph and then you have to figure out how to traverse the graph in order to get the alphabet. And so I have a hard problem if you&#8217;ve never been exposed to it before. But that&#8217;s why my answer is luck, right? Because I literally had this question in front of me when I was in that Uber before the interview and it was fresh in my mind and I just crushed it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love the honesty. 99% of people would not have said luck in giving me some cold showers, ice baths, long walks, meditation bullshit. So I love the honesty.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, I&#8217;ve had so many brilliant friends fail these interviews, like who are extremely talented, more talented than I am, like better developers, better engineers who have failed those interviews. So, yeah. Luck is definitely the right answer. I remember there was one famous story of an open source developer. I think it&#8217;s the person who made brew and he interviewed for Google and he failed the interview. And at the end he said, look, your entire company uses my products.&nbsp;</p><p>Matt Zahab&nbsp;<br>You can&#8217;t really not hire me. That&#8217;s why I love that. Let&#8217;s jump into some of these awards. Again, we&#8217;ve done 260 plus episodes on the pod. A lot of really interesting, incredibly smart people, all smarter than me, all more incredible than me. One thing that stands out, White House CIA Awards. That is absolute craziness. What the heck happened here? Did you go to the White House? How did that, like, give me the whole TLDR. What happened? You got to give us the goods here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, again, I think my answer is luck. So basically what happened was these are awards from a long time ago. These are awards actually from high school. So I&#8217;m from Virginia, which is physically located really close to the CIA. Langley is a couple of miles from our house. And so whenever we did science fair awards, people from the CIA would literally visit my high school to look at those science awards. And so my science fair project was compression, which is pretty similar to encryption to some extent. And I got an award for it. And then the White House was also very much luck. I was part of this organization called National Center for Women in Technology. And the organizer of that event was part of the Obama administration STEM efforts. And she was able to get a speaking opportunity and she asked people to come by, especially people who are representing NCWIT in particular. And I was literally the first person to RSVP to that request. So a lot of it is actually like, somebody asked me during an interview question, actually, like if I were to rate my luck and I would say nine out of 10. Like I think a lot of the things that have happened in my life were because I was prepared and I was just there on time and I was able to react to an opportunity that kind of came across my way. So I&#8217;m not sure if that was a satisfying or an unsatisfying answer, but that&#8217;s kind of how that happened.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love the honesty. Heck, we could have a whole podcast on luck as a whole and creating your own luck. Honestly, Elena will do that for round two. But yes, I love this. And it&#8217;s funny, you mentioned Langley and Canadians are usually better when it comes to knowing where American cities, places are just because you guys are so important in pop culture. And because, you know, I guess, candidly speaking, without you guys, we&#8217;d probably get taken over by most countries in the world. So we do lie our neighbors to the South, but I remember always watching, you know, I love war movies and like whether it&#8217;s Zero Dark Thirty or something else. And then they&#8217;re like, oh, snapshot to Langley, Virginia. And I&#8217;m always like, where the hell is Langley? And again. small world, you grew up right beside it. So just funny how crazy American pop culture is, it has such a presence in Canadians minds. But let&#8217;s jump in. 2017, you worked at some of the most incredible companies on the planet. Obviously, you had cushy jobs. I&#8217;m sure you were making a pretty penny, had the best benefits in the world, probably hadn&#8217;t paid for a meal since you graduated with all the sick benefits packages and all of the perks at these companies. Fast forward to 2017, and you decided to jump ship, take a huge risk, start Iron Fish. What was the story there?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. Wow. The meals were great, I have to say. Like as a foodie, leaving everyone was evil.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br>And then you&#8217;re not, I got entrepreneur over here. It&#8217;s like you go and I want to get my teeth cleaned. Oh, 600 bucks to go to the dentist. Lovely. It&#8217;s yeah. Your pains me, but my apologies for interrupting. Continue please.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s okay. You&#8217;re in Canada. You have health care for free, right? So give or take.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>We have free health care, but if you own your own business, you don&#8217;t get no perks, but c&rsquo;est la vie.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>So maybe the theme of the podcast should be luck. So my boyfriend at the time, who&#8217;s now my husband, was roommates with Juan Benay. Juan Benay started a project called IP Fast and then later became a Palette Coin. And so in 2017, I went over to a dinner at their house. It was somebody&#8217;s birthday, I think it was actually Juan&#8217;s birthday in Palo Alto. So they set up a house in Palo Alto where they lived and work basically. And so I went to that dinner. It was like a 30, 40 person dinner and everyone there was talking about Ethereum. And previously I knew about Bitcoin. I knew a little bit about crypto. Didn&#8217;t really know much about Ethereum. And here I am in a room with extremely intelligent people all buzzing about Ethereum. And so on the car ride back, I&#8217;m like Googling, like, what is Ethereum? And I remember reading the tutorial for how you do voting on chain, on Ethereum with Solidity. And I&#8217;m thinking, this is cool, but I&#8217;m confused by such a big deal. It didn&#8217;t quite click to me at first. This ETH Global Hackathon was announced. It was at ETH Waterloo in 2017, and I was encouraged to go. So I went, and that hackathon in particular was extremely special. That was a very special moment. Not only was it the first ETH Global Hackathon, but everybody was there. Everyone who was early in crypto in 2017, working at Ethereum, they were all there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ve heard so many of them. No, I was not in the space back then, but I&#8217;ve, again, I&#8217;ve been to Waterloo many, many times. Wolford Laurier, which is the sort of fun part of uni, I&#8217;d go see friends there, and then you actually Waterloo, which was the smart kid, you know, not nerd, but nerd uni, where all the most brilliant people in Canada go to school. So very familiar with Waterloo. I&#8217;ve literally had probably 20 or 30 guests on this pod, Elena, who have been at that 2017 event. It was the biggest electric factory in the history of crypto. They said every single person was there. Crazy shit was going on, and tons of incredible applications that we use today were created, and the inception date was actually during that week in ETH Waterloo back in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, it was crazy. I remember like, was Vitalik even giving you a talk about ZKPs? I don&#8217;t remember anymore, but that would have been pretty revolutionary. But yeah, so I was at that hackathon. Again, everybody was there and Metamask like, back in the day, it was just one guy, Dan Finlay, who like, wrote MetaMask. The MakerDAO team was pretty small and they were like, the majority of them were there. Like, Vitalik and his dad were there. It felt really special. And for me, like, I&#8217;m working on my hackathon project. It&#8217;s like 3 a.m. I can&#8217;t get it to work. Pretty frustrated. I asked for help. The person says, like, look, I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing wrong. But Dan Finlay, who wrote MetaMask, is right behind you. Go ask him. So I do like a 180 in my chair. And I&#8217;m like, hey, Dan, 3:30 a.m. I&#8217;m pulling out my hair. Can&#8217;t get my hackathon project to work. He like, I can&#8217;t get this like MetaMask integration to work. Could you help me out? And like, he&#8217;s debugging this with me and he&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s a bug in MetaMask. Like, here&#8217;s a workaround. And like that felt extremely special. And I got a small prize from Maker for kind of this hackathon project. And I was kind of encouraged to kind of keep going. I went to more hackathons, eventually started doing workshops and tutorials for how to code in Solidity because I thought that was so important. Like the ERC-20 boom was happening. If you remember that time, the ICO boom. And I was like, you know, I can live code an entire smart contract on stage with like the audience, you know, if I can do it with TASA with a basic UI, like so can you. And that was like my whole spiel about like, don&#8217;t be so impressed with this marketing language of like, oh, there&#8217;s a denta coin on chain because you can do it so easily as well. And so that ERC-20s were kind of boring. So I started doing tutorials on ERC-721s and got really deep in the NFT community in 2018. I don&#8217;t think people realize that NFTs are that old. And like literally if I had just, you know, pushed to mainnet, some of the tutorials that I&#8217;ve done for ERC-721, somebody gone somewhere. But yeah, those were incredible times. I think my second hackathon was with Alex and Devin from OpenSea, and we made this drag and drop NFT generator tool, which also got a prize. And then later on, I started doing these workshops, just live cutting down stage these tutorials. So yeah, that was a pretty special time. And so I was basically going all over the world to do workshops and hackathons and conferences and these talks while I was still an engineer at Airbnb. So at some point I thought, okay, I should choose what I wanna do full-time, because it felt like I had two jobs. I had my crypto side gig, or side hobby, and then I had Airbnb. And so I decided to quit. So I quit, I think in July of 2018. It took me a while to kind of understand what I wanted to do in this space and to do my research. And then we closed a pre-seed round. It was an amazing investor here in Silicon Valley who&#8217;s doing angel investing in October. And that&#8217;s kind of when things started. It was a very annoying year pass. We knew we&#8217;d be wanting to work in privacy in particular. We actually rewrote the entire code base in 2020. So whenever people ask me like, how old is Iron Fish? It&#8217;s like, oh, it&#8217;s like four and a half, but kind of two and a half years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s incredible. Wow. So many flashbacks and throwback Thursdays crazy. Elena, we have to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the Show, PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we&#8217;re going to get into Iron Fish 101, you guys, Mainnet launch back on April 20th. Clich&eacute; to do it on the 20th. We love to see that. That was obviously earlier this year. The importance of privacy in Web2, Web3, ZK Tech, and the world of L2s.

We got a fun docket of crypto stuff on route, coming in hot. Before that, give me the TLDR, the elevator pitch on Iron Fish. What exactly you and the team do, and then we&#8217;ll get into the fun stuff. So the floor is yours, the ball is in your court. What is Iron Fish?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>So Iron Fish focuses on privacy, our whole goal is to make crypto safe for users to use by adding private transactions for all your crypto assets. So right now, for instance, if you use Ethereum or Bitcoin, everything&#8217;s out in the open. So if you were to use it for real-world payments, you can kind of imagine being forced to use like Venmo Public, like every single transaction you do is out in the open. So for Iron Fish, we&#8217;re building a privacy layer so you can move your assets over to Iron Fish and do all the operations that you would normally do, but in a privacy layer. Iron Fish is a Layer 1 chain, where proof of work, which is very atypical. And nowadays, to launch a proof of work chain and every transaction is fully encrypted, meaning that it is private, so it hides the sender, the recipient, and amount, or an asset type, such that we can kind of support other assets from other chains and provide the privacy layer for Web3.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>And the big need point, was there a specific like, aha moment, or was there like, I&#8217;m tired of this shit, I&#8217;m building my own? Like was there a sort of use case inception story or anything of the like?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I think we&#8217;re just going to win. I think that crypto is going to win as a payments platform, period. And at this moment in time, we&#8217;re going into a dark mirror episode, or black mirror episode, of having all your transactions out in the open. So for me, the need was very much like, I believe in crypto, I don&#8217;t believe crypto is going to succeed without privacy. And that part to me was missing, that very few people were focusing on. If we look at the landscape of people working on privacy protocols, in comparison to maybe anything else, it&#8217;s very little. There are very few projects working on privacy. And to me, that seemed like the biggest opportunity, the biggest need for crypto to solve before it goes mainstream. And frankly, a necessity if we want to create this wordless payment system. So that was very much my thesis of if crypto is going to win, it has to have a privacy component in order to do so, and nobody else is building it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Touch&eacute;. I mean, yeah, very blunt to the point. I love that. And you guys mainnet launch on April 20th. I love that you guys did that on April 20th. Again, what other industry where it&#8217;s like, imagine if like some Fortune 500 company besides Tesla was like, oh, we&#8217;re going to do a big launch on 420. Like you get laughed at here, like it&#8217;s celebrated. I love that shit. Just one of the best parts about crypto, IMO.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>So this room behind is actually even funnier, I think. We&#8217;re supposed to have launched on March 14th, 3.14, which is Pi Day. And we were curing up for launch and we slipped. Like the day before, we basically couldn&#8217;t make it. And so we made this huge announcement that we had to delay launch and we have a blog post about it. We actually found a bug the day before launch that we thought was so critical that we need to delay it. But people were planning on shipping on March 14th. And so our entire majority, like pretty much our entire engineering team went to Coachella and already bought tickets to Coachella. And so the day where everybody was back with a one day buffer just happened to be 420. That&#8217;s true story. So that&#8217;s why we launched when people came back from Coachella.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I absolutely love that. Now a couple of year big and again I&#8217;ve when doing research for the show there&#8217;s always a couple main points that the guest aka you is an absolute expert on and can really hammer home You have a couple of really good ones. One is merging privacy and compliance in Web3. The world of L2s and the importance of privacy of Web2 and Web3 we can tackle these in any order. Let&#8217;s start with just privacy as a whole and then we&#8217;ll get into the world of L2s because I know you have some spicy takes on this and I can&#8217;t wait to get into that. But let&#8217;s start give us sort of the TLDR on the importance of privacy in Web2 and Web3. How they differentiate and why we need it in order to succeed in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, one of my talks was basically that when Web2 breaks this promise of privacy We have catastrophic consequences. So what I mean by that is if we have data leaks like Equifax or we have like other data leaks. Like if you ever use Strava, for instance, Strava is an app that tracks your runs if you&#8217;re in a fleet. And it revealed basically the location of US Army bases around the world because soldiers would use Strava to go running. And so like these are just like very simple examples where whenever we had data leaks in Web2, we had catastrophic consequences. But in Web3, there is no like concept of privacy. Like forget about data leaks. Like data leaks are built in by design with every single action that you do on Web3. And so for me, it&#8217;s like, well, you know, I know that Web2 is flawed, but at least Web2 gives you more of a privacy guarantee than Web3 will do. And it&#8217;s like, if Web3 is going to like surpass Web2, it has to be better than Web2. And at this moment in time, because of that privacy or lack of privacy, I should say, we can&#8217;t really make the argument that it&#8217;s better. You know, obviously, like there&#8217;s other things that we need to catch up on like speed and so on. But in order for technology to surpass, it needs to be like 10x better than the previous technology. And at this moment in time, it&#8217;s just not. Obviously, there are different people that are focusing on different things, like scalability and stability. For us, we chose to focus on privacy because again, it&#8217;s one of the biggest pillars that I think is missing, that very few people are focusing on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s so true. It&#8217;s unfortunate because, and you and I were talking about this before the show, privacy, it&#8217;s so important, but it&#8217;s not sexy. You know what I mean? Like when you ask someone, like, oh, do you really care about your privacy? Yeah, they&#8217;ll give you the spiel, but at the end of the day, they just want things that work, things that are efficient, you know, things that give you what you want quick, instant gratification, dopamine hit. No one gives a shit. And it&#8217;s so unfortunate because it&#8217;s so frigging important, you know?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, I&#8217;ll push back on that, right? So we have doors in our houses. We have that for a reason. Just like you&#8217;re not a criminal, right? But you still have a door.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Online privacy. You&#8217;re bang on. You totally nailed it. That would be what Web1? You know, like IRL and IRL. Yeah, in IRL privacy, yes, we all care, but in Web2 and Web3, aka every day on the internet, like everyone&#8217;s on TikTok. TikTok&#8217;s literally watching your every move. People don&#8217;t care because you get those quick dopamine hits. It&#8217;s fun. You know, it&#8217;s a way to kill time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>OK, here&#8217;s another example. Let&#8217;s say you are a teenager and you&#8217;re buying contraceptive. Do you want your parents to know that? Probably not, right? And in Web2, like you can use Venmo or a credit card or anything. And we&#8217;re cash even to like buy things that you might be embarrassed to, you know, for other people to know. You can do that with a pretty good degree of privacy. If you were to use Ethereum and your parents knew about you, like this is your Ethereum wallet, they&#8217;d be able to see, you know, if you were to like, you know, buy a plan BPEL, right? So I think when people like other people realize like what financial privacy or data privacy actually need and when I put in that context, they&#8217;re like, oh, yeah, I would like that privacy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s very true. Good point. Hey, you got me there. Elena two Matt zero. But yes, moving on the world of L2s. Again, this is a big one for you and the team here. Again, I&#8217;m not even going to try to explain this because you can do it way bigger than me. I&#8217;m going to throw the ball right over to your court. You have to touch on the point you touched on earlier before the show in regards to the importance of bridging between L1s and L2s and just give us a quick little synopsis present day early September 2023 on the world of L2s and what we have to look forward to in the future as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Sure. So quick landscape check of like what&#8217;s happening in the L2 world. I&#8217;m sure you heard that there&#8217;s optimistic rollups and then there are ZK rollups and they work differently. So for optimistic rollups, the way that happens is some activity happens in the L2 and then the L2 records activity of the L1 and you have seven days for other people to submit fraud proofs if anything it ferries has happened. So it&#8217;s kind of like an innocent until proven guilty model effectively. And for ZK rollups, it&#8217;s basically proven by math that like an action has happened on the L2 and I can give you a solid proof, a cryptographic proof that the action is correct, meaning that a person is not spending funds they don&#8217;t have, like that they&#8217;re basic checks that are kind of checked in order. And so that&#8217;s going to have the ZK rollups work. So as you can imagine, ZK rollups are much harder to build. And so there are some that are like either mainnet or kind of coming to fruition at this moment in time, but optimistic rollups at this moment in time have more attraction, more volume and so on because they were able to launch earlier and as much easier to use them. For optimism, the L2 release something called OP stack. So now anyone can host their own L2 and we have number of projects including base, real coin base, that have used the OP stack, meaning like they&#8217;ve used the code base to create their own L2. So in 2017, there was like then ICO boom of everyone creating their own ERC-20 coin. And I feel like now we&#8217;re kind of entering this different boom of people launching their own L2 to do something. And there&#8217;s cons and pros to that in my opinion. So if you look at an L2, I kind of feel like an old man shaking fists at the sky. Like L2s are just like L1s. They&#8217;re sovereign chains. They are not tied to Ethereum, at least optimistic ones. They&#8217;re not tied to Ethereum in ways that people think they are. They&#8217;re sovereign chains. And the only difference is that they have a different consensus mechanism. And the consensus mechanism is, I say so. Because an L2 has a single sequencer, meaning that they have a single block producer that accepts blocks. They accept whatever blocks that they produce themselves. And at this moment in time, fraud proofs are not live. I think Arbitrum, which is another optimistic rollup, has made more advancements fraud proofs. But I think at this moment in time, it&#8217;s still not fully live. And I might be wrong, but for OP stack that people are using right now, that&#8217;s definitely the case. And so when you kind of look at it that way, you&#8217;re like. Okay, well, L2s are kind of like sovereign L1s with a different consensus. So what is the relationship with the L1? And so the bridge, and that&#8217;s more contract on the L1 are kind of like those relationships. And for bridging in particular, like bridging is hard. Like we&#8217;ve had so many hacks happen in 2020, 2021 with bridges, I guess at 2021. We got like the rodent hack, if you remember that, that was that $600 million hack, the Nomad bridge hack, a few others.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It has sort of interrupt. That seems like it was yesterday. That was two years ago then. That is wild. That was the, Ronin was the Axie hack, right?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, when did that happen? That was, okay, 2022, I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Still crazy that, yeah, just crypto moves so bloody quick. My goodness. Sorry, you were saying the relation between L1s and L2s, the hacks, side note, it is crazy, all those hacks that happen on bridges. It seemed like bridges were just getting absolutely attacked and no pun intended. And I feel like it hasn&#8217;t gotten too much better. Like, yeah, there&#8217;s, you have a lot of incredible firms who were like you guys who really go out there and make life more secure in Web3. But I still feel like there&#8217;s so many vulnerabilities. Speaking of attacks, Stake just got, you know, and a lot of Web2 folks know what Stake is because you have like streamers like Aiden Ross and obviously Drizzy Drake, the boy, shout out Drake, who work with Stake. But crazy these hacks that they still happen all the time. Hope this shit comes to an end soon. It&#8217;s not a good look for us folks at Web3.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>No, and hacks like happen for different reasons. Sometimes the bridge design is actually good, but the implementation of it might have some flaws, right? Or you have operational and security, which is kind of what happened with Ronin. The story for that is wild. I don&#8217;t know if you know this, but the hacker went through an entire interview process with Ronin because the hacker wanted an engineer with AWS keys on their laptop to open the PDF, the resume PDF, and then there was an exploit in the PDF itself. And like wild. stuff, right? So like the exploit was able to find the AWS keys that they were able to access the validator nodes for Ronin. Ronin was a multi-sig bridge, meaning that you have a quorum. I believe they had nine validators and the majority had to sign off for transactions to pass through, you know, one chain to the other. The Axie Infinity, I believe, had four out of the nine validators, which is not a majority. But the fifth validator basically auto, but like auto did everything, auto copied everything that the Axie Infinity validators did. So again, the bridge design, like the multi-sig bridge design is the most common bridge design that we have today. Most of the bridges that you&#8217;ve heard of, like wormhole and so on, they&#8217;re using this multi-sig, they&#8217;re using the exact same architecture. So it&#8217;s not that the architecture was flawed, it&#8217;s like the off set was flawed. And so like bridge design is obviously like very difficult, and there&#8217;s like a lot of traps. And so for us, we&#8217;re very much interested in the topic, because we want assets from other chains to come to Iron Fish. So we&#8217;ve done a lot of research. And when we looked at the L2s, I said, well, wait a minute, they&#8217;re basically L1s in my opinion. Because the validation of the L2 happens on the L2. Like the way L2s work is they basically put the state on the L1, but validation does not happen on the L1. It happens on the L2. And so then the bridge services pretty important role there. When we look to the bridge, it&#8217;s like, well, the bridge looks like a single sign or bridge between most of these L2s, which is like pretty dangerous, right? But because it&#8217;s kind of like hidden a little bit away in terms of how people interact with L2s, most people don&#8217;t think about it, which is very interesting. Now, there are different L2 designs as well. So for instance, all of them work the same. The ZKVM from Polygon, I think, is pretty interesting in the sense that a user basically locks the funds themselves on the L1, and then the user themselves unlocks the funds on the L2. And so I&#8217;m not entirely sure if that&#8217;s considered non-custodial, but I would personally argue that it&#8217;s non-custodial because the user basically does all the actions to lock in a lock themselves. So it&#8217;s not the bridge that&#8217;s minting or burning wrapped assets. It&#8217;s the user that&#8217;s insuring those things, which I think is actually really cool. But yeah, there&#8217;s like a lot there. And I think we&#8217;re moving to kind of a really weird world where we&#8217;re kind of realizing that the transaction cost on L2s is cheaper than on L1s, but not by that much. So for instance, if you were to spend like $10 to do an L1 transaction, you&#8217;re still spending like $1 to do an L2 transaction. And that&#8217;s still kind of expensive for most of what you want to do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s got to be dirt cheap.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. So why is the cost there? And part of the reason why the cost is there is because L2s aggregate transactions and simplify them or compress them, and then they put that state on the L1. And just like storage on the L1 is very expensive. So that is why your transaction cost that much. So then people got excited and they were like, if we do like data availability layers. So what if we have L2 store data elsewhere, so the transactions are much cheaper. But then the trade-off is if the L2 saves data elsewhere, then is it an L2 for Ethereum or not? I would argue that at that moment in time, you&#8217;re giving up even more security if you&#8217;re moving away to a different availability layer. So it&#8217;s like a weird moment in crypto where in order to drive transactions or in order to drive down cost-worth for those transactions, we have to even move to a more centralized kind of like place that is losing a lot of the ethos of crypto. So obviously like that is top of mind for us because we&#8217;re looking into how to integrate into that world. And sorry if that was a pessimistic view.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>No, that was very well described. One of the best ones on the pod. So I appreciate that. On the importance of L2s and this will be my last question on this topic and we are getting tight for time, mind you, but OP. I&#8217;m still seeing so much OP news everywhere. This is optimism by the way, folks. It&#8217;s everywhere. Like, are you bullish on it long term? Is this just a fad? Obviously, the launch of base, which is Coinbase&#8217;s L2 on OP, is huge, right? Whenever you get a company like Coinbase coming in and moving and grooving and building, that has ripple effects. That moves the needle. Is this here long term, Elena, or is this just the hype train?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>So I&#8217;m a huge fan of the team. I think optimism is like an incredible team. If you look at the people that work there, they&#8217;re like, oh, gee, crypto people who have been like in Ethereum since practically day one. So I think they&#8217;re really a special team. So I think like I&#8217;m bullish on them figuring it out, but they&#8217;re facing really hard problems. Like the basic problems that I mentioned of like, how do you make sure that it&#8217;s still decentralized? How do you make sure the validation happens on the L1 to some degree? How do you make sure that prices make sense without you giving up everything by moving to a different data availability layer? Oh my gosh, I can&#8217;t say that word. I think they&#8217;re facing like really hard problems, but I&#8217;m kind of bullish on the team to figure it out. I&#8217;m figuring them out, but you know, I am critical of the design they have today, which is the fact that they don&#8217;t have fraud proofs and the fact that everyone was kind of copying their design. And as a part of the reason why I was so passionate, you know, doing those tutorials in 2018, like I wanted people to understand how the software is made, like how the tech actually works in order for them to like believe whether or not it&#8217;s full decentralization. And at this moment in time, like anyone going to like just make their own L2, like there&#8217;s even services like Caldera, for instance, that make that experience like for you launching your own L2, like two button clicks, right? And so when it&#8217;s that easy, and there&#8217;s not that much like, you know, to tie into that, like it makes me worried that we&#8217;re entering a variation of like the ICO boom, but now with these like app chains or these L2s. So I&#8217;m very bullish on the team, but I&#8217;m critical of the products at this moment in time and how it&#8217;s used by various teams.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I love that. We might have to title this episode, Elena on the L2 boom. No, we&#8217;d never, but that&#8217;s very interesting take. And this is the first time I&#8217;ve heard that. Elena, we are getting tight for time. This has been an absolute treat. Non-negotiable. You must come on for round two because we barely scratched the surface. But before then, last question, hot take factory, you and I jump in, get our shit kicked, knee high boots on, let a couple hot takes fly. Doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto related. It can be health, wealth, happiness, space race, aliens, AI, any spicy shit you got for us before we let you go today.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s a lot. Can you ask me a question? I&#8217;ll give my hot take. Like aliens?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Give me aliens. First we&#8217;ll do aliens and we&#8217;ll do AI. We&#8217;ll just stick with the A&#8217;s. Are aliens real?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh my gosh, aliens. Do I believe they&#8217;re real? I mean, I think like someone said this quote, I think like it&#8217;s scarier to think that we&#8217;re the only species in the universe. So I want to believe that they&#8217;re aliens, but I also read the three body problem. I don&#8217;t know if you read the book, but the concept of the book is, let&#8217;s say you imagine you&#8217;re in dark forest and you meet somebody in dark forest, and you think, okay, maybe they want to kill me because they don&#8217;t know who I am. So I should kill them first for the off chance that they might want to kill me first. And that whole concept is like applied to aliens. And so like if aliens know who we are, then like, why are we alive?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Very true. They&#8217;re just mocking us. They&#8217;re like, look at these peasants. Look at these humans.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, there&#8217;s so many other, like, okay, so here&#8217;s my hot take at aliens. Maybe aliens are just really ancient humans from a previous civilization.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>What about all this UFO stuff? Is it weird that the UFOs only pop up over like Nevada and other parts of the States that have military bases and not a lot of cities close by? Is that spooky in any capacity, or is it just all nonsense?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Totally. I mean, there&#8217;s like two arguments, right? If aliens do exist, then they&#8217;re like, oh my gosh, these humans, they&#8217;re going to blow themselves up. We better monitor this situation, especially if aliens live on this planet somehow like underwater, right? They&#8217;re like, okay, we&#8217;re worried. You know, the other hot take is that maybe they&#8217;re just military operations, right? Like if I&#8217;m the US government and I made an aircraft that resembled a UFO, I would definitely want to test it out next in Nevada or whatnot. But then if anyone sees it, I&#8217;ll be like, oh, it&#8217;s a UFO. I think the fact that the government is like propagating this theory that these UFOs are aliens makes me more suspicious that it&#8217;s just military aircraft.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, we&#8217;re so far advanced with what we can do today. I don&#8217;t see how they&#8217;re not working on some crazy stuff behind the scenes, but that&#8217;s well above your nice pay grade. Maybe not you, because your boy&#8217;s gals, rather, with the CIA and the White House, where&#8230;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh gosh, no, that was high school. That was long time ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Hey, it&#8217;s in the bio. You got to take that to the grave, you know? At least if you knock on the door, like with your trophy, they might let you in. With me, they&#8217;ll be like, who&#8217;s this curly-headed, you know, Canadian Lebanese fuck and throw me behind bars.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Hey, you made a great podcast. So that&#8217;s a thing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ll take it. Small wins. Elena, this has been an absolute treat. Thank you so much for coming on, learned a ton and have some homework to do and cannot wait to have you on for round two before you leave. Can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Iron Fish Foundation. Everything Iron Fish related for that matter online and on socials.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Awesome. My Twitter is @leanthebean. It&#8217;s the same thing on Telegram and syndicate from middle school is stuck around. And then for Iron Fish, @ironfishcrypto is the tag line for Twitter. And if you want to join our Discord, which I highly recommend if you want learn more about Iron Fish, it&#8217;s discord.ironfish.network. And then obviously our website is ironfish.network. So if you have any questions, we&#8217;re on Discord. We&#8217;re there. Just tag me and they&#8217;ll make sure to answer your question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>There it is. Folks what an episode. Elena, thanks again. Really appreciate it and can&#8217;t wait for round two.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elena Nadolinski</strong>&nbsp;<br>Awesome. Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an episode with Elena Nadolinski, CEO of Iron Fish Foundation. Folks, we got some homework to do. She was dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center the world of L2s. The big L2 boom which we are currently seeing and will continue to see Privacytek, you name it, ZK Rollups, we touched on it. Huge shout out to Elena and the team for hooking this up. If you guys enjoyed this one, I hope you did. Please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I. Speaking of the team, love you guys so much. Thank you for everything as always, we&#8217;ll be lost without you. Love you all. Justas my amazing sound editor. You&#8217;re the GOAT. Appreciate you. You know how much you do and it does not go unnoticed. Would also be lost without you and back to the listeners. Love you guys. Thank you so much for everything. Thank you for tuning in. Keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.&nbsp;</p>

We are buzzin as always, and I&#8217;m super pumped to have the one and only Eric Chen on the show today, Co-Founder and CEO of Injective Labs. Prior to Injective, he was a researcher at Innovating Capital, working on trading strategies and protocol research. For that, he was part of the NYU Blockchain Labs and has been working in the crypto industry since 2017. Nice and early, we&#8217;d love to see that. Eric also dropped out of NYU and currently has one of the best accounts on Crypto Twitter, just putting out nothing but fire 24 hours a day. Eric Chen, pumped to have you on my man. Welcome to show. How you doing?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Good. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Pumped to have you. You are a New York lad living in Manhattan, which is the absolute best, probably the best city in the world. I mean, pretty tough to debate against. You dropped out of NYU. That must have been crazy. I&#8217;m sure your parents, your friends, your family were like, give your head a shake. What are you doing? Walk me through that decision. What was that like droppin at NYU to co-work in crypto?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think the process for that was actually pretty much a no brainer for me personally. It was too good of an opportunity to pass up on. I think as I started full-time with the industry, just like what are two years late? I would have missed out on a lot of opportunity and just be much later than everyone else within the space. And on top of that, there were a lot of very exciting and inspiring people to work alongside. Yeah, it didn&#8217;t really take much consideration at all. I think it probably took much longer time for people around me to wrap their head around or to understand than for me to decide.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Walk me through some of those combos though, because again, this is something that I get asked. I didn&#8217;t drop out of uni. I did my four years, but looking back at it, I would have been a good choice. It would have been probably the right choice to do. I love uni. I had a blast. I don&#8217;t know about learned a ton, learned a lot on the qualitative side of things, right? The networking and conversations, partying, all that kind of good stuff, which I do think moves the needle in life. But on the quantitative side, definitely didn&#8217;t learn as much as I would have liked to. And I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s part of the reason why you dropped out as well. You understood that you were able to grab some crazy working experience in a booming industry. But with that being said, what would you tell someone who has entrepreneurial spirit, who wants to grind, isn&#8217;t really messing with uni at the moment and wants to drop out? Any words of advice, wisdom, things you wish you did differently?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I would say for me, it was actually quite easy to convince a parent and stuff like that. Because there&#8217;s this angelic, plan A and plan B, I&#8217;d receive a thing, initial funding or at least commitments. So that would be a plan A. Plan B It&#8217;s fairly easy for me to get a job or continue what my previous part-time job was. So that wasn&#8217;t exactly the biggest issue after dropping out. I would say above all, I was like, education is still an extremely important. One of my partial regret was definitely not being able to finish school or take some grad courses I really wanted to take and kind of forced myself like a tough learning path. So I would say, unless there are absolute irrefutable reasons for you to drop out, definitely staying in school is certainly much more impactful and much more high A.B. experience and path. I&#8217;m well read.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, well said there. Let&#8217;s jump into Injective. Love the logo, by the way. Super clean, I mean, great setup. It&#8217;s fun. You and I were talking about this before the show. Every office now has like a little media room. Like it&#8217;s crazy. Every office I&#8217;ve been to in the last couple of years now has media room for pods and video sessions, whatever the case may be. And I mean, before COVID that was never a thing. So just a cool side note there. But walk me through Injective before we get into the nitty gritty, the founding story, the vision, overview, ecosystems, key projects, all that stuff. And then we&#8217;ll sort of pick and choose where we want to jump into as we move forward through the conversation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think, you know, like Injective last start off as a fairly simple, you know, mission. And that is, you know, trying to democratize finance through decentralization and, you know, providing like a permissionless and accessible platform for all. And obviously, you know, like that is very much of a big direction. The really the more nuanced or like the more specific approach in Jack of Laugh start off as is utilizing a lot of the existing infrastructure, especially at a time where you have like a resemblance of Dex, you have some very early nascent primitives within decentralized finance and, you know, fairly nascent as well, you know, rails on and off ramps. One of the key, you know, blockers were one of the key missing part was having like a fair and scalable and dynamic exchange of infrastructure. And back then, you know, like dex was extremely gas intensive. It was literally just slamming water or some type of an Ethereum of more about was, you know, no ways to scale it. And, you know, they all understand that, you know, it&#8217;s almost impossible to trade. So Injective, logically you know, start off as trying to solve that problem by, you know, figuring out the scalability layer and more importantly, figuring out like the far running resistant and the free type of solution to make sure that there is a, you know, viable infrastructure for any type of exchange, applications in the most dynamic way possible. And to this day, you know, like Injective as an ecosystem and, you know, what Injective Labs focus is on has certainly changed a lot. You know, it started off from like a blockchain with a lot of like, you know, exchange focus permanent into a very much sector specific, generalized, you know, semi-generalized, at least, Layer-1 blocking bill for financial applications. At this point, you know, it&#8217;s effectively identified as like an open, interoperable blockchain with a set of very powerful, you know, next generation, DeFi primitives and, you know, out of the block modules where different types of these protocols and applications can plug and play and integrate with. And these modules, you know, include decentralized spot and derivatives exchanges, and, you know, prediction market, binary options, you know, lending, world calls, etc. much more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s crazy. So just to summarize, you and the team in essence built a blockchain specifically for finance. And again, with the this stem from really just the old state of DeFi being built on Ethereum, such a shit show, like you said, crazy high gas prices, you&#8217;re literally just slamming the ETH order book and you guys were like, hey, this needs to change. It needs to be much leaner, more efficient. And that&#8217;s why there was a need for a blockchain specific finance or a finance specific blockchain rather.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think it goes a lot beyond that. Initially, that was during my process, which is like, you know, since EVM is obviously turned complete, and, you know, it&#8217;s just, you know, like a pretty dynamic environment with a set up like pretty quirky, like pretty compiles, you can technically just have like L2 solution that has, you know, almost like, you know, like synchronous environment or like a continuous environment, aka like very fast, like block reduction, and just call it a day, you know, host whatever sort of applications you want. But very quickly became, you know, a very significant issue, because, you know, within any type of generalized environment, the chips are stacked against the DeFi applications, because DeFi applications require kind of like a constant economics of scale for, you know, a lot of the core operations, it has, you know, like typically, you know, for, let&#8217;s say, order bulk exchanges, for example, it&#8217;s usually, you know, comparatively computationally light, but at the same time, you know, extremely space intensive. So it kind of goes around, you know, kind of like the general heuristic for, you know, how like a gas economy would work or like any type of smart contract environment, not just for EVM. So it requires kind of like the interference of like a, you know, a feltson native exchange infrastructure that has, you know, more like blockchain friendly mechanisms, and also like a guarantee in terms of like matching intervals, etc. And also, you know, somewhat like a guarantee and like liveness, as well as, you know, kind of like a guarantee with an tonality where like, you don&#8217;t have like your entire order or, you know, your entire position like the neck, because there was a, you know, small fork, etc. And all the, you know, DeFi related, you know, kind of like ecosystem also has that, you know, you&#8217;d be working around this kind of core infrastructure to make it truly, you know, like scalable and also as sector, kind of like a financial ecosystem. So this means that with these types of like native modules like Oracle, like order book, etc. You can on top of it build a lot of different types of like smart contracts or, you know, different types of application that you don&#8217;t necessarily have to worry too much about all that, you know, like gas fluctuations, etc. And, you know, kind of have to guarantee that, you know, your application is going to be up to date and live. I think those are like, you know, definitely like the most important aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How does one even, again, this is way out of my pay grade, Eric, like I wouldn&#8217;t even know where to begin, but how do you start building these blockchains and exchange specific, you know, protocols and bits of technology? Like, where do you even start? Again, I&#8217;m not a coder, so this is so, you know, nascent to me, but like, if someone did have a technological background and was like, okay, I understand algos, I understand order books, I understand the ins and outs of transactions, and more specifically exchanges, like where do you get started? How do you implement this?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward, to be honest. You basically start with like, you know, blockchain infrastructure that&#8217;s like pretty valuable. Obviously, you know, if there isn&#8217;t such, you know, like customizable like SDKs or like, you know, like infrastructure tools, like it&#8217;ll be a lot more painful. But, you know, thankfully, like there&#8217;s Cosmos SDK, you know, Tendermint, etc. that can basically resolve like, you know, 60% of like the consensus level or like, you know, the core level, like complexities. And you simply, you know, like customize a lot of logic within the core SDK itself, and, you know, messed around with like different types of modules and implement like the logic that you&#8217;re looking for. And obviously, you know, like there&#8217;s definitely a lot more like granularity and issues behind it. But, you know, getting started with like a zero to one step, that&#8217;s actually, you know, super straightforward. Thanks to, you know, a lot of the existing tools and infrastructure around it, and mainly things that, you know, Cosmos SDK.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Interesting. Super cool there. I mean, you made that sound a hell of a lot easier than it is. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s absolute nightmare fuel, but we&#8217;ll take your word for it there. But yeah, with all honesty, it must be absolutely insane. So let&#8217;s take a sort of a deeper look into Injective, walk me through a couple of this specific projects that you guys are working on, some of the ecosystems that you&#8217;re diving into. And then we&#8217;ll get into some of the fun stuff, like getting investments from Mark Cuban, Jump Crypto, Pantera, and all those lads.</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think I&#8217;ll have to top up my head. You know, if you asked me this question like three months ago, or like half a year ago, it would have been super easy. I was like, oh, like there&#8217;s Helix, and you know, there&#8217;s a couple of other ones, you know, a lot of the adoption and traction are like sent around Helix, or the exchange module, etc. processing, you know, like, I don&#8217;t know, like maybe 12 or like $11 billion to date for past year or two. But if you, but now, especially like, you know, in like, July, August and September, there has just been, you know, crazy amount of, you know, interest and, you know, traction for a lot of the, you know, tabs are, you know, building natively within Injective and deploying on top of the Injective, where I&#8217;m, you know, constantly trying to catch up on like what all the builders are working on, you know, what they&#8217;re doing, even off the top of my head, you know, there&#8217;s Talis, which is a highly successful, you know, NFT platform and this point with a bunch of volume, exactly, you know, how much it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s a better question to ask Talis. But, you know, like it&#8217;s certainly, you know, beating out a lot of the major L1s and numbers of adoption and traction. There&#8217;s obviously, you know, quite a few other like native projects. I think like, you know, Black Panther, they&#8217;re working on like ask management protocol and generating like real yield strategy. There&#8217;s Astroport, which is quite exciting, you know, like AMM protocol was like native, orderable based, OP and liquid, you know, like provisioning and swapping. There&#8217;s quite a lot to be honest and, you know, Qwerty, Dojo, like Exchange Apps. And then, you know, there&#8217;s a FrontRunner, which is kind of sports betting, like a gaming app. And then like recently, there&#8217;s also like, you know, like Aliens On Injective, which is working on quite a few things, I think beyond just like entity. And there&#8217;s also like, you know, I think like a few of productivity apps even, but yeah, like it&#8217;s just been like a lot of, you know, like developer interests and deployments and a lot of traction behind them as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. I mean, I feel like, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I feel like the sentiment&#8217;s changing. I feel like, I don&#8217;t want to say the bear market&#8217;s over because it&#8217;s not, but I feel like the sentiment at least is on the rise. Do you agree with that?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. I mean, like we, we certainly felt like witness or, you know, basically a plunge of it, especially because, you know, like I feel like, you know, during like acquire a common market, like, you know, currently where we are right now, that&#8217;s when, you know, like signal to noise ratio is like the most optimal. And there&#8217;s a lot more like, you know, merit based filtering and, you know, a lot more like capital position, cost efficient, you know, like onboarding and traction. If you have, you know, like a strong reason for developers to be interested to be building on top of you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>100%. Great point there. Eric, we got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. But when we get back, we got to talk about a couple of fun things. You mentioned FrontRunner. I know you&#8217;ve been buzzing on FrontRunner. You have some hilarious tweets about FrontRunner and I&#8217;m a sports gambler myself, big sports fan. We got to get into that. Before we do huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews .com and long time sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast. I absolutely love PrimeXBT.

Now back to the show with Eric. Talk to me about FrontRunner. This looks, candidly speaking here, I didn&#8217;t know about them until I was doing prep for the show. Again, you have to do what you gotta do. I always lurk my guest Twitter account. It&#8217;s one of the best spots for some good talking points. Looked at them, they seem sweet. What&#8217;s the deal with FrontRunner? Their Twitter bio is the number one sports prediction app. It&#8217;s tender for sports fans. That is hilarious. Tell me more about this. Why does this get you going?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Well, from my perspective, it&#8217;s a very interesting utilization. That&#8217;s a lot to exchange module primitives, especially on the derivatives side. Because effectively the way that FrontRunner works is that they take existing financial primitives for derivatives in measurements and really turning it into something that is applicable to a much more broader audience. Effectively speaking, they utilize this binary off-game primitive, which is a binary outcome that has a very light reliance on Oracle, but at the same time it has a lot of flexibility on binary outcomes, which is perfect for sports, etc. But at the same time, which is obviously a non-binary outcome, but at the same time it&#8217;s a fixed duration for, or guaranteed like a resolution. And utilizing these primitives, they turn it into like a betting or like a gaming platform where it looks and feels like any type of sports betting platform that they&#8217;re familiar with, but in reality it&#8217;s fully decentralized with a lot of very powerful like liquidity aggregation and synergetic relationship with liquidity providers. Because I don&#8217;t know much about the betting or gaming industry, but one thing I do know is that liquidity fragmentation is extremely palpable and apparent. And one of the things that FrontRunner can do is to have this global platform where anyone can provide liquidity, anyone can introduce order flow into like a nexus of events, and provide probably the best possible solution for the overall market. But when I actually started using it, that&#8217;s when I realized like how would I know about sports?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>I see. And where does the Tinder part come into play there? It&#8217;s that the bio is number one sports prediction app. I think in sports prediction apps are different than sports betting apps, but where does the Tinder for sports fans come into play?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>I mean, it&#8217;s a similar type of like abstract mechanism as like Tinder, right? It&#8217;s a binary choice on any type of like potential events or potential objects. So, for FrontRunner&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s like for every single sports event, you can have a binary bet on it. So that would be betting that one team would win and the other team would lose or reverse, right? Whereas for Tinder&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s like making a choice. Yes to this person or no to that person. Both of them are fairly similar and mechanisms. There are some other products that like FrontRunner offered that&#8217;s a little bit more interesting, like throughout the entire season, who is the winner, etc. And you speculate on odds for that. So that&#8217;s not necessarily like a binary outcome per se, but it&#8217;s fairly similar mechanism as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Gotcha. We gotta take a step back and go through Helix. Are you guys investors in Helix? What&#8217;s your deal with Helix? Why do you&#8230; I mean, I understand they&#8217;re a great company with really good tech, but what gets you going about Helix so much? I see them all over your Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh, it&#8217;s a flagship exchange application built by Injector Labs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Gotcha. Makes sense. There you go. So yeah, give me the quick TLDR on Helix and then we&#8217;ll jump into it a little more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. I think it&#8217;s just like the one of the most, vanilla in a sense or one of the most native ways to interact with the exchange module with an Injective. It has like the full-fledged exchange experience, but in reality, the entire infrastructure and backend overall, like trading experience or interaction experience is fully decentralized self-custodial and on-chain. So there&#8217;s a great amount of work trying to optimize for user experience to converge it with what they&#8217;re used to with, let&#8217;s say like Binance, Coinbase, etc., but at the same time, fully preserving, fully on-chain and decentralized nature of things. Essentially, it&#8217;s a very strong showcase of the early capabilities of Injective as a blockchain with some of the, even just basic utilization of modules built on top of Injective. So even to this day, it&#8217;s been highly popular, was a lot of volumes and stuff like that. But I think more importantly, and also inspired a lot of developers to dig further into Injective and build more exciting products than Helix within the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Helix is big for B2B, is it not? Aren&#8217;t a lot of actual exchanges trying to snag some of the tech from Helix and implement it in their own?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, so there&#8217;s obviously a lot of other exchange applications because Helix doesn&#8217;t have sovereignty over, it doesn&#8217;t have exclusivity over the liquidity and flow within its platform. So a lot of other applications can also build similar offerings, tapping into the same type of liquidity and do the same type of flow. And this is obviously a very useful tool for various exchanges and stuff like that. I think there&#8217;s also a couple of like two companies adopting the same, but I think another fairly interesting part is that there&#8217;s also a lot of institutional adoption, contributing liquidity to Helix and other exchange applications within Injective with DevOps, like institutional programs, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Totally feel that. I&#8217;d love to jump into the investing side of things. I mean, you dropped out of school, you started companies, you&#8217;ve done a whole lot at such a young age. What was it like getting investments from Mark Cuban, Jump Crypto, you know, Pantera? I mean, you guys also have a $150 million ecosystem fund, like walk me through the ins and outs of actually raising money and becoming a VC yourself. Did you ever dream of this as a kid? Did it just sort of happen? Some of those conversations that happened, you know, what are some of the best takeaways from your careers of VC as well?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think, or like the ecosystem fund, and you know, the more recent like Best of Capital. I think it&#8217;s more like, you know, never really wanted to be a VC per se, but you know, there were just like opportunity to present to itself and, you know, basically like decide to synergize like a resource. So for ecosystem fund, it&#8217;s, you know, one of the primary, you know, like drivers for recent, you know, adoption and, you know, developer interests for an Injective. And one of the things we saw prior to the ecosystem fund was that there were a lot of, you know, like institutional players and VCs, etc., that are, you know, trying to, you know, explore like potential opportunities within an Injective or, you know, like betting on, you know, like the network itself, etc., but there were just, where like that much established like discovery process or basically like opportunities in a more general sense. And by, you know, synergizing all of their kind of deal flows, effectively speaking, and, you know, bringing them all together to identify as like, oh, like it&#8217;s peak bear right now, but don&#8217;t assume that, you know, there&#8217;s no like, you know, VCs or like funds, you know, out there investing. And it&#8217;ll help you see, helps VC a lot, because it also helps them, you know, identify opportunities at scale, you know, brings all their, you know, like resources and, you know, flows together and, you know, helping each other with like due diligence, but more importantly, you know, synergizing, like the resources to back the best possible projects out there. And I think it&#8217;s a matter, you know, like a type of opportunity where like, of both my and like partners over time, just run into a lot of like angel deals, etc., and fly easier to, you know, like bring them all into one, synergize them, but like support and stuff like that. Because we realize that, you know, like we do give out like personal checks here and there, but like, you know, we oftentimes are very wary about doing so, because we end up, you know, spending a lot of time, like helping them basically, you know, helping them build their product, giving them a lot of technical advice, and sometimes you make them like a full lot of rule book, like, oh, like, you know, if you like implemented this way and this way, like you can get the product double then, like this amount of times, but like that, because, you know, we&#8217;ve been there, and we know exactly like, you know, how can we build some of the potential blockers here and there. And we just realized like, you know, it&#8217;s much easier. So like, you know, merge all the resources and coordinate them in an official way, so bring them all into one entity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Very cool. Convos Mark Cuban, what was that like? Did you speak to him at all when you guys did the race?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How was that? Cool dude?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think it was like, yeah, very interesting. He basically, you know, like you would expect someone like Mark Cuban to have, you know, limited attention towards like all of his like leads, not even saying like, you know, like his portfolio companies, but like, you know, all the potential products to reach out to him or like, you know, like helping out with like existing like a portfolio projects, you know, basically, you know, dealing with the needs of ones or like, you know, requests for support from like his portfolios, I don&#8217;t know how many hundred companies, but he&#8217;s arguably one of the most, you know, responsive, one of the most prolific and one of the most productive person we&#8217;ve ever seen because he would, you know, always almost like respond to any type of email, even our, you know, very first email ever to Mark Cuban. And, you know, actually spend a lot of time, you know, diving deep into understanding, you know, like what we&#8217;re working on and, you know, how Injective works or like, how the blockchain works or how it&#8217;s, you know, able to, you know, provide all the native primitives for all the projects. And yeah, like it&#8217;s been a pleasant, you know, working with him the entire time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s very cool. Let&#8217;s jump into the state of DeFi. This is again, DeFi has been a little wishy-washy, you know, over the last year. So we had the big boom 2020, 2021. Sort of not fall for cliff per se, but definitely volume to slow down to my knowledge, still very similar. What&#8217;s the current state of DeFi? Where does the industry stand? Where&#8217;s it going? Any future really cool use cases do you see in your summary? What is the current state of DeFi?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>I think that the current state of DeFi is heavily like utility or like merit driven. Oftentimes I would say like during like 2021 or 2022, it&#8217;s been heavily like focused around products and tools that tends to avoid the question of what is this utility behind us or like what is inherent value problem. But now if someone goes to me and tells me to explain what are the current trends within DeFi or like what are the interesting or well adopted tools out there, it&#8217;s a very much of a theoretical flow on oh like this, here&#8217;s why people need it and here&#8217;s why it makes sense to have it. And I think one of the interesting or one example of this would be like the recent trend around like liquid staking derivatives and adoptions around it and also the restaking economics. It&#8217;s a very easy, you know, like value prop and it&#8217;s a very clear and helpful to users. And you know, like that&#8217;s been like kind of like the, I would say like the consensus or like the culture, I would say around like a lot of the ecosystem projects within Injective as well. It&#8217;s like, you know, I think one of the exciting lending protocols calling up to is working on like a lending application on top of Injective and the value prop for, you know, a lending protocol is clear, but for another lending protocol, oftentimes, you know, people can&#8217;t really answer it. But, you know, thanks to, you know, a lot of the Injective native infrastructure and, you know, some of the exciting works that, you know, Neptune did, it&#8217;s very, you know, like defensible because what Neptune does is that it effectively allows for the collateralization of, you know, various types of assets, but more importantly, you know, allows abstract assets like derivatives positions, open orders, etc. And, you know, once you create like an account through a Neptune, you can essentially like collateralize or borrow open orders per positions or, you know, end to end spot assets, etc. And what that means from a user-facing perspective is that you can in fact typically build out like an entirely, like FTX, like experience or some piece or like a, you know, portfolio margining experience that everyone just knows and loves where you have much more flexible risk calculation. You have much more, you know, kind of gracious margining that&#8217;s very much sensible where, you know, if you have like a long position within like a spot asset or yourself and you cover it or you hedge it, which like our short position, typically, you know, you&#8217;d have to like very actively manage it in order to make sure your position doesn&#8217;t blow up. And more importantly, you know, it&#8217;s very expensive for you to do it because it means that you have to post enough collateral to establish your short position. But, you know, for like, you know, what would have cost like $1 ,000 worth of capital, you can easily cheat that was $100 or $200 worth of capital, which is kind of like the ethos of, you know, like a more efficient infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Touch&eacute;, I love that. Any other areas of crypto Eric that get you going, you know, doesn&#8217;t have to be DeFi or exchanges, whatever. What do you think of Friend.tech, the grayscale, SEC, Big Dub, like what else is front of mind for you right now that gets you going?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think Friend.tech is a user experience. I was absolutely, you know, astonished by it. It&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s one of the early, you know, like demonstrations of the potential behind account abstraction. So that&#8217;s always extremely exciting to me. I really love like, you know, how Friend.tech onboard users and this is probably, you know, like the start of something very exciting for the entire space. And, you know, like, it&#8217;s something that we believe in working on as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>How so with the onboarding? Do you mean with just sort of creating the scarcity aspect with the need of codes to get in the actual onboarding once you&#8217;re in the app? In what regard do you do enjoy the onboarding?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Even trade transactions with just face ID or like, you know, your Google account and stuff like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Oh, I see. So the simplicity and, you know, lack of friction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah. I think, you know, one of the biggest painplugs for crypto or blockchain for longest time for people are arguing against it was, you know, the difficulty and like onboarding saying that, you know, people are incapable of managing private keys on their own, or it&#8217;s way too painful, processes, etc. I think, like with this, it demonstrates, it&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s not going to be a problem very soon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, no, that&#8217;s true. And I want to, a couple more, and this has been a treat, Eric. I&#8217;m very grateful and appreciative of your time here. On the personal side of things, like you are a young lad who executes and does a shit ton and has a lot on his shoulders. What&#8217;s your day to day look like? Like, are you in the office five, six days a week? You putting in 16 hour shifts? Are you a faster, cold plunged sauna, like walk me through some of the non crypto, just actual human to human, P2P, Eric stuff? Like, what&#8217;s your average day look like?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I would say it&#8217;s dominated by, like, just like, spending time in office. There&#8217;s not a lot of reasons to leave the office, per se. I think, like, one interesting thing is, like, initially I was, you know, going on a diet that&#8217;s basically just one meal a day, because, you know, I realized that, like, at least for me personally, like, eating less than enough during one meal is a lot harder than, you know, just not eating at all and just, like, you know, concentrating that one very earthful meal. And I know a lot of people can&#8217;t do it, so I think it&#8217;s just what I found out that works best for me. But, like, later on, I kind of realized this is also really grateful, like, you know, longevity and health as well, where, you know, long as you have, like, a very good, like, caloric balance and nutritional balance, like, you know, eating once a day or, you know, 1.2, 1.5 a day is, you know, typically a fairly healthy experience. So that&#8217;s one of those, yeah, honestly, it&#8217;s like, especially in times like these, it&#8217;s like fairly dominated, you know, and just, like, wake up, go to office, you know, I would leave office, go to sleep.</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>So you&#8217;re grinding, you&#8217;re spending 15 hours a day at the office.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, give or take. I&#8217;ll do a little bit more, a little less, I&#8217;m not sure, but yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Nice, that&#8217;s awesome. Eric, this has been a treat, man. Before we wrap up, any hot takes? Any Eric hot takes? I mean, you gave me one little one with fasting. I mean, again, you and I are in the same yacht there. I&#8217;m, when I&#8217;m in a good, you know, good boy, Matt Holsomode, I have one-sized McMeal at around 5 p .m., 4:30 p .m. I don&#8217;t get hungry throughout the day. Maybe the stomach will growl for a little at like 12:31. And then, you know, from two to five, I feel like I&#8217;m Elon Musk with my focus. I just dial in the, you know, I&#8217;m the CEO of the dial in factory. And then after my big meal, I go for a walk, but any other hot takes, you know, health, wealth, happiness, space, AI, anything that&#8217;s getting you going or that you&#8217;re curious about or disagree with at the moment?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think like the hot take is like, you know, don&#8217;t try to like hop around friends. Basically, you know, like we&#8217;ve seen a lot of people and especially, you know, cycle after cycle, like people like these people join back in and they believe again. And this is especially applicable for a lot of, you know, like industries and, you know, specific players, etc., where like, you know, they try to be on top of the law trends, which is, you know, very encouraging, but at the same time, you know, overdoing it by, you know, trying to be the expert on like everything on your trend, which we&#8217;ve noticed. So yeah, like, you know, just keep our work on it. Whatever trend that it may be, no matter how quiet or like, you know, unattractive it is right now because, you know, given like the, you know, fluctuations of various narrative and trends, like there&#8217;s almost like a, you know, very strong probabilistic guarantee that whatever you&#8217;re working on is going to, you know, be a narrative over, you know, within like keep grinding.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Eric, you crushed this man. Appreciate you coming on. Before you go, please let our listeners know where they can find you and Injective Labs online and on socials.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, I think Twitter is the best place to start. You know, for me, it&#8217;s at @ericinjective. And for Injective, you know, the website is best place, which is injective.com.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>And the other, while I have Eric&#8217;s Twitter in front of me, at @VesselVC, @InjectiveLabs, like he said, and at Helix app, hit up his Twitter. It&#8217;s absolute fire. Check it out. And of course, hit up the Injective website as well. Eric, appreciate you coming on, man. I would love to have you in for round two. And next time I&#8217;m in Manhattan, I&#8217;ll be hitting you up. Maybe I&#8217;ll pull you out of the office for a nice dinner. That&#8217;d be a treat.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Chen</strong>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, appreciate it. Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong>&nbsp;<br>Folks, what an incredible episode with Eric Chen from Injective Labs, CEO and janitor of Injective as he likes to call himself. He was dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center. Huge episode, learned a ton, got some homework to do. We&#8217;d love to see that. If you guys enjoyed this one, and I hope you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I. Speaking of the team, love you guys. Thank you so much for everything.
