										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/112252/271396/adobestock-weerasak-1.jpeg" srcset="" width="" class="content-img" alt=""><figcaption>Source: AdobeStock / weerasak</figcaption></figure><p><i>Ron Stoner is the Head of Security at US-based crypto security specialist </i><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/casa/"><i><strong>Casa</strong></i></a><i>.</i><br>__________&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Operational <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/security/">security</a>, or OPSEC, is the process of performing risk management by defining what information you are trying to secure, what is required to achieve that goal, and then taking the practical steps required.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The philosophy behind OPSEC primarily focuses on thinking like your attacker, understanding who that attacker may be, and what steps they may take to exploit you.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Performing good OPSEC is especially essential for cryptocurrency key-signing devices, such as hardware <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/wallet/">wallets</a>. Hardware wallets are considered &ldquo;cold wallets&rdquo; because they have no direct internet functionality and must be attached to another device, such as a smartphone or PC, to bridge to the internet and perform a transaction.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">These hardware devices and the bridge they connect via are the most crucial points of failure when performing cryptocurrency transactions.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">With 2022 becoming the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-hacks-stole-record-38-billion-2022-led-by-north-korea-groups-report-2023-02-01/">worst year on record</a> for cryptocurrency hacks, with $3.8 billion stolen, OPSEC has never been more critical. As the digital asset space becomes more mainstream, attackers seek new ways to exploit users and platforms.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While the stakes and risk profile for every entity using digital assets will vary, all users should obey best practices for protecting their value.</p><h2>Securing The Signing Environment</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Before signing transactions, look at your environment to identify <i>anything</i> that could serve as an attack vector.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Assuming you are in an otherwise private setting, such as your home, this includes things like cameras or microphones, which are present on almost all modern laptops and mobile devices.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Don&rsquo;t forget about various Internet of Things (IoT) products such as smart TVs, Alexa, etc. Any of these can be potentially used to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazons-alexa-never-stops-listening-to-you/">spy on you</a> while you perform a transaction.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As such, it&#8217;s essential to &ldquo;clean&rdquo; your working space of anything that could be potentially tapped into &mdash; powering down or even removing these devices from the area of operation altogether.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">While this may come across as a little paranoid, if large, critical amounts of money are on the line, it is one important aspect of protecting you from attackers.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Signing transactions from any public space, such as an office, library, or cafe, is generally not recommended, but you may sometimes have no other alternative. If this is the case, several steps can be taken to maximize security.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Once again, you&rsquo;ll want to account for any security cameras in the area. These days, CCTV, especially HD and 4K resolution cameras, can easily read what is displayed on a computer or mobile phone screen within the field of view.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Of course &mdash; and hopefully, this goes without saying &mdash; there shouldn&rsquo;t be any other people in direct proximity. It is best to find the most secluded space possible, an empty workroom, for example.</p><h2>Update All Involved Devices</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps most importantly, you&rsquo;ll want to update all software and firmware on any devices involved in the signing process.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If you aren&rsquo;t using a computer or mobile device directly, then your hardware wallet will need to connect to one to transmit a transaction.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Theoretically, hardware wallets are designed so that it shouldn&rsquo;t matter if the unit they connect to is compromised. All processes happen on the wallet itself; PCs or smartphones are only used to broadcast the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">However, some forms of malware can alter various aspects of a transaction, including the amount and the recipient address. Even the change address &mdash; an address where the change from a transaction goes after the chosen amount has been sent to the recipient &mdash; can be manipulated, a field that is easy to overlook.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If you are using a phone or computer, you will want to update your operating system with the latest security patch. Your wallet&#8217;s firmware, too, should be regulatory updated.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Though unless the update involves a specific urgent security threat, it is often better to wait a few days after a new release to upgrade. This is because it&rsquo;s common for there to be bugs present in the latest patches, which tend to be resolved quickly but can cause headaches. For this reason, giving non-critical updates a bit of room to be tested is a good idea.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">One last thing to remember is to continually update all software and firmware only from official sources, like a website or repository.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Try to learn to use tools like <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GPG</a> to check the file signatures against the officially documented ones to confirm all data matches what is supposed to be there.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Never trust any links, even those coming from within a given piece of software itself, as there are far too many ways they can be used as a means of attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As an example, the popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> wallet <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/electrum/"><strong>Electrum</strong></a> suffered an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/electrum-wallet-phishing-attackers-steal-usd-22m-in-bitcoin-7980.htm">attack</a> in 2020 that allowed malicious actors to push a message to all users through the app itself, claiming the need for an update with a link provided.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As it turned out, the link was a phishing attack that installed a corrupt version of Electrum on the victim&rsquo;s machine. This gave the attackers full control of the wallets of those who installed the malicious software, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds.</p><h2>Easily Overlooked OPSEC Procedures</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">One of the most obvious attack vectors to address is human error. Even if you think you have good security, humans tend to develop a false sense of security when nothing goes wrong, leading to lax practices.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The worst failures happen when you let your guard down. Never rush a signing event; ensure you have plenty of uninterrupted time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Hurrying or being distracted are great ways to overlook something like double-checking your transaction data before confirming a signature.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">While we&rsquo;ve mentioned several lines of defense, the latter should never be taken for granted. Double and triple-check the amounts and addresses involved in any transaction because it could save you from making a major mistake.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Also, be extremely wary of using public charging stations or even unknown, third-party USB cables. There are seemingly innocuous USB cables <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90413945/theres-a-scary-new-reason-not-to-borrow-a-strangers-iphone-cable">circulating</a> with tiny chips inside the head that can intercept and inject data &mdash; hijacking a cryptocurrency transaction and wreaking havoc.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Combined with some issues around compatibility and device wear, it is always best to use the USB cables that are packaged with any external signing device.</p><h2>Health Checks Can Provide Quick Confidence In Your Keys</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Lastly, there&rsquo;s a technique that some signing devices offer that can be invaluable in boosting security. Known as a &ldquo;<a href="https://support.keys.casa/hc/en-us/articles/360045442511-Health-checks-in-the-Casa-app">health check</a>,&rdquo; this technique provides an easy way to verify that your keys are available for signing transactions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If you were to run a health check on a mobile phone, the check would first confirm that your key is available locally and that the device is working correctly. It will also ensure that the same valid key is backed up securely on the cloud.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This can all be automated with a simple click, and the user will be alerted if anything is wrong.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The same basic steps apply for hardware wallets, but the external device will need to be connected to a computer or mobile phone. Health checks can be done for multiple keys on multi-signature wallets as well.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Importantly, If these keys are stored across different devices, the health check should be run on every relevant unit.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While the world of OPSEC is complex and ever-changing, securing the environment, keeping all devices updated, and ensuring they&rsquo;ve accounted for easily overlooked issues, are essential steps to staying ahead of attackers.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">By combining these strategies with regular health checks every six months, users can significantly improve the security that protects their cryptocurrency funds.</p><p>____</p><h3>Learn more:&nbsp;</h3><p>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-trezor-and-the-sandbox-issue-security-warnings-cronos-launches-a-new-dex-three-japanese-banks-set-to-test-stablecoins-on-japan-open-chain.htm">Trezor Issues a Security Warning</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/popular-hardware-wallet-was-hacked-by-cybersecurity-firm-should-you-concerned.htm">This Popular Hardware Wallet was Hacked by a Cybersecurity Firm &ndash;&nbsp;Should You Be Concerned?</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-crypto-hackers-fraudsters-stole-162-billion-in-q4-alone-silvergate-cuts-40-of-workforce-us-sec-brings-charges-in-coindeal-investment-scheme.htm">Crypto Hackers &amp; Fraudsters Stole $1.62 Billion in Q4 Alone</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-lost-nearly-4-billion-to-fraudsters-last-year-will-things-improve-in-2023.htm">Web3 Lost Nearly $4 Billion To Fraudsters Last Year &#8211; Will Things Improve in 2023</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-scammer-gets-away-with-12m-arb-tokens-through-address-poisoning-attack-heres-what-happened.htm">Crypto Scammer Gets Away with $1.2M in ARB Tokens Through &#8216;Address Poisoning&#8217; Attack &ndash; Here&#8217;s What Happened</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-wallet-maker-ledger-raises-109-million-latest-funding-round-bull-market-back.htm">Crypto Wallet Maker Ledger Raises $109 Million in Latest Funding Round &ndash; Is the Bull Market Back?</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metamask-introduces-more-payment-options-for-buying-cryptocurrencies-crypto-adoption-rise.htm">MetaMask Introduces More Payment Options for Buying Cryptocurrencies &ndash; Crypto Adoption on the Rise?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/apple-approves-decentralized-exchange-uniswap-ios-wallet-app-heres-how-it-works.htm">Apple Approves Decentralized Exchange Uniswap iOS Wallet App &ndash; Here&#8217;s How it Works</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm">How to Choose a Bitcoin Wallet?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/3-ways-to-set-up-an-ethereum-wallet.htm">3 Ways to Set Up an Ethereum Wallet</a></p>

Enter utility NFTs.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Designed to provide tangible utility to holders by way of rewards and other perks, utility NFTs may, in fact, be the key to the widespread adoption of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">Web3</a>. By offering real-world benefits, this may convince non-crypto natives to test the waters of Web3.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Below are six use cases of NFTs, all of which illustrate how utility NFTs can benefit holders while at the same time, insulating the space against future hype cycles to create a stronger Web3 and drive greater mainstream use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">1. NFT Memberships</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Imagine the exclusivity of <strong>Soho House</strong>, but instead of memberships by way of referrals and direct debits, people are granted access by purchasing a Soho House NFT.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Companies such as <a href="https://cnaluxury.channelnewsasia.com/people/what-does-mandala-clubs-new-s15000-nft-membership-get-you-213236"><strong>Mandala Club</strong></a> have already begun to leverage the potential of NFT memberships, selling at price tags as high as S$15,000. Benefits offered through NFT memberships include access to exclusive newsletters, Discord channels, interviews, and events.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Not only do NFT memberships provide a streamlined means to verify members, but they also allow for peer-to-peer sales and trading enabling the value of a given membership to appreciate with demand through secondary trading and sales.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Examples in the cryptosphere include the <a href="https://crypto.com/nft/collection/82421cf8e15df0edcaa200af752a344f?tab=items"><strong>Loaded Lions</strong></a> and <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club</strong> (<a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/">BAYC</a>) memberships. The Loaded Lions offers members VIP experiences, giveaways, and priority access to selected <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cryptocom/"><strong>Crypto.com</strong></a> NFT drops.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The BAYC membership, on the other hand, offers owners access to member-only areas, real-world events, and special merchandise. Just as event organizers would now turn to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/"><strong>Eventbrite</strong></a> for ticket sales, NFTs can be used as a conduit for membership sales, acting as a means to onboard more mainstream users to Web3.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">2. Driving Phygital Experiences</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Alongside virtual asset ownership, the concept coined &lsquo;phygital&rsquo; ties physical goods and services into the digital world by way of NFT sales. This may take place when a buyer receives a physical item through the purchase of an NFT.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond merely digital art, NFTs are being used as a medium for <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-first-nft-home-just-sold-for-175000/437522">real-world real estate sales</a>.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Another iteration of &lsquo;phygital&rsquo; takes place when the purchase of a certain item offers buyers a digital version in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/metaverse/">metaverse</a>. <strong>Adidas</strong>&rsquo; <a href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/metaverse">Into the Metaverse</a> collection demonstrates how this can be brought to life in real time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">With an <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1241219/adidas-sports-and-outdoor-online-shops-brand-profile-in-the-united-states#:~:text=How%20loyal%20are%20the%20customers,show%20loyalty%20to%20the%20brand.">84% loyalty rate</a> among US customers, companies like Adidas can leverage their influence to entice customers into Web3 through phygital NFT offerings.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">3. Metaverse Branding</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Hand in hand with the allure of phygital NFT offerings, NFTs in the metaverse enable companies to corner a new addressable market on the frontier of branding and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/advertising/">advertising</a>.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">With increasing recognition and momentum, the metaverse offers companies a world of new real estate to consider for marketing efforts.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Major brands such as <a href="https://www.swoosh.nike/"><strong>Nike</strong></a> and <a href="https://vault.gucci.com/en-GB/story/metaverse"><strong>Gucci</strong></a> have dropped NFT collections for owners to claim digital editions of their products. As a result, users are able to wear their favorite brands in the metaverse through new forms of digital expression enabled by augmented and virtual reality.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In turn, loyal customers may find themselves more likely to onboard into Web3, with a metaverse full of brands that they already know and trust.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">4. NFTs in Gaming</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">NFTs enable <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/gaming/">gamers</a> to buy assets and features within <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain</a> games, effectively allowing them to buy into communities they are passionate about.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">In contrast to traditional in-game purchases, NFTs allow assets to be ported from one game to another and controlled by the owner rather than the game.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This extends the lifespan and value of in-game assets, handing the power back to players. The autonomy granted by NFT asset ownership offers an incentive for traditional gamers to transition to blockchain gaming, providing a means to onboard an additional user pool into Web3.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">5. NFTs to Rewire DeFi</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Similar to the unique benefits that NFTs can offer holders in a membership setting, the unique non-fungible nature of NFTs can provide holder-specific positions and benefits within the decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) landscape.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">At present, DeFi users often face periods of illiquidity when staking cryptocurrency to earn rewards. NFTs, however, offer an easily-tradable alternative, removing issues of illiquidity when users would otherwise have to lock up protocol tokens for fixed periods of time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, DeFi protocols can also add gamification elements, offering users benefits such as NFT staking boosters, exclusive allowlist access, and fee rebates to name a few. <strong>VVSGotchi</strong> does this by offering tangible utility to its VVS Miner Mole NFT collection through experience points which can be used to earn higher rewards on staked NFTs.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">DeFi protocols can also define the scarcity of their NFTs, allowing the value to match the demand.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The given examples illustrate how NFTs can further enrich the DeFi ecosystem with added functionality while reducing the risk of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/volatility/">volatility</a>. In doing so, NFTs will help build a more robust DeFi landscape, creating a greater appeal for new and existing users alike.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">6. Gamification of Health and Social Media</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Through the use of NFTs, the gamification of traditional industries hands the power back to the users through greater data ownership and monetization opportunities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, one can mint their <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/nfts-an-health-data/">health history into an NFT</a> and sell it to third parties interested in the data. Alongside, health-oriented feature-to-earn projects are already entering the fray, such as <a href="https://stepn.com/"><strong>Stepn</strong></a>, which allows users to earn rewards for the steps they have taken.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">With royalties automatically accrued to the creator, the use of NFTs in conjunction with the wellness industry offers users innovative new revenue streams.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">While <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/social-media/">social media</a> giants such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/instagram/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a> are working to provide users with NFT offerings, launching features to allow users to mint and sell on existing platforms, a new generation of decentralized social media has entered the mix.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">New projects such as <a href="https://www.deso.com/"><strong>DeSo</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.lens.xyz/"><strong>Lens Protocol</strong></a> are poised to offer users a fully Web3-native social media experience with features such as creator coins, micro tipping, and gas-free NFT minting.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The unique revenue streams offered by the gamification of both health and social media through NFTs offer users the means to monetize things they are already doing for free.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The result? Two vast addressable user bases able to champion the use of NFTs into the mainstream.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">NFTs: Catalyzing the Mainstream Adoption of Web3 with Utility</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Rather than having to rely on status value or quick trades, NFTs will be able to add a more meaningful, long-term value proposition for countless industries worldwide.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">By thinking in terms of the functions that the underlying technology offers, everyday users can reap the benefits offered by NFTs without concern for market volatility or the price fluctuations of specific assets.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">In doing so, NFTs will act as the catalyst to propel the mainstream <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">adoption</a> of Web3 by supporting, streamlining, and strengthening existing verticals rather than dismantling and rewiring them altogether.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">____</p><h3>Learn more:</h3><p>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/luxury-brand-gucci-collaborates-with-bored-ape-creator-yuga-labs-for-metaverse-project-crypto-adoption-rise.htm">Luxury Brand Gucci Collaborates with Bored Ape Creator Yuga Labs for Metaverse Project &ndash;&nbsp;Crypto Adoption on the Rise?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/exclusive-interview-tether-co-founder-says-crypto-industry-will-bounce-back-despite-past-failures-heres-why.htm">Exclusive Interview: Tether Co-Founder Says Crypto Industry Will Bounce Back Despite Past Failures &#8211; Here&rsquo;s Why</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-crypto-startup-enables-users-send-nfts-using-phone-numbers-is-future-of-nfts.htm">New Crypto Startup Enables Users to Send NFTs Using Phone Numbers &ndash;&nbsp;Is This The Future of NFTs?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spotifys-latest-experiment-playlists-unlocked-by-nft-holders-the-future-of-music-streaming.htm">Spotify&#8217;s Latest Experiment: Playlists Unlocked by NFT Holders &ndash; The Future of Music Streaming?</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indian-advertising-watchdog-releases-new-guidelines-for-crypto-ads.htm">Indian Advertising Watchdog Releases New Guidelines For Crypto Ads</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-ad-regulator-sends-enforcement-notice-crypto-promoters.htm">UK Ad Regulator Sends &#8216;Enforcement Notice&#8217; to Crypto Promoters</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gaming-giant-sony-files-patent-enable-nft-transferability-across-games-consoles.htm">Gaming Giant Sony Files Patent to Enable NFT Transferability Across Games and Consoles</a><br>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/amazon-enter-crypto-nft-market-with-gaming-initiative-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">Amazon to Enter the Crypto NFT Market with Gaming Initiative &ndash; Here&rsquo;s What You Need to Know</a><br><br>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/a-beginner-s-guide-to-nfts-what-you-should-know.htm">A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to NFTs: What You Should Know</a><br>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-nft-marketplaces.htm">Top 10 NFT Marketplaces</a></p>

And while our revenue model heavily relies on incentivizing people to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/staking/">stake</a> their crypto, seeing that some of them don&rsquo;t really understand what staking is has always been quite disheartening for me.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Failing to comprehend what you&rsquo;re doing inevitably leads to trouble. And in this case, it might be trouble for the entire community.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Being responsible is one of the core requirements for any validator on any proof-of-stake (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-stake/">PoS</a>) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain</a>. It&rsquo;s absolutely fair and reasonable. Otherwise, those blockchains would stop working quite soon.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">But what we often tend to ignore is that the community has its own share of responsibility, too. In this piece, I&rsquo;ll explain what it&rsquo;s all about.</p><h2>Start with the Basics</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">For starters, sometimes we need to explain how a PoS-based economy is different from a proof-of-work (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-work/">PoW</a>) one.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">PoW blockchains depend on the computational power of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/mining/">miners</a>. The more powerful your equipment, the more likely you are to mine a new block and get new coins as a reward. In this case, the coins represent nothing but value imposed on them by the community.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In PoS blockchains and their variations like DPoS, a coin represents more than just value: it&rsquo;s also a governance right. Put simply, owning a coin on a PoS blockchain grants you the right to influence its further development and progress through voting.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">But quite often, you don&rsquo;t have enough funds (and coins) to run and maintain your own node, which would allow you to make decisions affecting the entire network. That&rsquo;s where validators come into play.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Running your own node is quite an expensive endeavor. Not only do you need the equipment, but you also need to service it 24/7, which requires some profound DevOps expertise. It&rsquo;s simply cheaper and less troublesome to have someone else do that for a fee that is incomparably lower than your own potential expenses on running a node.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A validator is very much like your representative in a parliament. While you may wield the source of power in your country as its citizen, you actually have only a fraction thereof, much like most of your compatriots. Instead, you delegate your governance rights to someone you trust. That&rsquo;s the gist of representative democracy. And also, that&rsquo;s the gist of PoS blockchains.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">We don&rsquo;t need to go very far to see what happens when people delegate their power to delinquents. Just like an incompetent government might rule their country into oblivion, irresponsible validators could put a blockchain on the brink of extinction solely by failing to do their job right.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This very fact alone means that the community must feel responsible for the fate of the blockchain whose tokens they hold. This directly impacts the profitability of their purchase, at the very least.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">But instead, we often see that the only thing people are interested in is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). Moreover, the typical way of thought suggests that the higher the APR is, the better for the delegator. And, believe it or not, it is just as big a problem.</p><h2>How High APR Can Be Evil</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">While the crypto economy is often hailed as superior to the fiat one, it primarily concerns the technological aspect, leaving behind the fact that they&rsquo;re not so very different from the economic standpoint.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When the US Federal Reserve System (FRS) starts printing new dollars, it&rsquo;s pretty apparent to everyone that a surge of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/inflation/">inflation</a> is afoot. But when you get your staking rewards, you actually do the same: you validate transactions of existing coins and, for doing so, get similar coins out of thin air. It is the very same inflation model that we see in the fiat economy. For good or for bad, it&rsquo;s just how things work in our world in this day and age.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">APR, the most popular metric for most people who weigh on whether they should start staking, is, in fact, the inflation rate of the blockchain in question.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">And inflation means that the asset&rsquo;s value is gradually diluted, and so is the user&rsquo;s share in the blockchain&rsquo;s governance. The core problem here, however, is that people tend to disagree on what this value actually means.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To many people, I have to admit, the value is measured in the exchange rate of the coin to USD. This kind of user is mainly after the quick buck, and they don&rsquo;t give much thought to what sort of blockchain they&rsquo;re investing in by staking their coins.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The real value of a coin, however, is in the power it grants its holder to influence the direction the blockchain takes and, therefore, its success. The more successful a blockchain is, the higher its tokens are valued in USD. So, in a way, ignoring this aspect actually harms their plans to make money.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The same logic suggests that there are better ideas than seeking blockchains with higher APRs. An APR of 20% means that the inflation rate is through the roof. You would start panicking about your well-being if it were US dollars, pounds, or euros. Why are you happy when it&rsquo;s crypto? It&rsquo;s just as bad for you.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">When a PoS blockchain has an APR of 20%, it means that its model is flawed and seeks to attract more users rather than create a sustainable model. It becomes apparent later when it turns out that their customer base growth seriously lags behind the APR, leading to accelerated value dilution and, eventually, to the devaluing of the blockchain itself. I can compare it to a country whose currency becomes a bunch of worthless paper due to unreasonable economic policy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, some blockchains don&rsquo;t even need staking for their functioning, and they add it artificially to attract more users. Just take a moment and think about it: if a blockchain doesn&rsquo;t need staking to produce new coins, it might be just a machine for creating coins without any intrinsic value.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This evokes particular words in my mind. One of them starts with a &ldquo;P&rdquo; and ends with an &ldquo;onzi.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">But even if staking is required for a blockchain&rsquo;s effective functioning, people should still look out for its operation&#8217;s fundamentals. A healthy model often sees the yearly growth of the customer base overtaking the inflation rate (or APR, if you like). This makes the system more balanced and more likely to survive. Caring about things like that is what makes a delegator just as responsible as a validator.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">That said, not all validators are equally responsible. But even among the most irresponsible ones, nothing and no one can compare to cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><h2>Exchanges Can Ruin Everything</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">At the dawn of PoS blockchains, the most common question in the community was: are those &ldquo;validators&rdquo;&nbsp; trustworthy? Can&rsquo;t they collude to overtake the blockchain?</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In my practice, it&rsquo;s a rare stroke of luck if you happen to agree with many people on where to go for lunch, let alone conspire to hijack a complex distributed ecosystem. All validators have their skin in the game, and that&rsquo;s exactly how the ecosystem ensures that none of them would do things to harm it intentionally. And, to my knowledge, no validator has ever done that.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">That&rsquo;s not the case for exchanges. Unlike validators, they don&rsquo;t have any skin in the game.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">They&rsquo;re more like an institutionalized version of those irresponsible users who just want to get rich quickly and don&rsquo;t care about long-term ramifications. Exchanges pursue their own interests, and providing staking opportunities is just one more revenue stream for them. Unsurprisingly, they treat it as such.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">While holding immense user assets in custody, they effectively control them and prevent users from exercising their voting rights through a representative. An exchange can vote if it pleases. Or it can ignore all voting altogether.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">They can just neglect their nodes for days, as we saw in the case of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/kraken/"><strong>Kraken</strong></a> last year. In theory, an exchange can destroy a blockchain by voting or not voting on behalf of many people who would have wanted otherwise. In the real world, we call it usurpation. In the crypto world, we often act as if it&rsquo;s just the way things must be.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The instances of Kraken or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/ftx/"><strong>FTX</strong></a> prove beyond the shadow of the doubt that exchanges cannot be trusted with holding your assets, let alone staking them on your behalf. And if an exchange faces problems with regulators, liquidity, or literally anything, the last thing it would care about is user interests. And it&rsquo;s the users who will pay for the exchange&rsquo;s screw-ups.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">If I were to sum up everything I said, it would be this simple thought: greed is bad.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">You can track down every problem that I mentioned here to human avarice. It may be the avarice of someone who doesn&rsquo;t care about the future value of their holdings and seeks only to make a quick buck. It may be the avarice of an exchange that puts its own interests ahead of those of blockchains.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We must truly understand the true nature of staking, with its pros and cons, if we want this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">Web3</a> concept to move forward and bring about a better world. If we don&rsquo;t, human greed will corrupt our best efforts.</p><p>____</p><h3>Learn more:&nbsp;</h3><p>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-core-developers-announce-date-for-long-awaited-shapella-upgrade-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Ethereum Core Developers Announce Date for Long-Awaited Shapella Upgrade &ndash; Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-regulator-probing-crypto-staking-services.htm">South Korean Regulator Is Probing Crypto Staking Services</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/our-company-survived-crypto-winter-will-do-it-again-heres-our-survival-guide-for-crypto-businesses.htm">Our Company Survived a Crypto Winter and Will Do It Again: Here&rsquo;s Our Survival Guide for Crypto Businesses</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/one-misconception-and-severe-design-flaw-of-the-ethereum-merge.htm">One Misconception and Severe Design Flaw of the Ethereum Merge</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm">What is Proof-of-Stake?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-stake-eth-for-ethereum-2-0.htm">How to Stake ETH for Ethereum 2.0?</a></p>

The author would like to thank Aki Corsoni-Husain and Maggie Kwok for working together on this piece.</i><br>__________</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The British Virgin Islands (BVI)&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.harneys.com/insights/bvi-virtual-asset-service-providers-act-a-practical-guide/">Virtual Asset Service Providers Act 2022</a> (the VASPA) came into force on 1 February 2023. Any person who is conducting virtual asset service (VAS) business prior to the VASPA coming into force should be looking to be registered with the <strong>BVI Financial Services Commission</strong> (the BVI FSC) within the 6-month transitional window which expires on 31 July 2023.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All applicants should try their best to submit a full and complete VAS application to the BVI FSC within the transitional timeframe. Incomplete VAS applications run the risk of not being processed by the BVI FSC.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is important that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/regulation/">regulatory</a> advice be taken by persons who are conducting VAS business to ensure that the VAS regime is applicable to them. Once it is determined that a person is a virtual asset service provider (VASP), it is important to start working on the registration application to be filed with the BVI FSC. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Applicants for registration under the VAS regime would need to consider:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (a) <strong>Governance issues</strong>: of always having 2 individual directors, there may be a requirement for a local resident director to be appointed and also having in place a VASPA approved authorised representative based in the BVI who will have to possess sufficient knowledge of the applicant&rsquo;s VAS related business as well as an auditor;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) <strong>Ownership structure</strong>: full information on the ultimate beneficial ownership structure of the VASP including all intermediary structures (if any) will need to be disclosed &ndash; complex structures may lead to delays;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (c) <strong>Business plans</strong>: detailed business plans will need to be submitted taking into account matters related to corporate governance, capital reserves, technological audits, liquidity, risk management strategies, consumer protection provisions, related parties and public disclosures, custody and safe-guarding, escrow and lock up provisions, interoperability, cessation of business and succession planning, implementation of the travel rule;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (d) <strong>Policies and procedures</strong>: an applicant will need to have robust internal controls including, risk assessment frameworks, AML/CFT/CPF and sanctions compliance procedures, outsourcing agreements and policies, data protection and cybersecurity framework, statement of technological infrastructures, business continuity plans, custody and safe-keeping of assets framework, complaints handling procedures, technology audits framework and suitable insurance requirements;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(e) <strong>AML/CFT/CPF requirements</strong>: a VASPA will be considered a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; doing &ldquo;relevant business&rdquo; under the AML/CFT/CPF legislation, as such, a VASPA will need to ensure that as a part of the AML/CFT/CPF regime that it is identifying procedures in relation to new and continuing business relationships, establishing and maintaining verification procedures, where there is reliance on third parties that there is the appropriate channels to obtain the identification documents from those third parties as a means of recording the identity of customers, maintaining records and underlying documents, appointing the necessary compliance and money laundering reporting officers, conducting annual training etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is imperative that all VASPs, once registered under the VASPA, ensures that they comply with all of the on-going regulatory requirements that apply to the VAS regime, e.g.:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) remaining <strong>fit and proper</strong>, as such, fulfilling the BVI FSC&rsquo;s assessment that all VASPs are competent and that they conduct their business in line with the regulatory principles in the Regulatory Code 2009;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) <strong>notification / pre-approval requirements</strong>: for example, change of information provided, change of name, maintaining financially sound condition, appointment of directors, appointment of authorised representative and auditor, submission of audited financial statements, maintenance of records, disposition or acquisition of significant or controlling interest in a VASP, client assets, AML/CFT/CPF and sanctions compliance;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (c) <strong>screening of employees</strong><i><strong>: </strong></i>assessing the competence and probity of employees;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(d) maintaining <strong>adequate human and technological resources</strong> and policies, procedures and mechanisms to ensure compliance; and</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (e) considering and adapting resources and procedures to any <strong>changes in scope of business</strong> and legislative development.&nbsp;<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Failure to comply with the requirements under the VASPA or the AML/CFT/CPF regime can lead to various criminal offences which carry both monetary penalties and custodial sentences. The BVI FSC would also have at its disposal the administrative penalty regime for any administrative breach by a VASP. These would be the mechanisms that the BVI FSC can use as a part of any enforcement action to be taken.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As with any new legislative regime, it is important that existing VASPs and potential VASPs work closely with their service providers to understand the regime created by the VASPA and its subsidiary legislation and guidance to ensure that the VASP is ensuring full regulatory compliance with the VAS framework.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">____</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">Learn more:</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fatf-preparing-regulation-for-p2p-crypto-trading-platforms-8319.htm">FATF Preparing Regulation for P2P Crypto Trading Platforms</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-the-new-fatf-rules-will-open-up-crypto-to-a-layer-of-mid-4546.htm">How the New FATF Rules Will Open up Crypto to a Layer of Middlemen</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-regulation-is-key-to-crypto-industry.htm">Why Regulation Is Key to Crypto Industry</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-supreme-court-takes-landmark-crypto-case-with-coinbase-lawsuits-today-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">US Supreme Court Takes on Landmark Crypto Case with Coinbase Lawsuits Today &ndash;&nbsp;Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know</a>&nbsp;<br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/exclusive-interview-tether-co-founder-says-crypto-industry-will-bounce-back-despite-past-failures-heres-why.htm">Exclusive Interview: Tether Co-Founder Says Crypto Industry Will Bounce Back Despite Past Failures &#8211; Here&rsquo;s Why</a>&nbsp;<br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/is-it-safe-to-use-bitcoin.htm">Is It Safe To Use Bitcoin?</a></p>

The Bitcoin currency network, backed by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain</a> technology, empowers the unbanked and the banked alike by freeing them from central banking and unstable national currencies. In 2013, Bitcoin had grown in prominence as Argentina struggled with hyperinflation brought about by financial policies and complex government politics. It was clear to my brother and me that Bitcoin had the potential to alleviate many of the monetary issues holding back developing economies around <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/latin-america/">Latin America</a> and the globe.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Experience proved to me that economic development was only possible when people could trust their monetary system and the rule of law.&nbsp;It was clear that Bitcoin as a currency and monetary network, which was beyond the reach of challenging politics, could accelerate developing economies.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">No other group stood to benefit more from access to the Bitcoin global monetary system than the unbanked, who make up a significant percentage of people in Latin America.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The only question was how best to implement a technology that in 2013 was still so new and experimental.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The primary goal of this technology was to reduce the costs and burdens imposed by legacy systems that control and oversee the remittance payments of the world&#8217;s underdeveloped economies. Bitcoin technology had the potential to move money seamlessly, increasing economic growth in every country that would adopt it and build on top of it.&nbsp;By having the technological prowess to replace the current outdated legacy financial network known as <strong>SWIFT</strong>, our nations would save the people of Latin America millions every year by enabling stable remittance <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/payments/">payments</a> and real-time currency exchanges. Remittance companies in Latin America that were subject to hyperinflated currencies, outdated political systems, and high costs were ripe for disruption.</p><h2>US blockchain Research and Development &#8211; The North and South of the Americas</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">I returned to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/usa/">US</a>, New York and Connecticut, to continue my research in blockchain technology in 2016 and was able to be part of various blockchain <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/smart-contract/">smart contract</a> pilot projects specializing in decentralized finance, real estate, medical, and government applications. My team and I were able to research and develop various blockchain use cases and practical applications for real-world problems. Much of this research was published as part of a Blockchain education book, titled &ldquo;Blockchain for Accounting and Business&rdquo;, written by Saurav Dutta and distributed globally to academic and financial institutions. In 2018, the opportunity arose in Miami to create a Bitcoin center which later evolved into <strong>The Blockchain Center</strong>. The Blockchain Center is a non-profit organization developed to facilitate the mainstream <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/adoption/">adoption</a> of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology through political, financial, and media impact projects at national and international levels. The Bitcoin center was founded in 2014 by Bitcoin pioneer Nick Spanos under the name &ldquo;The Bitcoin Center&rdquo;, and was featured in the <strong>Netflix</strong> documentary &ldquo;Banking on Bitcoin&rdquo;.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;The Blockchain Center Miami was created in order to form an economic and innovation hub in downtown Miami, attracting blockchain and tech companies from New York, San Francisco, and worldwide. We&rsquo;ve had great support from the local city office since the beginning&nbsp; and to this day they have been a strong&nbsp; advocate of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.&rdquo; &#8211; Nick Spanos</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The initial goal was for the city of&nbsp; Miami to become the &ldquo;Silicon Valley of Latin America&rdquo; to increase economic growth, talent development, and innovation. &nbsp;As the city continues to push cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies in its agenda, Miami is poised to become the most disruptive city when it comes to decentralized government blockchain applications such as voting and public asset management via smart contracts. Miami is the center for Latin America&rsquo;s imports &amp; exports, cellular/satellite communications, and, most importantly, Latin American financial institutions that hold a majority of the continent&#8217;s wealth.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This positions Miami as the perfect neutral zone for all the countries in Latin America and the starting point for a Latin American union.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">From experiencing firsthand the growth of blockchain technology supporters, it became clear that Latin Americans believe in a union that would turn our developing countries into flourishing ones.&nbsp;This can be done by uniting and leapfrogging over inefficient systems of government and money.</p><h2>A more united Latin America</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">To better understand the current situation of Latin American continental progress, there are currently three organizations that have been developed to create a more united Latin America, the <strong>Alianza del Pacifico</strong>, <strong>Mercado Comun del Sur</strong> (Mercosur), and <strong>Mercados Integrados Latino Americanos </strong>(MILA). These organizations were designed to converge Latam countries to provide economic prosperity by enacting financial and monetary policies but are divided due to foreign interests related to the US, China, and Russia. The west of Latam is supported by Alianza del Pacifico, while the east is supported by Mercosur. MILA is an organization created to integrate the financial markets of Latin American countries. Currently, there are four countries signed up: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/peru/">Peru</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/colombia/">Colombia</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/chile/">Chile</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/mexico/">Mexico</a>. The integration aims to strengthen capital markets to increase investor confidence in the supply of securities, and issuers, and increase larger sources of funding.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The first milestone of the initiative is implementing a new organization where all Latin American countries accept and promote economic growth and innovation using decentralized financial infrastructures and blockchain technologies, as well as strong public and private partnerships for the overall goal of a strong united Latin America.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253495/pic-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253495/responsive-images/pic-1___media_library_original_451_254.jpg 451w, https://cimg.co/news/102855/253495/responsive-images/pic-1___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="451" class="content-img"></figure><h2>In order to build the future, we must understand the past</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">In the 1920s, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/germany/">German</a> government, under the Weimar Republic, was experiencing hyperinflation following World War I. The country desperately needed to rebuild its economy but lacked the necessary gold reserves. To overcome this challenge the Weimar Republic developed a new type of currency known as the &ldquo;Rentenmark&rdquo;, which was redeemable for bonds of land and industrial plants in order to stabilize the currency and bring back the confidence of foreign investors. The Weimar Republic also introduced new fiscal measures to insure the Rentenmarks stability. Credit was not offered to the German industry to prevent widespread speculation through leverage and subsequent inflation. With the currency in short supply, banknotes that were issued returned to acceptable levels, and confidence was returned to the German economy temporarily. This initiative was successful for a number of reasons but primarily due to the support of American bankers known as the <strong>Dawes Committee</strong>.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Dawes Committee created a novel solution for managing the funds raised from the sale of the Rentenmark. The process began with the German government raising money for war reparations and then transferring said funds into a special escrow account in the <strong>Reichsbank</strong> which would be managed and overseen by an American Agent-General. This new office would then decide how the funds should be put to use, either to pay back debt, buy German goods, or provide credit to local businesses.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This ingenious mechanism ensured these assets were properly distributed and invested.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Another case study of how a nation or state can leverage its natural resource wealth can be seen in the <strong>Alaska Permanent Fund</strong>. The Alaska Permanent Fund was established by the State of Alaska through a constitutional amendment in 1976 before the trans-Alaska pipeline began production. The goal of the fund was to monetize a portion of the state&#8217;s oil revenues for the needs of future generations of Alaskans. A few years later after induction, the Alaskan government formed the <strong>Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation</strong> (APFC) to manage investments of the Permanent Fund outside of the State Treasury. The investments were then guided by a six-member board of trustees appointed by the Governor. The Fund uses oil royalties to make investments in bonds, stocks, real estate, infrastructure, and private entities. Every year payouts of the fund are made to Alaskan residents which are used for college savings, retirement accounts, charities, and basic living expenses.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">APFC successfully injected millions into the economy (billions by 2023) in the early years of the fund&#8217;s creation and this past year alone injected 2.1 billion into the economy.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Studies have shown that it has reduced the state&rsquo;s poverty rate since its approval by the Alaska Constitution. According to the Institute of Social and Economic Research from 2011-2015, the fund reduced the poverty rate in Alaska from 11.4% to 9.1%. The Permanent Fund has been able to generate continuous revenue for the State of Alaska and future generations of its people.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">A similar mechanism could be applied to developing economies with vast untapped natural resources.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253496/pic-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253496/responsive-images/pic-2___media_library_original_650_274.jpg 650w, https://cimg.co/news/102855/253496/responsive-images/pic-2___media_library_original_600_253.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/102855/253496/responsive-images/pic-2___media_library_original_300_126.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="650" class="content-img"></figure><h2>Ingenious mechanism, escrow accounts, and multi-party agreements?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">These are known financial banking terms that have been used and implemented for ages, which asks the question: could blockchain and tokenization help increase transparency and efficiency and unlock the potential of illiquid assets?&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We will begin by explaining what a blockchain smart contract is, and according to IBM, &ldquo;Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary&rsquo;s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">To simplify this, smart contracts can help transactions between various parties be more transparent, efficient, and most of all fair, since every decision is governed and verified by computer code and all parties need to agree in order to move to the next event.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">There are several steps in the supply chain of natural resources such as the mining of gold or the farming of soybeans. Many parties are involved in this process and being able to verify certain amounts of the supply are valid are key factors that blockchain smart contracts could help validate, as well as provide a more precise real-time total value locked of assets in a digital or physical vault or better yet, phygital vaults. For example, the Dawes Committee could have used smart contracts when dealing with the various parties involved for instant settlement transactions and verification of assets if the technology was available at the time.&nbsp;The parties in the smart contract would consist of the German government, the Dawes committee, and the buyers of the Rentenmark. The Alaska Permanent fund could use Blockchain smart contracts to verify the supply chain of the oil reserves from the Alaska pipeline, or even tokenize each barrel of oil based on an individual oil field such as the Sourdough or Prudhoe streams for inventory and logistics management.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253497/pic-3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253497/responsive-images/pic-3___media_library_original_610_169.jpg 610w, https://cimg.co/news/102855/253497/responsive-images/pic-3___media_library_original_600_166.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/102855/253497/responsive-images/pic-3___media_library_original_300_83.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="610" class="content-img"></figure><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253498/pic-4.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253498/responsive-images/pic-4___media_library_original_706_156.jpg 706w, https://cimg.co/news/102855/253498/responsive-images/pic-4___media_library_original_600_133.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/102855/253498/responsive-images/pic-4___media_library_original_300_66.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="706" class="content-img"></figure><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Latam Initiative: Bitcoin and DeFi: a bright future for underdeveloped economies</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">The Bitcoin blockchain&#8217;s decentralized and secure nature, as well as its wide acceptance by financial institutions and large trading volume, make it an ideal foundation for a new solution that aims to improve the economic and government systems in Latin America. By applying Bitcoin&#8217;s network metrics to monitor a country&#8217;s natural resources production rate and validate asset reserves, transparency and trust can be established in the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The proposed <strong>Nuevo Sol</strong> network aims to build a network of trusted resource providers, including private corporations and public organizations, that must meet a delivery quota to maintain reliability and strength.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">By implementing a decentralized financial network governed by smart contracts, the Nuevo Sol network can promote price stability, increase liquidity, and drive economic growth for all citizens.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This&nbsp;new mechanism will allow developing Latin American nations with untapped potential to properly value each country&rsquo;s natural resources by means of tokenization. It will be able to provide the people with a stable means of exchanging value and provide economic equality to all its citizens by providing access to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">decentralized</a> financial technologies for the unbanked.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">____</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/latam-payments-giant-mercado-pago-launches-fresh-crypto-adoption-drive.htm">LATAM Payments Giant Mercado Pago Launches Fresh Crypto Adoption Drive</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brazil-legalizes-crypto-payments-setting-the-stage-for-greater-bitcoin-adoption.htm">Brazil Legalizes Crypto Payments, &#8216;Setting the Stage for Greater Bitcoin Adoption&#8217;</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/paraguay-president-squashes-bitcoin-crypto-mining-bill-with-total-veto.htm">Paraguay President Squashes Bitcoin &amp; Crypto Mining Bill with &lsquo;Total Veto&rsquo;</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/adoption-picks-up-pace-latm-with-brazilian-central-banks-defi-project-developments-argentina.htm">Adoption Picks up Pace in LATM with Brazilian Central Bank&rsquo;s DeFi Project &amp; Developments in Argentina</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/from-homeless-to-quadrupled-monthly-income-just-one-of-many-advantages-of-blockchain-and-web3.htm">From Homeless to Quadrupled Monthly Income: Just One of Many Advantages of Blockchain and Web3</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mastercard-51-of-surveyed-consumers-in-latin-america-the-caribbean-have-experienced-crypto.htm">Mastercard: 51% of Surveyed Consumers in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean Have &lsquo;Experienced&rsquo; Crypto</a></p>

Some might argue that the glass is half empty. However, through countless studies, researchers are proving that the glass is in fact half full. <strong>Deloitte</strong>&rsquo;s recent study <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/grid/cross-border-payments.pdf">points out</a> that payment transactions through blockchain technology are not only 40% to 80% cheaper than traditional processes but are also &lsquo;<i>astronomically quicker than conventional cross-border transfers due to being near-instantaneous</i>&rsquo;.</p><p>Similar to telephones, which evolved from PSTN lines to copper lines to 4G and now 5G, the world of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/payments/">payments</a> is undergoing a transformation as it adapts to using blockchain technology to meet the scalability and borderless demands of a fast-growing global economy.</p><h2>Blockchains &amp; global payments: yesterday, today, and tomorrow&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>For too long, the payments space has dealt with challenges of high cost, lack of transparency, limited speed, and accessibility. Traditionally, the payments system works with trusted sources (a.k.a. middlemen) and third parties who act as critical facilitators in transaction processes. These facilitators make transactions more expensive as each vendor/middleman takes small cuts/fees.</p><p>Furthermore, traditional payment systems are much more time-consuming and inconvenient. In addition to international payments taking days to complete, the obstacle of working hours in various timezones, and the need for oversight and transactors 24/7, regardless of weekends and holidays, they are way more prone to holdbacks and fraud due to a lack of transparency.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Think back to 2018, when nearly <a href="https://www.elasticpath.com/blog/crypto-commerce-banking-on-blockchain-for-b2b-payments">78% of businesses</a> reported a case of fraud in B2B payments.</p></blockquote><p>Today, blockchain technology offers lower costs, faster transaction speeds, increased security, and complete transparency to all users within the financial sector. Merchants and retailers who once depended on middlemen to transfer money from Point A to Point B now see accountability, transparency, and greater improvements in terms of speed and costs.</p><p>As digital payments are proving to work exceptionally well within developed countries&rsquo; markets, by extension, the movement is now opening doors to faster cross-border payments and global transfers. Currently, cross-border payments are haphazardly patched together. However, with the adoption of digital payment systems, we will witness a world-changing, seamless process born, changing the way we interact with value across borders forever.</p><h2>Transforming global commerce</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A recent report from <strong>Insider Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/despite-growth-crypto-payment-adoption-remains-low">stated</a> that by 2023, 5.5 million US adults, or 2.3% of US Internet users, would use digital currencies and cryptocurrencies to make payments.</p><p>With key players such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/visa/"><strong>Visa</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/mastercard/"><strong>MasterCard</strong></a>, <strong>Strike</strong>, <strong>Stash</strong>, and many more aggressively entering the digital payments space, one can only imagine the impact of blockchain technology on the financial industry. Enablers like digital currencies, tokenization of currencies, issuance of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/stablecoin/">stablecoins</a>, on-chain transactions, and more are all key players in this mass adoption of digital payments and currencies.</p><blockquote><p>Multinational or financial companies are just some of the ones who crave a piece of this pie.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Every prominent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/banking/">bank</a> in the world is currently pondering digital payments or experimenting with the goal of remaining competitive, innovative, and relevant. 100% of the world&rsquo;s banks are awaiting clarity, and 90% of them are awaiting regulatory clearance. While the smaller, less prominent banks are held back either due to their risk appetite or unclear regulations, they are slowly making their way into the new world of digital payments.&nbsp;</p><p>However, these inhibitors are soon to become obsolete as stablecoin regulators are aggressively pushing the regulatory movement forward and opening doors worldwide.</p><h2>When it comes to digital asset payments, the glass is half full</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>No matter where you stand on this debatable crossroad of blockchain technology and its impact on the global payments system, it is inevitable to conclude that digital currency technology is here to stay. With every bank and company already thinking of or racing towards digital currencies, it is only a matter of who crosses the finish line first.</p><p>With that being said, increased participation from developed and developing countries stands to produce substantial benefits through blockchain technology&rsquo;s global impact. Within the next five years, the world will witness both a proliferation of consumer enablers and many of the world&rsquo;s most renowned banks diving head-first into what will soon prove to be the future of finance.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/world-economic-forum-says-crypto-blockchain-technologies-will-continue-an-integral-part-of-modern-economy.htm">World Economic Forum Says Crypto and Blockchain Technologies Will Continue to be an &#8220;Integral&#8221; Part of Modern Economy</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-tim-draper-says-el-salvador-will-become-one-of-richest-countries-earth-for-one-reason.htm">Billionaire Tim Draper Says El Salvador Will Become One of the Richest Countries on Earth For This One Reason</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-sberbanks-blockchain-platform-to-be-ethereum-compatible-internet-computers-mainnet-integrates-with-bitcoin-exclusive-automotive-group-accepts-crypto.htm">Sberbank&#8217;s Blockchain Platform to be Ethereum-Compatible</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-australia-sues-block-earner-hacker-steals-42m-from-fenbushi-founding-partner-dbs-completes-repurchase-transaction-on-a-blockchain-based-network.htm">DBS Completes Repurchase Transaction on a Blockchain-based Network</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-paypal-to-expand-its-crypto-service-to-luxembourg-bybit-integrates-apex-pro-dex-nomad-preparing-relaunch.htm">PayPal to Expand its Crypto Service to Luxembourg</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/looking-at-defis-untapped-potential.htm">Looking at DeFi&#8217;s Untapped Potential</a></p>

Many within crypto are thoroughly preoccupied with thoughts of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman Fried</a>, the one-time face of the industry now sitting in a jail cell. Collectively, the crypto space is questioning what we believe to be true about our own industry, whether we can really judge a success story, and how this can be prevented from happening again.&nbsp;</p><p>The impact of recent events on the perception of crypto has been dire, and made worse by the fact that this low follows a period of high, in which novice retail investors were empowered to join the burgeoning field of crypto. Now, skepticism is affecting even the most reputable centralized crypto projects. Companies that have never been doubted before must show <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/investors-not-satisfied-with-binances-proof-of-reserves-audit-next-exchange-to-collapse.htm">&lsquo;proof of reserves&rsquo;</a> and radically increase their transparency to survive.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The crypto finance space is currently very far from winning public trust. While good ideas and intentions exist, there is little guarantee that they will not be corrupted and exploited.</p></blockquote><p>With that in mind, the praise that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a> (decentralized finance) is receiving from some quarters is to be expected. Removing the centralized component of crypto finance and instead providing trustlessness via <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/decentralization/">decentralized</a> protocols and code, systems of community voting, and built-in transparency for decision-making and assets under management has an understandable appeal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>While the centralized crypto world is talking about &lsquo;auditing&rsquo; as though the concept is new, DeFi has been humbly putting such ideals into action for nearly a decade.</p></blockquote><p>Far away from the hype, the celebrity endorsements, and the hero worship of the past year, DeFi has been quietly building a better financial world &mdash; and it will continue to build through what comes next.&nbsp;</p><h2>DeFi&rsquo;s ongoing appeal</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Despite having had our own bulls and bears &mdash; for example, the DeFi summer of 2020 and apparent DeFi winter of 2022 &mdash; DeFi&rsquo;s tangible capabilities have continued to grow. Mainstream financial institutions and large enterprises, such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/tesla/"><strong>Tesla</strong></a>, <strong>Monetalis</strong>, and <strong>Huntingdon Valley Bank, </strong>have adopted DeFi for real-world problem-solving.<strong> </strong>Through the extremities of 2022, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/maker/"><strong>MakerDAO</strong></a>&rsquo;s decentralized community quietly managed a portfolio of over $7 billion in AUM (assets under management), increasing and decreasing this number in sustainable, sensible responses to market events.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The removal of centralized intermediaries from the financial process is something that those of us in DeFi knew would be the most important factor to watch in the long term. Fundamentally, crypto&rsquo;s value is derived from the immutability of blockchain as a database. Decentralization, transparency, and community action are inherent parts of this world.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Even <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/regulation/">regulation</a>, which certainly has its place in the future of finance, cannot replace the need for trustlessness enshrined in code. Regulation alone cannot ensure a lack of corruption; a fact that is true outside of crypto, too. We can look to examples of corrupt corporate entities that kept secrets from regulators as proof of this &mdash; <strong>Enron</strong> and <strong>Theranos</strong> come to mind immediately. It&rsquo;s also worth remembering that Enron, much like the leadership of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/ftx/"><strong>FTX</strong></a>, campaigned for more regulation in its field.</p><p>While regulation provides a means to hold guilty parties accountable, it does not always deter bad actors. That goal requires decentralization from the outset.&nbsp;</p><h2>DeFi provides essential liquidity&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A crucial fact, understood by those in DeFi, is that using market capitalization as an indicator of the value of a company or token is misguided. The last bull cycle relied on market capitalization to judge the apparently booming health of certain crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/exhange/">exchanges</a> and other centralized entities.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>But, much like Googling the net worth of a public figure, this can be misleading. What matters is not the overall net worth or market cap, but rather the liquidity of the assets.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>DeFi protocols can be used to provide liquidity to the rest of the market, further proving their integral contribution. MakerDAO provides liquidity for lending and borrowing in crypto, while other DeFi protocols provide liquidity pools to allow users to lock crypto assets into smart contracts, providing liquidity for decentralized exchanges (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dex/">DEXes</a>). A more liquid market is associated with less risk, meaning a safer environment for users.&nbsp;</p><h2>On a mission to build</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Looking ahead into 2023, the DeFi space will build on this value to improve service offerings. Until now, CeFi has been a simple access point for newcomers to crypto thanks to its easy-to-use apps, fun incentives, brand endorsements, and reliance on centralized teams to take care of the details. DeFi has a tendency to require more research on the part of its users, particularly in a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dao/">DAO</a> (decentralized autonomous organization) where token holders vote on the direction of a project. The fact that due diligence, reporting, and decision making is not absorbed by a centralized entity naturally makes DeFi services more complex.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Improving the UX (user experience) and UI (user interface) of DeFi&rsquo;s many functions will allow us to open up the future of finance to new audiences and achieve the universal goal of financial inclusion.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Beyond this, for many projects, the road to full decentralization is incomplete. The events of this year have added new momentum for more projects in our industry to open up community voting, and record transactions and decisions on-chain.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The roadmap for many projects to decentralize will be sped up in 2023, with DeFi developers already busy making these plans a reality.</p></blockquote><p>This radical movement toward transparency, accountability, and community action will drive forward DeFi&rsquo;s agenda and, ultimately, will help us to leave centralized corruption in the past. Right now, developers at the center of this movement are determined to further increase their valuable output. Instead of allowing the crypto space to play to the whims of spectators and the actions of a corrupt few, following DeFi&rsquo;s lead will ensure we emerge from the bear market as winners in the long term.&nbsp;</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-report-shows-defi-outperforming-traditional-finance-market-conditions.htm">New Report Shows DeFi Outperforming Traditional Finance in Market Conditions</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/looking-at-defis-untapped-potential.htm">Looking at DeFi&#8217;s Untapped Potential</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-defi-offers-beyond-lending-for-crypto-speculation.htm">What DeFi Offers Beyond Lending for Crypto Speculation</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/decentralized-derivatives-trading-platforms.htm">Top 7 Decentralized Derivatives Trading Platforms</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/moving-from-crypto-winter-to-winter-spring-lessons-from-bear-market-and-when-the-winter-will-end.htm">Moving From Crypto Winter To Winter Spring: Lessons from Bear Market and When the&nbsp;Winter&nbsp;Will&nbsp;End</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/pros-cons-of-web2-joining-web3.htm">The Pros and Cons of Web2 Joining Web3</a><br>&nbsp;</p>

We&rsquo;ve been hit with disaster after disaster over 2022 &ndash; the collapse of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/ftx/"><strong>FTX</strong></a> being the freshest in our minds. People are growing distrustful of crypto and are looking for a remedy.&nbsp;</p><p>Amidst the chaos, there&rsquo;s a sector that&rsquo;s been gaining massive traction: NFTs. And it&rsquo;s not just crypto giants like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/binance/"><strong>Binance</strong></a> who are showing confidence, but real-life adoption is gaining speed as well. Luxury brands like <strong>Gucci</strong>, sports icons like Ronaldo, and even social platforms like <strong>Reddit</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong>&nbsp;have been integrating NFTs at a rapid pace.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a problem, however. NFTs are siloed by singular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchains</a> while we live in a multichain ecosystem. Thus, there&rsquo;s a case to be made for cross-chain NFTs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Multichain ecosystem</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Crypto has an abundance of Layer 1 (L1) blockchains.&nbsp;</p><p>Some are built to be general-purpose, while others have a specific niche they&rsquo;re trying to fill. And since they come with different tradeoffs between scalability, throughput, and security, there&rsquo;s yet to be a clear winner to take it all.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>So, it won&#8217;t be one chain at the top of the mountain. There will always be different projects that will pick their home based on their specific needs.</p></blockquote><p>Due to these differences, the users, builders, and protocols of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">Web3</a> are scattered across chains, forming multiple disjointed networks.</p><p>Initially, this idea comes with the problem of&nbsp;isolation and fragmented liquidity. This obstacle is already partly solved by cross-chain bridges&nbsp;that allow you to lock assets on one chain and withdraw them on another.</p><p>But, in a multichain future, fragmentation of fungible tokens&nbsp;such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/">avalanche (AVAX)</a> won&rsquo;t be the only thing limiting users from accessing other ecosystems.&nbsp;</p><p>Non-fungible tokens&nbsp;have multiple innovative use cases due to their verifiable and trustless properties, but there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s the natural progression for Web3 communities: digital identity.</p><h2>Digital identities&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>We all portray an external image of ourselves online.</p><p>And it&#8217;s for a good reason. As we&#8217;ve progressed to a more digital world, we&#8217;re slowly transferring our real-life personas online. Think about social media &ndash; we project an image of ourselves on different platforms such as Twitter, <strong>Instagram</strong>, and even <strong>LinkedIn</strong>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s your digital identity&nbsp;&ndash; a representation of your real-life persona in a digital environment.</p><p>We care about our digital identity because, in a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/coronavirus/">Covid </a>world, that was our only way to interact with other people.&nbsp;</p><p>Think about the NFT craze of last year &ndash; people were, and still are, willing to pay thousands of dollars for a PFP (profile picture) unique and representative of only them. Our avatars in a digital world are essentially our faces.</p><p>This is also why people love to buy skins in video <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/gaming/">games </a>and spend hundreds of hours pumping out content on their socials &ndash; to paint a picture of themselves for others to see.</p><p>Social media is so popular for the same reason. It allows you to craft a unique persona of yourself online.</p><blockquote><p>However, we have a problem with digital identity in the current state of social media. Your digital identity could be wiped at any time &ndash; all of your content, engagement, and connections could go to waste.</p></blockquote><p>This is where NFTs come in: NFTs can be used to store and transfer all aspects of your digital identity.</p><p>You want to own your identity &ndash; something that is not possible in the current state of social apps.&nbsp;</p><p>With the emergence of Web3, we&#8217;re slowly transforming the internet into a place where trustlessness and user ownership are the norms.</p><h2>The need for cross-chain NFTs</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>If your digital identity is an NFT, it needs to be chain-agnostic.&nbsp;</p><p>Like your real-life persona, you&#8217;d prefer to take it with you wherever you go.</p><p>Were you confined to a single blockchain, the idea wouldn&#8217;t work. Communities, decentralized apps (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dapp/">dapps</a>), and games will all be scattered across a wider ecosystem consisting of multiple blockchains.</p><blockquote><p>For a multichain ecosystem to be adequately inclusive, interoperability is a must.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>As an example, think about the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/metaverse/">metaverse</a>.

DeFi has used smart contract platforms as a base to develop a network of interconnected layers for decentralized financial services.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">DeFi TVL (total value locked) across chains reached <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://defillama.com/">$256 billion</a> in December 2021. The last few months have been difficult for the cryptocurrency market, falling to $73 billion. Market disadvantages can create new opportunities. Innovation involves repeated failures until breakthrough structures are built. DeFi protocols for the next generation have many options. Let&#8217;s find these opportunities.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">CeDeFi</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Assets are the foundation of any economic system, including DeFi. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/stablecoin/">Stablecoins</a> are driving decentralized finance by overcoming the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s high volatility. Its invention made non-volatile account units important for lending, borrowing, and forecasting interest payments.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">DeFi protocols should use stablecoins as an asset because they offer high trust and reduce volatility, making them ideal for decentralized financial products.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">A need to capture more opportunities in Synthetic and Real-World Assets (RWAs)</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">Blockchains</a> have innovative protocols for building synthetics and RWAs, but some blockchains <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac33fb51-53a4-49a0-a4c4-fb92dc6ee241">lack</a> synthetics and RWA protocols for the DeFi ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Investors can profit from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/synthetic-asset">synthetic assets</a> without owning the underlying asset. They let investors invest in crypto commodity classes that are out of reach due to product structure and characteristics. DeFi protocols can use synthetic assets thanks to blockchain composability. Synthetics in crypto assets improve DeFi&#8217;s efficiency by offering investors access and liquidity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Most DeFi protocols overcollateralized crypto due to volatility. Real-world assets (RWA) lack this trait. RWA is a non-volatile DeFi-TradFi bridge. RWA&#8217;s protocols would attract retail and institutional blockchain investors.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">DEX and lending &#8211; strong engines for the DeFi landscape</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">The basic DeFi layer allows all the above assets to be used as loan collateral or exchanged for other assets.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lending-protocols-rise-defi-lending-191340220.html">Lending protocols</a> capture almost half of DeFi deposits, allowing users to pledge assets as collateral. Some protocols&#8217; ability to attract TVL ensures a flow of liquidity to boost cryptocurrency lending.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm">Automated Market Maker</a> (AMM) for volatile and stable assets must be differentiated in exchange protocols. Stable AMMs reduce slippage to increase stablecoin trading efficiency. High-layer asset circulation and optionality depend on AMMs&#8217; deep liquidity and stableswap protocols&#8217; low slippage.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Untapped potential in derivatives</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp">Derivatives</a>, indexing, and options are part of advanced DeFi. These DeFi products are important, but they don&#8217;t advance blockchain. More options and derivatives are needed. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> in the options market proved that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> can take a large market share with the right protocols. New derivatives and Options are needed.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Options are used for basic financial strategies like hedging and can be attractive in volatile markets. Option protocols are essential for institutions, making them a key tool for blockchain. Retail users are unfamiliar with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/trading/using-the-greeks-to-understand-options/">the Greeks</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp">at the money</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp">American options</a>, so they rarely use options. Blockchains need option vault protocols to offer automated option strategies for delegating users.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Yield aggregators</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">The Aggregation Layer comes next. Supply-side protocols pool capital and distribute it to other protocols.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">New protocols could help ecosystem players compete with top blockchain market share leaders and win the &#8216;battle&#8217; with the top blockchain market share leaders.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Payments &#8211; the window for DeFi to power the world&rsquo;s economy</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">The aggregation layer prioritizes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/payments/">payment</a> protocols. Millions of people don&#8217;t have credit cards or bank accounts in underbanked countries. Blockchain can provide secure, decentralized, nondiscriminatory payment services to millions. Decentralized, blockchain-based payment services that don&#8217;t discriminate.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Crypto payment gateways are needed to reach the masses so e-commerce can be powered by crypto assets. Only a few stablecoins offer the perfect vehicle to build on for the ecosystem to compete with fiat currencies.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Path towards trustless DeFi infrastructure: security, compliance &amp; insurance</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Blockchain protocols must be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/security/">secure</a> across all layers. To avoid systemic risks that spread throughout the chain, as with well-known projects. To expand DeFi now, investors and users must feel safe. This requires risk-aware protocols.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Risk management, compliance, and insurance promote trust. Many blockchains lack contract audit protocols. Some mechanisms can help, but we also need protocols. Blockchains should prioritize insurance and stress testing to differentiate themselves as a secure, trustworthy technology. Based on market share, there&#8217;s room to develop leading protocols. These projects will help the ecosystem navigate uncertain times and build a new DeFi paradigm. More security, risk mitigation, and trust are needed.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">A DeFi landscape&#8217;s assets and DeFi Basic layers can also be strong. Great liquidity in the AMM, stableswap, lending, and a stablecoin are needed to scale the upper layers, where gaps remain. Derivatives, indexing, prediction markets, and payment solutions should be top priorities. Security, insurance, and compliance protocols are also important for blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Now is the time to help innovative protocols achieve their goals and promote mass crypto adoption.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-defi-offers-beyond-lending-for-crypto-speculation.htm">What DeFi Offers Beyond Lending for Crypto Speculation</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/decentralized-derivatives-trading-platforms.htm">Top 7 Decentralized Derivatives Trading Platforms</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/pros-cons-of-web2-joining-web3.htm">The Pros and Cons of Web2 Joining Web3</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/japanese-regulator-suggests-it-may-preparing-police-defi.htm">Japanese Regulator Suggests it May Be Preparing to Police DeFi</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-decentralized-exchange-new-privacy-policy-says-platform-will-collect-user-data-heres-whats-included.htm">Uniswap Decentralized Exchange New Privacy Policy Says Platform Will Collect User Data &ndash; Here&rsquo;s What&rsquo;s Included</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/founder-vitalik-buterin-reveals-5-features-that-excite-him-most-about-ethereum-last-one-may-surprise-you.htm">Founder Vitalik Buterin Reveals 5 Features That Excite Him the Most About Ethereum &ndash; The Last One May Surprise You</a></p>

As a result, thought leaders, founders, and entrepreneurs are jumping ship from web2 to web3.</p><p>This is even occurring at the executive level: <strong>Amazon</strong>&rsquo;s Pravjit Tiwana left his position as general manager of Amazon Web Services&rsquo; Edge Services to become the chief technology officer of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/gemini/"><strong>Gemini</strong></a>. Meanwhile, the former head of gaming at YouTube now leads Polygon Studios as its CEO, and <strong>AirBnB</strong>&rsquo;s former human resources director also joined <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/polygon/"><strong>Polygon </strong></a>in June.</p><p>The influx of brainpower and corporate experience looms as a double-edged sword for the emerging sector. On the one hand, growth hacks and infrastructural oversight can help guide the web3 ecosystem. On the other, mismatched interests and fundamental knowledge gaps can undo such benefits. So, let&rsquo;s take a step back and consider the pros and cons of web2 joining web3.</p><h2>Why web2 is jumping ship</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Ask nearly all recent arrivals why they joined web3. The answer is the same: the future. They foresee the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/metaverse/">metaverse </a>and believe the platforms of tomorrow are being created today. So, the idea of getting in on the ground floor is too good to pass up.</p><blockquote><p>These people are also frustrated.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>They no longer want to work within corporate confines and red tape. They want to call the shots. Similarly, in the aftermath of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/coronavirus/">pandemic</a>, web2 wants remote flexibility and the ability to work alongside a global community of entrepreneurs and product builders.</p><blockquote><p>But perhaps the biggest reason for change comes down to funding.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>For those launching a new project &ndash; and feeling unsupported by the giants of web2 &ndash; this space is very attractive. In Q2, seven out of the top ten most active VCs chose web3 as the sector of choice for investment.</p><p>Take a look at news outlets and &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; employees switching sides is incredibly common. From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/facebook/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/google/"><strong>Google</strong></a>, many of the best and brightest are leaving their jobs to start something new. While many are driven by lucrative funding opportunities and freedom to think outside of the box, web2 migrants do bring important maturity to web3.&nbsp;</p><h2>Pros: what web2 can improve in web3</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are three aspects where web2 teams can shine in the web3 world.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The first is community growth.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Many web2 teams have first-hand experience in creating platforms that are focused on creating a positive user experience. They also know how to build communities that can grow organically. For example, the team behind the move-to-earn platform <strong>Gritti</strong> previously established a web2 running app with more than 100 million users. This means they already have a massive network across marathon organizers, athletic brands, and influencers.</p><p>Also, years of experience and resources in the web2 space provide Gritti with channels for customer acquisition, whether through online/offline running events or decentralized running communities. In contrast, the vast majority of web3 projects are still limited to <strong>Telegram </strong>and <strong>Discord </strong>for most of their marketing efforts. <i>[Editor&#8217;s note: Youbi Capital is an </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.finsmes.com/2022/10/gritti-raises-1-7m-seed-funding.html"><i>investor </i></a><i>in Gritti.]</i></p><ul><li><strong>The second is design experience.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Currently, web3 platforms assume an understanding of crypto wallets or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain </a>addresses and operate accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>To go mainstream, the user experience must accommodate the masses. Ideally, this requires a similar user experience to web2. An email login, a simple user interface, and intuitive platform navigation. The idea is that platform creators make web3 as comfortable and seamless as possible to onboard everyone.</p><ul><li><strong>The third concerns internal management.</strong></li></ul><p>This is notable due to the contrast between web2 and web3. In the former, internal roles are readily defined, and working frameworks are established to achieve outcomes. In the latter, projects are less hierarchical, and workers are often entirely remote. As a result, team management is not as efficient as it should be. Again, managerial proficiency typically defines web2 leaders.</p><h2>Cons: what we must keep in mind</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>On the flip side, there are detractors to web2 joining web3.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The first is alignment.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Switching sides is not just a new job. Founders: You must understand web3 to succeed in web3. If not, poor products will result in the detriment of the ecosystem. So, do your homework. This is especially true of tokenomics. Done right, tokens offer low-cost capital to provide a user engagement incentive. Done wrong, projects face resource strain in an open and global market.</p><ul><li><strong>The second relates to old ways of thinking.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>In web2, the entire business model is built on centralized data ownership. In web3, the opposite is the future. Those hailing from traditional social media or banking players might need a process of reeducation to wholeheartedly embrace decentralization. Future focus &ndash; and not looking backwards &ndash; is the only way to succeed in this paradigm shift.</p><p>Ironically, it&rsquo;s not just the workers of web2 trying to move with the times. For example, Google is building its own web3 division. Meanwhile, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ndtv.com/business/jp-morgan-wants-to-bring-trillions-of-dollars-in-tokenised-assets-to-the-defi-market-3062217#:~:text=JP%20Morgan%20believes%20it%20has,assets'%20yield%2Dgenerating%20potential.&amp;text=JP%20Morgan%20believes%20it%20has%20discovered%20a%20mechanism%20for%20decentralised,assets'%20yield%2Dgenerating%20potential"><strong>JP Morgan</strong> is experimenting with decentralized finance (DeFi).</a> The issue, as mentioned, is that such business models are at complete odds with web3. While these corporations seek evolution, the only way they can truly succeed is to build something that competes with themselves.</p><h2>The verdict: the good outweighs the bad</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Despite the roadblocks, web2 talent can provide much-needed experience to help build better web3 products. They enter the segment at an important time with product-market fit and C-level insights. In turn, web3 provides them with the chance to experiment, call the shots and have a say in the internet of the future. Ultimately, each side benefits from the other. Whatever happens, this is one space to watch.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/japanese-mobile-firm-ntt-plans-invest-4-billion-web3-technology-find-out-why.htm">Japanese Mobile Firm NTT Plans to Invest $4 Billion in Web3 Technology &ndash; Find Out Why</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-exploring-digital-identity-wallets-web3.htm">JPMorgan Exploring Digital Identity Wallets in Web3</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-news-summary-dbs-adopts-defi-protocols-for-fx-government-securities-transactions-union-bank-of-philippines-to-launch-btc-eth-custody-trading.htm">DBS Adopts DeFi Protocols for FX &amp; Government Securities Transactions</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/disney-about-make-its-big-crypto-move-into-nft-metaverse-defi.htm">Is Disney About to Make its Big Crypto Move into NFT, Metaverse and DeFi?</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/starbucks-odyssey-makes-big-bet-that-web3-nfts-can-make-rewards-immersive.htm">Starbucks Odyssey Makes Big Bet that Web3 and NFTs Can Make Rewards &lsquo;Immersive&rsquo;</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/the-future-of-web3-will-be-multichain-and-chainless-at-the-same-time.htm">The Future of Web3 Will Be Multichain and Chainless at the Same Time</a></p>

In January 2021, barely nine years after it began trading, the aggregate value of the cryptocurrency market reached $1 trillion (USD) &ndash; the fastest asset by many standards to reach this milestone. Ten months later, on November 10, 2021, the asset class nearly tripled to $2.9 trillion as several tokens reached all-time highs.&nbsp;</p><p>Rocks and pixels regularly sold for millions, profile pictures on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/twitter/"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> were awash with laser eyes, and Euphoria had no limits.</p><p>However, just one month later, the market cap dropped to $2.3 trillion, a drop of -21%. By mid-June 2022, the entire market class had fallen to a market cap of $800 billion, more than -70% off its all-time high.</p><blockquote><p>The takeaway?&nbsp;Crypto&nbsp;winter&nbsp;is here, with much of the euphoria evaporated for anguish and bafflement.</p></blockquote><p>With apologies to Mark Twain, reports of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">Web3</a>&rsquo;s death have been greatly exaggerated. We&rsquo;ve been down this volatility path in 2011, 2013, and 2018 only to bounce back. But the question isn&rsquo;t so much if, but when, there&nbsp;will&nbsp;be light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lessons from the&nbsp;crypto&nbsp;winter&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A crucial takeaway from this latest bull run is that exaggerated narratives and the urge for high returns spurred &ldquo;greed&rdquo; among investors. While this is often assumed to be associated with retail investors, this cycle showed that even the most blue-blood investment firms were engaging in dangerous and unsound behavior.</p><p>Secondly, it became apparent that in the Web3 ecosystem, many of the prevailing token design principles needed to be sound. For example, tokens that rely on the network&#8217;s continued growth to prop up price have been found wanting, and governance as a token&#8217;s core objective function needs to be improved.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Token holders need and deserve more.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, investors need to understand that&nbsp;crypto&nbsp;has yet to live up to the narrative of being an alternative asset class, as it is closely linked with traditional asset classes. For example, the&nbsp;crypto&nbsp;market cap soared as long as the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/federal-reserve/">Fed</a>) kept rates near zero, similar to equities. However, as soon as the Federal Reserve telegraphed its intention to raise interest rates, valuations began to crumble.&nbsp;</p><p>One last failing is many protocols within the space were being created to operate as money &ldquo;Lego,&rdquo; deriving an unsustainable yield rather than having a real-world use case. As a result, these sorts of protocols, particularly within decentralized finance (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>), have disintegrated. A protocol must have a function to sustain usage and drive growth over time.</p><p>Despite highly-stressed market conditions and depressed prices, DeFi protocols (e.g., <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/aave/"><strong>Aave</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/compound/"><strong>Compound</strong></a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/maker/"><strong>MakerDAO</strong></a>) remained resilient while maintaining their loan-to-value. Investors who lent to these protocols were protected by smart contracts that automatically forced borrowers to repay their loans. This isn&rsquo;t to say that DeFi protocols are 100% safe, but the risk parameters to protect investors worked as they should for at least the top lending protocols. In addition, each of these instances had a clear and valuable function, and users were drawn to them for some specific purpose.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The most important lesson is that despite the winds of&nbsp;winter&nbsp;engulfing the Web3 streets, there are no indications that developer activity or attraction to Web3 has slowed down.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/"><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong></a><strong> </strong>remains one of the most robust ecosystems for developer talent and has renewed that confidence by shipping &ldquo;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-live-latest-news-updates.htm">The Merge</a>,&#8221; the most critical upgrade in blockchain history. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/"><strong>Solana (SOL)</strong></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cosmos-2/"><strong>Cosmos (ATOM)</strong></a> ecosystems are also gaining incredible traction. There remains fierce competition for developer talent with new layer-one ecosystems&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/aptos/"><strong>Aptos </strong></a>emerging.</p><h2>When&nbsp;will&nbsp;the&nbsp;winter&nbsp;end</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Of course, nobody has a crystal ball on how long the&nbsp;Crypto&nbsp;winter&nbsp;will&nbsp;last. While it is impossible to predict the future, we can glean insights from past cycles and current developments to guide the next wave of euphoria.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted earlier, the Web3 market is closely intertwined with traditional market cycles. Therefore, as the Fed and other central banks worldwide continue a hawkish monetary policy in response to the current economic environment, it&rsquo;s safe to assume depressed prices&nbsp;will&nbsp;continue.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>However, once there is stability and a reverse trajectory of three significant factors that drive asset prices &ndash; growth, inflation, and policy &ndash; we can expect an upward trajectory.</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, there needs to be a complete resolution of all the contagions from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/terra/"><strong>TerraUSD</strong> and <strong>Luna</strong> collapse</a>, as well as all of the questionable risk management decisions that accompanied it, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/three-arrows-capital/"><strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong> (3AC)</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/celsius-network/"><strong>Celcius</strong></a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/voyager-digital/"><strong>Voyager</strong></a>. Many technicals are currently signaling seller exhaustion, but we could continue to see new bottoms without resolving these critical issues.&nbsp;</p><p><i>[Editor&#8217;s note: the article was written before the collapse of the </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/ftx/"><i><strong>FTX </strong></i></a><i>crypto exchange.]&nbsp;</i></p><h2>What&rsquo;s next for&nbsp;crypto&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>It is inevitable that sooner or later,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>there&nbsp;will&nbsp;be broad-based acceptance of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain </a>technology, driving up block space demand and propelling the next wave of user <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/adoption/">adoption</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Risk management in DeFi is still in the early stages of development compared to traditional finance. I expect &ldquo;naive&rdquo; risk management tools to be developed on top of the primitive layer of DeFi protocols.</p><blockquote><p>Leading protocols in DeFi&nbsp;will&nbsp;likely continue to go through iterations to keep up with market forces and stay relevant.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Those fundamental to the ecosystem&nbsp;will&nbsp;have critical attributes such as technical innovation, high security, and trust demonstrated by the amount of capital locked in their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/smart-contract/">smart contracts</a>.</p><p>DeFi protocols&nbsp;will&nbsp;develop their multi-chain strategy or lean heavily on platforms that interconnect&nbsp;crypto&nbsp;markets across all chains to form open finance further and&nbsp;look&nbsp;for novel approaches to help strengthen their balance sheet and token price.</p><blockquote><p>Diverse revenue sources&nbsp;will&nbsp;be critical to keeping up with the dynamic market cycles.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>For example, Aave&rsquo;s recently-approved&nbsp;crypto-backed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/stablecoin/">stablecoin&nbsp;</a>will&nbsp;accrue interest to its treasury, allowing it to continue funding future projects, a strategy other protocols may follow.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto&nbsp;winters serve as a reminder that volatility is part and parcel of financial markets. Given the big vision of Web3, it is prudent to proceed cautiously. The aftermath of the dot-com bubble affirmed that innovative organizations and technologies weather storms. The story&nbsp;will&nbsp;be the same with Web3.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-michael-saylor-says-bitcoin-will-come-out-top-following-ftx-collapse.htm">Billionaire Michael Saylor Says Bitcoin Will Come Out on Top Following FTX Collapse</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-says-btc-will-bottom-at-price-not-worried-about-crash.htm">Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Robert Kiyosaki Says BTC Will Bottom at This Price, Not Worried About Crash</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shark-tank-superstar-believes-crypto-bull-market-will-start-after-one-event.htm">Shark Tank Superstar Believes Crypto Bull Market Will Start After This One Event</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-expert-believes-one-catalyst-can-trigger-new-bull-market-market-rebound-incoming.htm">Crypto Expert Believes This One Catalyst Can Trigger New Bull Market &ndash; Market Rebound Incoming?</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/expert-trader-peter-brandt-says-50-chance-bitcoin-can-go-to-zero.htm">Expert Trader Peter Brandt Says 50% Chance Bitcoin Can Go to Zero</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/galaxy-digitals-novogratz-doubts-bitcoin-will-pass-usd-30000-barrier-soon.htm">Galaxy Digital&rsquo;s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD 30,000 Barrier Soon</a></p>

More importantly, the clear distinction between the two emerging technologies have far-reaching implications for the future of the metaverse.</p><p>VR provides users with a completely artificial 3D environment in which they can interact using special equipment such as VR headsets, whereas AR is an integration of digital technology and the user&rsquo;s physical environment. In short, AR users experience a fully immersive mixed medium experience with digital information overlaid on top of their real-world environment.</p><blockquote><p>Until now, AR has merely been an afterthought in conversations surrounding the metaverse. However, AR is the missing key to the mass adoption of Web3 technologies.</p></blockquote><p>A recent study found that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/06/30/the-metaverse-in-2040/">54%</a> of experts predict that the metaverse will become a fully functioning feature of our everyday lives by 2040. In the same vein, a notable number of experts in the space envision that users will prefer a world with elements of &ldquo;real&rdquo; reality and that AR applications will become more widely used than VR for this reason.</p><p>In fact, part of the draw of AR lies in its simplicity: users require nothing more than a smartphone to experience this new digital environment. With Web3 sceptics citing inaccessibility as a barrier to adoption, AR has the potential to widen the metaverse&rsquo;s user base, bringing in a broader stroke of users, without the burden of expensive equipment or technical know-how. <strong>Google</strong>&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://qz.com/google-s-new-smart-glasses-won-t-make-you-look-like-a-c-1849327140">plans</a> to release new smart glasses mean a lot of growth in this area. Of course, it&rsquo;s much more fashionable to wear a sleek pair of sunglasses than it is to carry around a clunky VR set.</p><p>For newcomers to the space, AR provides a more user-friendly experience as it does not change the user&rsquo;s environment. Instead, it enhances it. The result is a more human experience with digital information assimilated into the physical world in real time, without losing touch with the physical environment the user is located in.</p><blockquote><p>Beyond increasing accessibility to the metaverse, AR technology has a host of potential use cases spanning a range of industries.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In the field of education, for instance, AR can enable science students to examine cell structures up close.&nbsp;Without the need for bulky equipment, this technology can give them the ability to zoom in and out to appreciate the intricacies of cellular structures. Architecture students can view how their creations actually fit within the physical world. Suddenly, the adage &ldquo;seeing is believing&rdquo; becomes a reality. Students won&rsquo;t need specialised rooms within universities to experience AR because a smartphone is the only requirement.</p><p>The advertising and retail sectors have already begun to reap the benefits of AR. In fact, a version of this technology has already been used by the Swedish DIY furniture giant <strong>IKEA </strong>through their smartphone-compatible app, IKEA Place. The app <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/ikea-launches-augmented-reality-application#:~:text=IKEA%20has%20launched%20a%20new,%2Dto%2Dscale%203D%20products.">leverages </a>AR to let users virtually place true-to-scale 3D furniture in their very own space before purchasing. Considering the merging of fashion, advertising, and retail with metaverse technology that took hold during Metaverse Fashion Week, we can be sure that when coupled with AR, the opportunities in this space are endless.</p><blockquote><p>One industry where the metaverse is offering new, compelling experiences is gaming.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The introduction of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain </a>and non-fungible tokens (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/non-fungible-tokens/">NFTs</a>) allows creators to design and trade in-game assets. Interoperability even allows players to bring these assets from one game to another. Incorporating AR into this mix creates a whole new realm of possibility by placing players into real, existing environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Pokemon GO was one of the first examples of this, taking gamers out of their living rooms into a version of reality that tracked their journeys in real time in the physical world. With AR, players in the metaverse can better examine the environments their characters are in whilst they come up with strategies to complete their quests.</p><blockquote><p>AR facilitates inclusivity in the metaverse, fostering a more human-like user experience.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>With a number of powerful benefits and use cases, it&rsquo;s clear that integrating AR technology into the metaverse will bridge the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. At last, users will be able to enjoy the benefits of the metaverse without leaving the comfort of reality.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/gaming-keep-crypto-users-warm-during-winter-how-blockchain-technology-begins-transforms-industries-outside-of-finance.htm">Gaming to Keep Crypto Users Warm During Winter: How Blockchain Technology Begins to Transforms Industries Outside of Finance</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/crypto-marketing-vr-akoin-w-erhan-korhaliller.htm">Crypto Marketing, VR &amp; Akoin w/ Erhan Korhaliller</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/joel-dietz-on-creating-ethereum-metamask-and-metametaverse-cryptonews-podcast-164.htm">Joel Dietz on Creating Ethereum, MetaMask and MetaMetaVerse | CryptoNews Podcast #164</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/markus-levin-on-geospatial-data-the-metaverse-and-xyo-network-cryptonews-podcast-167.htm">Markus Levin on Geospatial Data, The MetaVerse and XYO Network | CryptoNews Podcast #167</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/the-future-of-web3-games-and-digital-ownership.htm">The Future of Web3 Games and Digital Ownership</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/microsoft-gaming-ceo-on-crypto-metaverse.htm">Microsoft Gaming CEO on Crypto &amp; Metaverse</a></p>

Also, blockchain protocols that don&#8217;t need energy-intensive consensus models are emerging.</p><p>This article explains how the blockchain industry is revamping its technical architecture to ensure growth and sustainability.</p><h3>What is ESG, and why does it matter?</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp">ESG</a> (Environmental, Social, and Governance) measures the environmental, social, and governance impacts of a firm or investment. Socially conscious investors use it to filter possible investments based on a set of globally agreed standards for a company&#8217;s operations.</p><p>Global enterprises, businesses, and organizations must enhance their ESG scores to remain relevant and competitive. This helps battle climate change and other challenges.</p><p>Plan A says enterprises must decarbonize, create ESG framework and reporting, reach net-zero emissions, and create a resilient and sustainable supply chain.</p><blockquote><p>Blockchain technology can alleviate some of these difficulties using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>&#8216;s distributed ledger technology (DLT). Supply chain management, which affects carbon emissions the most, might employ DLT to improve ESG.</p></blockquote><p>Blockchains can synchronize organizations&#8217; record-keeping systems, allowing them to openly reveal ESG indicators and confirm their environmental commitment.</p><p>Blockchain makes supply chain tracking more efficient, transparent, and verifiable. It stores supply chain and sustainability data immutably.</p><p>In recent years, the number of investment funds incorporating ESG issues has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/best-esg-funds/">grown</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/esg-definition-meaning/">rapidly</a> and is likely to continue rising in this decade. ESG investments could reach tens of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/esg-assets-may-hit-53-trillion-by-2025-a-third-of-global-aum/">trillions</a> of dollars in the next decades.</p><h3>Blockchains aiming for carbon neutrality &ndash; a big win for ESG</h3><p>Bitcoin introduced us to blockchain, and its success is built on the network security maintained by its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-work/">Proof-of-Work (PoW) </a>mining consensus mechanism. It requires large amounts of computing power, and thus electricity, to verify transactions in order to add new blocks to the chain.</p><blockquote><p>Since the first Bitcoin block was mined, the crypto industry has improved technologically and produced more eco-friendly blockchain solutions. For instance, PoW-to-PoS transition is key to greener tech.</p></blockquote><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-stake/">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> is a more sustainable consensus process than PoW. To verify transactions and add new blocks, PoS validators stake their currencies. This reduces electricity use and carbon emissions. Block rewards are divided among node validators, with higher-staked validators having a better chance. Even <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, the second-largest crypto asset, has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-live-latest-news-updates.htm">switched </a>to PoS.</p><p>Many of the earlier Layer-1 blockchains are slow, have high transaction fees, and leave a larger environmental footprint than is acceptable.</p><p>All the top developers are working on cutting-edge protocols to solve Ethereum co-founder <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a>&#8216;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain-trilemma">blockchain trilemma</a>, which is how to balance security, speed, and scalability. When all blockchains accomplish this, the earth will benefit.</p><h3>One of the major challenges for massive blockchain adoption is scalability</h3><p>As blockchain adoption grows, most networks&#8217; designs create operational bottlenecks that stop them from growing. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/layer-2">Layers 2</a>, which combine transactions and send them back to Layer 1, are one of the most common ways to fix this problem. This speeds up the process and frees up block space.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these Layer 2s are also better for the environment. For example, validators use about 0.00079TWh of electricity per year, while Bitcoin &#8211; the biggest PoW chain &#8211; consumes ~ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons">9,000TWh</a>. There is a big difference.</p><p>Scalability is a problem for both Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work networks. Bitcoin, which, after the Ethereum Merge, is the only major chain that still uses PoW, has solutions for scaling up that also minimize power consumption.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>For example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lighting</a>, which is used in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/el-salvador/">El Salvador</a> to scale daily Bitcoin transactions, can grow in a way that is not proportional to how much energy it uses.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;This minimizes the required energetic input. Energy optimization goes hand in hand with scalability, which is needed to expand the use of blockchain technology.</p><h3>Proof-of-stake is not the only sustainable consensus mechanism&nbsp;</h3><p>PoW and PoS are the most widely used consensus algorithms. However, PoS is not the only consensus mechanism that does not require a lot of energy. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/proof-of-authority-explained">Proof-of-Authority</a> (PoA) takes advantage of the value of identities. This means that block validators don&#8217;t stake coins, but rather their reputations. PoA doesn&#8217;t require mining or any specific amount of energy (besides to be operative).</p><blockquote><p>Its technical architecture allows high transparency and speed, making POA a pretty good solution for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/proof-of-authority-algorithm-use-cases-grow-from-pharma-to-games">logistics </a>applications (supply chain).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Consequently, it is the consensus mechanism used by veChain, the most relevant crypto protocol applied to logistics. PoS is a more efficient consensus mechanism for other types of use cases such as decentralized finance (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>), non-fungible tokens (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/non-fungible-tokens/">NFTs</a>), or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/gaming/">GameFi</a> because of its lower barriers to entry, reduced hardware requirements, etc.</p><p>Many of the methods blockchain can be utilized to solve problems are ESG compliant.</p><h2>Looking forward</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Global blockchain leaders are reducing carbon emissions.

The update is expected to spur massive adoption and reduce energy usage, making it more environmentally friendly.</p><p>While Ethereum has come a long way over the past few years, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/scalability/">scaling </a>remains an obstacle for the network.</p><h2>Where to start</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Scaling the network is a top priority for DeFi. In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain </a>technology, &#8220;scaling&#8221; refers to increasing the number of transactions that can be processed by the system in a given amount of time. As a blockchain gains popularity, the number of users increases and, along with them, the transaction volume. A blockchain protocol&#8217;s scalability refers to its capacity to sustain high transactional volume and future expansion.</p><blockquote><p>During a recent speech at ETH Seoul, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a> mentioned that Layer 2 solutions ZK Rollups will be the foundation of Ethereum&rsquo;s go-to strategy for the near and mid-term future. But what does that mean?</p></blockquote><p>The foundational architecture of Ethereum&#8217;s main blockchain is Layer 1 (L1). It serves as the decentralized and secure base upon which the Layer 2 (L2) network is constructed. L2 offers scalability through quicker, cheaper transactions that utilize the primary security of the L1 chain. Protocols often use L2 to boost scalability by processing transactions off-chain and transmitting only essential information back to the mainnet. Smart contracts handle deposit and withdrawal processing entirely on the main blockchain protocol, which also monitors and enforces compliance with the rules for all off-chain transactions.</p><h2>Layer 2 scaling solutions</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Rollups come up in two distinct flavors &ndash; zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups and optimistic rollups. The method of verification is the key distinction between the two.</p><p>Zero-knowledge proof technology allows blockchains to validate transactions faster than other types of rollups while decreasing the cost of each. Since transaction <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/fee/">fees </a>are often an issue when working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/smart-contract/">smart contracts</a>, this is a huge win for compatible ecosystems. They accomplish this by combining hundreds of transactions into a single one and transferring them off-chain. It creates a cryptographic validity proof and sends it back to the primary blockchain.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>ZK-Rollups benefit from the same non-custodial security as Ethereum, but at a much faster transaction throughput, thanks to Ethereum&#8217;s verification of these proofs and storage of sufficient data to distinguish which off-chain account owns what.</p></blockquote><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/optimism/"><strong>Optimism </strong></a>on the other hand relays transaction data to a Layer 2 network via a smart contract. The sequencer bundles multiple transactions into batches, which it then submits back to the main chain as single transactions. Optimistic rollups assume that everyone will act in good faith, and there is a one-week period during which discrepancies can be challenged.</p><p>Protocols like <strong>zkSync</strong> and <strong>StarkWare</strong> employ Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to scale the Ethereum network. Although there are differences between each solution&mdash;one difference being that they use different proofing protocols&mdash;future implementations of ZK-rollups will allow the ability to integrate privacy and efficiency into transactions without the constraints of certain limitations.</p><h2>Empowering traders with technology</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Using ZK-rollups enables global yields to be accessible to anyone, anywhere, paving the way for a greater impact of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">Web3</a>. They group data-intensive transactions to save resources, making it possible to validate blocks quickly, and resulting in lower gas fees. To achieve a balance between technological superiority and improved per-unit profitability, we see this technology as a key.</p><p>When it comes to trading derivatives on L2, it provides leverage, deep liquidity, and cheaper transaction fee in comparison to an L1. In order to be efficient, it is important for users to have the ability to bridge back and forth from Ethereum without delays or reliance on liquidity providers.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In crypto, time is of the essence, and increased speed is important when it comes to derivatives trading.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The sole purpose here, alleviating risk associated with cryptocurrencies by reducing their volatility, allows for the proper execution of trading derivatives trickling all the way down to the trade. A trader can either profit by making the correct choice or lose money by making the wrong one.</p><p>We strongly believe that utilizing such a framework will equip users with a computing infrastructure for verified transactions, decentralizing and streamlining the entire process, and offering new financial instruments and products that were unavailable previously.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-use-layer-2-solutions-save-ethereum-fees-starkware.htm">How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/layer-2-2022-get-ready-for-rollups-bridges-new-apps-life-with-ethereum-20-layer-3.htm">Layer 2 in 2022: Get Ready for Rollups, Bridges, New Apps, Life With Ethereum 2.0, and Layer 3</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/vitalik-buterin-an-incomplete-guide-to-rollups.htm">Vitalik Buterin: An Incomplete Guide to Rollups</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/a-rollup-vision-for-ethereum-zk-vs-optimistic-panel.htm">A Rollup Vision for Ethereum: Zk vs Optimistic</a>&nbsp;<br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-layer-3-vision-unleash-full-power-of-crypto.htm">Ethereum&rsquo;s Vitalik Buterin Has a Layer 3 Vision to Unleash Full Power of Crypto</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/6-key-points-in-vitalik-buterins-vision-for-ethereum-presented-at-ethcc.htm">6 Key Points in Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s Vision for Ethereum Presented at EthCC</a>&nbsp;</p>

The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/coronavirus/">COVID-19</a> pandemic and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/ukraine-war/">Ukraine Crisis</a> have had a catastrophic effect on the global economy, its effects reverberating across regions at huge economic, financial, and humanitarian costs. The <strong>US Federal Reserve</strong> is now tapering off its pandemic-era economic stimulus, resulting in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e4caa59-5799-430b-9896-e494369900dc">shrinkage of the US economy during the first two quarters of 2022</a>.</p><p>Amid fears of a looming recession, the US Federal Reserve also managed the complicated task of combatting sky-high inflation by increasing the interest rate by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-hikes-interest-rates-by-basis-points.htm">75 base points in July 2022</a>, the largest hike since 1994.</p><p>Crypto was born out of the ashes of the 2008 Financial Crisis as an alternative monetary solution &mdash; it did so on the core premise of decentralisation, one that isn&rsquo;t susceptible to the influences of centralised institutions. Thirteen years later, crypto has garnered mainstream interest and cemented itself as a disruptor to the traditional financial system, but this proposition has been questioned and is constantly tested.&nbsp;</p><p>The current bear market is the latest example of this. Whilst grappling with the aftermath of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/terra/">Terra/Luna</a> crash and the domino effect that led to the collapse of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/celsius-network/"><strong>Celsius</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/three-arrows-capital/"><strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong></a> (3AC), and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/voyager-digital/"><strong>Voyager</strong></a>, crypto also faces an existential question:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Is crypto suffering from the same problem that it was once created to solve and how can we address the issues of systemic risks and unsustainable financial models that led us to a crisis of epic proportions?</p></blockquote><p>We are witnessing the growth of crypto, culturally and otherwise, via mainstream <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/adoption/">adoption </a>across various sectors including art, film, and business. The onboarding of institutional investors into the industry has accelerated this adoption. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/top-100-public-companies-investing-in-blockchain-and-crypto-companies">BlockData reported</a> that of the top 100 listed public companies, 40 have invested in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain </a>&amp; crypto companies between September 2021 and June 2022, including financial empires such as <strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>Samsung</strong>, and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>.&nbsp;Each major investment bridges the gap between traditional financial markets and the emerging crypto market, but widespread adoption will only be meaningful if the industry is willing to confront some of its fundamental issues.</p><h2>CeFi lending platforms at the heart of DeFi</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While the impact of the Fed&rsquo;s recent policies cannot be understated, with some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thedefiant.io/stablecoin-mkt-cap-down-25b">arguing </a>that the interest rate hikes created a dollar liquidity crisis, which catalysed the Terra/Luna collapse, it was the unsustainable business models of CeFi [centralised finance] lending platforms that set the foundation for, and incentivised arguably unscrupulous behaviours that sparked the crypto contagion.</p><blockquote><p>When centralised lending platforms entered the industry during the previous bull run, they saw the lack of regulatory structures in place as an opportunity to make easy money in the absence of robust credit conditions.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This was done in two distinct ways.</p><p>First, lenders began leveraging high-yield returns to investors. In the case of Celsius, the crypto lending platform promised <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-27/celsius-s-18-yields-on-crypto-are-tempting-and-drawing-scrutiny?sref=gWGOp6EX">high yield returns of up to 18% APY</a> [annual percentage yield], placing part of their investors&rsquo; deposits in yield aggregators and other <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi </a>[decentralised finance] protocols.</p><p>Second, they imposed a far-reaching and unstructured lending system, sanctioning loans with assets that they themselves borrowed from various decentralised exchanges. Essentially, paying off the debt of a credit card with another credit card.</p><p>These types of investment models worked when the industry was riding the wave of the bull run. However, easy money is rarely ever sustainable. We all know how the saying goes: if it&rsquo;s too good to be true, it usually is. When Terra collapsed back in May, the crypto market experienced seismic shockwaves which exposed the overleveraged positions of many crypto lending firms. During the Terra collapse, it was reported that Celsius withdrew an estimated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH </a>225,000 out of <strong>Anchor Protocol</strong> &mdash; a borrowing and lending platform developed by Terra.</p><blockquote><p>The fallout of this exposed the flawed business models of CeFi lending platforms and in the process caused life savings and investments to plummet on the part of ordinary investors.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The issue of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/regulation/">regulation</a> also resurfaced, as regulatory bodies needed to posit a strong stance on regulations and crack down on those who caused the catastrophe. In 2008, governments and central banks were able to bail out major players behind the subprime mortgage crisis, subsequently coining the term &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; in the process by economic and political elites. In the crypto world, where the sector takes pride in the lack of an intermediary whose mandate is to intervene when market forces fail, who can they turn to?</p><h2>Stabilising the market: The need for regulation</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There is no doubt that the crypto lending crisis will accelerate the regulatory crackdown, whether that&#8217;s for optics purposes or a genuine readiness to implement change. Already, we are beginning to see the discourse shift, focusing on the classification of digital assets into either securities or commodities. Legislative bodies are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/federal-reserve-issues-guidance-banks-considering-crypto-activities-2022-08-16/">issuing guidance for banks</a> considering digital asset investment. And on a grander scale, regulators are imposing their authority on major crypto players.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/063015/what-are-major-laws-acts-regulating-financial-institutions-were-created-response-2008-financial.asp">During the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis</a>, steps were taken to silo the global financial sector. Governments looked to reset the status quo by issuing a series of measures aimed at regulating economic activities and protecting investors. Crypto is now faced with the same situation, a possibility to upend the status quo and streamline the market.</p><blockquote><p>Crypto is a decentralised and borderless product, and regulation, by default, requires the presence of a centralised player and to intervene when market forces fail.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Evangelists in the crypto community will staunchly oppose any notion of regulation. But if we want to create an environment that encourages institutional onboarding and protects retail investors, we need to welcome an open dialogue on regulation and a bottom-up approach. This means not only a willingness to engage with regulators, but also incentivising creators and builders of crypto projects to implement rules by design.</p><p>There are also risk management practices that can be considered. A starting point to bolster crypto&rsquo;s lending and borrowing systems is to introduce credit conditions that will prevent both CeFi and DeFi exchanges from lending uncollateralised assets to just anybody.&nbsp;</p><p>A reliable risk analysis framework that is fundamental to any robust credit system are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/five-c-credit.asp">the 5Cs of Credit</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Character</strong> &mdash; a borrower&rsquo;s creditworthiness;</li><li><strong>Capacity</strong> &mdash; debt-to-income ratio;</li><li><strong>Capital</strong> &mdash; amount of money;</li><li><strong>Collateral</strong> &mdash; securitisation of the loan;</li><li><strong>Conditions</strong> &mdash; specifics of the loan.</li></ul><p>This system is widely used by lenders across traditional markets in order to effectively vet borrowers and ensure their overall credibility.</p><p>Another solution, one that is regularly used in financial services, and is emerging in crypto, is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/audit-kyc-projects-build-trust-132000631.html">Know Your Customer (KYC) audits</a>. In the case of compliant <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/exchange/">exchanges</a>, KYC outlines a set of standards that determine whether participants can borrow and lend. While this solution endorses a bottom-up approach to regulation, the issue is that this process is currently self-regulatory. This allows players like Celsius, 3AC, and Voyager to refrain from complying.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Regulation of crypto is highly complex due to the innate contradiction between one and the other. There are more questions than answers at this point, but it&rsquo;s important we ask the right questions in order to find a path forward.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Does regulation completely undermine the premise on which crypto exists, and to what extent? Is there a balance or tradeoff we are willing to accept?</p></blockquote><p>Incentivising a regulatory strategy that starts from the bottom-up is crucial to ensuring any regulatory actions are introduced with the crypto community&rsquo;s buy-in &mdash; that it is seen as beneficial rather than purely antagonistic. At the same time, state-level regulators need to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry.</p><p>Crypto is a unique alternative solution to the traditional markets, and a powerful one at that. However, if it wants to continue challenging the status quo and co-exist with its traditional counterparts, it needs to be realistic about some of its fundamental flaws and adopt an open-door policy to address them. No one paradigm can be the answer to everything, but maturing the DeFi sector is integral because it is without a doubt the future of finance.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-prosecutors-turn-interpol-for-help-hunt-for-do-kwon.htm">South Korean Prosecutors Turn to Interpol for Help in Hunt for Do Kwon</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cel-rallies-after-celsius-asks-court-to-let-it-return-usd-50m-in-crypto.htm">CEL Rallies After Celsius Asks Court to Let it Return USD 50m+ in Crypto</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-court-permits-three-arrows-liquidators-to-access-key-financial-records-report.htm">Singapore Court Permits Three Arrows Liquidators To Access Key Financial Records &#8211; Report</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/give-us-our-money-back-issue-with-custodial-wallets-implications-of-halting-withdrawals-cryptos-reputation.htm">Give Us Our Money Back: The Issue With Custodial Wallets and the Implications of Halting Withdrawals on Crypto&#8217;s Reputation</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-spot-next-celsius-before-its-too-late.htm">How to Spot the Next Celsius Before It&rsquo;s Too Late</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-celsius-and-voyager-were-more-like-uninsured-quasi-banks.htm">Why Celsius and Voyager Were More Like Uninsured, Quasi-Banks</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-regulation-is-key-to-crypto-industry.htm">Why Regulation Is Key to Crypto Industry</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-treasury-begins-public-consultation-how-regulate-crypto.htm">US Treasury Begins Public Consultation on How to Regulate Crypto</a></p>

Phil Graham, Partner at Harneys, is global head of the Investment Funds and Regulatory groups and head of the transactional team in the British Virgin Islands.</i><br>__________</p><p>The buzz around a virtual asset or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">web3</a> project will typically focus on the &lsquo;front-end&rsquo; &ndash; the product offering, team, partnerships, and performance; how it is going to change the world. Whilst accepting that the corporate structuring behind the front-end is far less exciting, it truly can make the difference between a project&rsquo;s success and sustainability or its failure and damaging fallout.</p><p>Many web3 projects aspire to decentralisation, but initially consist of a small and highly centralised team. Like any early-stage start-up, a crypto project will usually want to set up a corporate structure to protect the project&rsquo;s team and its assets, secure funding, and start doing business with real-world counterparties.</p><p>Similar considerations will also apply to principals wanting to set up a cryptoasset-focused fund, who will want to seek and provide for attractive returns, have an optimised <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/tax/">tax</a> structure and, be appealing to an investor base all over the world, whilst protecting the investment management vehicle and the fund&rsquo;s other service providers by using a flexible and appropriately regulated structure for their launch.</p><blockquote><p>With that in mind, international financial centres (IFCs), such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and the Cayman Islands provide attractive solutions for both crypto projects and crypto funds.</p></blockquote><p>For decades IFCs have offered tax-neutral and appropriately regulated financial services products to their users through sophisticated and experienced financial services providers. For example, many investment funds and other financial services products are domiciled in IFCs, including the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s crypto funds: an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/4th-annual-global-crypto-hedge-fund-report-june-2022.pdf">estimated </a>63% of which utilise Cayman Islands and BVI vehicles.</p><p>One shining example of innovation by IFCs to create vehicles for specific uses is the Cayman Islands foundation company. Foundation companies are not required to have charitable or non-profit purposes and unlike most corporate vehicles, are not required to have members in order to remain in existence. These two factors make foundation companies attractive to projects aiming for decentralisation as they can serve as a memberless vehicle with the sole purpose of supporting the project or its governance protocol. The foundation company can engage with third parties or hold certain assets in support of the project and can be bound by its constitutional documents to act on the instructions of a governance protocol or its representatives.</p><blockquote><p>In addition, virtual asset regulations in the BVI and the Cayman Islands allow BVI or Cayman Islands entities to be used as the token issuer, with private sales being largely unregulated and public sales of tokens being subject to appropriate levels of regulatory oversight.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>A structure that is frequently used involves establishing a Cayman Islands foundation company, which owns a token issuing vehicle, typically formed in the BVI.&nbsp; The director(s) of these companies will often be a professional services provider, who can take guidance from the governance protocol adopted by the decentralised autonomous organisation (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dao/">DAO</a>). This approach separates each entity&rsquo;s functions appropriately as well as reducing some risk and simplifying accounting for the project and team. For many projects, this can enhance decentralisation governance and further remove the founders and team from the corporate structure that will carry out activities.</p><p>All of this being said, there is no one size fits all approach to crypto fund or crypto project structuring. Each team must carefully consider their commercial requirements, risk appetite, and legal, regulatory, and tax position.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Slavishly copying a structure used by other projects is a dangerous game particularly without understanding that project&rsquo;s objectives, legal and tax advice, and risk appetite in a shifting regulatory landscape.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Engaging crypto-experienced service providers early in the process means a fund or project can get the right advice early enough to avoid costly mistakes to understand fully their legal and regulatory position, the tax implications of a proposed structure (both for founders, users, and the project vehicles themselves), reduce risk where possible, and avoid consequences which may arise well after a fund or project is launched that could be difficult or impossible to remedy.</p><p>In addition to choosing the right structure, the global regulatory landscape crypto is in flux. The <strong>Financial Action Task Force</strong> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-anti-money-laundering-watchdog-presses-countries-crypto-exchanges-to-implement-key-requirement-faster.htm">FATF</a>)&ndash; the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog &ndash; published anti-money laundering standards and recommendations for certain crypto businesses which jurisdictions must implement locally to avoid being subject to sanctions such as blacklisting. Not all crypto businesses will be affected in the same way by new crypto regulations and, of course, other laws and regulations, such as securities, investments, banking, substance, and data protection legislation may apply to a project, so a local legal and regulatory analysis may be required for each vehicle in a structure.</p><blockquote><p>In this context, it is incredibly important for readers to realise that using a vehicle domiciled in an IFC won&rsquo;t absolve crypto projects of their obligations to comply with the relevant laws and regulations in countries in which they do business or in which their clients or customers are based, especially given the fact that a large number of the digital asset projects often involve a mixture of IFC vehicles and vehicles domiciled onshore.</p></blockquote><p>Crypto continues to grow and thrive regardless of market setbacks and downturns. Many of the world&rsquo;s largest crypto funds and businesses use IFC vehicles to optimise their corporate structure, and startup projects with the right advice can also benefit from the jurisdictional and structuring advantages offered by IFCs and their corporate vehicles.</p><p>IFC jurisdictions recognise the value of crypto in strengthening their global offering, so local governments and regulators regularly consult with industry to understand trends and implement frameworks to position themselves to capture crypto market share while complying with international standards around corporate and tax transparency and reporting.&nbsp;</p><p>This agility is difficult to find in onshore jurisdictions and helps IFCs maintain their reputation as preferred jurisdictions for businesses with a global client base, to the point where some projects have opted to have physical offices and staff on the ground itself. The physical benefits of residing in these jurisdictions are for an entirely separate publication, but there is no doubt that there is a perfectly aligned approach on both islands, which means that both the BVI and Cayman Islands should always be firmly in the mind of anyone operating in this space.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fundstrat-warns-of-trading-on-offshore-crypto-exchanges-7968.htm">Fundstrat Warns of Trading on Offshore Crypto Exchanges</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-regulation-is-key-to-crypto-industry.htm">Why Regulation Is Key to Crypto Industry</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microstrategy-calls-dc-tax-fraud-lawsuit-false-says-it-will-fight-back-aggressively.htm">MicroStrategy Calls D.C. &lsquo;Tax Fraud&rsquo; Lawsuit &lsquo;False&rsquo; and Says it Will Fight Back &lsquo;Aggressively&rsquo;</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/japanese-regulator-wants-reform-crypto-tax-laws-for-companies-investors.htm">Japanese Regulator Wants to Reform Crypto Tax Laws for Companies &amp; Investors</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/when-should-you-run-own-blockchain-node.htm">When Should You Run Your Own Blockchain Node?</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/data-validation-and-the-problem-of-standards-why-it-is-difficult-and-how-to-fix-it-in-a-decentralized-way.htm">Data Validation and the Problem of Standards: Why it is Difficult and How to Fix it in a Decentralized Way</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-designed-avoid-bullshit-compound-founder-says-about-crypto-bailouts.htm">DeFi is &lsquo;Designed to Avoid This Bullshit,&rsquo; Compound Founder Says About Crypto Bailouts</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/defi-suffers-from-too-much-centralization-what-can-be-done.htm">DeFi Suffers from Too Much Centralization, What Can Be Done?</a></p>

The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://halborn.com/explained-the-wormhole-hack-february-2022/">Wormhole hack</a> was caused by a fake deposit exploit. Attackers initiated a fake deposit and fooled the validators into approving a withdrawal of an equal size.</p><p>What do these hacks have in common? These bridges all used Automated market maker technology (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers">AMMs</a>). Here are three ways we can make cross-chain bridges safer.</p><h3>Step 1: Use peer-to-peer bridges instead of AMMs</h3><p>The major hacks mentioned above could have been avoided using peer-to-peer (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/p2p/">P2P</a>)-powered bridges instead of AMMs and here&rsquo;s why. P2P brides don&rsquo;t rely upon complex smart contracts or liquidity pools. They use atomic swaps and order books, enabling cross-chain swaps to be completely trustless and decentralized without middlemen. Swaps are described as &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; because with each order, either the trade completes and two users exchange funds or the trade doesn&rsquo;t complete and original funds are distributed back to the two users.</p><p>AMMs use liquidity pools, which are essentially centralized pots of money that depend on smart contracts. The pools are the vulnerable element, which can get hacked or rugpulled. P2P bridges do not use pools, meaning user funds are never left vulnerable to these types of exploits.</p><h3>Step 2: Pay attention to the number of validators for AMM bridges</h3><p>If an AMM bridge must be used instead of a P2P platform, users should use an AMM bridge with a higher number of validators.</p><p>A small group of validators makes it easy for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/hack/">hackers</a> to target. The more validators there are for a bridge, the more decentralized and secure it is.</p><p>With the Ronin hack, hackers were able to get control of five of nine validators. The attacker only had to hack one person to get four validators from that device, and then hacked <strong>Axie DAO</strong> to obtain the 5th validator. The need for only a few signatures bodes little security as there are not enough validators to ensure the integrity of bridge transactions will stay intact.</p><p>We need to see more validators on AMM bridges. Using a multi-signature wallet is crucial, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if it only requires an attacker to exploit two or three wallets.</p><p>Case in point, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/one-keeps-trending-lower-while-harmony-offers-hacker-usd-1m-bounty-for-return-of-funds.htm">Horizon bridge attacker</a> allegedly took control of the multi-signature wallet leveraged in Harmony&rsquo;s bridge. Because the bridge was a two-of-five multi-signature scheme, anyone with access to private keys for two of these addresses could take control of the bridge.</p><h3>Step 3 &#8211; Use bridges that have received professional audits</h3><p>Project developers should take extra precautions and use audits before deploying any bridge. Developers can use real-time threat monitoring solutions to stop or at least mitigate the fallout from hacks. Audit companies also guide developers in the right direction, advising on what changes to make before applications are deployed. Before deploying new smart contracts, it&rsquo;s essential to battle-test them and be aware of various attack vectors.</p><p>Users should research and take control of their funds by only using bridges that have been audited by credible firms, and by reading through the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quantstamp.com/blog/the-dark-side-of-defi-cross-chain-bridge-hacksv">audit reports</a> to catch issues on the bridge that have been noticed and resolved.</p><p>Audit companies normally review the project&rsquo;s smart contract, which holds the contract&rsquo;s code that interacts with a blockchain and cryptocurrency, to find the most noticeable errors.

Despite the fact that cryptocurrency prices remain near the current market bottom, there has been quite some positive media coverage about the industry lately.</p><p>The reason for the latter is rather straightforward. In the last few months, a surging number of prominent businesses and government entities have started adopting digital assets for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/payments/">payments</a>.</p><h2><strong>Accelerating business and state crypto adoption</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In August, while <strong>Gucci</strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cryptotimes.io/gucci-stores-now-accept-apecoin-payments/"><strong> </strong></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/robinhood-fined-again-zb-suspends-withdrawals-resetting-viresfinance-apecoin-enters-gucci-more-news.htm">expanded</a> its list of supported digital assets with <strong>ApeCoin</strong> and the luxury resort chain <strong>Soneva</strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sonevas-luxury-resorts-now-accept-crypto-payments/"><strong> </strong></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@trendingcryptonews/sonevas-luxury-hotels-now-accept-payments-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trending-crypto-news-d9c720aecdee?source=user_profile---------11----------------------------">started</a> accepting major coins at its premises in the Maldives and Thailand, <strong>Oxford City</strong> has<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-62399371"> become</a> the first non-league football club to integrate crypto for matchday payments.</p><p>Moreover, businesses have expanded crypto payment coverage in Australia and Argentina. &#1057;itizens of the latter can now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/latin-america/en/newsroom/press-releases/pr-en/2022/august/binance-and-mastercard-launch-prepaid-card-in-argentina-to-bridge-cryptocurrencies-and-everyday-purchases/">utilize</a> a prepaid card brought about through a partnership between <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/binance/en"><strong>Binance</strong></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/mastercard/"><strong>MasterCard</strong></a> to settle transactions at merchants via cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Aussies can<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/aussies-buy-fuel-and-chips-with-crypto-across-175-fuel-outlets"> now </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptocom-users-can-shop-in-175-otr-stores-btg-pactual-launched-crypto-trading-platform-cdpq-wrote-off-stake-in-celsius-more-news.htm">purchase</a> fuel and other merchandise with their digital assets at <strong>On The Run</strong>&#8216;s 175 premises.</p><p>At the same time, states are also increasingly realizing crypto payments&#8217; potential use cases and benefits. Of course, central bank digital currencies (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDCs</a>) continue playing a major role in governments&#8217; cryptocurrency <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/adoption/">adoption</a>, especially if we consider how close China is to launching its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/digital-yuan/">digital yuan</a> (e-CNY). While visitors and residents can leverage e-CNY to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-chinese-citys-metro-begins-accepting-digital-yuan-payments.htm">buy subway tickets</a> in Ningbo and Beijing, bus fares can be covered with the state-issued digital asset in Guangzhou.</p><h2><strong>Clever marketing or real signs of crypto adoption?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Large brands like <strong>Gucci</strong>, <strong>Balenciaga</strong>, and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/luxury-brands-start-to-take-cryptocurrency-payments-11654860403"> </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tag-heuer-to-allow-users-to-display-nfts-on-their-smartwatches.htm"><strong>Tag Heuer</strong></a> joining the ranks of companies like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/microsoft/"><strong>Microsoft</strong></a>, <strong>PlayStation</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, and <strong>Subway</strong> to accept crypto is definitely good news for the industry.</p><p>However, before we imagine <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and other major cryptocurrencies &#8220;going to the moon&#8221;, we should discuss whether this is a signal of real-world, no-fooling around adoption or just a marketing plot by brands.</p><p>Fortunately, the prior statement seems to hold the truth.</p><p>Whether they like it or not, big firms are adopting cryptocurrency for payments to fulfill consumers&#8217; surging demand. In Gucci&#8217;s case, the luxury brand likely decided to integrate ApeCoin due to its customers&#8217; strong interest in the non-fungible tokens (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/non-fungible-tokens/">NFTs</a>) of the popular <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club</strong> (BAYC) project, where top celebrities like<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/the-ultimate-pr-eminem-snoop-dogg-perform-as-bored-ape-nfts-at-mtv-awards/"> Eminem and Snoop Dogg</a> are actively involved.</p><p>Furthermore, with an<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/"> estimated</a> 320 million crypto users worldwide, many consumers have realized the benefits of crypto payments. Compared to conventional forms of payment, digital assets are cheaper and faster to transfer due to the lack of intermediaries in the transactions. At the same time, while users have direct ownership over their funds (<i>provided they weren&rsquo;t goofing around with their private keys</i>) with non-custodial wallets, they don&#8217;t have to use a bank account, a credit card, or other services of financial institutions to settle their payments.</p><p>For businesses, the advantages of crypto payments are even more obvious. Compared to traditional providers that typically charge between 1.5% and 3.5% for processing credit card transactions, a recent report<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PYMNTS-Paying-With-Cryptocurrency-June-2022.pdf"> revealed</a> that it only costs enterprises approximately 1% to accept digital assets with a capable processor.</p><p>The savings in fees and the speed of transactions provide an excellent opportunity for merchants to reduce their bottom line. Furthermore, while they can target crypto-native prospects more efficiently, they face significantly fewer risks of unfriendly behavior, viz. fraudulent chargebacks, with digital assets-powered transactions.</p><h2><strong>Who will take the lead in crypto adoption?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In the coming months, I expect more luxury brands, especially those actively involved in the NFT and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/metaverse/">metaverse</a> sectors, to follow in Gucci&#8217;s footsteps and adopt crypto payments. Also, as demand among merchants grows, it will likely give one more reason for payment giants like MasterCard, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/visa/"><strong>Visa</strong></a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/paypal/"><strong>PayPal</strong></a> to introduce new or expand their existing digital asset offerings to fulfill enterprise demand.</p><p>At the same time, as the upcoming metaverses of tech firms like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/meta/"><strong>Meta</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/microsoft/"><strong>Microsoft</strong></a> are getting one step closer to their launch, we might witness an acceleration of crypto adoption in this field as well, where said assets might be utilized as a means of payment in virtual worlds. Now, how and whether &ndash; <i>if at all </i>&ndash; future-proven and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/regulation/">regulation</a>-resistant will those new efforts be, remains to be seen. Meta still hasn&#8217;t fully recovered from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/libra/">Libra</a> blowback. How decentralized and peer-to-peer (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/p2p/">P2P</a>) those infrastructures are is yet another point of uncertainty.</p><p>Next year, we may also see some new government initiatives that aim to leverage the benefits of crypto payments in a similar way, spanning across the continents, from Iran through African states to Argentina&#8217;s Mendoza province. However, I believe all those efforts will be slowed down by the focus that might be diverted to CBDC development.</p><p>For that reason, I expect businesses to take the lead in crypto payments adoption for the next few months &ndash; or at least until <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/china/">China </a>completes the nationwide launch of the digital yuan, opening up the way to millions of new crypto users.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-chinese-citys-metro-begins-accepting-digital-yuan-payments.htm">Major Chinese City&rsquo;s Metro Begins Accepting Digital Yuan Payments</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinese-parents-to-use-digital-cny-smart-contracts-to-pay-for-after-school-lessons.htm">Chinese Parents to Use Digital CNY &lsquo;Smart Contracts&rsquo; to Pay for After-school Lessons</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvador-leader-bukele-calm-as-media-label-bitcoin-experiment-failure.htm">El Salvador Leader Bukele Calm As Media Label &lsquo;Bitcoin Experiment&rsquo; a &lsquo;Failure&rsquo;</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-partners-with-nigerian-authorities-to-launch-dubai-like-digital-economic-zone.htm">Binance Partners With Nigerian Authorities to Launch Dubai-Like Digital Economic Zone</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-assets-could-become-permanent-feature-of-finance-singapore-central-banker-argues.htm">Digital Assets Could Become &lsquo;Permanent Feature&rsquo; of Finance, Singapore Central Banker Argues</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/adoption-picks-up-pace-latm-with-brazilian-central-banks-defi-project-developments-argentina.htm">Adoption Picks up Pace in LATM with Brazilian Central Bank&rsquo;s DeFi Project &amp; Developments in Argentina</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-crypto-atm-provider-bitcoin-depot-to-go-public-as-part-of-merger-deal.htm">US Crypto ATM Provider Bitcoin Depot to Go Public as Part of Merger Deal</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripio-launches-visa-bitcoin-cashback-crypto-card-in-brazil.htm">Ripio Launches Visa Bitcoin Cashback Crypto Card in Brazil</a></p>

Understanding the new reality is paramount, especially as you prepare for it to emerge.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I often find people ignoring or misconstruing very important notions that are inseparable from the Merge. Considering the immense importance of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> becoming a proof-of-stake (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-stake/">PoS</a>) blockchain and the impact that it will have on the crypto economy (which I talked about elsewhere), I think many of us can&#8217;t afford to ignore those things.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I decided to talk about them point-blank.</p><h2>There are no 400,000 validators</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As we are approaching the Merge in Ethereum, I hear a quite repetitive narrative about it having about 400,000 validators after going full PoS as there are allegedly this many owners of at least ETH 32 (USD 49,500), which is the minimal stake size. But that is plainly wrong. Moreover, anyone would be able to run a node without any ETH.</p><p>As a CEO of a company that makes its bread by validating on more than 50 different blockchains, I can see thousands of people launching nodes, but I can&#8217;t see all of them ensuring nearly 100% uptime. Soon many of them will get their fingers burned by slashing, lose their money, and eventually become completely demotivated or financially incapable of starting all over again.</p><p>It means that the PoS incarnation of Ethereum won&#8217;t have nearly as many validators as some expect. Moreover, I don&#8217;t expect the number of nodes to be significant enough to satisfy those with a serious decentralization kink. But, of course, there will be more node operators than the proof-of-work (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/no-black-and-white-answer-to-the-proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-question-says-kraken-1.htm">PoW</a>) could ever afford.</p><p>Those efforts are at risk of being eclipsed by a very ominous presence: major centralized exchanges as validators.</p><h2>Exchanges as validators are a flaw</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Even now, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/binance/en"><strong>Binance</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/en"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/en"><strong>Kraken</strong></a> hold over 32% of staked ETH. With Ethereum switching to PoS, the risk from exchanges will only increase.</p><p>The fact that exchanges can participate in validation is a personal pain in the butt. It is a severe design flaw that I don&#8217;t even know how to rectify. Maybe some project will find a solution someday, but right now this seems impossible.&nbsp;</p><p>Validators in PoS are trusted because acting against the network&#8217;s interest will cost them a lot of money, and they are aware of that. It incentivizes them to work diligently and, for example, maintain 100% uptime.&nbsp;</p><p>But exchanges don&#8217;t use their own funds to stake. They just push their users&#8217; money there and make profits they don&#8217;t even disclose sometimes. If they act against the interests of the network, they won&#8217;t lose anything &ndash;unlike their customers, whose tokens may deprecate because of an exchange&#8217;s ill-natured actions.&nbsp;</p><p>The exchanges are big enough to harm an entire ecosystem and get away with it. And knowing the influence and the scale of Ethereum, it will become a huge problem when the Merge occurs.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The most important notion, though, is hardly surprising: we are all people, and we drag our human imperfections even in the perfect technologies. As long as some people vie for power for the sake of power and others chase the quick buck without any thought about the importance of technological advancement, there will always be politics, even in crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>And I fear that the Merge will let more people like that into the realm where they can impact the ecosystem. It&#8217;s not a reason to fear the Merge itself, of course. Its importance for technology and the very evolution of crypto is difficult to underestimate.&nbsp;</p><p>What I mean, after all, is that we all must be ready to face this new reality when it finally arrives.<br>_____<br><strong>Learn more:</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-says-his-influence-over-ethereum-decreases-as-network-nears-the-merge.htm">Vitalik Buterin Says His Influence Over Ethereum Decreases as Network Nears the Merge&nbsp;</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-advise-ethereum-users-to-avoid-transacting-on-merge-day-outline-numerous-risks.htm">Analysts Advise Ethereum Users to Avoid Transacting on Merge Day, Outline Numerous Risks</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/no-black-and-white-answer-to-the-proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-question-says-kraken-1.htm">No &lsquo;Black and White&rsquo; Answer to the Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake Question, Says Kraken</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/merges-long-term-impact-ethereum.htm">The Merge&rsquo;s Long Term Impact on Ethereum</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-bitcoin-crypto-companies-warn-of-extreme-risk-in-proof-of-stake-systems.htm">Major Bitcoin &amp; Crypto Companies Warn of &#8216;Extreme&#8217; Risk in Proof-of-Stake Systems</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/the-compromises-and-benefits-of-ethereum-switching-to-a-proof-of-stake-network.htm">The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network</a></p>

However, the current crypto infrastructure is highly fragmented with spotty use cases and evolving regulation, leaving a lot to be desired. Multiple chains and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/layer-2-2022-get-ready-for-rollups-bridges-new-apps-life-with-ethereum-20-layer-3.htm">layer 2s</a> have come up to scale Web3, but there&#8217;s a lot of friction between these chains leading to lower network effects.<br><br>There&rsquo;s a strong case to be made for replacing traditional banking systems with cryptographic technology, but using monolithic blockchains that restrict users to their ecosystems isn&rsquo;t the answer. It only provides a perceived sense of financial freedom, where centralization has revealed its limitations.<br><br>Not to mention the long list of complexities that await users coming into Web3. There&rsquo;s the clunky user experience, the self-management of wallets and keys, and the lack of killer apps. And then, as Web3 has been becoming more multichain, the burden of dealing with cross-chain friction has made the experience even worse.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>While we&rsquo;re still early, the winners of Web3 will be the ones laser-focused on building a viable experience. This is where a chainless experience matters. While the Web3 infra will be multichain, the experience will have to be chainless.</p></blockquote><p>Holding users captive on one blockchain and then confusing them with overly-technical processes won&rsquo;t encourage participation. But what if we could abstract away their cross-chain mechanisms to the background, so the user doesn&#8217;t need to worry about them? Dapps (decentralized applications) and products built on-chain will enable better participation without compromising the fundamental decentralized purpose of Web3.&nbsp;</p><h2>No one chain to rule them all&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A common narrative is that one chain will eventually find a solution to the myriad of problems faced by others, from gas fees to transaction times, and will ultimately become &ldquo;the one&rdquo; blockchain above all others.<br><br>Each shiny new blockchain comes loaded with promises to unlock the holy grail of Web3, but history shows this only results in exposing the blockchain&rsquo;s flaws. New chains will pop up to propose solutions, and the cycle of innovation continues.&nbsp;</p><p>While these new chains navigate fresh challenges and technical roadblocks, they also become fertile ground for builders to experiment with new projects, further fueling interest and communities in Web3. This flywheel of engagement is healthy for us all.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, over the last year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana (SOL)</a>&rsquo;s total value locked has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">grown</a> from USD 152m to USD 7.87bn, indicating the growth in investment on the chain.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>With the different chains growing in strength, the need to move across them becomes so much more important &mdash; because users will need options and mobility across chains. This is true freedom in Web3.</p></blockquote><p>Currently, bridges are the go-to mechanism to make the move across chains. Much like most new technologies, these have run into problems &mdash; most specifically with user experience &amp; onboarding. Most users don&rsquo;t want to deal with using bridges, moving their funds around, managing multiple chains etc. And new mainstream users have such steep learning to understand any of it, that they are going to run away.&nbsp;<br><br>Another issue is security. A bridge hack in February this year proved to be one of the biggest in crypto at the time. The Wormhole hack saw USD 321m stolen. Concerns around bridge security had already been raised, specifically by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> co-founder <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>As the reality of a multichain future beckons, the need for connecting bridges becomes undeniable. Bridges will be critical to Web3 infrastructure, but the experience of using them will have to improve by leaps and bounds.</p><h2>Chainlessness as an answer</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While bridges may be inevitable, they do also add complications. This is why interoperability can&rsquo;t exist if the chains are still front and center in the user experience.</p><p>To accelerate Web3 adoption, we need to ask, &ldquo;How can we declutter and simplify&nbsp;the cross-chain process?&rdquo; Do we really need to see and execute every part of the bridging or transaction?&nbsp;<br><br>Just like how something you ordered off <strong>Amazon</strong> with a couple of clicks arrives at your house in days, dapps and other projects building on-chain should be able to hide the nuts and bolts behind the scenes while remaining transparent and decentralized.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s the key philosophy behind chainless &#8211; users should just be able to use any dapp on any chain like they use a Web2 app. Bridging the funds, calling the dapp contract on another chain etc. should be handled by dapp/infra in the background.&nbsp;</p><p>A key example is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/non-fungible-tokens/">NFTs</a> in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/play-to-earn">play-2-earn</a> (P2E) games. In 2021 and into this year, P2E has become a significant entry point into crypto.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/axie-infinity"><strong>Axie Infinity</strong></a> founder Aleksander Leonard Larsen said during a panel at the Token 2049 conference that half of the game&rsquo;s players had never used a crypto app before.&nbsp;</p><p>This makes sense for a couple of reasons.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Many people enjoy playing games. Less people have technical expertise in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s &ldquo;easier&rdquo; to jump from gaming into crypto through something familiar like a mobile game.</p></blockquote><p>A more illuminating reason is that P2E games somewhat obscure the complex mechanisms going on behind the scenes.</p><p>For example, <strong>DeFi Land</strong> is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/yield-farming/">yield farming</a> game on Solana that hides the more complex financial elements of yield farming behind a fun user experience. This puts the chain and mechanisms behind an enjoyable gamified experience.&nbsp;</p><p>While gaming is a great example of a more chainless experience, Axie specifically also offers insight into the downfall of siloed chains.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Axie Infinity was built on its own chain, which means that the users who arrived through this specific game lack access to the other Web3 products and projects. As such, P2E, in this case, as an onboarding mechanism, arrives at a dead end.&nbsp;<br><br>If Axie Infinity was connected to other chains with unique value propositions, players would simply see the game as a fun access point, with the freedom to move into other Web3 projects and ecosystems. The onboarding of players continues.&nbsp;</p><h2>Changing the price of admission</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The user experience issues we face today are often seen as part of the price of admission into Web3. This mindset is not sustainable if we aim to make our blockchain technology inclusive and available to all.</p><p>With an effectively chainless yet multichain experience, users will be able to hop across chains without executing a dozen technical commands. They can easily move assets, NFTs, and their user identities between worlds to work, live, and play.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><br>By then, traditional banking intermediaries and financial gatekeepers will still be around, but they would be much less relevant.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>_____<br><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/growth-in-digital-assets-trade-puts-the-spotlight-on-blockchain-bridge-security-risks.htm">Growth in Digital Assets Trade Puts the Spotlight on Blockchain Bridge Security Risks</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/a-multichain-world-is-key-to-the-success-of-web-30-and-the-metaverse.htm">A Multichain World Is Key to the Success of Web 3.0 and the Metaverse</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-dominance-will-continue-to-decrease-messari-analysts.htm">Multichain Future Brings Multiple Competitors to Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum &#8211; Analysts</a></p>
