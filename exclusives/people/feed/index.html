<p>Earlier on Thursday, a New York jury found FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried guilty of defrauding his customers and lenders, concluding a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/prosecution-eviscerates-sbf-during-closing-arguments-he-built-a-pyramid-of-deceit.htm">five-week trial</a>.</p>
<p>In a unanimous verdict which the judge said came in at 7:40 pm, the jury found Bankman-Fried guilty of all of the seven charges he had faced.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bankman-Fried’s defense attorney Mark Cohen said the disgraced FTX founder respects the jury’s decision but will continue to fight to prove his innocence.</p>
<p>The judge marked out the 28<sup>th</sup> of March 2024 as a potential sentencing date.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s charges include 1) wire fraud and 2) conspiracy to commit wire fraud against FTX customers, 3) wire fraud and 4) conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Alameda’s lenders, 5) conspiracy to commit securities fraud against FTX’s investors, 6) conspiracy to commit commodities fraud against FTX’s customers and, finally, 7) conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>
<p>A number of former FTX executives, including the company’s CTO Gary Wang, Head of Engineering Nishad Singh and former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, testified against Bankman-Friend.</p>
<p>They all said they are pleading guilty to charges relating to their role in the FTX collapse, but all argued that they had taken direction from Bankman-Fried, who oversaw the fraudulent operation.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto’s Biggest Fraudster</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SBF could easily go down for decades.</p>
<p>Investors and users lost billions when the exchange abruptly collapsed just over one year ago, following a bank-run that forced it to halt withdrawals.</p>
<p>The exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm">declared bankruptcy on the 11<sup>th</sup> of November 2022</a>, while <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas-following-formal-notification-by-united-states.htm">Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested around one month later</a>.</p>
<p>FTX said earlier this year that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftx-says-8-9-billion-in-customer-funds-are-missing-c232f684">hole in its balance was nearly $9 billion</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that Sam Bankman-Friend had funneled FTX customer/investor funds to bail out his failing hedge fund Alameda, which over the course of 2022 had lost billions amid bad crypto bets and poor risk management.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried’s guilt gives his the unwanted crown of being crypto’s biggest-ever fraudster.</p>
<p>Other notable scammers include the creators of the OneCoin and BitConnect ponzi schemes, which cost investors $2.4 and $4 billion respectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internet observers have expressed surprise after the Chinese state-run media outlet <b>CCTV</b> carried some bold predictions about <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>’s long-term future – and featuring a forecast that BTC fever may apply downward pressure on gold.</p>
<p>CCTV is one of China’s leading, state-operated broadcasters, with a daily readership and viewership in the millions. Since the crypto crackdown of September 2017, BTC and altcoins have been strictly off the agenda for CCTV and the like – only really featuring in reports about scams and articles that seek to point out the differences between blockchain technology (which Beijing champions) and crypto (which it vilifies).</p>
<p>But internet users have taken cheer after a <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/marketresearch/2020-12-13/doc-iiznctke6229982.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from <b>China Securities</b> was <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404581727413600823#_loginLayer_1607932488146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by the CCTV news platform featuring the bold prediction that BTC was beginning to “outshine” gold.</p>
<p>One glass-half-full pundit and former <b>Messari</b> trader <a href="https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1338146048741609473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on Twitter,</p>
<blockquote class="left"><p>“Chinese state media is saying the BTC bull market may cause long-term downward pressure on gold. This is just incredible.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Another BTC enthusiast <a href="https://twitter.com/marcvanderchijs/status/1338325854204489728" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opined</a> that the news, if true, was another sign of “a huge bull market,” adding that it was “too bad Chinese can only” trade BTC on over-the-counter (OTC) platforms, as crypto exchanges are banned in the Middle Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, before BTC fans start uncorking the champagne, it may be worth remembering that the report was actually a repost of an article authored by <b>China Securities</b>, a financial media outlet with considerably more independence than CCTV.</p>
<p>And the article in question was not really about BTC at all. It was about gold prices, and the only reference to BTC was in a single paragraph containing thoughts from the London-based <b>JPMorgan Chase</b> Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou about the long-term factors that might influence gold prices.</p>
<p>But a regular China observer took to Twitter to write that the news was nonetheless significant.</p>
<div class="tweet tweetContainer"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@CryptoFlow520 @redtheminer Either way the fact that it’s getting airtime on CCTV is quite significant, I’m not sur… <a href="https://t.co/JJvmipA6gV">https://t.co/JJvmipA6gV</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Graham (@mattysino) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattysino/status/1338363883346530306"></a></blockquote><script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script></div>
<p>This may well be the case – as earlier this month, the <b>People’s Daily</b>, China’s biggest state-run newspaper, carried an <a href="http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2020/1203/c1004-31953347.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-depth explanation</a> about how BTC’s price had been rising, what factors might have caused the price surge…and eventually concluding that bitcoin investment was nonetheless dangerous.</p>
<p>Although the People’s Daily article was in fact another repost, this time of an <b>Economic Information Daily</b> <a href="http://dz.jjckb.cn/www/pages/webpage2009/html/2020-12/03/content_69637.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, also from December 3, it is still relatively rare for BTC to be given so many column inches in a Beijing mouthpiece.</p><p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/chinese-state-media-outlet-reposts-btc-outshining-gold-predi-8607.htm">Chinese State Media Outlet Reposts BTC ‘Outshining’ Gold Prediction</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>

Musk owned as much as 23% of the company as recently as 2021, but has since reduced his Tesla position substantially, and now owns around 13%, as per a February 2023 regulatory filing.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk also owns 304 million in exercisable stock options from the compensation package agreed with Tesla back in 2018.</p><iframe title="Elon Musk sells Tesla shares worth $6.9 billion" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yihelMzPsGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Musk famously has never taken a salary from his work as CEO of Tesla, opting instead to be rewarded with shares based on the performance of Tesla&rsquo;s stock price and revenue growth.&nbsp;</p><p>At the current Tesla market cap of around $566 billion as of Tuesday, Musk&rsquo;s Tesla stake is worth around $73.66 billion.</p><p>Musk&rsquo;s second largest asset is his reported 42% stake in SpaceX. Given SpaceX&rsquo;s valuation of around $137 billion in a January 2023 funding round, Musk&rsquo;s stake is thus worth in the region of $57.5 billion.</p><iframe title="Elon Musk&#039;s SpaceX tests Starship, most powerful ever rocket system - BBC News" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xyvWJ9jrf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In October 2022, Musk took over Twitter in a $44 billion leveraged buy-out and is now estimated to own about 74% of the popular social media company.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Musk paid over the odds for Twitter (hence why he tried to back out of the deal earlier in 2022).</p><iframe title="Elon Musk Buys Twitter And Starts Making Changes Right Away" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HY_CIfUyAIk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Bloomberg estimates that his 74% stake in Twitter is only now worth around $10.5 billion, implying that Twitter is currently only worth around $14.19 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Bloomberg base their estimate on the price disclosed by investor Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund in a filing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Musk has a 90% share in The Boring Company.&nbsp;</p><p>The company was valued at $5.7 billion in a fundraising round in April 2022, implying Musk&rsquo;s stake at the time is worth around $5.13 billion. Bloomberg estimates that Musk also owns other liabilities worth in the region of $3.23 billion.</p><h2><strong>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Crypto Holdings</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Elon Musk has never disclosed exactly how much cryptocurrency he owns. However, Musk is a self-proclaimed supporter of cryptocurrency, particularly of meme coin Dogecoin.</p><iframe title="Elon Musk talks about Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Cryptocurrency" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwT_m5ZWcHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mainly supporting doge, frankly, because I think doge has the memes and dogs and it seems to have a sense of humor and doesn&rsquo;t take himself too seriously,&rdquo; Musk said on the Full Send Podcast in 2022.</p><iframe title="Elon Musk Reveals His Knowledge on Aliens, Challenges Putin to UFC, and Predicts WW3" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXS_gkWAIs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In the same podcast, he revealed that he personally owned Dogecoin, Bitcoin and Ether. Tesla has also in the past invested substantial sums in Bitcoin. In February 2021, the company bought $1.5 billion worth of the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</p><p>However, in a 31<sup>st</sup> December 2022 filing, the company disclosed the value of the Bitcoin it owned was now only around $191 million, down more than 90% from the value of its holding one year earlier.</p><p>Musk explained that Tesla&rsquo;s waning interest in Bitcoin is partially as a result of concerns about the Bitcoin network&rsquo;s carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p><p>In a June 2021 Tweet, Musk said Tesla would resume allowing Bitcoin transactions once there is confirmation that 50% of mining activity is powered by clean energy and there is a positive future trend.</p><iframe title="Elon Musk’s Tesla sell most of its Bitcoin holdings – BBC News" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-aN_803Ca4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Given Musk&rsquo;s 13% Tesla stake, he indirectly owns 13% of Tesla&rsquo;s stated $191 million in Bitcoin holdings. That&rsquo;s close to $25 million in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the 31<sup>st</sup> December closing price of around $16,500, that implies Musk indirectly owns a little more than 1,500 Bitcoins, worth close to $40 million at the current market price of around $26,000.</p><h2>The Verdict</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Overall, pinning down Musk&#8217;s exact wealth is difficult and it is near-impossible to know how much crypto he really owns.&nbsp;</p><p>But Musk is undoubtedly up there with the world&#8217;s richest men and if he can turn things around at Twitter, keep pushing Tesla forward and keep making positive steps in SpaceX&#8217;s mission to colonize space, the rise Elon Musk&#8217;s net worth could well make him the world&#8217;s first trillionaire.&nbsp;</p><iframe title="Who Will Be The First TRILLIONAIRE" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4PCiaWSJm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3>Crypto Projects Linked to Musk</h3><p>Elon&#8217;s support for Dogecoin has undeniably contributed massively to the growth of the popularity of meme-coins in recent years. Successful projects have even been created in his honor, such as Floki Inu, a meme coin named after Musk&#8217;s pet Shiba Inu dog called Floki. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>One project that has gained significant attention in recent weeks is <a href="https://aidoge.com/en?source=cryptonews%20">AiDoge.com</a>, an AI-powered meme-generating platform that has already raised more than $8.6 million since its launch just a few weeks ago.<br><br>AiDoge&#8217;s platform uses advanced AI algorithms and large datasets to generate memes.</p><p>All users have to do is enter short text-based descriptions to generate memes, while holding $AI to pay the small fee for the platform.</p><p>Users can upvote and downvote created memes, with the highest-ranked images earning their creators rewards in $AI.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/aidoge/en"><strong><u>Buy AiDoge Here</u></strong></a><br><br><i><sup>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</sup></i></p>

He also had a short-lived but also successful career in mixed martial arts. Thanks to his quick wit and trash-talking abilities, Tate gained popularity as a kickboxer.&nbsp;</p><iframe title="Was Andrew Tate a Good Fighter?

The case is being heard in a court in the Southern District of New York, USA. But behind the headlines are the people who invested money &ndash; in some instances their &ldquo;life savings&rdquo; &ndash; in Celsius.</p><p>Many of these people have <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cases.stretto.com/Celsius/court-docket/#search">submitted</a> their written testimony to the court and the presiding judge, Martin Glenn, ahead of a forthcoming hearing. Here&rsquo;s what some of them had to say.</p><h2>&lsquo;Angry with myself&rsquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Frustration is the single most striking emotion that underpins the letters sent to Judge Glenn. Many explained that their decisions to use Celsius&rsquo; services have compromised life not only for themselves, but also their families.</p><p>A number of them accused the CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky, of spreading &ldquo;lies&rdquo; &ndash; and many castigated themselves for having believed his &ldquo;untruths.&rdquo;</p><p>The Florida-based Mark Hide wrote that he had &ldquo;over USD 25,000 worth of cryptocurrency deposited in a Custody account&rdquo; with Celsius, and explained:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I strongly feel that Celsius, in particular Alex Mashinsky, has lied to the community about the safety of our assets. I feel like I have been lied to and misled. I am embarrassed that I have so much money tied up in what now seems to be a scam.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>He claimed that the incident &ldquo;has affected me personally,&rdquo; adding,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[I] now have so much anger with myself for getting my family in this position. All I hope for is that I can retrieve my cryptocurrency and can keep it in storage myself and avoid any future scams.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>A Finnish citizen named Petri Tuomela, who claims to have had more than USD 50,000 locked up in Celsius, explained:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am embarrassed, sad, and angry that my life savings were invested [in] a &lsquo;bank&rsquo; which was a lie. This will have significant ramifications to my retirement and it is beyond awful.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2>The situation is &lsquo;precarious&rsquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>With the fate of their coins up in the air, some investors expressed their displeasure at the way Celsius has been handling the matter, and appear unsure how to proceed.</p><p>One individual named TK Kimmel wrote that while Celsius had &ldquo;paused its account transfers and withdrawals,&rdquo; it &ldquo;has not paused its loan activity,&rdquo; which puts Celsius customers &ldquo;in a terribly precarious situation.&rdquo;</p><p>Kimmel wrote that as Celsius &ldquo;requires customers to add more funds to their loan accounts in order to prevent liquidation,&rdquo; customers were now in a quandary.</p><p>Kimmel explained:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;How can we possibly be expected to add more funds to Celsius until we are assured the platform is safe and that we can recover all the funds we currently have stored on the platform?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>One false move, Kimmel suggested, could bring about a &ldquo;devastating loss of [&#8230;] life savings&rdquo; for customers.</p><h2>&lsquo;Blood-boiling&rsquo; rage</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A customer named Danielle wrote that it was &ldquo;not only disheartening but blood-boiling&rdquo; to learn that Celsius was &ldquo;continuing to pay their employees and high-level executives while holding the members&rsquo; assets hostage.&rdquo; She called the situation infuriating and pleaded with the judge &ldquo;not to allow this company and their executives to swindle their way out of paying their debts back to the Celsius members in full.&rdquo;</p><p>Danielle urged that Celsius executives could not &ldquo;be allowed to go on with life as normal while we lose our life savings,&rdquo; and explained:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have elderly parents whom I care for and the assets currently held in Celsius [are intended] to help them live out their last years in comfort. I pray I will see my funds returned in full.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Another customer who did not appear to provide their name claimed that their brother had &ldquo;attempted suicide&rdquo; over the matter and added:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have a mental disorder and I cannot sleep now. I haven&rsquo;t slept since the account was frozen.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The same customer begged the judge:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Please jail these people, they are still getting crazy salaries from our money. [&hellip;] They have zero shame for what they did.

Amid surging demand for his know-how, Wojciechowski has decided to commercialize the technology.</p><p>Wojciechowski, who runs an IT company in Gniezno, in Poland&rsquo;s west, <a href="https://www.onet.pl/styl-zycia/noizz/polak-ogrzewa-dom-koparka-bitcoinow-pomoze-innym-obnizyc-rachunki/hvp2ds5,3796b4dc">told</a> Polish news site Onet.pl that, under his <strong>Flame IT</strong> brand, he will supply consumers with his invention &#8212; a smart boiler that needs to be plugged into a house&rsquo;s existing heating system, and it uses the heat generated by crypto mining gear.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You will need a plumber to do this, but the process is not complicated. This boiler needs to be connected to a device that generates heat. In my case, it is my cryptocurrency mining gear,&rdquo; the miner said.</p></blockquote><p>The miner&rsquo;s bitcoin mining hardware requires 38 Kilowatt per hour (kWh) of electricity per 24 hours. In comparison, an average fridge uses 0.8 kWh in the same period. As bitcoin mining operations have boosted his household&rsquo;s energy use, Wojciechowski <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polish-miner-uses-solar-panels-to-mine-bitcoin-heat-his-hous-10877.htm">initially decided</a> to set up 31 panels on his house&rsquo;s roof, acquiring a total capacity of 9.9 Kilowatt peak (kWp). He later decided to install the same number of panels to reach a capacity of around 20 kWp.</p><p>Wojciechowski says that, to develop his product, he has established ties with a factory that specializes in making heating solutions, and also an unnamed foreign chemical company.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;This way, we have secured access to top-shelf experts and a chemical laboratory that we would never be able to build on our own,&rdquo; according to the entrepreneur.</p></blockquote><p>Wojciechowski said that this cooperation has allowed his company to acquire a chemical agent in which crypto mining hardware is dipped. The compound is &ldquo;safe not only for electronic equipment, but also for humans.&rdquo; With the use of the agent, the gear transmits its heat to the heating system which then distributes it throughout Wojciechowski&rsquo;s house.</p><p>The price of the product has not been disclosed.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polish-miner-uses-solar-panels-to-mine-bitcoin-heat-his-hous-10877.htm">Polish Miner Uses Solar Panels to Mine Bitcoin, Heat His House</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-crypto-mining-2022-new-locations-technologies-bigger-players.htm">Bitcoin &amp; Crypto Mining in 2022: New Locations, Technologies, and Bigger Players</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-see-slower-bitcoin-hashrate-growth-2022-amid-market-correction.htm">Analysts See Slower Bitcoin Hashrate Growth in 2022 Amid Market Correction</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-double-2022-compute-north-ceo-predicts.htm">Bitcoin Mining Hash Rate to Double in 2022, Compute North CEO Predicts</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polish-lawmakers-press-finance-ministry-on-crypto-firms-bank-11303.htm">Polish Lawmakers Press Finance Ministry on Crypto Firms&#8217; Bank Accounts</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polish-banks-mull-cbdc-crypto-asset-projects.htm">Polish Banks Mull CBDC, Cryptoasset Projects</a></p>
