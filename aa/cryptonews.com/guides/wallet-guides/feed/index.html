										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><img class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334962/10-best-cold-wallets.jpg" alt="10 best cold wallets" width="854"></h2><p>Cold wallets, also known as hardware wallets, are one of the safest storage solutions for your cryptocurrencies. That&rsquo;s because they store your wallet&rsquo;s seed phrase offline while being encrypted. In other words, if a hacker compromises your computer, they won&rsquo;t be able to see the seed phrase and steal your funds.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, hardware wallets require that you authorize each transaction by pressing physical buttons. So unless someone holds your hardware wallet and knows your PIN number to unlock it, they can never transfer funds out of your cold wallet. Given that over <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/01/tech/crypto-hacks-2022/index.html"><u>$3.8 billion worth of crypto was stolen in hacks in 2022</u></a>, having a cold wallet could have saved you from being in such a statistic.</p><p>To find the best cold wallets this year, we compared multiple options in terms of features and ease of use. Read more to find our top picks.</p><h2><strong>The Top 10 Cold Wallets Ranked&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In 2023, cold wallets remain the gold standard for cryptocurrency security, with top contenders like Ledger Nano S Plus and Trezor Safe 3 leading the market.</p><ol>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><strong><u>Ledger Nano S Plus</u></strong></a> &mdash; The best crypto cold wallet that comes with over 5,500 coins and tokens supported, and a companion app that lets you buy coins with a card, transfer coins or stake them to earn passive income while enjoying the Ledger safety.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><strong><u>Trezor Safe 3</u></strong></a> &mdash; This is a popular cold storage wallet that aside from protecting your coins, you can obscure your crypto transactions or use Shamir Backup to restore your account.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><strong><u>Ledger Stax</u></strong></a> &mdash; A premium cold wallet designed for NFT enthusiasts. It boasts Bluetooth connectivity and wireless charging, as well as a large E Ink touchscreen.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><strong><u>Trezor Model T</u></strong></a> &mdash; Trezor&rsquo;s premium model comes with an additional safety feature via a micro SD card slot that further protects access to your funds with an encrypted PIN. It also comes with LED touchscreen buttons.</li>
<li><strong>ELLIPAL Titan Cold Wallet</strong> &mdash; Leading crypto cold wallet designed with 100% protection via full metal cover, air-gapped and with self-destruct technology in case of device tampering.</li>
<li><strong>KeepKey</strong> &mdash; An affordable cold wallet with Thorchain exchange integration for seamless swapping of coins.</li>
<li><strong>Blockstream Jade</strong> &mdash; A Bitcoin-only wallet that comes with one of the lowest prices for a cold wallet. It supports multisig technology for approving transactions, a camera for scanning QR codes and more.</li>

<li><strong>CoolWallet Pro</strong> &mdash; is a credit card-sized crypto wallet with a strong battery that lasts up to two weeks. It connects to your smartphone via encrypted Bluetooth where you can stake your coins or make transactions.</li>
</ol><h2><strong>The Best Cold Crypto Wallets Reviewed</strong></h2><p>Let&#8217;s explore the most popular cold storage wallets that crypto investors are using right now to secure their altcoin holdings.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1. Ledger Nano S Plus &mdash; Overall Best Cold Crypto Wallet, Supported By Live App</strong></h3><p>This is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger&rsquo;s</u></a> entry-level wallet. But don&rsquo;t let this fool you. Ledger Nano S Plus offers the same functionality as the more expensive Ledger Nano X. The main difference between the two is that the Ledger Nano X has Bluetooth and it feels like it&rsquo;s made with higher-quality materials.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Ledger Nano S Plus" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334939/ledger-nano-s-plus.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p><br>The app that all Ledger devices use is called Ledger Live. This is both a mobile app and a desktop app. You can use it to buy coins with a credit card, swap them using decentralized exchanges like 1Inch and others, or stake your coins.</p><p>Ledger Nano S Plus supports over 5,500 coins, which is the same as the more expensive Nano X version, and you can also hold NFTs in your wallet.</p><p>Since it doesn&rsquo;t support Bluetooth connectivity, you can connect your Ledger cold wallet via a USB-C cable with your smartphone or computer. This shouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal if you mostly use your Ledger wallet for storing coins. If you plan to actively transfer coins or trade, the Ledger Nano X could be the better option due to its Bluetooth support.</p><p>Ledger&rsquo;s support is top-notch. If something happens to your device, say it breaks or malfunctions, Ledger will send you a replacement free of charge. All this makes Ledger Nano S Plus the best cold wallet in 2023.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Ledger Live mobile and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports staking, swapping and buying with a card</li>
<li>Over 5,500 coins and tokens supported</li>
<li>Multiple accessories to customize your Ledger</li>
</ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul>
<li>No Bluetooth</li>
<li>No wallet seed phrase backup recovery yet</li>

Trezor Safe 3 &mdash; Obscure Transactions &amp; Restore Your Seed Phrase if Lost</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><u>Trezor Safe 3</u></a> is the best offering from Trezor because it offers the same functionality as the most expensive cold wallet but at an affordable price. Trezor Safe 3 comes with a monochromatic OLED screen where you can see the transaction information, and USB-C connectivity since it doesn&rsquo;t have Bluetooth.</p><p>This shouldn&rsquo;t be a dealbreaker, though, as cold wallets are designed for long-term storage and not active trading.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Trezor Safe 3" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334943/trezor-safe-3.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Some of the safety features of this Trezor cold wallet include the Secure Element (EAL6+) and the passphrase to unlock your device, which makes it hard for hackers to steal your assets. Another feature of Trezor cold wallets is the Shamir Backup, which splits your seed phrase into up to 16 pieces to help you recover your seed phrase if you lose it, meaning if you lose one piece or it gets stolen, you can still recover your assets.</p><p>As a companion to this Trezor cold wallet is the Trezor Suite app available on mobile, desktop and browser. Via the app, you can send, receive and trade over 8,000 cryptocurrencies</p><p>Unlike most cold wallets, Trezor has open-source software, which can be examined by anyone to ensure it&#8217;s safe. Another interesting feature is that you can go incognito with Coinjoin, which lumps multiple transactions into one, thus obscuring your transactions, and you can protect your identity with Tor.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Trezor Suite mobile, browser and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports sending, receiving and trading via the app</li>

Ledger Stax &mdash; Store Over 5,000 Cryptocurrencies, Wireless Charging &amp; Bluetooth Connectivity</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger Stax</u></a> is one of the most innovative cold wallets you can find. It looks like a small ebook reader because of its curved E Ink touchscreen. Because of that, it is mostly designed for storing your NFT collections because you can put your favorite NFT on the screen like an ebook cover.</p><p>Aside from its interesting design, it supports wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and it&rsquo;s highly customizable. This means you can connect your Stax with your Ledger Live mobile app and sign transactions without using cables.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Ledger Stax" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334944/ledger-stax.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>As the name suggests, you can &ldquo;stack&rdquo; multiple Stax wallets one on top of the other, if you have multiple wallets. For example, one Stax could hold your Ethereum NFTs, a second one could store your Solana NFTs, and a third could store your coins.</p><p>Of course, one Stax is enough to hold all of the above. But if you want to have multiple Stax&rsquo;s, say one for yourself, another for a family member, all with different screen images, you can easily do so.</p><p>Similar to the other two Ledgers, Stax uses the Ledger Live mobile and desktop app to swap coins, stake coins or buy them with a card. Also, the Ledger Live app is used to update your cold wallet&rsquo;s firmware.</p><p>With all these features and functionality, Stax comes with an eye-watering price of around $279, which is on the higher end compared to other cold wallets. Despite that, if you are an NFT enthusiast and you can afford it, Stax is one of the best cold wallets you can get.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>

</figure><h2><strong>What is a Cryptocurrency Cold Wallet?</strong></h2><p>A crypto cold storage wallet, also known as a hardware wallet, is a device with specifically designed hardware to encrypt and store your wallet&rsquo;s seed phrase offline and in a safe environment. Hot wallets, on the other hand, store your seed phrase online. If a hacker has access to your computer, they can see your seed phrase and use it to steal your funds.</p><p>Cold wallets typically have physical buttons, or touchscreen buttons depending on the device, which are used for signing transactions on the blockchain. This makes it hard for scammers and hackers to steal your funds unless they physically hold the device. What&rsquo;s more, each cold wallet is locked with a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA. The fraudsters will also need to know that to unlock your wallet.</p><p><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Ledged crypto app" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334952/ledger.jpg" data-srcset=""><br>Using a companion app, these wallets can store crypto assets including cryptocurrencies and NFTs. You can also trade, swap, stake and more with these apps, giving cold wallets the same functionality as hot wallets but with added security.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, you can connect your cold wallet to a hot wallet like MetaMask or Phantom, which makes connecting to DeFi applications seamless. For every transaction you make, you will have to sign it with the buttons on your device.</p><h2><strong>How do Cold Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>All cold storage crypto wallets have a seed phrase, consisting of 12 or 24 words, which you can use to restore your wallet and access your crypto funds in case something happens to your computer or smartphone. That&rsquo;s because your crypto wallet and assets are stored on the blockchain. Using the seed phrase you actually prove that you own the wallet.</p><h3><strong>Cold Wallets Store Your Seed Phrase Offline</strong></h3><p>Cold wallets generate and store the user&rsquo;s private keys on the physical device. This means the seed phrase is never exposed on your computer screen while you&rsquo;re connected to the Internet. This way, hackers can never see your seed phrase via your computer even if your computer is compromised.</p><p>If the user needs to restore a private key, they enter the seed phrase directly on the device itself, which is encrypted and offline.</p><h3><strong>You Need to Press a Button to Sign Transactions</strong></h3><p>Aside from keeping your seed phrase safe, cold wallets have another safety feature. You have to physically press buttons on the cold wallet to authorize transactions. This way, no one can authorize the transaction except the person who holds the cold wallet device.</p><p>To increase security, cold wallets use a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA to unlock the device. If someone manages to steal your hardware wallet, they would need to know your access codes to unlock it.</p><blockquote>
<h3><strong>Why Is The Seed Phrase Important?</strong></h3>
<p>The crypto wallet seed phrase, often made of 12 to 24 randomly generated words, is the backup key to your wallet. This sequence of words is linked to the private keys and acts as a mnemonic representation to retrieve access to the assets within the wallet.</p>
<p>For example, you create a crypto wallet and you don&rsquo;t save the seed phrase. If you need to reinstall your operating system, someone steals your computer or your cold wallet breaks and you don&rsquo;t know your wallet&rsquo;s seed phrase, you won&rsquo;t be able to access your digital wallet and your funds will be trapped.</p>
<p>To protect your seed phrase, you need to write it down on a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe. Some cold wallet providers, like Ledger, sell metal seed phrase protectors that can withstand fire and damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><h2><strong>Advantages of Cold Crypto Wallets</strong></h2><p>The main advantage of a cold wallet is enhanced security. Since you need to physically press buttons on the wallet, you are safe from remote access hacks.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3><p>The best advantage of cold crypto wallets is their superior protection against online vulnerabilities. Cold wallets aren&rsquo;t connected to the internet, making them immune to cyber attacks.</p><p>This includes protection from hacking attempts, phishing schemes, malware infections and other malicious activities. By storing private keys offline, cold wallets ensure that access to your funds is protected.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Unauthorized Access Protection</strong></h3><p>Cold wallets require that you physically press a button to sign a transaction. In the unfortunate event that a malicious actor has gained access to your computer accounts and companion cold wallet app, they can&rsquo;t move your funds without you pressing the buttons.</p><p>This acts as a physical barrier against unauthorized access and theft, giving you peace of mind that your funds are protected even when you sleep.</p><h3><strong>Long-Term Safekeeping</strong></h3><p>Crypto cold wallets are designed for the long-term storing of your crypto assets. That&rsquo;s because the safety feature of pressing buttons to authorize transactions can become a nuisance if you plan to use your cold wallet device for active trading. What&rsquo;s more, active trading requires that you connect to multiple decentralized apps, which could potentially pose a threat if they&rsquo;re hacked.</p><p>Unlike hot wallets, which are designed for frequent transactions and daily use, cold wallets are better suited for &#8220;hodling&#8221;, which is for keeping your assets safe long-term.</p><h3><strong>Immune to Platform Failures</strong></h3><p>Online platforms and exchanges are known to experience downtimes, glitches and even hacks. For example, <a href="https://decrypt.co/150669/defi-exchange-curve-finance-confirms-various-ethereum-pools-hacked"><u>DeFi exchange Curve Finance had various Ethereum pools hacked</u></a> where $52 million were stolen.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/13/north-korean-attackers-linked-to-54m-coinex-hack-blockchain-data-suggests/"><u>CoinEx lost $54 million in a hack</u></a>. If you had funds in these two platforms or any other where the assets were compromised, you could have lost all your funds.</p><p>Cold wallets eliminate this risk because you have full control over your assets and how they move.</p><h2><strong>Cold Wallets vs Hot Wallets</strong></h2><p>Both cold wallets and hot wallets are designed to store your digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But there are some differences between the two.</p><h3><strong>Assets Safety</strong></h3><p>One of the main differences between cold wallets and hot wallets is safety. Hot wallets provide you with a seed phrase visible on your computer screen or smartphone when you open a new wallet. Cold wallets, on the other hand, provide you with a seed phrase directly on the screen of the hardware wallet, which isn&rsquo;t connected to the internet.</p><p>This means that unless someone looks directly at your hardware wallet&rsquo;s screen when you read and write the 12 to 24 words, there is no way that they can know your seed phrase to steal your funds.</p><h3><strong>Transaction Execution</strong></h3><p>Another difference between these two types of wallets is how transactions are executed. You can sign transactions with one click using hot wallets, which makes it an excellent choice for frequent trading or using decentralized apps.</p><p>Cold wallets, however, have buttons that you have to physically press to sign the transaction. What&rsquo;s more, you need to unlock your crypto cold wallet device with a PIN, a passphrase or 2FA. This makes signing transactions more complex but also safer.</p><h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3><p>Due to being safer, the best cold wallets are designed for long-term safekeeping. This means that once you buy your crypto assets, you send them to your cold wallet and you leave them there until you decide to sell.</p><p>Hot wallets are designed to be exploited daily. Connect your hot wallets to decentralized exchanges, yield farming protocols or NFT marketplaces and feel free to continuously sign transactions. You can always move your profits into your cold wallets for safekeeping.</p><h2><strong>How to Choose a Cold Cryptocurrency Wallet</strong></h2><p>Choosing the best cold wallet is a decision that requires weighing in several factors, including security features, supported cryptocurrencies, mobile app experience as well as pricing.</p><h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3><p>This is the main reason to get a cold wallet. But there are nuances that you have to consider as not all cold wallets are created equal. For example, some users prefer Bluetooth connectivity so they can easily sign transactions on their smartphones without using cables.</p><p>Other users may consider Bluetooth as a liability and prefer to have air-gapped devices, meaning they have no wireless contact of any kind that could compromise security.</p><p>Also, look for wallets that have a proven track record of security, like Ledger and Trezor, which employ strong encryption methods. Additionally, consider the wallet&#8217;s recovery options. In case the wallet is lost or damaged you will have to use your seed phrase to access your wallet.</p><p>But sometimes you could lose your seed phrase as well. Every Trezor cold wallet has a solution for this via something called Shamir Backup where you split your seed phrase into several pieces. If one piece is lost or stolen, you can still recover your wallet.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Ledger Recover" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334956/ledger-recover.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Ledger has recently employed a similar <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/24/crypto-wallet-maker-ledger-officially-rolls-out-recover-unleashing-fresh-round-of-snark/"><u>wallet recovery feature called Ledger Recover</u></a>. This is a paid feature where you have to submit valid ID documents and a selfie recording. Once approved, your device will encrypt your seed phrase and split it into three fragments, which will be used to recover your seed phrase. Because your seed phrase is locked to your ID, you can be the only one who can request the recovery fragments.</p><blockquote>
<h3><strong>What is Shamir Backup?</strong></h3>
<p>Shamir Backup is a security standard that aims to protect your seed phrase. The way it works is your seed phrase is split up into pieces, called recovery shares, and you can store them at various places. If one of the pieces is lost or damaged, you can still recover your assets.</p>
<p>Recovery shares are sequences of 20 or 33 words that carry part of the cryptographic secret. When you combine the number of shares you create a master seed, which you can use to recover your wallet.</p>
</blockquote><h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>Most crypto cold wallets support the most popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, but they also support thousands of other coins and tokens. However, some wallets, like Blockstream Jade, support only Bitcoin and no other coin.</p><p>That is why you have to consider what you really need before buying a cold wallet. If you only want to hold Bitcoin and sell it in 10 years, then Blockstream Jade could be a perfect wallet; it&rsquo;s cheaper, it&rsquo;s reliable and it&rsquo;s safe. But if you want to store multiple coins and do multi-chain swaps, then Trezor or Ledger wallets are typically the way to go.</p><h3><strong>Companion Mobile App</strong></h3><p>Even though cold wallets are designed to be offline storage devices, most of them come with companion mobile apps that allow you to monitor your portfolio, to initiate transactions, to stake your idle coins, to use decentralized apps like Uniswap and 1inch exchange, and more.</p><p>That is why it&rsquo;s important to consider cold storage wallets that meet your requirements. Ledger&rsquo;s Ledger Live app is one of the best companion apps, where you can stake your idle coins. This feature isn&rsquo;t available in most other cold wallet apps.</p><p>Another valuable app is the Trezor Suite, which has similar functionalities to Ledger Live, but it can also help obscure your transactions with Coinjoin.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Trezor Suite" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334958/trezor-suite.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><h3><strong>Device Cost</strong></h3><p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/21/mark-cuban-lost-nearly-900000-dollars-to-crypto-hackers.html"><u>Mark Cuban lost nearly $900,000 to crypto hackers</u></a> by installing a fake MetaMask app. If this happened to him it could happen to everyone. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to own a cold wallet and never share your seed phrase regardless of the device&rsquo;s cost.</p><p>However, if two or more devices share a similar price point while offering the same functionality, you could spend the extra money investing in crypto. Compare the wallets you are willing to get and see whether paying a premium is worth it.</p><h2><strong>Limitations of Cold Wallets</strong></h2><p>While cold wallets offer security advantages, there are some limitations to consider. Before opting for a cold wallet, weigh the benefits against the potential inconveniences associated with cold storage.</p><p>Susceptible to physical attacks. Someone could steal your hardware wallet or it could be damaged or lost. If you don&rsquo;t have your seed phrase ready, you won&rsquo;t be able to recover your assets.</p><p>Regular transactions. Cold wallets are designed for storage, which makes them inconvenient for everyday transaction signing. That&rsquo;s because you have to physically press a button every time you wish to make a transaction. If you&rsquo;re making hundreds of transactions each day, it could be tedious to approve them every time on your hardware wallet.</p><p>Cost. While hot wallets are free to use, cold wallets come with a purchase price. Of course, this is a small price to pay for the safety of your crypto assets. But you still have to weigh in whether you really need a cold wallet or not for your intended use cases.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The 10 best cold wallets for 2023 stand out not only for their robust security features but also for their user-friendly companion apps, a wide range of coin support and innovative functionalities. Whether you&rsquo;re a beginner in the crypto space or a seasoned investor, buying a cold wallet is probably one of the most prudent investments you can make.</p><p>Consider one of the three Ledger devices to hold your crypto assets. These are some of the best on the market, with strong safety features and a mobile app that lets you stake your coins or trade them whenever you want.</p><p>Ledger S Plus supports over 5,500 coins for an affordable price. But if you&rsquo;re looking for Bluetooth connectivity, Ledger Nano X could be a better option.</p><div class="raw-html-embed">

If that&#8217;s not enough, active Best Wallet users become eligible for the $BEST token airdrop.</li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/youhodler/"><strong><u>YouHodler</u></strong></a> &#8211; This is is a top rated crypto wallet that comes with multi-chain support and 15% APY on certain coins.

As a regulated platform with licenses from multiple jurisdictions, eToro has institutional-grade security controls in place.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, it keeps the majority of cryptocurrencies in cold storage. eToro also offers two-factor authentication. Although not mandatory, it&#8217;s wise to switch this on for added security. We also like that the eToro wallet can be accessed without needing to download any software. Instead, users simply need to log into their eToro account to access their cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2142" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_2142_1138.jpg 2142w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_1200_637.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_900_478.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_720_382.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_600_318.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_300_159.jpg 300w"></figure><p>That said, eToro also offers a crypto wallet app for iOS and Android. This will appeal to investors wanting more control of their cryptocurrencies. For example, to send or receive funds via the blockchain. eToro supports a huge range of cryptocurrencies across many different networks. This includes Bitcoin, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, XRP, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, BNB, and many others.&nbsp;</p><p>The eToro wallet also allows investors to trade cryptocurrencies. The minimum trade requirement is just $10, or about 820 INR. Trading commissions amount to 1% of the trade size. eToro is also ideal for first-time investors that do not currently own cryptocurrencies. This is because its wallet supports fiat payments, including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Skrill, and bank wires.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1888" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_1888_1282.jpg 1888w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_1200_814.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_900_611.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_720_488.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_600_407.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_300_203.jpg 300w"></figure><p>eToro will also appeal to long-term investors that prefer to have their crypto portfolios managed on their behalf. Its smart portfolio feature offers hand-picked baskets of cryptocurrencies. eToro rebalances each portfolio periodically based on broader market conditions. There are no additional fees, but smart portfolios require a minimum investment of $500, or about 41,000 INR.</p><p>Another popular feature of eToro is its in-built staking tool. This allows investors to automatically earn interest on their cryptocurrencies. Supported coins include Tron, Cardano, and Ethereum. eToro also offers a copy trading feature. This is another passive investment tool. But instead of investing in hand-picked portfolios, users will mirror the positions of a seasoned crypto trader.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1670" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1670_1120.jpg 1670w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1200_805.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_900_604.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_720_483.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_600_402.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_300_201.jpg 300w"></figure><p>We also like eToro for its customer service department.

Ledger &#8211; Cold Crypto Wallet Device for the Highest Security &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/">Ledger </a>is one of the best crypto wallets for Indian investors seeking the highest level of security. Launched in 2014, Ledger offers hardware devices that keep cryptocurrencies offline in cold storage. This is the safest way to store digital assets, as they are not exposed to hacking attacks. In fact, the Ledger wallet even remains offline when transferring funds.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because the wallet connects to mobile and desktop devices via a USB cable or Bluetooth. Moreover, outgoing transactions can only be confirmed on the device itself. This is achieved by entering a PIN, which the user creates when setting the Ledger device up. Ledger also provides users with a 24-word passphrase.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2718" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_2718_1210.jpg 2718w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_1200_534.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_900_401.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_720_321.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_600_267.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_300_134.jpg 300w"></figure><p>This is the private key for the wallet, so should be kept somewhere safe. Ledger also allows users to add a 25th word of their choosing &#8211; up to 100 characters. This means that even if a bad actor knows the 24-word passphrase, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to access the wallet. We also like that Ledger can be recovered remotely if the device is stolen.&nbsp;</p><p>Ledger comes with both a mobile and desktop app (Ledger Live) where users can monitor their crypto portfolios. The Ledger app also allows users to connect with third-party services such as 1inch DEX, MoonPay, and Lido staking. They provide a software wallet that can be connected to the hardware wallet for increased functionality.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_900_393.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_720_314.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_600_262.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_300_131.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Ledger is a major competitor to Trezor, another hardware wallet.

Data is also anonymous, because when users login to web applications they are often far more vulnerable. Three versions are currently available &#8211;&nbsp; Model One, Trezor Safe 3, and the advanced Model T. These models can be compared on the site.</p><p>The beauty of Trezor is that it is very simple to set up and operate, but there are multiple optional add-on features that users can select depending on what they are looking for. For instance, it&#8217;s possible to create multiple wallets within Trezor, or take advantage of CoinJoin for increased privacy. A sign and verify features allows crypto addresses to be vetted, while the Tor browser is supported within the Trezor application. Plus, a whopping 8,000 coins and tokens are supported.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_900_372.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_720_298.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_600_248.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_300_124.jpg 300w"></figure><p>For the Indian investors who are purely concerned with security, Trezor is definitely the way to go.

We found that most features on MyEtherWallet are user-friendly and require no prior experience. For example, MyEtherWallet connects to StakeWise and Lido, which facilitate Ethereum staking. This allows users to generate passive rewards on idle ETH balances.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2408" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316026/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_2408_1258.jpg 2408w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_1200_627.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_900_470.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_720_376.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_600_313.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316026/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_300_157.jpg 300w"></figure><p>MyEtherWallet also connects to selected dApps like Aave. Golem Migrator and MakerDAO will be added in the near future. Additionally, users can also swap ERC20 tokens directly within the wallet. This service is provided by third parties, so keep an eye on fees. That said, standard features on MyEtherWallet are free of charge.&nbsp;</p><p>This includes receiving and storing tokens. GAS fees are charged when sending funds to another wallet. But GAS is quoted by the Ethereum blockchain, meaning MyEtherWallet doesn&#8217;t make any money from outgoing transactions.

They operate much like a bank account, allowing Indians to store, send and receive funds. But unlike a bank account, crypto wallets are connected to the blockchain network.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that transactions are processed without the sender or receiver revealing their identity. Instead, wallet transactions are sent to a &#8216;public address&#8217;. This is similar to a bank account number. All crypto wallets come with a unique public address, and there is no limit to the amount that can be created.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto wallets also come with &#8216;private keys&#8217;. This provides access to the crypto wallet, much like a bank account password. Investors should never reveal their private keys to anyone. If they do, a bad actor can access the wallet and steal the cryptocurrency tokens being stored.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1280" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/finance-gf775d132b-1280.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_1280_853.jpg 1280w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_1200_800.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_900_600.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w"></figure><p>As a decentralized technology, there is no third party to help recover stolen cryptocurrencies. Moreover, it is important that the private keys are kept somewhere safe but easily accessible. This is because the private keys will be needed if the user forgets the password to their wallet. If both the password <i>and</i> private keys are no longer available, the wallet cannot be recovered.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two different types of crypto wallets &#8211; non-custodial and custodian. Non-custodial wallets, otherwise referred to as &#8216;self custody&#8217;, give investors full control of their private keys. This means that third parties &#8211; including the wallet provider, cannot access the cryptocurrencies being stored. Non-custodial wallets are best suited for experienced crypto investors.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How do Crypto Wallets Work?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We will now explore how crypto wallets work in much more detail.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Public Address</strong></h3><p>All crypto wallets will come with a public address. This will be a unique, long string of numbers and characters. There is no harm in sharing a public address. On the contrary, the public address will need to be sent to the sender when receiving funds.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Suppose an Indian investor wants to buy Bitcoin from an online exchange</li><li>They buy 0.5 BTC and now want to withdraw the tokens to a private wallet for safekeeping</li><li>The investor would need to copy their public address from their wallet</li><li>They would then paste the address into the exchange platform when making the withdrawal</li><li>Once approved, the 0.5 BTC should arrive in the private wallet in 10-20 minutes</li></ul><p>The above example highlights that crypto transactions are not too dissimilar to bank account transfers. After all, the recipient will provide the sender with their account number so that they can receive funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Public wallet addresses, however, are long and complex.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of an online Bitcoin wallet address:</p><p><strong>3MgEAFWu1HKSnZ5ZsC8qf61ZW18xrP5pgd</strong></p><p>The above wallet address belongs to the crypto exchange <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okx/">OKX</a>, as per <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3MgEAFWu1HKSnZ5ZsC8qf61ZW18xrP5pgd">BitInfoCharts</a>. The blockchain is transparent, so we can see that the wallet currently holds over 31,551 BTC tokens, valued at almost $979 million.&nbsp;</p><p>The transparent nature of cryptocurrencies is something to bear in mind when sharing a wallet address. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3><p>Crypto wallets are protected by private keys. They provide full ownership of the wallet and any cryptocurrencies being stored.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if the user forgets the password to their wallet, they can regain access by typing in the private keys. The private keys do not need to be entered on the same device that the wallet is stored on.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, the wallet can be accessed at any time, anywhere, as long as the private keys are known. This should be a reminder that private keys should be kept safe in a secure location. Most crypto investors will write their private keys down.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of what a Bitcoin private key looks like:</p><p><strong>E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262</strong></p><p>As is evident, private keys are even more complex than public addresses. This increases the risk of making a mistake when writing them down. &nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2000" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_2000_1170.jpg 2000w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_1200_702.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_900_527.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_720_421.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_600_351.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_300_176.jpg 300w"></figure><p>This is why the best crypto wallets in India provide users with a &#8216;backup passphrase&#8217; rather than the full private key. This is usually a string of 12 or 24 words. The passphrase must be written down in the correct order. Otherwise, they won&#8217;t work when attempting to recover a wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Custodianship</strong></h3><p>Understanding how custodianship works is also important when learning about crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>Non-custodial wallets do not have access to the user&#8217;s private keys. This information is only provided to the owner of the wallet, meaning the owner has full control over their funds.</p><p>Some investors in India do not feel comfortable taking the above risks. This is because of a lack of knowledge or experience of wallet security.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative option is to store cryptocurrencies in a custodial wallet. This will be controlled by a third party, which also presents risks. However, the best custodial wallet providers are regulated entities.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, eToro is regulated by bodies in the UK, Australia, Cyprus, and the US. The eToro custodial wallet also comes with solid security features. For example, eToro sends an SMS with a unique code when logging into the wallet. Without the code, access to the wallet is prohibited.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do You Need a Crypto Wallet? Key Reasons Explained&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Whether or not a crypto wallet is needed depends on the goals of the individual.</p><ul><li>For example, many Indian investors will buy cryptocurrencies from a regulated platform that does not offer non-custodial wallets.&nbsp;</li><li>This is because the platform will have its own centralized wallet that stores all client-owned cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li><li>This enables investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without actually needing a wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>As long as the chosen platform is credible, secure, and regulated &#8211; the cryptocurrencies will remain safe.&nbsp;</li><li>When the investor wishes to cash out back to INR, they can sell the cryptocurrencies and make a withdrawal to a bank account or debit/credit card.</li></ul><p>Some investors will want more control over their cryptocurrencies. For example, those wanting to send or receive funds via the blockchain will need a wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, if an investor does not want to trust a third-party custodian, they will need to choose a wallet that offers non-custodial storage. This means that only the investor has access to the private keys. And hence, they can transact freely without requiring approval from a custodian.</p><p>A private wallet is also required to invest in DeFi products. For example, earning interest on <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, Uniswap, or PancakeSwap.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Indian investors will need to consider their objectives and prior experience. In doing so, they can choose the best crypto wallet in India for their individual profile.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What are the Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets?</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Investors will need to choose between a software or hardware wallet. Both come with varying levels of security and convenience. For example, software wallets make it easy to transact but come with reduced security. While Bitcoin hardware wallets are much safer but are less convenient. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Still not sure how crypto wallets work? In this section, we discuss the different types of crypto wallets alongside their pros and cons.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Casual investors and active traders will be suited for a software wallet. These are &#8216;hot&#8217; wallets, meaning they are always connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>This increases the risks, considering that software wallets are not immune to hackers. This is why it&#8217;s important to pick a software wallet with adequate security features.&nbsp;</p><p>Software wallets come in many different forms. Desktop wallets, for example, can be downloaded to a laptop or PC. Mobile wallets come as mobile apps and offer added convenience.&nbsp;</p><p>Web wallets are also an option. These are offered by custodians like eToro and can be accessed from any desktop or mobile device with an internet connection.&nbsp;</p><p>Some wallets also offer a browser extension. This is also a convenient option but limits access to desktop devices. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Long-term investors and traders with large balances might opt for a crypto hardware wallet. This wallet type comes as a small physical device. The wallet only will need to confirm transactions on the device itself, usually via a PIN.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto hardware wallets are also known as &#8216;cold wallets&#8217;. This is because they are not connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this makes them immune to online hacking attempts. One of the best crypto hardware wallets is the Ledger Nano S Plus. This is available to buy for $79 directly from the <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger website</a>. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>Another way to keep cryptocurrencies in cold storage is a paper wallet. The wallet&#8217;s private keys are written or printed on a sheet of paper and then kept somewhere safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering that the private keys are always stored offline, hacking risks are alleviated. While paper wallets can be recovered remotely, the process can be cumbersome.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because the private keys will need to be manually imported into a software wallet. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tips for Selecting the Best India Bitcoin Wallet&nbsp;</strong></h2><blockquote><p>While the best India Bitcoin wallets come with solid security tools, investors should also consider other factors. For example, does the wallet offer additional features like staking or trading? Investors should also explore how user-friendly the wallet is and whether it&#8217;s suitable for their experience level. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Considering how many India crypto wallets there are, knowing which one to choose can be difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>We have created a checklist to help Indians choose the best crypto wallet for their needs.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>The first thing to check is what coins are supported by the crypto wallet. For example, Electrum only supports Bitcoin. Similarly, MyEtherWallet only supports Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Indians with a diversified portfolio might consider the Best Wallet. This supports Ethereum, Polygon, BNB and dozens of other popular cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/best-wallet.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_900_374.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_720_299.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_600_249.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_300_125.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Trust Wallet is also a good option for supported coins. It is compatible with over 70 blockchain networks and allows users to add custom tokens.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wallet Type</strong></h3><p>Indian investors should also think about the <i>type</i> of crypto wallet they prefer.&nbsp;</p><p>First, consider whether a custodial or non-custodial wallet is more suitable.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Inexperienced investors might prefer a custodial wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>Those wanting more control over their crypto tokens might be better suited for a non-custodial wallet.</li></ul><p>Additionally, investors should think about the device they want to store the wallet on. For example, Best Wallet offers a mobile app with the web app being built. While Ledger is available as a hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Desktop users might consider Exodus, as it supports over 50 blockchain networks and is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3><p>Investors should also ensure the crypto wallet aligns with their experience level.&nbsp;</p><p>Complete beginners might prefer a user-friendly custodial wallet like best Wallet. This is because no prior knowledge of wallet security is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>More experienced investors might prefer the OKX wallet. This offers non-custodial storage alongside MPC technology. It also supports cross-chain token swaps and staking.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3><p>Basic wallet functions are usually free, such as receiving and storing cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Software wallets are also free to download and maintain. But hardware wallets will come at a cost. For example, the Ledger Nano S Plus retails for $79. But the more advanced Ledger Stax costs over $279.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, check what fees apply when sending cryptocurrencies to another wallet. The GAS charges quoted should reflect the current blockchain fee.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Trading and Other Features</strong></h3><p>Indians should also explore what features the wallet comes with.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Indian Bitcoin wallets discussed today allow investors to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. But it&#8217;s important to assess what charges will apply for these services.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Best Wallet users who stake their coins will pay no fees to swap coins.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, MetaMask charges up to 5% when buying crypto with fiat money. This is also the case with Trust Wallet and Ledger.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for this is that these wallets use third parties for fiat transactions. eToro, on the other hand, handles payments directly &#8211; so is able to offer competitive fees. &nbsp;</p><p>Some investors in India will also look for wallets that support staking. This allows users to earn passive rewards without leaving the wallet. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Get and Use an India Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Ready to get started with a crypto wallet but need some guidance?</p><p>If so, follow the three-step walkthrough below to set up the Best Wallet mobile app. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download the Best Wallet app</strong></h3><p>Indian investors need to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">download the Best Wallet app</a> on the App Store or Google Play to use it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="323" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333558/bw7.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333558/responsive-images/bw7___media_library_original_323_700.jpg 323w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333558/responsive-images/bw7___media_library_original_300_650.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2: Open the Best Wallet App</strong></h3><p>Once you open the app, you&#8217;ll have to verify your email address. If you want to increase your app&#8217;s security, now is your chance. You&#8217;ll be asked to activate two-factor authentication. You can skip this step if you don&#8217;t want to, though. You can always activate this feature later on.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333557/bw4.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333557/responsive-images/bw4___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333557/responsive-images/bw4___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Regardless of whether you skip this step or activate 2FA, you will have to set up a four-digit password. If your device supports biometrics such as fingerprint or face ID, you can activate this feature as well.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Wallet</strong></h3><p>Create your main wallet, which is on the Ethereum blockchain. During this step, you can create multiple wallets and give them names, such as &#8220;Storage&#8221; or &#8220;NFT wallet&#8221;. You can also change the background color, so you can easily identify each wallet within the app.</p><p>Tap &#8220;Continue&#8221; when you&#8217;re done.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333556/bw3.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333556/responsive-images/bw3___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333556/responsive-images/bw3___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3><p>With your wallet set up, you can now buy coins with a card or you can receive coins from exchanges or your other wallets. The Best DEX is available for you to start swapping coins and using the wallet. The more you use it, the bigger the chance of getting the $BEST token airdrops during Phase 6 of development.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333555/bw1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333555/responsive-images/bw1___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333555/responsive-images/bw1___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><h2><strong>How Safe Are Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2><p>The type of wallet chosen will determine how safe the cryptocurrencies are. A good starting point is to differentiate between custodial and non-custodial wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>If the investor opts for a custodial wallet, then they must do some due diligence on the custodian itself. For example, most custodians are <i>unregulated</i> exchanges. This option should be avoided.&nbsp;</p><p>If the investor opts for a non-custodial wallet, then they will be responsible for keeping the cryptocurrencies and private keys safe.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If the private keys are misplaced and end up in the wrong hands, the cryptocurrencies will likely be stolen</li><li>If the investor forgets their password and no longer has access to the private keys, the cryptocurrencies in the wallet will be lost forever&nbsp;</li></ul><p>To reduce the risk of losing access to the non-custodial wallet, look for providers that offer the following security features:</p><ul><li>Multisig permissions, which require transactions to be approved from two or more wallets. This removes a single point of failure.&nbsp;</li><li>A single point of failure can also be avoided by using an <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/mpc-wallet">MPC wallet</a>. This splits the private key across multiple locations.&nbsp;</li><li>Cold storage wallets will keep the private keys offline at all times, removing their exposure to live servers.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ultimately, if the investor has a significant amount of cryptocurrency to hand, cold wallets are the best option.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><p>As cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming popular in India, investors now have many options when selecting a wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the best crypto wallet in India is Best Wallet. Access the wallet via its iOS or Android app and swap coins between multiple blockchains. Future releases will include market insights, crypto news and token analytics, which will make Best Wallet the most powerful Web3 wallet. &nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison"><strong>https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/298361"><strong>https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/298361</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain"><strong>https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/"><strong>https://pancakeswap.finance/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://opensea.io/"><strong>https://opensea.io/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://aave.com/"><strong>https://aave.com/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okx/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okx/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3MgEAFWu1HKSnZ5ZsC8qf61ZW18xrP5pgd"><strong>https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3MgEAFWu1HKSnZ5ZsC8qf61ZW18xrP5pgd</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/6512619-using-mew-offline-current-mew-version-6"><strong>https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/6512619-using-mew-offline-current-mew-version-6</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mew-crypto-wallet-defi-web3/id1464614025"><strong>https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mew-crypto-wallet-defi-web3/id1464614025</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myetherwallet.mewwallet&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US"><strong>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myetherwallet.mewwallet&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/mpc-wallet"><strong>https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/mpc-wallet</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-gb/glossary/kyc"><strong>https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-gb/glossary/kyc</strong></a></li></ul><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>What crypto wallets are available in India?</strong></h4><p>Many crypto wallets are available in India, and some of the best include Best Wallet, YouHodler, Ledger, and Trust Wallet. &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Is Trust Wallet safe in India?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Trust Wallet is a safe, non-custodial wallet offering decentralized storage to many Indian crypto traders. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Is MetaMask available in India?</strong></h4><p>Yes, MetaMask is available in India and remains one of the most popular non-custodial wallets in the market.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What is the best crypto wallet for Indian traders?</strong></h4><p>The best crypto wallet for Indian traders is Best Wallet, available on iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Best Wallet &#8211; Overall Best Wallet for Storing and Managing ERC20 Tokens &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We rank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet">Best Wallet</a> as the overall best ERC20 wallet as it has a built-in decentralized exchange that supports trading for all <a href="https://bitpay.com/blog/erc-20-tokens-what-they-are-and-how-they-are-used/">450,000+ ERC20 tokens</a> plus those on other chains such as the Binance Smart Chain.</p><p>The decentralized, non-custodial, multi-chain wallet also has features that other wallets don&#8217;t have, making it more than just a destination to trade and store tokens.</p><p>As well as the built-in DEX it has other DeFi features, made possible through holding native ERC20 token $BEST &#8211; which is launching soon.

Nonetheless, payments are processed by a <a href="https://wert.io/fiat-onramp">regulated entity</a>, Wert &#8211; licensed in the US and EU.</p><p>Best Wallet also supports Bitcoin, Dash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and many other leading cryptocurrencies.

This wallet provider is backed by an established exchange with multiple tier-one licenses. Regulation is from FINRA (US), ASIC (Australia), FCA (UK), and CySEC (Cyprus).

For example, users can stake tokens automatically without needing to opt in. eToro distributes up to 90% of the staking rewards directly into the user&#8217;s wallet. eToro also offers an exchange that supports crypto-to-fiat pairs. This means that users can trade ERC20 tokens against the US dollar.&nbsp;</p><p>What&#8217;s more, eToro supports fiat deposits via debit/credit cards and e-wallets. There are no fees charged when making the deposit in US dollars (0.5% for other currencies). Additionally, the eToro wallet supports copy trading. This is an innovative tool that allows users to replicate an experienced crypto trader. All positions will be copied automatically at a proportionate amount. &nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of ERC20 Wallet</strong></td><td><strong>Custodianship</strong></td><td><strong>Supported Coins</strong></td><td><strong>Fee to Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></td><td><strong>App?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest Rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Web wallet and mobile app</td><td>Custodial</td><td>90+ cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, and a range of ERC20 tokens.</td><td>1% trading commission.

Trust Wallet &#8211; Supports All ERC20 Tokens Plus 70 Other Blockchain Standards &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Trust Wallet is a non-custodial ERC20 wallet that is free and simple to use. It supports multiple devices, including browser extensions and smartphones. The latter includes an app for both iOS and Android. Trust Wallet is protected by a PIN and a 12-word passphrase.

Instead, ERC20 transactions are broadcasted to the network via Bluetooth or a USB cable, depending on the model.&nbsp;</p><p>All Ledger models require outgoing transactions to be authorized on the device. This requires the user to enter their PIN. If the PIN is forgotten, the wallet can be recovered with the backup passphrase.

Even if the specific token isn&#8217;t supported, some ERC20 wallets allow users to add them manually. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>ERC20 tokens need to be stored in cryptocurrency wallets that support the Ethereum network. As the world&#8217;s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">second-largest cryptocurrency</a> by market capitalization, this means the number of ERC20 wallets in the market is extensive. Not only that, but there are many different types of ERC20 wallets to choose from.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, while some ERC20 token holders prefer web-based wallets, others feel more comfortable with a hardware device.&nbsp;</li><li>Some investors opt for a mobile wallet app for added convenience.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Either way, ERC20 wallets come with a unique Ethereum address. This address will support all ERC20 tokens. That said, users should check whether custom tokens can be added to the ERC20 wallet. If not, then the user will only be able to deposit ERC20 tokens that are supported. Nonetheless,<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users"> sending ERC20 tokens to a wallet address takes just 15 seconds on average</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, wallet-to-wallet transactions require <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/">GAS fees</a>.

But not all ERC20 wallets share this information. This will depend on whether the user opts for a custodial or non-custodial wallet. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why Do I Need an ERC20 Wallet?</strong></h2><p>ERC20 wallets provide many different functions. Not only for storing and transferring ERC20 tokens but accessing DeFi products.&nbsp;</p><p>Read on to discover why ERC20 investors need a suitable wallet to engage with the Ethereum ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Storage</strong></h3><p>Both short and long-term investors need a safe place to store their ERC20 tokens. This means keeping the tokens off unregulated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">crypto exchanges</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The best ERC20 wallets offer various security tools to protect the tokens from hackers. For example, custodial wallets usually offer two-factor authentication via SMS and/or email.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2592" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_2592_1206.jpg 2592w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_1200_558.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_900_419.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_720_335.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_600_279.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_300_140.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Non-custodial wallets give users control of their private keys, which are usually encrypted on the respective device.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wallet-to-Wallet Transfers</strong></h3><p>To send or receive ERC20 tokens, a wallet is needed. Users simply need to provide the Ethereum wallet address when sending ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be unique to the wallet, but all ERC20 tokens will be sent to the same address.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, suppose the user is given the following Ethereum address by their chosen wallet:</p><p><strong>0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe</strong></p><p>In this instance, all incoming ERC20 tokens will be sent to this address.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Ethereum DeFi Ecosystem</strong></h3><p>The Ethereum blockchain is the go-to network for DeFi platforms. Some of the most popular include UniSwap, Curve, SushiSwap, DODO, OpenSea, and Kine Protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>The best ERC20 wallets allow users to connect to DeFi platforms directly. This means users can swap tokens, earn staking rewards, and even borrow funds without leaving the wallet interface.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Fiat Payments</strong></h3><p>Some ERC20 wallets allow users to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money. This removes the need to use an external exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>Users should, however, keep an eye on fees. For example, while the eToro wallet offers fee-free fiat payments in USD, the same transaction would cost up to 5% on Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Best ERC20 Wallets: Our Ranking Criteria&nbsp;</strong></h2><blockquote><p>While security is a crucial factor when choosing the best ERC20 wallet, other metrics also need to be considered. This includes usability, fees, customer service, supported networks, and core features.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>When compiling our list of the best ERC20 wallets, we focused on the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Custodianship:</strong> First, ERC20 token holders should explore the custodianship of a wallet. This determines whether or not the user has access to their private keys. If so, this is a non-custodial wallet. If not, the wallet is custodial. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> The best ERC20 wallets do not charge fees for storing tokens. Nor should there be any extra fees for sending transactions. Instead, this should replicate the blockchain GAS fee. Just remember, while software wallets are free to use, hardware wallets need to be purchased.</li><li><strong>Wallet Type:</strong> Beginners are best suited for mobile or web-browser wallets, for the convenience on offer. That said, some ERC20 token holders prefer desktop or hardware wallets, depending on their requirements. We covered a broad range of wallet types to suit all needs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported Coins:</strong> Be sure to choose a wallet that supports <i>all</i> ERC20 tokens. The wallet should have a feature that allows users to add a custom token manually. If it doesn&#8217;t, the wallet will only support a limited number of ERC20 tokens. Leading ERC20 wallets also support Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-arbitrum-network-tokens.htm">best Arbitrum network tokens</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> The primary purpose of an ERC20 wallet is to keep investments safe. This means that the chosen ERC20 wallet should have suitable security features. For example, Best Wallet comes with biometric security, while eToro offers two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote><p>Overall, the best wallets for ERC20 tokens cover a good blend of security and convenience, plus support for a wide range of ERC20 tokens and features.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2><strong>How do ERC20 Wallets Work? The Basics</strong></h2><p>ERC20 wallets come with various fundamentals that should be learned before proceeding. First, investors will be provided with a unique ERC20 wallet address. Not only does this enable them to receive Ethereum, but all ERC20 tokens. This is because ERC20 tokens operate on top of the Ethereum framework. As such, Ethereum and ERC20 tokens use the same wallet standard.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it is important to assess whether the chosen wallet accepts <i>custom</i> ERC20 tokens. If it does, then users can add an ERC20 token to their wallet even if it isn&#8217;t listed on an exchange. All the user needs to do is paste the contract address into the wallet. Thereon, any incoming ERC20 tokens transactions will be reflected in the wallet address.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2864" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_2864_1040.jpg 2864w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1200_436.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_900_327.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_720_261.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_600_218.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_300_109.jpg 300w"></figure><p>When sending ERC20 tokens to another wallet, the user will need the correct address. If any mistakes are made, the transaction will be sent to a dead wallet address. In other words, the ERC20 tokens will be unrecoverable. Do remember that <i>sending</i> ERC20 tokens requires GAS fees. And as noted earlier, GAS fees must be paid in ETH and not the ERC20 token being sent.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>For example, if an investor wants to transfer Dai, they must have enough ETH in their ERC20 wallet to cover transaction fees. This is quoted by the Ethereum network and will vary depending on demand. Currently, ERC20 token transfers <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">cost $1.73</a> or about 0.0010 ETH. This is considered competitive, as ERC20 GAS fees will often exceed $10. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>ERC20 token holders should also be aware of how private keys work. After all, if opting for a non-custodial wallet, private keys are the responsibility of the user. All of the non-custodial wallets discussed today convert private keys to a 12 or 24-word passphrase. This makes it easier to write down and recover the ERC20 wallet if needed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Different Types of ERC20 Wallets</strong></h2><p>We have now covered the basics of how ERC20 wallets work. Next, let&#8217;s explore the most common <i>types</i> of ERC20 wallets, including hardware, software, and paper.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>ERC20 Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Most ERC20 token holders will opt for a software wallet. Especially those that actively buy, sell, and trade ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>Options include a mobile wallet, which comes as an app for iOS or Android. This is the most convenient option, as users can send and receive ERC20 tokens anywhere, at any time. Moreover, mobile wallets are protected by screen locks, biometrics, and a backup passphrase.</p><p>Desktop and browser-based wallets are also popular. These options are suitable for ERC20 token holders that prefer transacting on a laptop or PC. In some cases, desktop wallets come with two-factor authentication, requiring users to verify access via an SMS code. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>ERC20 Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>ERC20 hardware wallets will appeal to two types of investors. First, those with a large value of ERC20 tokens in their portfolio. Or those that want to hold their ERC20 tokens long-term.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because hardware wallets come with unprecedented security controls. For instance, a PIN needs to be entered on the device when authorizing transactions. What&#8217;s more, the hardware device remains in cold storage, as it&#8217;s never connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>ERC20 Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>An alternative option is to use an ERC20 paper wallet.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The user will first need to create an ERC20 wallet address.</li><li>This can be done from most software wallets, such as Trust Wallet.</li><li>The user will then transfer the ERC20 tokens to the newly generated wallet address.&nbsp;</li><li>Next, they will print the wallet address and the private keys onto a sheet of paper.&nbsp;</li><li>Then, the paper is kept somewhere safe, and thus &#8211; the private keys remain in cold storage at all times.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While this makes it challenging to actively send and receive funds, paper wallets are one of the safest and most cost-effective ways to store ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How Safe Are ERC20 Wallets?</strong></h2><p>The safety of an ERC20 wallet depends on various factors, for example:</p><ul><li>Whether the wallet is non-custodial or custodial</li><li>Whether it&#8217;s a hot or cold wallet</li><li>The specific security features provided by the wallet</li></ul><p>Let&#8217;s break the above list down into more detail &#8211; starting with custodianship.&nbsp;</p><p>Custodial wallets are responsible for keeping the user&#8217;s ERC20 tokens safe. While they don&#8217;t share the user&#8217;s private keys, the best custodial wallets offer a range of security controls.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, eToro keeps the majority of client funds in cold storage.&nbsp;</li><li>It also has a 24/7 security team and allows users to secure their wallets with two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</li><li>What&#8217;s more, eToro is regulated by multiple licensing bodies, including those from the UK, US, EU, and Australia.</li></ul><p>The security of a non-custodial wallet will depend on whether the user opts for hot or cold storage.</p><ul><li>Cold storage, available as a hardware or paper wallet, keeps the private keys offline at all times. This removes the threat of the wallet being hacked remotely.&nbsp;</li><li>Hot storage keeps the ERC20 tokens online at all times, which offers added convenience. Most non-custodial hot wallets are secured with a PIN, password, or biometrics. But two-factor authentication is not an option, as non-custodial wallets are decentralized.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ultimately, ERC20 token holders should do their due diligence on the security of a wallet before proceeding.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Set up an ERC20 Wallet?</strong></h2><p>Setting up an ERC20 wallet is relatively straightforward. Beginners can follow the step-by-step walkthrough below to get started with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">Best Wallet</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download Best Wallet</strong></h3><p>Best Wallet is currently available as a mobile app with a desktop browser currently in development.</p><p>It can be found in the App Store or Play Store on Android/iOS and can be downloaded for free.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1080" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_1080_648.jpg 1080w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_900_540.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_720_432.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_600_360.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_300_180.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2: Create Account</strong></h3><p>Users only need to input an active email address to create an account, as Best Wallet is decentralized and non-custodial and there is no <a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process">KYC process</a> to complete.</p><p>Next, users decide what security settings to add &#8211; a four-digit passcode is the minimum but there is the option to add two-factor authentication and/or fingerprint ID. This can also be added/removed later.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Transfer or Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></h3><p>A Best Wallet account has now been created and users will be redirected to the dashboard, where they can either purchase ERC20 tokens via third-party WERT or trade thousands of other tokens on the built-in DEX.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1080" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/best-wallet-homescreen.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_1080_2055.jpg 1080w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_900_1713.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_720_1370.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_600_1142.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_300_571.jpg 300w"></figure><h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><p>After reviewing the top ERC20 wallets for 2023, we found that Best Wallet is our top option.&nbsp;</p><p>This decentralized, non-custodial wallet has just launched as a free mobile app and gives users full control over managing their crypto holdings.</p><p>We also like that Best Wallet has numerous other features that make it more than just a wallet, including unique insights on tokens, early access to new projects and reduced fees while trading.</p><p>That is make possible by the $BEST token, which has not yet launched but will be airdropped to active users of the wallet in the near future.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users"><strong>https://www.coinbase.com/blog/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://support.simplex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014078420-What-fees-do-you-charge-for-card-payments"><strong>https://support.simplex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014078420-What-fees-do-you-charge-for-card-payments</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html"><strong>https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison"><strong>https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://mycoinify.com/fees/"><strong>https://mycoinify.com/fees/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/trading"><strong>https://www.binance.com/en/fee/trading</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker"><strong>https://etherscan.io/gastracker</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process"><strong>https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process</strong></a></li></ul><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>What is an example of an ERC20 wallet?</strong></h4><p>ERC20 wallets support tokens on the Ethereum standard, and examples include Best Wallet, eToro, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Where can I get an ERC20 wallet?</strong></h4><p>Dozens of ERC20 wallets can be downloaded for free as an app or browser extension, with leading examples including Best Wallet, eToro, Exodus, and MetaMask.</p><h4><strong>How do I know if I have an ERC20 wallet?</strong></h4><p>If the wallet is on the Ethereum blockchain and the receiving address starts with an &#8216;0x&#8217;, then it supports ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What is the best ERC20 wallet?</strong></h4><p>Overall, we like Best Wallet, which not only offers non-custodial storage for any ERC20 token, but also Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and other major cryptocurrencies.

BitAddress &#8211; Open-Sourced Paper Wallet Provider for Free Cold Storage &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>BitAddress is the best decentralized crypto wallet for cost-effective cold storage. Unlike Trezor and Ledger Nano, BitAddress is completely free to use. This is because BitAddress is a &#8216;paper&#8217; wallet solution. Here&#8217;s how it works. First, users visit the BitAddress website to create a new wallet address.&nbsp;</p><p>Within seconds, BitAddress will display two unique barcodes. One represents the wallet address. The other is the wallet&#8217;s private keys. The user can then transfer Bitcoin to the wallet address and finally &#8211; print the two bar codes onto a sheet of paper and keep it somewhere safe.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1736" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-___media_library_original_1736_1176.jpg 1736w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-___media_library_original_1200_813.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-___media_library_original_900_610.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-___media_library_original_720_488.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-___media_library_original_600_406.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-___media_library_original_300_203.jpg 300w"></figure><p>In doing so, the Bitcoin tokens remain offline at all times. If the user wants to transfer the tokens to another wallet, they can scan the private key QR code. This imports the wallet credentials to the next wallet location.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of safety, BitAddress is an <a href="https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org">open-sourced provider</a> that merely creates Bitcoin wallet addresses and private keys. This means it is the user&#8217;s responsibility to keep their credentials safe. Finally, BitAddress only supports Bitcoin &#8211; so this option won&#8217;t be suitable for diversified portfolios.&nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of Decentralized Wallet</strong></td><td><strong>Operating Systems</strong></td><td><strong>Supported Cryptos</strong></td><td><strong>Fee for Decentralized Crypto Trades</strong></td><td><strong>Mobile App?</strong></td><td><strong>Features</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Bitcoin</td><td>Not supported</td><td>N/A</td><td>Free cold storage alternative to hardware wallets, open-sourced for user safety&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Create unlimited Bitcoin paper wallets</li><li>Completely decentralized &#8211; private keys are encrypted&nbsp;</li><li>Free of charge&nbsp;</li><li>Wallet addresses and private keys are represented by QR codes &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Not suitable for active crypto traders that regularly move funds&nbsp;</li><li>Does not support altcoins &nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>What is a Decentralized Wallet?</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Decentralized wallets give users full control of their crypto investments. Unlike centralized wallets, only the user has access to their private keys.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In a nutshell, decentralized wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrency tokens safely. This is because users control their private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>This is in contrast to centralized wallets, which are often provided by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> or brokers. This is because centralized wallets do not provide users with their private keys. This means users need to trust the centralized provider will keep their funds safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, when setting up a decentralized wallet, private keys are usually provided in a simplified form. This is often a 12-word passphrase that needs to be entered in the correct order. Nonetheless, the decentralized wallet provider will never have access to the private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>This means users are responsible for safeguarding their wallets. If the wallet is compromised or the private keys are misplaced &#8211; the provider cannot help recover the funds.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Benefits of Using a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Some of the core benefits provided by decentralized wallets include sole custody of the private keys, access to dApps, and faster transaction times.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Still not sure if a decentralized wallet is the best option?</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of using a decentralized wallet for storing cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Full Control of Crypto Tokens</strong></h3><p>The main attraction of decentralized wallets is that users control their funds. This is because only the user has access to their private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, only the user can authorize outgoing transactions. Moreover, entities &#8211; whether that&#8217;s the wallet provider or the government, cannot access the crypto funds.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows users to store wealth outside of the conventional financial system. In other words, users do not need to trust decentralized wallet providers as they do with centralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Faster Transactions</strong></h3><p>The best decentralized crypto wallets offer much faster transaction times when compared to centralized options.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because there is no requirement to have the transaction authorized by a third party.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, consider the process involved when storing crypto tokens on a centralized exchange&nbsp;</li><li>First, the user would need to request a withdrawal from the exchange</li><li>The user would need to wait for the exchange to approve the transfer</li><li>This could take minutes, hours, or days &#8211; this can vary widely depending on the centralized exchange</li><li>Once approved, only then will the crypto tokens be transferred to the recipient&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In comparison, there is no third-party approval process with decentralized wallets. As such, the transaction will be executed on the blockchain as soon as it is verified by the wallet owner.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Store a Great Number of Tokens</strong></h3><p>When using a centralized wallet, the number of supported tokens will often be limited. This is because users can only store tokens that are supported by the exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, the best DeFi wallets support thousands, sometimes <i>millions,</i> of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Take Trust Wallet as a prime example. We found that Trust Wallet is compatible with over 70 blockchain networks and 4.5 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This enables investors to store all of their digital assets in one safe place.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Access Web 3.0 dApps&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The best decentralized crypto wallets provide seamless access to Web 3.0 dApps.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1838" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1838_924.jpg 1838w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1200_603.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_900_452.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_720_362.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_600_302.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_300_151.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Some of the most commonly supported dApps include:</p><ul><li>UniSwap</li><li>SushiSwap</li><li>PancakeSwap</li><li>OpenSea</li><li>Compound</li><li>Yearn.finance</li></ul><p>But there are hundreds more. Crucially, these dApps offer access to decentralized finance tools, such as token swaps, staking, yield farming, and dual investments. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Anonymity &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Another popular feature of decentralized crypto wallets is they offer complete anonymity. This means users can create a wallet without providing any personal information or contact details.&nbsp;</p><p>All users need to access their wallet is the respective password or private keys. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Centralized vs Decentralized Wallets</strong></h2><blockquote><p>The responsibility of &#8216;custodianship&#8217; is how DeFi and centralized wallets are differentiated. Centralized wallet providers are tasked with keeping the user&#8217;s cryptocurrencies safe. While DeFi wallets give users full control &#8211; meaning they are responsible for looking after their private keys.</p></blockquote><p>DeFi and centralized wallets both enable users to store their cryptocurrency tokens. The key difference is in who takes responsibility for safeguarding the wallet&#8217;s private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of centralized wallets, private keys are secured by the provider. This is often a crypto exchange or broker. As such, users do not have access to their private keys. In turn, if the custodian is hacked or goes bankrupt (like FTX), the user&#8217;s crypto funds are at risk.&nbsp;</p><p>DeFi crypto wallets, on the other hand, give users full control of their funds and private keys. This means that there is no reliance on a third-party custodian. Users can send and receive funds at any time without needing approval from another person or entity.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there is nowhere to turn if the DeFi wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys. Therefore, while DeFi wallets give users control of their wealth &#8211; appropriate security practices should be taken.&nbsp;</p><p>This means keeping the private keys offline at all times &#8211; preferably written down on a sheet of paper. In doing so, the user can recover their wallet if they forget their password or the device is lost or stolen. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Different Types of DeFi Wallets</strong></h2><p>Now that we have established the difference between centralized and DeFi wallets, we can explore the different types available.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Most crypto investors opt for a software-based decentralized wallet. Software wallets are often referred to as &#8216;hot storage&#8217;. This is because the funds remain online at all times, increasing both convenience and risk.</p><p>Software wallets come in many forms, but mobile apps are particularly popular. Decentralized wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet both offer an app for iOS and Android. This enables users to secure their crypto funds with a PIN or fingerprint ID.&nbsp;</p><p>Mobile wallets are very convenient for actively managing crypto portfolios. At the click of a button, users can send, receive, and trade crypto right from their smartphones.&nbsp;</p><p>Software wallets also come as a browser extension. For example, MetaMask offers an extension for Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox browsers. This enables users to access the crypto markets whenever they are on their laptops. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Some decentralized wallets come as desktop software, but this is less common. One of the most popular desktop wallets is Electrum, which safely stores Bitcoin on Windows, Mac, and Linux.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Hardware wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrencies on a device. The private keys are held on the device and kept offline at all times. &nbsp;</p><p>To transfer crypto to another wallet, users must enter a PIN on the hardware device. This offers an ultra-secure way to store large amounts of crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>Equally, hardware wallets are far from convenient for active crypto traders. This is because making last-minute trades is cumbersome, considering access to the hardware device is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>The leading hardware wallet providers are Trezor and Ledger Nano. Both are decentralized, as neither provider has access to the device&#8217;s private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>However, do remember that users will need to provide some personal and financial information when buying a hardware wallet online.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>Paper wallets also offer a decentralized way to store crypto tokens. As we mentioned earlier, BitAddress allows users to instantly create a Bitcoin wallet address and private keys. &nbsp;</p><p>Both are represented by a QR code, which the user can print onto a sheet of paper. As long as the paper is kept somewhere safe and private, the crypto funds remain unhackable.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How Secure Are Decentralized Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2><p>First and foremost, there is no requirement to trust a third party when using a decentralized wallet. After all, decentralized wallets merely provide a bridge between crypto transactions and the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>However, decentralized wallets will always be at risk from remote hacking attempts and theft. As such, users must ensure that they follow sensible security practices to keep their crypto funds safe.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, those using a mobile wallet should ensure that a suitable PIN is used. This should be in addition to a lock-screen password for the smartphone. If someone is able to bypass these security measures, they will have access to the wallet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2124" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_2124_810.jpg 2124w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1200_458.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_900_343.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_720_275.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_600_229.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_300_114.jpg 300w"></figure><p>This is also the case for desktop and browser extension wallets. Another way for hackers to access a decentralized wallet is through &#8216;links&#8217;. For example, a scammer might impersonate the wallet&#8217;s support team and send a link for the user to click.&nbsp;</p><p>Unwittingly, the link might install a virus or keylogger, enabling the scammer to access the wallet remotely. The safeguard here is to never click links from unknown sources &#8211; whether that&#8217;s on social media or emails.&nbsp;</p><p>The safest option is to keep the crypto wallet offline at all times. For example, consider installing the wallet on a cheap smartphone that is never connected to the internet. Similarly, users might also consider a paper wallet that is stored away from the risk of theft or damage,&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, decentralized wallets <i>are</i> safe, but users must also take responsibility too. Users also need to consider that increased convenience often leads to reduced security.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, while software wallets are convenient for actively trading and investing crypto, the private keys will always be vulnerable to hackers. As such, users should only keep small amounts of crypto in a software wallet. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Select the Best Decentralized Crypto Wallet?</strong></h2><p>Choosing a suitable wallet is a crucial part of the crypto investing process.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this section highlights the most important factors to look for when choosing the best decentralized crypto wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>Decentralized wallets provide users with their private keys, ensuring that wealth is built and maintained without third parties.&nbsp;</p><p>However, decentralized wallets are still vulnerable to hackers. As such, choosing the best decentralized wallet requires users to consider what security features are included.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Mobile wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask are secured by a PIN</li><li>Desktop and browser-based wallets are secured by a password</li><li>Hardware wallets are secured via cold storage. Plus, users need to enter a PIN on the device to transfer funds</li></ul><p>In comparison, centralized wallets offer additional security features. This can include device whitelisting, two-factor authentication, and even insurance. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Networks</strong></h3><p>The number and type of blockchain networks supported by decentralized wallets will vary wildly. For example, Trust Wallet supports over 70 networks. This includes Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> &#8211; like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1734" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1734_824.jpg 1734w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1200_570.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_900_428.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_720_342.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_600_285.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_300_143.jpg 300w"></figure><p>In contrast, Electrum only supports one cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin. Crucially, users should check which networks and cryptocurrencies are supported by choosing a decentralized wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Device Type</strong></h3><p>Consider the most convenient and secure device type to store the decentralized crypto wallet. Options include desktop software, browser extensions, and mobile apps.&nbsp;</p><p>For offline storage, consider a hardware or paper wallet. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3><p>Another factor to consider is user-friendliness.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, beginners should explore whether the chosen decentralized wallet is suitable for their skill set. Sending and receiving crypto should be simple, as should setting up and securing the wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>More experienced crypto investors might seek a crypto wallet with more advanced features. For example, Electrum offers multi-signature permissions. While this adds a great level of security to the wallet, this feature is not suitable for newbies.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Investment and Trading Features</strong></h3><p>The best decentralized wallets enable users to maximize their crypto investments. For example, OKX has an in-built aggregator tool that connects to over 200 dApps.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2554" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_2554_866.jpg 2554w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1200_407.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_900_305.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_720_244.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_600_203.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_300_102.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Users can search for the crypto they currently hold in the OKX wallet and locate the highest APYs available.

That said, do remember that decentralized wallets also invite risk. If the wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys &#8211; the crypto funds will likely be unrecoverable.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to choose wisely when selecting a decentralized wallet, with Best Wallet our top pick and an excellent choice. The self-custody wallet allows for accounts to be created in less than five minutes with no KYC verification needed, with users able to securely store crypto and trade tokens via built-in DEX.</p><p>It stands out ahead of its rivals because it is more than just a crypto wallet &#8211; its native token $BEST can be staked to earn rewards and holding it also grants other benefits such as early access to new projects and NFTS and reduced fees, while the platform will also offer unique insights and data on trending tokens.</p><p>$BEST is not yet live but will be airdropped to active users of the wallet in the near future.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://trezor.io/compare"><strong>https://trezor.io/compare</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://crypto.com/"><strong>https://crypto.com/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://metamask.io/"><strong>https://metamask.io/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180731005764/en/Binance-Acquires-Trust-Wallet---A-Popular-Mobile-Crypto-Wallet"><strong>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180731005764/en/Binance-Acquires-Trust-Wallet&#8212;A-Popular-Mobile-Crypto-Wallet</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022"><strong>https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.moonpay.com/learn/defi/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees"><strong>https://www.moonpay.com/learn/defi/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org"><strong>https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org</strong></a></li></ul><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><p><strong>Which wallets are decentralized?</strong></p><p>There are dozens of decentralized crypto wallets in the market &#8211; ranging from Best Wallet, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet to Electrum and OKX.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the safest decentralized crypto wallet?</strong></p><p>The most secure decentralized wallets are hardware-based, with providers like Trezor and Ledger Nano leading the market, although users need to purchase physical devices which can be expensive.</p><p><strong>Is Coinbase Wallet decentralized or centralized?</strong></p><p>Yes, the Coinbase Wallet is a decentralized wallet that operates independently from the main Coinbase exchange.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is Trust Wallet decentralized or centralized?</strong></p><p>Yes, Trust Wallet is a decentralized wallet for iOS, Android, and Chrome browser extensions.</p><p><strong>What fees do decentralized wallets charge?</strong></p><p>Most decentralized wallets are free to use and maintain, with users only needing to cover gas fees when transferring funds. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>How secure are decentralized crypto wallets?</strong></p><p>While Decentralized wallets give users full control of their private keys away from centralized third parties, they are not immune to remote hacking attempts. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT come with up to 12% APY, which is one of the highest yields you can get on stablecoins.</p><p>However, to get this yield you need to advance your levels by trading or holding a certain amount of funds in your account. The Basic level APY is 7% for LTC and 6% for stablecoins. This is still competitive with other DeFi platforms.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/youhodl-yield.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/responsive-images/youhodl-yield___media_library_original_900_451.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/responsive-images/youhodl-yield___media_library_original_720_361.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/responsive-images/youhodl-yield___media_library_original_600_301.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/responsive-images/youhodl-yield___media_library_original_300_150.jpg 300w"></figure><p>If you&#8217;re looking to diversify your crypto assets without leaving your wallet, you can swap between multiple chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple and even less popular coins like ApeCoin and Decentraland.</p><p>Another rewarding feature is the Bitcoin Cloud Miner. The way it works is you complete weekly tasks and you earn sparks. You can then use the sparks in the Cloud Miner to earn BTC with up to 0.2 BTC per month.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/334452/cloud-miner.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/334452/responsive-images/cloud-miner___media_library_original_900_522.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/334452/responsive-images/cloud-miner___media_library_original_720_418.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/334452/responsive-images/cloud-miner___media_library_original_600_348.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/334452/responsive-images/cloud-miner___media_library_original_300_174.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Those who are strapped for liquidity can use their cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to get crypto or fiat currency loans like EUR, USD, CHF and GBP and instantly withdraw them. The loan-to-value is 90%, which is among the highest in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p><p>YouHodler is regulated in Switzerland and in Italy. The company uses Ledger Vault technology to secure its holdings with $150 million in pooled insurance.

As an online broker, eToro supports over 70 crypto assets and thousands of stocks, ETFs, currencies, and other financial instruments. Additionally, authorities such as ASIC, FINRA (USA), CySEC (Cyprus), and FCA (UK) stringently regulate eToro.</p><p>What distinguishes eToro from other brokers is its dual function as a secure platform for fund storage. eToro takes responsibility for securing its clients&#8217; crypto holdings by implementing cutting-edge safety measures, including storing most crypto assets in cold storage. It employs a custody-based system comprising a web wallet and a mobile wallet, saving Australian investors the trouble of understanding the complex world of crypto wallets.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/1-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/responsive-images/1-1___media_library_original_900_484.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/responsive-images/1-1___media_library_original_720_387.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/responsive-images/1-1___media_library_original_600_323.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/responsive-images/1-1___media_library_original_300_161.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Another notable feature of eToro is the availability of 2FA, which adds an extra layer of security to user accounts. Clients are required to verify login attempts using a one-time SMS code. Our research indicates that most eToro users prefer the web wallet, which provides additional features such as the ability to send and receive tokens.</p><p>The web and mobile wallet options offered by eToro are user-friendly and well-suited for beginners. When it comes to purchasing crypto in Australia, eToro remains the top contender. With a minimum trade size of only $10, it caters to many cryptocurrencies. Australian clients can deposit funds through various methods, including debit cards, POLi, PayPal, and Neteller, with a modest initial deposit of $50. The wallet app also enables users to trade tokens directly within the wallet interface.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1888" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_1888_1282.jpg 1888w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_1200_814.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_900_611.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_720_488.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_600_407.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_300_203.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Upon completing a transaction on eToro, the purchased crypto is immediately transferred to the user&#8217;s eToro web wallet. eToro&#8217;s appeal lies in its smart portfolio service, ASIC license, and state-of-the-art security features.

Crypto wallets are essential for interacting with the blockchain, which powers these digital currencies.</p><p>Crypto wallets can be categorized into two types: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial wallets involve a third-party service, like an exchange or a wallet provider, holding private keys on behalf of users. While they offer the convenience of easy access and management, users must trust the service to keep their keys secure, which can be risky.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="854" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/untitled-design-2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/responsive-images/untitled-design-2-1___media_library_original_854_480.jpg 854w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/responsive-images/untitled-design-2-1___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/responsive-images/untitled-design-2-1___media_library_original_600_337.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/responsive-images/untitled-design-2-1___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Non-custodial wallets give users complete control over their private keys, allowing them to store and manage their cryptocurrencies independently. This offers better security but requires users to take responsibility for safeguarding their private keys.</p><p>There are various types of custodial and non-custodial wallets, including software, hardware, paper, and web wallets. Each type has its unique features and security levels. To keep your crypto wallet safe, choose the right one based on your needs, take advantage of backup and recovery options, and use strong security measures such as encryption and two-factor authentication.</p><h2><strong>Why Crypto Investors Need a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Crypto wallets are vital for investors looking to venture into the world of crypto. These digital wallets allow users to store, send, receive, and manage various digital assets securely and efficiently. Let&#8217;s see why crypto investors need a crypto wallet:</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>The primary function of a crypto wallet is to secure users&#8217; digital assets. Wallets use advanced cryptographic techniques to generate unique private keys that are required for accessing and managing cryptos.</p><p>For instance, hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor provide an additional layer of security by storing private keys offline, mitigating the risk of online hacks and thefts. Investors can also enable 2FA to further enhance their crypto wallets&#8217; security.</p><h3><strong>Control</strong></h3><p>Crypto wallets give investors complete control over their digital assets. Unlike leaving funds on exchanges, where users are vulnerable to hacks, wallet owners can manage their cryptocurrencies as they see fit.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, investors can quickly transfer funds between wallets or utilize DeFi platforms directly from their wallets, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet.</p><h3><strong>Convenience</strong></h3><p>Best crypto wallets simplify the process of sending, receiving, and managing cryptos. They often come equipped with user-friendly interfaces and support multiple cryptos, allowing investors to manage all their digital assets from a single location.&nbsp;</p><p>Some wallets even offer built-in exchange features, enabling users to swap cryptos without using external platforms.</p><h3><strong>Interaction with dApps</strong></h3><p>Best crypto wallets, especially those compatible with Ethereum, enable users to interact with dApps and smart contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, MetaMask, a popular Ethereum-based wallet, allows users to directly access various DeFi applications and NFTs platforms, such as Uniswap and OpenSea, from the wallet interface.</p><h2><strong>How do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>Bitcoin wallets enable users to store, send, and receive digital assets seamlessly. A Bitcoin wallet comprises two critical elements: public and private keys. The public key, or wallet address, is an alphanumeric sequence that is the destination for sending and receiving Bitcoin. Sharing the public key poses no risk to security.</p><p>Conversely, the private key is a secret alphanumeric code providing access to the wallet&#8217;s funds. Safeguarding private keys is crucial, as misplacing them can lead to permanent fund loss while disclosing them exposes the wallet to theft.</p><h3><strong>The Transaction Process</strong></h3><p>To receive Bitcoin, share the wallet&#8217;s public address with the sender. The wallet relies on the private key to authorize the transaction to send Bitcoin. This transaction is then transmitted to the Bitcoin network, where it undergoes verification and is added to the blockchain.</p><h3><strong>Protecting Your Wallet</strong></h3><p>Maintaining the security of a Bitcoin wallet is of utmost importance. Consider the following best practices:</p><ul><li><strong>Backups</strong>: Schedule regular wallet backups to prevent data loss from hardware malfunction or theft.</li><li><strong>Multi-Signature</strong>: Opt for wallets necessitating multiple private keys for transactions, increasing security levels.</li><li><strong>2FA</strong>: Implement 2FA (two-factor authentication) to shield your wallet from unauthorized entry.</li><li><strong>Offline Storage of Private Keys</strong>: Keep private keys in an offline environment, minimizing exposure to hackers or malware.</li></ul><h2><strong>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Before selecting a storage solution for their digital assets, investors should familiarize themselves with the different crypto wallets available in Australia. This knowledge will enable beginners to make informed decisions and choose the most suitable crypto wallet for their requirements.</p><p>Here is an overview of the primary crypto wallet types:</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Software wallets are digital wallets that store your crypto as software applications. They are further divided into two types: mobile wallets and desktop wallets.</p><h4><strong>Mobile Wallets</strong></h4><p>Mobile wallets are applications designed for smartphones and tablets. They provide users with easy access to their cryptos, allowing them to transact and manage their digital assets on the go.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Convenient and user-friendly, making it easy to manage cryptos.</li><li>QR code scanning simplifies sending and receiving transactions.</li><li>Many mobile wallets offer additional features like built-in exchanges and portfolio tracking.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>May be susceptible to hacks and phishing attacks, as smartphones can be compromised.</li><li>Limited to the device, so if the phone is lost or damaged, access to the wallet may be lost.</li></ul><h4><strong>Desktop Wallets</strong></h4><p>Desktop wallets are applications designed for personal computers and laptops. They offer a higher security level than mobile wallets, as they are less prone to hacks and viruses.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Desktop wallets could often provide advanced features like coin staking and multi-signature support.</li><li>Better suited for long-term storage of cryptos.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Less portable and convenient than mobile wallets.</li><li>Accessible only from the device it&#8217;s installed on, so if the device is lost or damaged, access to the wallet may be lost.</li></ul><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Hardware wallets are physical devices designed to store your crypto offline, known as cold storage. They provide an added layer of security by keeping private keys separate from internet-connected devices. Popular hardware wallets include Ledger Nano, Trezor, etc.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Offers the highest level of security for storing cryptos.</li><li>Resistant to hacks and malware, as private keys are stored offline.</li><li>It supports multiple cryptos and integrates with various software wallets.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>More expensive than software wallets.</li><li>Less portable and convenient for everyday transactions.</li></ul><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>Paper wallets are physical documents that store your crypto&#8217;s private and public keys in QR codes. They provide a simple and inexpensive way to secure your digital assets offline.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Highly secure, as the keys are stored offline and cannot be hacked.</li><li>Inexpensive and easy to create.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Prone to physical damage, such as fire or water, which can lead to the loss of assets.</li><li>Not user-friendly for everyday transactions and managing multiple cryptos.</li></ul><p>Selecting the right crypto wallet depends on your preferences, usage, and security requirements. Evaluate your needs and choose the wallet type that best suits your requirements. Mobile and desktop wallets offer convenience and ease of use, while hardware and paper wallets provide heightened security for long-term storage.</p><h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Australia Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2><p>With the rise of cryptos, selecting the ideal wallet for your needs is crucial. The best Bitcoin wallet in Australia or any other region should be secure, user-friendly, and compatible with various currencies. This section will guide you through choosing the perfect crypto wallet for you and exploring the key factors to consider, such as security, private key ownership, supported coins, fees, mobile experience, and more.</p><h3><strong>Prioritizing Security</strong></h3><p>Your crypto wallet&#8217;s security should be a top priority. When looking for the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, consider wallets with robust security measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA), biometric authentication, and encryption.</p><p>Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, are among the most secure options. These wallets store your private keys offline, making it difficult for hackers to access your funds. Examples of the best crypto hardware wallets include Ledger Nano and Trezor.</p><h3><strong>Ensuring Private Key Ownership</strong></h3><p>Owning your private keys is essential for maintaining control of your assets. You can choose a wallet that gives you full ownership of your private keys rather than entrusting them to a third party. Non-custodial wallets, such as MetaMask and OKX, grant you complete control over your private keys.</p><h3><strong>Considering Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>Different wallets support different cryptos, so make sure your wallet accommodates the coins you own or plan to invest in. The top crypto wallets in Australia, like eToro, typically support many digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Ensure your wallet supports all the cryptos you want to avoid compatibility issues.</p><h3><strong>Evaluating Fees</strong></h3><p>Transaction fees vary depending on the wallet you choose. Some wallets, such as the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, offer competitive prices, while others may charge a premium for their services.&nbsp;</p><p>Research the costs associated with each wallet before deciding, and factor in the frequency of your transactions. Some wallets allow users to set custom fees, providing greater flexibility in terms of costs.</p><h3><strong>Assessing Mobile Experience</strong></h3><p>If you plan on managing your cryptos on the go, consider a wallet with a user-friendly mobile app. Some Australian crypto wallets offer seamless mobile experiences, allowing users to easily monitor their portfolios, trade, and transfer funds. Ensure the mobile app is compatible with your device&#8217;s operating system, whether iOS or Android.</p><h3><strong>Examining User Interface and Usability</strong></h3><p>A simple and intuitive user interface is vital, particularly for those new to cryptos. When evaluating the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, consider wallets that offer simple navigation and a clean layout.&nbsp;</p><p>Wallets like MetaMask and OKX are known for their user-friendly interfaces, making them suitable for beginners.</p><h3><strong>Preparing for Backup and Recovery</strong></h3><p>In case you lose access to your wallet, it&#8217;s crucial to have a backup and recovery plan in place. When comparing Australian crypto wallets, opt for wallets that provide a secure backup solution and clear instructions on recovering your funds in an emergency. Most wallets offer a recovery phrase or seed phrase, which can be used to restore your wallet on a new device.</p><h3><strong>Exploring Additional Features</strong></h3><p>Some wallets offer extra features that can enhance your overall experience. For instance, built-in exchanges allow you to trade cryptos directly within the wallet, while staking features enable you to earn passive income on your holdings. When choosing the top crypto wallets in Australia, consider the additional functionalities that could benefit your needs.</p><h2><strong>How to Get a Cryptocurrency Wallet in Australia</strong></h2><p>Choosing the best Bitcoin app or wallet can significantly impact the ease of getting started in the world of digital currencies.

This means that users do not need to trust a third party when storing their cryptocurrency investments. MetaMask provides users with their private keys via a 12-word passphrase. The wallet provider cannot see the keys, as the information is encrypted.&nbsp;</p><p>But do remember that if the password and backup passphrase are misplaced, MetaMask cannot help recover the wallet. Moreover, MetaMask comes with limited security features. Nonetheless, we like that MetaMask is available as a browser extension or mobile app for Android and iOS. It is free to download and use, and no fees are charged when storing and receiving cryptocurrencies.</p><p><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2102" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_2102_1214.jpg 2102w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_693.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_900_520.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_720_416.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_600_347.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_300_173.jpg 300w">&nbsp;</p><p>We also like that MetaMask doesn&#8217;t charge any additional fees for outgoing transfers.

In terms of supported cryptocurrencies, MetaMask comes pre-installed with an Ethereum wallet address. This accepts all ERC20 tokens, including Tether, USD Coin, and DAI.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Bitcoin is not supported, several other networks can be added to the MetaMask wallet manually. This includes Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Optimism. MetaMask also supports the best Arbitrum network tokens. Although MetaMask is free to use, it comes with several paid-for features.

That said, some wallets come as hardware devices, such as Trezor.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1280" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/bitcoin-3089728-1280.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_1280_720.jpg 1280w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_1200_675.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_900_506.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w"></figure><p>All wallets come with a unique address for each supported cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin will have its own wallet address, and this is required when <i>receiving</i> tokens. When <i>sending</i> tokens to another wallet, the receiver&#8217;s address will be needed. If using a mobile wallet, the sender can scan the receiver&#8217;s address via a QR code. If not, the wallet address can be pasted in.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Unlike traditional bank wires, crypto transactions are sent on a wallet-to-wallet basis. This means they do not go through a third party. Instead, wallet-to-wallet transactions are processed by the blockchain network.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>While storing, sending, and receiving tokens are the main functions of a crypto wallet, other features are often available. For example, the eToro wallet allows users to trade cryptocurrencies. It also supports staking and can directly accept AED payments.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How do Crypto Wallets Work?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Now let&#8217;s take a much more detailed look at how crypto wallets work.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with custodianship:</p><h3><strong>Wallet Custodianship</strong></h3><p>In order to choose the best crypto wallet in the UAE, investors must understand how custodianship works. This is important, as it determines <i>who</i> is responsible for looking after the cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple analogy is to think about how traditional money is stored.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When using a <i>custodial</i> storage option, the money would be deposited into a bank. The bank is then responsible for keeping the money secure. To access the money, permission needs to be granted by the bank.&nbsp;</li><li>Those who do not trust banks would need to consider a non-custodial option, such as keeping the money at home in a safe. This gives full control of the money, as no permission is needed to access it. But equally, this increases the risks of theft.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The same concept is true for crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, custodial wallets like eToro and Binance are responsible for keeping client cryptocurrencies safe. They do not provide users with their private keys as a safety precaution. As licensed custodians, these wallet providers have institutional-grade security practices in place.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, non-custodial wallets like Best Wallet give users their private keys when getting started. The wallet provider cannot access the private keys. Only the user can.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118852/333643/best-wallet.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118852/333643/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_900_374.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118852/333643/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_720_299.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118852/333643/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_600_249.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118852/333643/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_300_125.jpg 300w"></figure><blockquote><p>Choosing between a custodial or non-custodial wallet is ultimately down to the investor&#8217;s experience. While beginners will likely prefer a regulated custodian, experienced investors might feel more comfortable safeguarding their own wallets.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Wallet Addresses</strong></h3><p>In order to send and receive cryptocurrencies via the blockchain, wallet addresses are needed. Each blockchain will have its own wallet address format.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, this is what a Bitcoin wallet address looks like:</p><p><strong>1F34duy2eeMz5mSrvFepVzy7Y1rBsnAyWC</strong></p><p>And here&#8217;s an example of an Ethereum wallet address:</p><p><strong>0x868daB0b8E21EC0a48b726A1ccf25826c78C6d7F</strong></p><p>Both are equally long and complex. But crucially, no two wallet addresses can be the same. This is similar to a bank account number.&nbsp;</p><p>So, sending funds to another person requires the destination wallet address. And vice versa when receiving cryptocurrencies into the wallet.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Providing a wallet address to another person is not a security threat. Just like giving someone a bank account number, wallet addresses only allow people to send funds.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>But do note that wallet addresses are <i>public</i>. This means anyone can view the wallet balance if they have the address. Data analytic websites like <a href="https://blockchain.com/">Blockchain.com</a> and <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/">BitInfoCharts</a> provide this information. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wallet Private Keys</strong></h3><p>Crypto wallets also come with a unique set of private keys. Similar to wallet addresses, they are complex in nature. Private keys provide access to wallets and the cryptocurrencies stored within them. This means that private keys should be protected at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, instance, private keys should never be stored on a device that can connect to the internet. If they are, they are at risk of being hacked remotely. The hacker would then be able to access the wallet and drain the cryptocurrencies stored.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The best practice for securing private keys is to write them on a sheet of paper.&nbsp;</li><li>For added security, the private keys could be split and written down on multiple sheets.&nbsp;</li><li>This way, if someone comes across the sheet of paper, they would only have part of the private key &#8211; which wouldn&#8217;t provide them access to the wallet.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>But ultimately, safeguarding private keys can be intimidating for beginners. This is why custodial wallets are often the better option. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do You Need a Crypto Wallet? What to Consider &nbsp;</strong></h2><p>According to a <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022">Crypto.com study</a>, there are 219 million Bitcoin holders globally. However, the number of people that use Bitcoin for transactions is very small. For example, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-activeaddresses.html">BitInfoCharts data</a> shows that in the prior 24 hours, there were just over 880,000 active Bitcoin addresses.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that the vast majority of people that own Bitcoin do not transact. Instead, Bitcoin is purchased as an investment. In practice, this means that UAE residents do not actually need a crypto wallet to invest in this space.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, UAE investors wanting to send and receive cryptocurrencies will need a wallet. This will provide them with a unique wallet address and the ability to transfer funds without going through a third party. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What are the Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets?</strong></h2><p>We have covered custodianship, public addresses, and private keys in great detail. The next step for UAE investors is to learn about the different types of crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with the most common type &#8211; software wallets. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Software wallets allow investors to send and receive funds remotely. There are generally four options to choose from in this regard:</p><ul><li><strong>Web Wallet</strong>: Web wallets are offered by custodians like eToro and Binance. No software is actually required, as investors can access their web wallets by logging into their accounts. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet</strong>: Mobile wallets like Best Wallet come as an app. They allow users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies no matter where they are located. This option is suitable for active traders that want full control of their cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Desktop Wallet</strong>: Another option is to download a desktop wallet. Usually supported for Windows and Mac, this offers a more user-friendly experience when transacting. But desktop wallets are less convenient, and transactions can only be verified when the user has access to their device.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Browser-Based Wallet</strong>: Some of the best crypto wallets in the UAE come as a browser extension. The wallet is installed in a browser like Chrome or Firefox. This makes it simple to trade cryptocurrencies online &#8211; especially on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">decentralized exchanges</a>. &nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Hardware wallets do not allow investors to transact with the blockchain remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, they come as a hardware device, and the private keys are never exposed to the internet. To transact, a PIN needs to be entered on the hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>We found that one of the best crypto hardware wallets for UAE investors is the Trezor Model One. This retails for just $69 or about 250 AED. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>The less common option is a paper wallet. This is a cost-effective version of a hardware wallet, as the private keys are never connected to live servers. This is because the private keys are printed and kept somewhere secure and private &#8211; like in a safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Paper wallets will not appeal to UAE investors who want to regularly send, receive, or trade cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tips for Selecting the Best UAE Bitcoin Wallet</strong></h2><p>There are many variables to consider when researching the best UAE Bitcoin wallets. Not only in terms of the wallet type and custodianship, but security, supporting coins, and core features.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s what to consider when choosing a UAE crypto wallet:</p><ul><li><strong>Custodianship</strong>: First, do some research on the pros and cons of both custodial and non-custodial wallets. As noted earlier, a great analogy is to consider how money is stored. Those that prefer to keep money in a bank can opt for a regulated custodial wallet. Those who prefer keeping money at home in a safe can opt for a non-custodial wallet.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Device Type</strong>: The most popular wallets are available on multiple devices. For example, wallets come as mobile apps, browser extensions, and desktop software. Hardware wallets are another option.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported Coins</strong>: The best crypto wallets in the UAE support many different coins and network standards. Best Wallet supports coins from various blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon and BNB, with Bitcoin blockchain planned for a future update.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fees</strong>: Hardware wallets must be purchased, so consider the costs before proceeding. Software wallets are free to download. Storing and receiving cryptocurrencies should also be free. Some wallets charge markups when sending cryptocurrencies. These wallets should be avoided. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: Security features will vary depending on the wallet type. Non-custodial hot wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask come with limited security features. Cold wallets like Trezor are super-secure. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>User-Friendliness</strong>: UAE investors should also choose a crypto wallet that is suitable for their experience. The best user-friendly wallets are offered by eToro and Binance. On the other hand, OKX comes with many features, but it&#8217;s more suitable for experienced investors. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Features</strong>: We like crypto wallets that come with extra features. For example, being able to buy crypto with AED or swap tokens without leaving the wallet. Staking and yield farming tools are handy for earning passive income.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Get and Use a Bitcoin Wallet in UAE</strong></h2><p>This section provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to set up the Best Wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>We found that Best Wallet offers the best crypto wallet app for UAE investors. Not only is it non-custodial, meaning you have full control over your funds, but the app allows users to send and receive funds via multiple blockchains.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download the Best Wallet app</strong></h3><p>UAE investors must <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">download the Best Wallet app</a> from the App Store or Google Play, depending on the device.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="323" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/bw7.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/responsive-images/bw7___media_library_original_323_700.jpg 323w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/responsive-images/bw7___media_library_original_300_650.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2: Open the Best Wallet App</strong></h3><p>When you open the app, you&#8217;ll be asked to verify your email address. The next step is to activate a two-factor authentication to improve the app&#8217;s security. However, you can skip this step and activate 2FA later on if you want to.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/bw4.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/responsive-images/bw4___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/responsive-images/bw4___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Whether or not you activate 2FA, you&#8217;ll have to set up a four-digit password next. There&#8217;s an option to enable biometrics such as fingerprint or face ID if your device supports any of those features.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Wallet</strong></h3><p>Your first wallet is on the Ethereum blockchain. You can now create multiple wallets, give them names, such as &#8220;Trading wallet&#8221; or &#8220;NFT storage&#8221; and select a background color. This is designed so that you can quickly identify each wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Tap &#8220;Continue&#8221; when ready.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333561/bw3.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333561/responsive-images/bw3___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333561/responsive-images/bw3___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3><p>Now you can buy crypto with a card, receive coins from exchanges or other wallets and swap them. Active Best Wallet users may get $BEST tokens airdropped in Phase 6 of the development of this wallet.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/bw1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/responsive-images/bw1___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/responsive-images/bw1___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><h2><strong>How Safe Are Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2><p>Each wallet type will come with its own level of security. Not only in terms of the device type, but whether it&#8217;s a custodial or non-custodial wallet. UAE investors should also consider whether the wallet offers hot or cold storage.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s break down the most important factors;</p><ul><li><strong>Cold Wallets</strong>: Cold wallets offer the highest level of security. They are never connected to a live internet server, so this removes a major risk &#8211; remote hacking attempts. Hot wallets are usually non-custodial, such as Trezor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Hot Wallets</strong>: In contrast, hot wallets offer a much lower level of security, because they are always connected to a live internet server. Hot wallets come as both custodial and non-custodial options. For example, the Binance web wallet is custodial. While the Exodus wallet is non-custodial, as users are provided with their private keys.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>When deciding between a custodial or non-custodial wallet, assessing the security features is paramount.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, non-custodial wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask come with limited safety features. These wallets are only protected by a password. If the device that the wallet is stored on is compromised, the private keys would be hacked.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Custodial wallets like eToro offer many safety features &#8211; from two-factor authentication, regulation, and analytic behavior machine learning. On the flip side, investors are trusting a third party to look after their cryptocurrencies. This is much the same as trusting a bank to store money.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><p>There are many considerations to make when choosing the best crypto wallet for UAE investors. But overall, we found that the Best Wallet offers the ideal balance between safety, convenience, and features.&nbsp;</p><p>The Best Wallet can hold coins from multiple blockchains, it can swap them, and you can safely store your NFTs. With upcoming updates, you&#8217;ll get market insights and token analytics. Active Best Wallet users can get $BEST tokens airdropped in the future. &nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-secures-financial-services-permission-from-abu-dhabi-global-market-3067578165660383216"><strong>https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-secures-financial-services-permission-from-abu-dhabi-global-market-3067578165660383216</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-gb/glossary/kyc"><strong>https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-gb/glossary/kyc</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://trezor.io/compare"><strong>https://trezor.io/compare</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/looking-back-at-binances-2022-endofyear-report-1820343945198453383"><strong>https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/looking-back-at-binances-2022-endofyear-report-1820343945198453383</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hackers-steal-around-100-million-cryptocurrency-binance-linked-blockchain-2022-10-07/"><strong>https://www.reuters.com/technology/hackers-steal-around-100-million-cryptocurrency-binance-linked-blockchain-2022-10-07/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.adgm.com/financial-services-regulatory-authority"><strong>https://www.adgm.com/financial-services-regulatory-authority</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://yearn.finance/"><strong>https://yearn.finance/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://support.simplex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014078420-What-fees-do-you-charge-for-card-payments-"><strong>https://support.simplex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014078420-What-fees-do-you-charge-for-card-payments-</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.okx.com/learn/secure-your-wallet-with-mpc"><strong>https://www.okx.com/learn/secure-your-wallet-with-mpc</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022"><strong>https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-activeaddresses.html"><strong>https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-activeaddresses.html</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/</strong></a></p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>Which is the best crypto wallet in UAE?</strong></h4><p>Best Wallet &#8211; a regulated custodian and exchange, offers the best crypto wallet for UAE traders seeking a safe place to store and trade cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Can you use Coinbase in the UAE?</strong></h4><p>No, Coinbase is only available to trades in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Are Bitcoin wallets legal in the UAE?</strong></h4><p>Yes, the UAE is a crypto-friendly nation with solid regulation &#8211; so Bitcoin wallets are perfectly legal.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Can UAE residents use Binance?</strong></h4><p>Yes, not only can UAE residents use Binance, but the exchange has been approved by the Abu Dhabi Global Market&rsquo;s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA).</p>

Investors will need to select a wallet that offers adequate security controls, a user-friendly interface, and convenient accessibility. In addition, investors will need to consider what features they seek from a wallet, such as being able to trade or stake tokens.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Crypto wallets come with many different functions, but they are primarily used to store digital currencies. For example, consider an investor who buys Bitcoin from a crypto exchange in South Africa. Instead of trusting the exchange to keep the tokens safe, many investors will withdraw the funds to a private wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>In doing so, the investor can retain full control of their cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto wallets allow investors to send and receive funds. Transactions are conducted on a wallet-to-wallet basis and do not go through a centralized entity, such as a bank or e-wallet provider. Instead, wallet transactions are private and decentralized.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1280" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/bitcoin-3089728-1280.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_1280_720.jpg 1280w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_1200_675.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_900_506.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/responsive-images/bitcoin-3089728-1280___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w"></figure><p>When sending funds to another person, the user will need the receiver&#8217;s wallet address. No two wallet addresses are the same. After confirming the transaction, it will be executed by the underlying network.&nbsp;</p><p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa come with additional features, allowing users to fully engage with the blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, wallet providers like Best Wallet and Binance support trading. This means that users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies without leaving their wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>Providers like Trust Wallet and OKX come with staking tools, enabling users to earn passive income on their idle tokens.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As we explain in more detail later, there are many different types of crypto wallets. For instance, non-custodial wallets provide users with their private keys. This means the user has full control of their crypto tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>Custodial wallets, on the other hand, remove the need to secure private keys. This is because the custodian will keep the crypto tokens safe on behalf of investors. Investors also need to consider their preferred device type, such as a mobile or desktop wallet.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do You Need a Crypto Wallet? Key Reasons Explained&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are various reasons why a crypto wallet is crucial when investing in digital currencies. This is the case for both short and long-term traders.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussed below are the key benefits provided by the best crypto wallets in South Africa.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Safely Store Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3><p>Cryptocurrencies are highly sought after by cybercriminals, due to their anonymous characteristics. Put otherwise, if an investor has their crypto tokens stolen remotely, the likelihood is that the funds will never be recovered. This is why wallets are so important, as they keep cryptocurrencies safe.&nbsp;</p><p>The level of security offered by a wallet will vary greatly.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, &#8216;cold&#8217; wallets are always offline, so offer the greatest security controls. &#8216;Hot&#8217; wallets are less secure as they are always connected to live servers. But hot wallets can still be protected by two-factor authentication and other security tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, crypto wallets allow South Africans to store wealth away from banks and other financial institutions.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Send and Receive Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3><p>Wallets also allow users to transact, often without a centralized intermediary. Transactions are processed on a wallet-to-wallet basis via public addresses.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, suppose an investor wants to transfer some Bitcoin tokens to a family member.&nbsp;</li><li>After providing the receiver&#8217;s wallet address, the Bitcoin transaction should be confirmed by the blockchain in about 10 minutes.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If the investor wishes to receive Bitcoin from another person, they would need to provide their unique wallet address.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Additional Features</strong></h3><p>The best crypto wallets for South African traders come with additional functionality. This removes the need to use third parties when engaging with the blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Some wallets allow users to swap tokens instantly. For example, swapping Bitcoin for Dogecoin without needing to use an exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>Earning passive income is also possible when using a top-rated wallet. The most common methods include staking and yield farming.&nbsp;</li><li>Many wallets are able to connect to Web3 applications. This includes decentralized exchange and lending platforms, offering a world of possibilities for South African investors.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While security should be the main priority when choosing a wallet, investors should also explore what features are available.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Top Crypto Wallets in South Africa: Full Reviews &nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are many metrics that should be considered when choosing the best crypto wallet for South African traders. This includes everything from fees and security to accessibility, user-friendliness, and core features.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we rank and review the best crypto wallets in South Africa for 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1.

This means assessing security, usability, supported coins, fees, and other important factors.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Still undecided on the best South Africa Bitcoin wallets? Read on for assistance on how to select the most suitable wallet in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></h3><p>South African investors should consider the type of crypto wallet that is most preferable for their needs.&nbsp;</p><p>This begins with a choice between custodial or non-custodial storage.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Custodial wallets</strong>: Investors have no access to their private keys. The <i>custodian</i> is responsible for keeping the crypto wallet safe.</li><li><strong>Non-custodial wallets</strong>: Private keys are provided when setting up the wallet. The <i>investor</i> is responsible for keeping the crypto wallet safe. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>What&#8217;s more, South Africans need to choose the device type to store their crypto wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Mobile apps offer a great level of security and convenience. Another option is desktop or browser-based wallets. When opting for a software wallet, make sure the respective operating system is supported.&nbsp;</p><p>Those holding a large amount of cryptocurrencies might be more suited for a hardware or paper wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>Next, South Africans need to ensure their chosen cryptocurrencies are supported by the wallet. For example, while MetaMask is one of the best crypto wallets in South Africa &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t support Bitcoin, Cardano, or Solana.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2348" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315851/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315851/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-___media_library_original_2348_812.jpg 2348w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315851/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-___media_library_original_1200_415.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315851/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-___media_library_original_900_311.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315851/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-___media_library_original_720_249.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315851/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-___media_library_original_600_207.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118498/315851/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-03-at-___media_library_original_300_104.jpg 300w"></figure><p>eToro, on the other hand, supports 90+ cryptocurrencies across many different networks. In addition to Bitcoin, Cardano, and Solana, this also includes Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, EOS, Dash, and Bitcoin Cash.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s best to choose a wallet that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and network standards. In doing so, investors can store their cryptocurrencies in the same place.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3><p>Most software wallets are free to use. This means there are no fees to store or receive cryptocurrencies. While GAS fees apply on outgoing transactions, the best crypto wallets in South Africa do not charge any markups.&nbsp;</p><p>Hardware wallets are not free. They must be purchased from the manufacturer, and prices will vary considerably. Investors should ensure that the cost price is justified, based on the value of their crypto portfolio.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, those investing very small amounts likely won&#8217;t want to buy the Trezor Model T &#8211; which retails for approximately 4,100 ZAR.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Extra Functionality</strong></h3><p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa offer extra functionality, such as being able to trade tokens. This removes the need to use a third party when buying and selling cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Best Wallet allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with a credit card, and they support multi-chain tokens.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333540/best-wallet.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333540/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_900_374.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333540/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_720_299.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333540/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_600_249.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333540/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_300_125.jpg 300w"></figure><p>The Binance wallet is also great for additional features. It supports staking, savings accounts, yield farming, and leveraged trading. The latter includes futures and options.&nbsp;</p><p>We also like the OKX wallet, which bridges to over 200 exchanges. OKX users subsequently get the best interest rates when earning yields on idle tokens.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Security Controls</strong></h3><p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa offer a breakdown of what security controls are provided.&nbsp;</p><p>This might include:</p><ul><li><strong>IP/Device Whitelisting</strong>: Additional security steps are needed when logging into the wallet from a new IP address or device.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication</strong>: The user will need to enter a unique code when logging in. This is either sent to the user via email or SMS.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Cold Storage</strong>: Keeping cryptocurrencies in cold storage means the private keys remain away from live internet servers. This makes them practically impossible to hack remotely.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Multi-Sig Permissions</strong>: Some crypto wallets offer multi-sig permissions. The user will need to verify outgoing transactions on multiple devices.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>MPC</strong>: MPC technology is offered by the OKX wallet. It splits the private key into multiple segments and stores each part in a unique location.</li><li><strong>Regulation</strong>: The best crypto wallets in South Africa are regulated. eToro holds licenses in multiple countries, including the US, the UK, Cyprus, and Australia.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>How do Crypto Wallets Work?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Looking for some guidance on how crypto wallets <i>actually</i> work?</p><p>Here&#8217;s what South African investors need to know before getting started.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wallet Addresses</strong></h3><p>Once a suitable wallet has been chosen, the investor will need to set it up. This will generate a new, unique wallet address. The wallet address allows the investor to receive cryptocurrencies from another location.&nbsp;</p><p>Think of it like an electronic funds transfer (EFT), which requires the sender to specify the receiver&#8217;s personal account number. The wallet address is safe to share with other people, as it simply allows the user to receive tokens via the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Each blockchain network has its own wallet address standard. For example, <a href="https://ethereum.org/fi/guides/how-to-use-a-wallet/">Ethereum wallets always start with 0x</a>. Nevertheless, if the wrong wallet address is provided, the tokens will be sent to an incorrect location. This means the tokens will be unrecoverable.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3><p>If the investor opts for a non-custodial wallet, they will be provided with unique private keys when getting started. This is usually provided as a 12-word passphrase, but some wallets use a much longer combination.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, private keys must never be shared with another person. Nor should they be kept on a device that connects to the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>If they end up in the wrong hands, the private keys will allow an unauthorized person to access the wallet. This is one of the most common reasons for crypto wallets being hacked remotely.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Custodial wallets do not provide users with their private keys. This is because the custodian is responsible for keeping the cryptocurrencies safe. Custodial wallets are popular with beginners, but investors should ensure the provider is regulated.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Wallet Fees</strong></h3><p>Software wallets are usually free to use. There are no fees to store or receive cryptocurrencies. But fees are charged when sending cryptocurrencies to another wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa do not charge a markup on network fees. Instead, fees go directly to blockchain miners.&nbsp;</p><p>Fees are quoted in real-time and rise and fall based on network demand.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto hardware wallets, however, are not free. Prices vary depending on the provider and model type. For example, Trezor charges $69 and $219 for its basic and advanced models.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What are the Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets?</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Once South African investors have chosen between a custodial or non-custodial wallet, the preferred device type should be considered. Wallets come as mobile apps, desktop software, browser extensions, and hardware devices. Investors should also consider whether they prefer a hot or cold wallet.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>We will now discuss the main types of crypto wallets that are available to South Africans in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Some of the most popular crypto wallets in South Africa come as software. This includes desktop software for Windows, Max, and Linux. The software is installed on the desktop device and allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies via a laptop or PC.&nbsp;</p><p>Another option for desktop users is wallets that come as a browser extension. Some providers offer support for Chrome, Firefox, and other popular web browsers.&nbsp;</p><p>An even more convenient option is mobile wallet apps. This allows users to store cryptocurrencies on their smartphones. As such, this makes sending, receiving, and trading cryptocurrencies a breeze.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>A more secure option is to buy a Bitcoin hardware wallet. As noted above, prices will vary, with Trezor charging $69 for its basic device.</p><p>Hardware wallets come with the added benefit of cold storage. In simple terms, this means the cryptocurrencies and private keys are never exposed to live internet servers.&nbsp;</p><p>Safeguards are also in place to protect investors from physical theft. This is because cryptocurrencies can only leave the hardware wallet if the PIN is entered on the device itself. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>We also found that paper wallets are increasingly becoming popular with South African investors. After generating a public address and private key, the user will print the credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>This keeps the wallet offline at all times. It is imperative that the paper wallet is kept somewhere safe. It is also important to ensure the paper wallet provider is legitimate and that private keys are encrypted when initially shown to the user.&nbsp;</p><p>Both paper and hardware wallets offer excellent security, but do make it cumbersome to send and trade cryptocurrencies. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Get and Use a Bitcoin Wallet in South Africa</strong></h2><p>We mentioned earlier that Best Wallet is the overall best crypto wallet in South Africa. In this section, we explain how to get started with this wallet in under five minutes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download the Best Wallet app</strong></h3><p>South African investors will first need to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">download the Best Wallet app</a> on the App Store or Google Play.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="323" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/bw7.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/responsive-images/bw7___media_library_original_323_700.jpg 323w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/responsive-images/bw7___media_library_original_300_650.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2: Open the Best Wallet App</strong></h3><p>First, you need to verify your email address. Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to secure your account with a two-factor authentication. If you want to, you can skip this step and activate this feature later.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/bw4.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/responsive-images/bw4___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/responsive-images/bw4___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Whether you activate 2FA or not, you&#8217;ll be asked to set up a four-digit password. You can also enable biometrics to unlock your wallet if your smartphone supports this feature.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Wallet</strong></h3><p>Now that we have secured the app, go ahead and create your first wallet. This will be your main wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. At this stage you can create multiple wallets and name them, for example, &#8220;Meme coin wallet&#8221; or &#8220;Storage&#8221; or whatever you want.</p><p>Choose a background color for each wallet.

You can swap the tokens you have as well. The more you use the wallet during this stage, the greater the odds of getting the $BEST token airdrop in Phase 6.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/bw1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/responsive-images/bw1___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/responsive-images/bw1___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><h2><strong>How Safe are Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2><p>While varying levels of security are offered, crypto wallets are never 100% secure from hackers and scams. Moreover, investors need to take steps to protect their wallet credentials.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, custodial wallets remove the need for investors to secure their private keys.&nbsp;</li><li>But this isn&#8217;t to say that the wallet is immune to fraud.&nbsp;</li><li>On the contrary, investors should make use of two-factor authentication and any other safeguards offered by the custodian.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinbase, for instance, allows users to set up IP and device whitelisting.&nbsp;</li><li>This means an extra security step kicks in if the user attempts to access the wallet from a new IP address or device.&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote><p>Security procedures will differ when opting for a non-custodial wallet. This is because there is no custodian to protect the investor&#8217;s cryptocurrencies. Instead, only the user has access to their private keys, meaning they must take full responsibility for keeping them safe.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Non-custodial wallets do not come with two-factor authentication or whitelisting. This is because there is no custodian sitting between the investor and their cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, we like that the OKX wallet comes with MPC technology. This means that only a small segment of the private key is stored on the user&#8217;s device. The remaining segments are stored across multiple locations.&nbsp;</p><p>Some non-custodial wallets come with multi-sig permissions. This is a security tool that requires outgoing transfers to be confirmed on at least two devices. Just like MPC technology, this removes a single point of failure &#8211; making it challenging for remote hacks to succeed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><p>Wallets ensure that South Africans can invest in the crypto market safely. While there are many crypto wallets in the market, we particularly like Best Wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>The Best Wallet can hold coins from various blockchains, it can seamlessly swap them, and you can store your NFTs in a single mobile app. Upcoming features include market insights and token analysis, which will make Best Wallet the ultimate Web3 crypto hub for your tokens.&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><p><a href="https://trustwallet.com/"><strong>https://trustwallet.com/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain"><strong>https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://trezor.io/compare"><strong>https://trezor.io/compare</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/"><strong>https://pancakeswap.finance/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://uniswap.org/"><strong>https://uniswap.org/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/how-and-why-assets-move-between-binance-wallets-4835275628753556476"><strong>https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/how-and-why-assets-move-between-binance-wallets-4835275628753556476</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hackers-steal-around-100-million-cryptocurrency-binance-linked-blockchain-2022-10-07/"><strong>https://www.reuters.com/technology/hackers-steal-around-100-million-cryptocurrency-binance-linked-blockchain-2022-10-07/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/what-is-mpc/"><strong>https://www.fireblocks.com/what-is-mpc/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/licenses"><strong>https://www.coinbase.com/legal/licenses</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process"><strong>https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/fi/guides/how-to-use-a-wallet/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/fi/guides/how-to-use-a-wallet/</strong></a></p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>What crypto wallets are available in South Africa?</strong></h4><p>Dozens of crypto wallets are available to South African investors, with leading providers including Best Wallet, eToro, Trust Wallet, Trezor, and MetaMask.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Can South Africa use Coinbase wallet?</strong></h4><p>Yes, South Africans have access to the non-custodial Coinbase wallet, as well as its centralized exchange.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Does Binance wallet work in South Africa?</strong></h4><p>Yes, the Binance wallet not only supports South African investors but ZAR deposits and withdrawals.</p><h4><strong>What is the best South Africa crypto wallet?</strong></h4><p>One of the best South Africa crypto wallets is Best Wallet, which allows investors to store and trade cryptocurrencies from multiple blockchains.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>

As a result, there are now many types of digital wallets or eWallets available in the space. Safe, decentralized crypto wallets are a crucial tool to store, swap, and transfer valuable digital assets.<br><br>It&#8217;s essentially to carefully evaluate the best crypto wallet for your needs, however &#8211; in this Trust Wallet review, we evaluate Binance&#8217;s popular Trust Wallet and all its features for mobile and desktop.</p><h2>Trust Wallet &#8211; A Summary</h2><p>Trust Wallet is currently used by over 60 million users all around the world. It is a beginner-friendly crypto wallet which gives its users full custody and authority over their cryptocurrencies. That means it&#8217;s possible to use Trust wallet without having to register for an account or share any personal information &#8211; giving full rivacy and anonymity.</p><p>Trust Wallet is compatible across multiple devices, available for free as a smartphone app on both Android and iOS and also as a Chrome browser extension for desktop users. The web interface of Trust Wallet is aesthetically pleasing as well as user-friendly. All the information provided is presented in a manner which is easier for the reader to understand.</p><p>Trust Wallet supports over 4.5 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs across 70 blockchains. From Bitcoin, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum.htm">Ethereum</a>, Solana, to Polygon and more, you will find everything on Trust Wallet. This creates a good opportunity for investors to diversify their investment portfolios.&nbsp;</p><p>Before we dive into the technical details, here is a pros and cons list of Trust Wallet:</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Non-custodial wallet</li><li>Supports over 4.5 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs</li><li>Free to download and use</li><li>In-house Trust wallet staking tools</li><li>12-word seed phrase</li><li>Provides connection to a variety of dApps</li><li>Charges low or minimal fees</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Credit / debit card payments require KYC processing</li><li>Limited security features</li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-wallet-review.htm">MetaMask</a> often cited as preferrable for desktop use</li></ul><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">View Our Recommended Crypto Wallets</a></div></div><h2>What is Trust Wallet?</h2><p>Trust Wallet was first launched in 2017 as only a mobile app, but because of its popularity and features, it was acquired by Binance a year later in 2018. Its customer base now consists of more than 60 million users, which given the current competition, is not an easy feat to achieve in the industry. As the wallet grew, it decided to accommodate more people and thus extended to the Chrome browser.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1600" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313727/trust-wallet.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313727/responsive-images/trust-wallet___media_library_original_1600_900.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313727/responsive-images/trust-wallet___media_library_original_1200_675.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313727/responsive-images/trust-wallet___media_library_original_900_506.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313727/responsive-images/trust-wallet___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313727/responsive-images/trust-wallet___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313727/responsive-images/trust-wallet___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Trust Wallet is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-decentralized-crypto-wallets.htm">decentralized digital wallet</a>. It offers non-custodial storage and so gives its users freedom and full access to their cryptocurrencies. This means, unlike a self-custodial wallet, Trust Wallet will not have any knowledge or access to the user&rsquo;s private keys and crypto wallet. This separates Trust Wallet from other options like the Coinbase wallet.</p><p>Trust Wallet offers security features like PIN and password and 12-word private keys. The PIN and password allow users to stop any unsolicited third-party access to the wallet, whereas the 12-word private keys lend extra security features to the app. Although Trust Wallet shows this code on the users&rsquo; screen, it is encrypted and thus, Trust Wallet does not hold any information about the aforementioned key as well.</p><p>The wallet has many features, one of which includes direct access to decentralized applications such as Uniswap or PancakeSwap to enable token swapping. It also allows passive earning potential with its in-house crypto staking. The website offers a staking calculator which gives an estimate of earning potential with various coins. The wallet also charges zero to minimal fees for its services. For example, for transferring cryptos it charges only the essential gas fees, and for token swapping only an exchange fee is involved.</p><h2>Supported Cryptocurrencies on Trust Wallet</h2><p>Trust Wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies which may cover all digital assets. These cryptos are available across 70 blockchain networks including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Binance Smart Chain and more. This diverse range makes Trust Wallet a lucrative option for those who want to diversify their cryptocurrency investments.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1380" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313728/trust-wallet-cryptos.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313728/responsive-images/trust-wallet-cryptos___media_library_original_1380_590.jpg 1380w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313728/responsive-images/trust-wallet-cryptos___media_library_original_1200_513.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313728/responsive-images/trust-wallet-cryptos___media_library_original_900_385.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313728/responsive-images/trust-wallet-cryptos___media_library_original_720_308.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313728/responsive-images/trust-wallet-cryptos___media_library_original_600_257.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313728/responsive-images/trust-wallet-cryptos___media_library_original_300_128.jpg 300w"></figure><p>In addition to this, Trust Wallet also supports <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm">NFTs</a>. In fact, it supports NFTs on the Polygon, xDai, Ethereum, Solana, Smartchain, Tezos, Optimism, and Avalanche, as well as the Arbitrum chain.</p><h2>Is Trust Wallet a Decentralized Entity?</h2><p>As already stated before, Trust Wallet is a decentralized wallet. This means that it gives its users full authority and control over their digital assets. Additionally, a user can store or make P2P transfers and enjoy full custody over their cryptocurrencies. A majority of users prefer decentralized wallet as opposed to centralized wallets like Coinbase because it does not involve a third-party intermediary.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to being decentralized, Trust Wallet also offers non-custodial storage. This means a user will not need any account registration or personal verification to perform transactions on Trust Wallet, except when buying cryptos with a debit/credit card. This has been discussed at length later in this review. Thus, being a non-custodial wallet, Trust Wallet does not ask for or collect any personal information. This gives users anonymity and privacy when it comes to their cryptocurrency investment.</p><p>Unlike centralized wallets, decentralized wallets also do not hold any control over users&#8217; private keys. Trust Wallet does display the 12-word private key to first-time users, but this information is always encrypted, and the wallet does not know what it is. As a result, Trust Wallet cannot assist users who may have lost their private keys or got their private keys hacked. Thus, it is extremely crucial to keep your private keys safe.</p><h2>Trust Wallet Fees</h2><p>Now that we have covered which cryptocurrencies you can store on Trust Wallet, let us move on to another important section- the fees charged by Trust Wallet.</p><p>While using any digital wallet, it is important to know how much fees it charges. This way, you know for certainty what costs to expect while using a wallet, and you don&rsquo;t go overboard with your expenses, thus maximizing your ROI from cryptocurrencies.</p><h3>Trust Wallet Installation Fees</h3><p>Trust Wallet is available free of cost. One can download and install the mobile apps or Chrome browser extension for free. Thus, it comes in handy if you want a reliable wallet without spending any money.</p><h3>Trust Wallet Storage Fees</h3><p>Trust Wallet does not charge any storage fees. Thus, one can store as many cryptocurrencies as they want in Trust Wallet without incurring any cost.</p><h3>Trust Wallet Transaction Fees</h3><p>Transaction means two things- either you are receiving funds or transferring funds. Receiving funds on Trust Wallet is free of cost, which means a user can receive funds from another wallet without paying any fees.</p><p>Like all other eWallets, Trust Wallet charges a fee for transferring funds from your wallet to another user. This is an inevitable cost as crypto transactions have gas fees. Cryptocurrency transactions need computational resources to execute, and thus each transaction attracts gas fees. Trust Wallet does not use this gas fee as a source of revenue, but it uses this to pay the respective network.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a default feature on Trust Wallet that shows a tentative network fee when you transfer digital assets. This information is gathered from real-time demand. Usually, users can adjust the gas fee they pay.</p><p>It is important to note that a higher gas fee will complete the transfer at a fast rate, while a low fee may be rejected as it may not be sufficient to do the transaction smoothly.</p><p>In addition to this, Trust Wallet also does not charge a fee to receive NFTs from another wallet.</p><h3>Trust Wallet In-Wallet Token Swap Fees</h3><p>In-Wallet cryptocurrency token swapping fees does not attract any fees from Trust Wallet. This means users can swap tokens within the wallet interface without having to pay anything.</p><p>However, there is an exchange rate which needs to be paid to swap one token with the other. Trust Wallet notify the users of these rates and thus, users must check the exchange rate properly. It is also advisable to check out exchange rates on other platforms to score a better deal.</p><p>Users can consider other decentralized apps such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-make-a-uniswap-trade.htm">Uniswap</a>, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap. All of these are accessible via the Trust Wallet app or extension.</p><h3>Trust Wallet Credit / Debit Card Purchase Fees</h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2117" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313729/trust-wallet-fees.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313729/responsive-images/trust-wallet-fees___media_library_original_2117_1060.jpg 2117w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313729/responsive-images/trust-wallet-fees___media_library_original_1200_601.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313729/responsive-images/trust-wallet-fees___media_library_original_900_451.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313729/responsive-images/trust-wallet-fees___media_library_original_720_361.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313729/responsive-images/trust-wallet-fees___media_library_original_600_300.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313729/responsive-images/trust-wallet-fees___media_library_original_300_150.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Trust Wallet is a decentralized wallet and thus does not accept fiat currency for transactions. However, it does use centralized third parties like <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/">MoonPay</a> and <a href="https://www.simplex.com/">Simplex</a> to facilitate credit card and debit card purchases.</p><p>Now there are some fees to it that the third-party charges. For instance, Simplex charges somewhere between 3.5 to 5% on credit/debit card purchases. If it is expensive for some users, then they can check out eToro, which offers the same services at a lower fee.</p><p>Here is a quick summary of the Trust Wallet fees breakdown:</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><strong>Installation Fee</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">No fee is charged</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><strong>Storage Fee</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">No fee is charged</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><strong>Transaction Fee (Receiving Funds)</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">No fee is charged</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><strong>Transaction Fee (Transferring Funds)</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Only gas fee</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><strong>In-Wallet Swaps</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">No fee is charged, but please note the exchange rate</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><strong>Credit/Debit Card Purchases</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Depends on third-party processors</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Trust Wallet Security &#8211; Is it Safe?</h2><p>Now let us come to the most important question when it comes to using Trust Wallet. Is it safe to use? Will Trust Wallet keep your funds secure? Will it protect you from online scams and threats?</p><p>After our assessment of Trust Wallet, we conclude that Trust Wallet is safe to use based on the following features that the wallet provides:</p><h3>Trust Wallet Requires PIN / Password</h3><p>Trust Wallet provides its users with either a PIN or password to protect their wallets. This offers added security to the wallet as with this verification, unauthorized users cannot get access to your wallet.</p><p>Trust Wallet mobile app on both Android and iOS gives its users the option of setting up a PIN, while the Trust Wallet Chrome browser extension gives its users the option of setting up a password. Both these options are equally effective if you can come up with a strong PIN or password to keep your wallet safe.</p><h3>Trust Wallet Provides Non-Custodial Storage</h3><p>Trust Wallet is a decentralized wallet, and it provides non-custodial storage of your cryptocurrencies. Non-custodial storage means to store cryptos a user need not register or disclose their identity, thus promoting anonymity. This adds extra security to your wallet and transactions, as no one will know your personal information.</p><h3>12-Word Seed Phrase</h3><p>We have saved the most exciting feature for the last. It is the gateway to your private keys, which is also known as the backup passphrase. Trust Wallet provides its users with a 12-word recovery phrase when they first set up their Trust Wallet account. Thus, to access the wallet, a user must enter this 12-word seed phrase accurately.</p><p>The Trust Wallet YouTube channel produced the video below showing the process of setting up a Trust Wallet, including first seeing your 12 word phrase.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc2kPDLLmVo"></oembed></figure><p>It is important to mention here that users must keep this backup phrase highly confidential. It is not a good idea to store it online on your mobile or laptop or Gmail account. Storing it online would make it more prone to online attacks or hacks. It is also not a good idea to share this key with anyone, known or unknown.</p><p>No matter how many security features are added, virtual tools and platforms are always at risk of cyber crimes such as attempted hacking or scams. As such, Trust Wallet is also prone to these threats. So, it is always recommended to understand the risk associated with a non-custodial wallet and take added safety measures to ensure that your wallet is safe &#8211;</p><ol><li>Never share your Trust Wallet credentials or PIN / password with anyone. This is highly sensitive information, and so be kept confidential at all costs.</li><li>Scammers may be lurking in Trust Wallet forums as fellow users or fake customer support, so never share any Trust Wallet information therein- especially on Twitter, Telegram, and the community section.</li><li>Do not entertain spam emails or links, as they may be ridden with viruses or key-loggers, which could give an unauthorized person access to your Trust Wallet credentials.</li><li>Do not share your private keys with anyone nor store them in any online devices or notebooks. If you do so, it could get compromised, and hackers will clear out your funds.</li></ol><h2>Trust Wallet &#8211; Top Features</h2><p>Let us go through some of the key features offered by Trust Wallet.</p><h3>Trust Wallet Staking</h3><p>As per Trust Wallet&rsquo;s website, it supports a few coins which are considered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/5-best-crypto-to-stake-for-maximum-returns-2023-big-passive-rewards.htm">lucrative for staking</a>. This includes Osmosis, Cosmos, Terra, Tron, BNB, Kava, Algorand, etc. APYs from these coins will vary on a lot of factors such as market volatility, chosen token, and its current demands, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>If you go to the &lsquo;staking&rsquo; section on the Trust Wallet website, you will find a staking calculator, which will provide the estimated earnings from the current APR. The calculator even breaks it down into daily, monthly, and yearly earnings.</p><p>While staking has its benefits, it is important to know that staked coins are affected by market fluctuations.</p><h3>Trust Wallet NFTs</h3><p>Trust Wallets offers its users a way to keep and access all their unique crypto NFTs and game assets in one place. These NFTs and crypto collectibles are secured on the blockchain and linked to a public address. These can be considered as famous artwork by Van Gogh or vintage baseball cards which are unique and limited in existence.

You can visit the <a href="https://trustwallet.com/">trustwallet.com website</a> and choose your mode as per your device which includes:</p><ul><li>Trust Wallet Chrome browser extension</li><li>Trust Wallet Android app</li><li>Trust Wallet iOS app</li></ul><h3>Step 2 &#8211; Open a New Wallet</h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1600" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313736/open-trust-wallet-install.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313736/responsive-images/open-trust-wallet-install___media_library_original_1600_955.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313736/responsive-images/open-trust-wallet-install___media_library_original_1200_716.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313736/responsive-images/open-trust-wallet-install___media_library_original_900_537.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313736/responsive-images/open-trust-wallet-install___media_library_original_720_430.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313736/responsive-images/open-trust-wallet-install___media_library_original_600_358.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313736/responsive-images/open-trust-wallet-install___media_library_original_300_179.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Once you have successfully downloaded the app or extension, open the Trust Wallet app. Look for a &lsquo;Create a New Wallet&rsquo; option and click on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, generate a PIN or password for your wallet. Since Trust Wallet is a virtual software, it is important to keep it safe from scams or hacks. Thus, it is important to create a secure PIN or password. While smartphone users can set up a PIN, for Chrome extension, Trust Wallet will need a password.</p><h3>Step 3 &#8211; Secure Your Private Keys</h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1600" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313735/trust-wallet-backup-phrase.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313735/responsive-images/trust-wallet-backup-phrase___media_library_original_1600_955.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313735/responsive-images/trust-wallet-backup-phrase___media_library_original_1200_716.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313735/responsive-images/trust-wallet-backup-phrase___media_library_original_900_537.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313735/responsive-images/trust-wallet-backup-phrase___media_library_original_720_430.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313735/responsive-images/trust-wallet-backup-phrase___media_library_original_600_358.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117346/313735/responsive-images/trust-wallet-backup-phrase___media_library_original_300_179.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Trust Wallet provides users with 12-word private keys, which is also known as the backup passphrase. This private key is crucial for your wallet&rsquo;s security and never be shared with anyone online or offline.</p><p>During this step, your screen will display the 12-word keys. Users need to write it down exactly as it is shown on the screen. In the next step, Trust Wallet will ask users to confirm this 12-word passphrase. So, now users must click on each word as previously shown. This is essential to complete the setup process.</p><h3>Step 4 &#8211; Add Your Favourite Crypto to Your Trust Wallet</h3><p>At this step, your new wallet will not have any digital assets. So, to add cryptos to it, you can either buy cryptocurrencies or receive tokens from another wallet.</p><p><strong>Buy Crypto:</strong>&nbsp;You can buy cryptocurrencies with a credit/debit card within Trust Wallet. To do so, click on the &lsquo;buy&rsquo; option, choose a fiat currency to make the payment, and choose a cryptocurrency to receive. Now Trust Wallet does not accept fiat currency, so for this, the app will use centralized third parties to complete this payment. Once the payment provider is selected and KYC is completed, the newly bought crypto tokens will be added to your wallet.</p><p><strong>Receive Crypto:</strong>&nbsp;You can receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin within your Trust Wallet. To do so, click on the &lsquo;receive&rsquo; option. After this, copy your Trust Bitcoin wallet address. Using this address, you can complete this transaction from a different wallet. Once the transaction is processed, Trust Wallet will notify you and record the transaction under your Bitcoin tab.</p><h2>The Verdict</h2><p>As our verdict to this Trust Wallet app review, we conclude that Trust Wallet is a good eWallet. It has all the features that users may seek in a reliable wallet such as security, user-friendly interface, diverse options, etc.</p><ul><li>The Trust software wallet is a non-custodial wallet that provides a 12-word private key. This feature lends extra security to its users and thus gives them peace of mind while storing and transferring their cryptos.</li><li>Trust Wallet supports around 4 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs; this makes it an apt choice for seasoned investors who may want a diverse portfolio.&nbsp;</li><li>The wallet gets extra points for keeping its charges free or minimal, thus making it a good choice for new users who may not want to spend money.</li></ul><p>Overall, it could be a good alternative to centralized wallets. But we advise our users to take extra security measures while using a digital wallet as they are prone to attack.</p><p>Also see our reviews of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-trust-wallet-alternatives.htm">best Trust Wallet alternatives on the market</a>.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">View Our Recommended Crypto Wallets</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>References</h3><ol><li><a href="https://trustwallet.com/assets">https://trustwallet.com/assets</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://trustwallet.com/blog/the-official-beginners-guide-to-trust-wallet#:~:text=To%20receive%20Bitcoin%2C%20click%20on,recorded%20under%20your%20Bitcoin%20tab.">https://trustwallet.com/blog/the-official-beginners-guide-to-trust-wallet</a></li><li><a href="https://community.trustwallet.com/c/helpcenter/troubleshooting/17">https://community.trustwallet.com/c/helpcenter/troubleshooting/17</a></li></ol><h3>FAQs</h3><p><strong>Is Trust Wallet safe to use?</strong></p><p>Trust Wallet is considered safe because as a decentralized wallet, it provides non-custodial storage.

YouHodler offers yield earnings on select cryptocurrencies. Litecoin has the highest annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 15%, while Solana has an APY of up to 13%. The latter is more than the 8% you earn by natively staking Solana on its own blockchain.</p><p>USDT and USDC stablecoins offer up to 12% APY, which is the highest yield you can find with these types of coins. However, to get the maximum yield, you need to have a trading volume of $150,000 each month or meet any of the other criteria to advance in Gold, Platinum or even VIP levels. The Basic APY is 6% for stablecoins, which is still competitive and enough to beat the yearly inflation.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/youhodl-yield.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/responsive-images/youhodl-yield___media_library_original_900_451.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/responsive-images/youhodl-yield___media_library_original_720_361.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/responsive-images/youhodl-yield___media_library_original_600_301.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/responsive-images/youhodl-yield___media_library_original_300_150.jpg 300w"></figure><p>If you&#8217;re all about Bitcoin, you can also earn yield of up to 4.5% APY with YouHodler&#8217;s yield program.

Here&rsquo;s a short overview of the most popular benefits of using a hot wallet.</p><ul><li>Easy access</li><li>No additional cost</li><li>Staking and swapping</li><li>Easy access to dApps</li><li>Recovery and backup</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at each of these aspects in more detail.</p><h3><strong>Easy Access</strong></h3><p>Hot wallets allow you to access and manage your crypto funds anytime, as long as you have a stable internet connection. The software helps users access their crypto from a range of devices. For example, a hot wallet can come in handy if you need to send money to someone or make a payment quickly. Many even feature QR codes and other functions that simplify transactions, so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with tedious wallet addresses.</p><h3><strong>No Additional Cost&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Cold or hardware wallets require you to have a dedicated piece of hardware where you&rsquo;ll store your crypto wealth. You&rsquo;ll need to purchase one of the Trezor or Ledger hardware options and spend up to several hundred dollars. The good news is that all hot crypto wallets are free of charge, meaning there are no upfront payments. These wallets usually make a profit by charging a small fee for your transactions.</p><h3><strong>Staking and Swapping</strong></h3><p>Staking has become increasingly popular in the crypto world, as it allows crypto owners to make passive income with their coins. Therefore, many wallets offer various staking options, although not all can be beneficial. As with crypto trading, staking does not guarantee a profit, so you have to be careful where you choose to invest your funds.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to staking, many wallets have built-in exchanges or are part of bigger exchange platforms.</p><h3><strong>Quick Access to dApps</strong></h3><p>Many hot wallet crypto solutions feature access to exchanges where you can use various trading options. In addition, some wallets are compatible with a wide range of decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, MetaMask can be easily connected to various Ethereum projects. If you go to CryptoKitties, one of the original NFT-based collectible games, and launch it, the MetaMask plugin in your browser will automatically pop up, and you can connect it to start playing.</p><p>Access to dApps is perhaps the biggest advantage that hot wallets have compared to their cold counterparts.</p><h3><strong>Recovery and Backup</strong></h3><p>Many hot crypto wallets offer all kinds of recovery and backup options should you lose or damage your device or in case of theft. The process often entails using your recovery phrase or mnemonic seed that you should remember at all costs. Following the backup procedures can help you successfully retrieve your funds, which is one of the main advantages of hot wallets.</p><p>Furthermore, in the ever-evolving landscape of hot wallets, new security features are being introduced to augment the backup and recovery process. Some cutting-edge hot wallets offer advanced mechanisms like biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to enhance the security of wallet restoration.&nbsp;</p><p>By leveraging these state-of-the-art technologies, hot wallets provide an additional layer of protection, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and recover the wallet. These forward-thinking security measures exemplify the continuous efforts of hot wallet developers to prioritize safeguarding users&#8217; funds and personal information.</p><h2><strong>Ranking the Best Hot Wallet for Cryptocurrency</strong></h2><p>Creating our best hot wallet 2023 list was no easy feat, as we had to carefully examine dozens of options based on various factors, including their security, supported cryptos, additional features, fees, and more.</p><h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3><p>First and foremost, we ensured that all hot wallets that made it to our final list adhered to the required security protocols to ensure maximum protection for your funds. Cold wallets are overall more secure, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean hot wallets get hacked all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>As long as you stick to reputable and trustworthy options with regular security updates, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about your private keys and crypto wealth being stolen. Of course, if you have millions of dollars in crypto, it&rsquo;s better to keep the majority in a cold storage wallet. In that case, investing in a good hardware wallet shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult.</p><h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3><p>A user-friendly hot wallet prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, making it effortless for users to interact with their cryptocurrency. Its interface is clean and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate through various features, including sending or receiving funds, checking transaction history, or managing account settings.</p><p>By focusing on user experience, hot wallets aim to provide convenience and accessibility, helping individuals feel comfortable and confident in managing their digital assets.</p><h3><strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3><p>Some wallets support more currencies than others. However, this shouldn&rsquo;t be the factor you focus on when choosing a wallet. Instead, you should pick a wallet with the cryptos you intend to use and store.</p><p>If you look at our list of the best hot wallets, you&rsquo;ll notice that some support literally millions of coins while others accept just one. For example, if you want just to use and store Bitcoin, you should opt for a wallet like Electrum, which specializes in BTC. For Ethereum-based decentralized apps and storing ERC tokens, wallets like MetaMask are a great choice.</p><p>Why does MetaMask only work with the Ethereum blockchain and accept hundreds of thousands of tokens, but Electrum doesn&rsquo;t? Simply put, all those tokens are built upon the Ethereum network. In contrast, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that&rsquo;s part of the BTC network if we count out the forks.</p><p>For those new to crypto wallets, the safest bet is to go with one that communicates with two or more popular blockchains (like Best Wallet) and accepts their most relevant digital coins.</p><h3><strong>Device Compatibility</strong></h3><p>Device compatibility can vary among hot wallets since different wallet providers support various operating systems and devices. However, most well-known hot wallets are developed to be suitable for use with a diverse range of devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, users should check the wallet&#8217;s compatibility requirements before selecting one. By doing so, they can ensure that the hot wallet they choose is suitable for their preferred device and operating system.</p><p>For example, if you&rsquo;re an iPhone user looking for a dedicated iOS app, you shouldn&rsquo;t pick Electrum, as it&rsquo;s not compatible with Apple&rsquo;s products.</p><p>Ultimately, you must ensure your device has the hardware required to launch and run a hot wallet. Of course, all hot wallets are light enough to run without cutting-edge computers or smartphones, but ancient Android devices definitely won&rsquo;t be able to run your Coinbase Wallet as effectively as the newest model of Samsung Galaxy.</p><h3><strong>Community and Support</strong></h3><p>Popular wallets have active communities, so you can find relevant sites, forums, and social media groups with other users and exchange your experience with them. Moreover, a community can also assist you if you want to learn more about using a specific wallet. This was an integral aspect of our research, as users will often tell you the pros and cons without hesitation.</p><p>We also carefully examined customer support for each wallet we picked. Most options feature a support team but don&rsquo;t expect them to answer fast every time you contact them. For some hot wallets, especially open-source ones, reaching out to the community for support is a better approach.</p><h3><strong>Recovery and Backup Feature</strong></h3><p>Hot wallets are digital wallets connected to the internet, making them more vulnerable to hacking and other security risks. Therefore, robust recovery and backup mechanisms are crucial for the safety of your funds.</p><p>First, we looked for wallets with a seed phrase or a private key backup option. This feature allows you to restore your wallet on another device if yours is lost, stolen, or damaged.</p><p>Moreover, we checked if all wallets on the list provide at least one backup option. These are either physical copies (e.g., paper wallets or hardware wallets) or digital backups (e.g., encrypted files or cloud storage).</p><h3><strong>Integration With Exchanges and Other dApps</strong></h3><p>Some wallets are part of exchanges or have integrations with them. Not all featured options have this, as some people prefer standalone crypto wallets that aren&rsquo;t connected to any platform. When applicable, we mentioned CEXs in our reviews.</p><p>Wallets such as MetaMask can be connected with various decentralized applications. This is something we also paid attention to when making the final list since some people only consider these features.</p><h3><strong>Updates and Future Roadmap</strong></h3><p>Some wallets are continuously upgraded with new functionality and security features. We examined their respective roadmaps in detail to ensure there was a plan for the future. We also paid attention to past updates to see if the wallets are well-maintained.</p><h3><strong>User and Professional Reviews</strong></h3><p>For every wallet we selected, we checked numerous reviews, both from users and professionals, before including them in our final hot wallet list. However, it is important to take these testimonials with a grain of salt, as some may be biased or fake.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it is essential to do your research on a wallet before making a decision. Ultimately, you should use your best judgment to evaluate the quality of the wallet and decide if it is the right one for you. Be sure to consider factors such as the ones listed in this guide to make your final selection.</p><h2><strong>How Do Hot Wallets Work?</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Digital wallets known as &#8220;crypto hot wallets&#8221; allow instant access to and storage of cryptocurrencies. They work by using computer programs or internet distribution hubs that produce and store the private keys needed to access the assets.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of these wallets&#8217; internet connectivity, users may easily send, receive, and manage their cryptos in real-time. Hot wallets are more vulnerable to security threats than cold wallets since they are always connected to the web, thus it is crucial for users to have strong security measures in place and to be cautious about safeguarding their digital assets.</p></blockquote><p>Before using a hot wallet, you may have to open an account. If the wallet is non-custodial, you&rsquo;ll likely just get your public and private keys and complete the process, meaning there&rsquo;s no need to provide sensitive data. For custodial wallets, which have custody of your private keys, you&rsquo;ll probably have to go through the full registration process and provide information such as your email, password, and more.</p><p>In both cases, your private key, a secret cryptographic code, should remain hidden. Due to their connection to the internet, hot wallets can be vulnerable to malicious attacks. It is, therefore, important to take all necessary precautions to protect the private key and wallet from potential threats.</p><p>Since they&rsquo;re connected to the web, hot wallets have many different functionalities, including swapping, access to various dApps, exchanges, and more. Nowadays, many wallets, hot and cold, feature staking functionalities.</p><h2><strong>Cold Wallets vs. Hot Wallets</strong></h2><p>As stated, hot wallets are connected to the web, as opposed to cold storage wallets. A <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin-cold-storage.htm"><u>Bitcoin cold storage</u></a> or cold wallet, on the other hand, is not on the web.</p><p>Which one should you pick, then? Well, that depends on how much money you intend to store. If you have millions in crypto, using a cold wallet is a must, as it will enhance your security.</p><p>Finally, you should take into account that the amount you own changes every day. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered-says-2023-04-24/"><u>According to Reuters</u></a>, the price of BTC could go up to $100,000 by the end of 2024, so you should move some of your &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; to a cold wallet when the time comes.</p><h2><strong>Which Cryptocurrencies Can You Store in a Hot Wallet?</strong></h2><p>In most cases, you&rsquo;ll be able to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-store-bitcoins.htm"><u>store Bitcoin</u></a>, Ethereum, and other popular cryptos. Nonetheless, some wallets will only focus on one crypto or one blockchain. Why, you may wonder? Here&rsquo;s the deal, hot wallets can be divided into single- and multi-blockchain wallets.</p><p>Single-blockchain wallets communicate with one chain. For instance, if it only communicates with the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/bitcoins#xj4y7vzkg"><u>Bitcoin blockchain</u></a>, you can only store one crypto: BTC. Some blockchains handle more than one crypto. If the wallet communicates with the Ethereum blockchain, it means you can store all ERC tokens in it.&nbsp;</p><p>These wallets are generally more secure since they are specialized for one blockchain. Additionally, they tend to have more features tailored specifically to the coin or blockchain they support. However, you&rsquo;ll have to create several wallets if you want to store multiple cryptocurrencies. For example, if you want to store Bitcoin and Ethereum, you&rsquo;ll need two different wallets.</p><p>Multi-blockchain wallets communicate with two or more chains. Users can manage their Bitcoin and Ethereum funds from the same wallet. Multi-blockchain wallets also enable users to exchange digital assets from different blockchains in a single transaction without moving funds from one wallet to another. This makes it much easier to diversify digital asset portfolios and access funds from different blockchains.&nbsp;</p><p>Multi-blockchain wallets provide an efficient and secure way to manage digital assets. However, there are also some potential downsides.&nbsp;</p><p>First, managing multiple digital asset wallets can be confusing for users unfamiliar with different blockchains. Second, those who lose access to their multi-blockchain wallet might not have access to any of their digital assets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"><u>as some millionaires experienced, according to the NY Times.</u></a> Finally, multi-blockchain wallets could be less secure than single-blockchain wallets, as they provide more opportunities for hackers to access users&#8217; digital assets.</p><h2><strong>How Many Cryptos Can You Store in a Hot Wallet?</strong></h2><p>Wallets usually don&rsquo;t have any minimum and maximum limits on how much of a single crypto you can store. In other words, you can hold your entire crypto wealth in a crypto hot wallet. However, that&rsquo;s not the best idea if you have a lot of money stored in digital currencies. At some point, switching to a cold wallet might be a good idea.</p><p>Finally, you should remember that the number of supported cryptos changes over time. Usually, they incorporate more cryptos &mdash; if a new ERC-20 token is added, you can store it via MetaMask.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are also factors that could result in a negative impact. For instance, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e904f8bd-0d4f-4d38-8d71-a199e7e9c131"><u>Coinbase trading volumes fell after tightening the regulations</u></a> around the exchange in the US. This could also affect the Coinbase wallet in the near future, limiting what digital coins Americans can store in it.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s crucial to stay on top of the latest developments in the crypto sphere and understand how specific regulations or shifts in the industry could influence your crypto wealth and, ultimately, your crypto hot wallet.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>To sum up, hot wallets provide the convenience of storing and using your cryptocurrencies. Many can be easily connected to various exchanges or used for accessing decentralized applications. Our top choice is Best Wallet, a multi-blockchain hot wallet with a DEX and NFT Integration within the platform. It also offers market insights and helps users spot promising tokens even before they hit exchanges.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>References&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/"><u>https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered-says-2023-04-24/"><u>https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered-says-2023-04-24/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e904f8bd-0d4f-4d38-8d71-a199e7e9c131"><u>https://www.ft.com/content/e904f8bd-0d4f-4d38-8d71-a199e7e9c131</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"><u>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/bitcoins#xj4y7vzkg"><u>https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/bitcoins#xj4y7vzkg</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.etoro.com/"><u>https://www.etoro.com/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://electrum.org/"><u>https://electrum.org/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://metamask.io/"><u>https://metamask.io/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://trustwallet.com/"><u>https://trustwallet.com/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/wallet"><u>https://www.coinbase.com/wallet</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.exodus.com/"><u>https://www.exodus.com/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.okx.com/web3"><u>https://www.okx.com/web3</u></a></p><p><a href="https://wallet.mycelium.com/"><u>https://wallet.mycelium.com/</u></a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>Which hot wallet is the best at the moment?</strong></h4><p>At the moment, our top choice for the best hot wallet is Best Wallet.

Read on to choose the most suitable wallet for supported cryptocurrencies, security, device types, and more.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>List of the Best Trust Wallet Alternatives&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In our view, listed below are the best Trust Wallet alternatives for 2023:</p><ol><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/"><strong>Best Wallet</strong></a> &#8211; Newly founded Best Wallet is a great alternative to consider. This wallet supports multiple blockchain networks, from Bitcoin and XRP to Ethereum and Solana. It comes with an in-built staking tool and supports decentralized token swaps. Best Wallet also offers AI-backed assistance when building and maintaining a wallet portfolio &#8211; not to mention access to DeFi applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>eToro</strong></a> &#8211; eToro is the best Trust Wallet alternative for security and user-friendliness. While this is a <i>custodial</i> wallet, eToro is regulated by bodies in the US, UK, Australia, Cyprus, and Gibraltar. What&#8217;s more, eToro keeps client digital assets in cold storage, and accounts are protected by two-factor authentication and passwords. The eToro wallet supports over 90 cryptocurrencies, which can be stored and traded in one safe place.</li><li><strong>Trezor</strong> &#8211; Another alternative to Trust Wallet for security purposes is Trezor. This is a hardware wallet that comes as a small physical device. Any cryptocurrencies stored within Trezor are kept offline in cold storage, and a PIN is needed to verify outgoing transfers. The Trezor Model One retails for $69. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>MetaMask</strong> &#8211; While MetaMask and Trust Wallet possess many similarities, the former offers a better user experience on desktops. This is because the MetaMask browser extension comes with more functionality, including staking and token swaps. These features are not available when using the Trust Wallet browser extension.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Binance</strong> &#8211; Binance offers a custodial web wallet that comes packed with features. This includes the ability to store and trade hundreds of cryptocurrencies. The Binance wallet also supports staking, dual investments, savings accounts, and yield farming. This wallet is suited to active cryptocurrency traders that want to maximize returns.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Exodus</strong> &#8211; This wallet offers desktop software for Windows and Mac &#8211; providing a seamless experience on laptops and PCs. Exodus &#8211; which supports over 50 blockchain networks, also offers an app and browser extension. Core features built into the Exodus wallet include staking and token swaps.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>OKX</strong> &#8211; The OKX wallet is decentralized, meaning it offers non-custodial storage without requiring users to provide any personal information. The wallet&#8217;s main feature is its bridge aggregator. This allows users to swap and stake cryptocurrencies via 200+ decentralized exchanges without leaving the OKX wallet. As such, users can secure the lowest exchange rates and highest DeFi yields.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2><strong>7 Best Alternatives to Trust Wallet: Full Reviews &nbsp;</strong></h2><blockquote><p>When exploring Trust Wallet alternatives, users should focus on various metrics. This includes security, usability, fees, features, and supported device types.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Now let&#8217;s move on to our comprehensive reviews of the best Trust Wallet alternatives for 2023.</p><h3><strong>1. Best Wallet &#8211; Overall Best Trust Wallet Alternative &nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a> is the overall best Trust Wallet alternative. This is a non-custodial wallet that allows users to store cryptocurrencies safely and anonymously. No personal information, contact details, or private data is collected when using Best Wallet. Most importantly, users have full control of their private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>This is provided by Best Wallet when setting the wallet up. Only the user can view the private keys, and they are fully encrypted on the respective device. Best Wallet supports desktop software and a mobile app for iOS and Android. Both options are user-friendly and support multiple blockchains. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2768" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313137/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313137/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_2768_1324.jpg 2768w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313137/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_574.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313137/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_900_430.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313137/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_720_344.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313137/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_600_287.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313137/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_300_143.jpg 300w"></figure><p>For example, Solana, Dash, XRP, Litecoin, and BNB. Best Wallet also supports the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-arbitrum-network-tokens.htm">best Arbitrum network tokens</a>. While users are responsible for keeping their wallets safe, Best Wallet comes with plenty of security features. This includes biometrics, such as facial and fingerprint ID. Wallets are also secured by passcodes and two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter is not supported by Trust Wallet, nor many other non-custodial wallets in the market. When it comes to core features, Best Wallet supports an entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. For example, Best Wallet offers yields on some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">best staking coins</a> &#8211; allowing users to earn rewards on their idle cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2398" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313138/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_2398_1126.jpg 2398w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_563.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_900_423.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_720_338.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_600_282.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_300_141.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Best Wallet also supports in-wallet token swaps. This feature supports cross-chain transfers, meaning users can trade Ethereum for Bitcoin or BNB for Tether without using a centralized exchange. Best Wallet has also launched its own utility token, BWAT. This offers exposure to the growth of Best Wallet, and those staking BWAT will secure additional perks.&nbsp;</p><p>This includes access to fee-free transactions, where Best Wallet covers the cost of GAS. Staking BWAT also provides access to the Best Wallet AI assistant. This helps users make informed decisions on their wallet portfolio. For example, users can ask the AI bot for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptocurrencies to buy</a> on the Binance Smart Chain.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2348" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313613/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313613/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_2348_1136.jpg 2348w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313613/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_1200_581.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313613/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_900_435.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313613/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_720_348.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313613/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_600_290.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313613/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_300_145.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Or, which cryptocurrencies to sell to reduce the wallet&#8217;s volatility. Importantly, Best Wallet is yet to launch in the market. It is currently collecting email addresses for its pre-launch &#8211; which gives users early access. Those interested in trying the wallet can <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">visit the Best Wallet website</a> to join the waitlist.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Overall best Trust Wallet alternative&nbsp;</li><li>More secure features than Trust Wallet &#8211; including two-factor authentication</li><li>Available as a mobile app and desktop software</li><li>Supports dozens of blockchain networks</li><li>In-built AI assistant helping users make informed decisions</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Has not been released yet &#8211; join the waitlist to try the wallet out&nbsp;</li><li>Fiat payments are processed by <a href="https://wert.io/fiat-onramp">WERT</a> &#8211; which charges 4% &nbsp;</li></ul><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. eToro &#8211; The Most Secure Alternative to Trust Wallet for Beginners&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/">eToro</a> is one of the best Trust Wallet alternatives for security. Unlike Trust Wallet, eToro is a custodial wallet. It comes packed with security features that ensure beginners have a safe place to store their cryptocurrencies. For example, eToro is a regulated entity that was launched in 2007. It holds licenses with some of the world&#8217;s most stringent bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>This includes FINRA (US), ASIC (Australia), FCA (UK), GFSC (Gibraltar), and CySEC (Cyprus). As a regulated custodial wallet, eToro is required to keep client funds safe. It does this by keeping client-owned cryptocurrencies in cold storage. It also offers safeguards to protect user accounts from unauthorized logins.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2142" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_2142_1138.jpg 2142w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_1200_637.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_900_478.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_720_382.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_600_318.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_300_159.jpg 300w"></figure><p>For example, two-factor authentication via SMS is required when accessing the wallet. We also like eToro for its user-friendly dashboard. At the click of a button, users can store, buy, and sell more than 90 cryptocurrencies. On top of Bitcoin and Ethereum, this includes Aave, BNB, Cardano, Solana, and Dash.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these cryptocurrencies can be traded with leverage (non-US and UK clients) and even short-sold. Moreover, eToro allows users to stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Tron, and Cardano. Passive investment can also be generated via the eToro copy trading tool. Users can choose a trade to copy, and all future investments will be replicated in their own portfolios.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1670" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313614/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313614/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_1670_1116.jpg 1670w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313614/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_1200_802.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313614/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_900_601.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313614/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_720_481.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313614/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_600_401.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313614/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w"></figure><p>This Trust Wallet alternative is available via web browsers. Simply log into the eToro account, and all features are available. That said, the eToro web wallet doesn&#8217;t allow users to send and receive cryptocurrencies via the blockchain. For this, users need to download the eToro mobile wallet for iOS or Android. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Unlike Trust Wallet &#8211; eToro is heavily regulated by tier-one bodies&nbsp;</li><li>Plenty of passive investment tools &#8211; including staking, copy trading, and managed portfolios</li><li>Completely free to use and no markups on GAS fees</li><li>Increased security tools include cold storage and two-factor authentication&nbsp;</li><li>Fiat payments cost 0.5% (free for US clients)</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/meaning-kyc">KYC</a> is required for all wallet users &nbsp;</li><li>Only supports three staking coins &#8211; Ethereum, Cardano, and Tron&nbsp;</li></ul><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit eToro</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Crypto assets are highly volatile investment products.

Trezor &#8211; Cold Storage Alternative for Long-Term Investors &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Another Trust Wallet alternative for security is Trezor. Unlike eToro, this is a non-custodial wallet that requires users to look after their private keys. That said, the private keys are encrypted on the user&#8217;s device &#8211; which remains offline at all times. This is even the case when sending cryptocurrencies to another user.&nbsp;</p><p>The transaction goes through a standard USB cable on the Trezor One device. While the latest Model T uses Bluetooth. In both cases, transfers must be authorized by entering a PIN on the device. This protects the user from remote <i>and</i> real-world hacking attempts. When setting up the wallet, users are provided with a 12 or 24-word passphrase.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2836" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313615/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313615/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_2836_1162.jpg 2836w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313615/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_1200_492.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313615/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_900_369.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313615/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_720_295.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313615/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_600_246.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313615/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_300_123.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Users will need this to recover the Trezor wallet if they forgot the PIN. The passphrase is also needed if the device is lost, damaged, or stolen. While Trezor supports fewer cryptocurrencies than Trust Wallet, it is compatible with the most popular blockchain networks. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Solana, Polygon, and Polkadot.&nbsp;</p><p>What&#8217;s more, Trezor allows users to manually add a cryptocurrency token if it isn&#8217;t supported by default. The only prerequisite is that the underlying blockchain is supported. The main drawback with Trezor is that it is not a free alternative to Trust Wallet. Instead, users <a href="https://trezor.io/compare">will pay</a> $69 and $219 for the Trezor Model One and T, respectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Cold storage solution to Trust Wallet &#8211; private keys are always offline</li><li>Outgoing transactions must be authorized on the device with a PIN</li><li>Trezor wallets can be recovered remotely via a 12 or 24-word passphrase&nbsp;</li><li>Allows users to add custom tokens to any supported blockchain standard&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The device must be purchased &#8211; with prices ranging from $69 and $219&nbsp;</li><li>A lot more time-consuming to send cryptocurrencies when compared to Trust Wallet&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>4. MetaMask &#8211; Solid Trust Wallet Alternative for Desktop Users&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>MetaMask is another Trust Wallet alternative to consider &#8211; especially for those that prefer using a desktop device. Put simply, while Trust Wallet also comes with a browser extension, it offers limited functionality. In comparison, MetaMask allows users to stake and swap tokens directly from its browser wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#8217;t the case with Trust Wallet, which only offers these features on its mobile app. Moreover, MetaMask is the better option when accessing DeFi applications on a laptop or PC. In the vast majority of cases, DeFi platforms directly support a MetaMask link-up. This removes the need to use third parties like <a href="https://walletconnect.com/">WalletConnect</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2074" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313616/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313616/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_2074_1268.jpg 2074w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313616/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_1200_734.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313616/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_900_550.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313616/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_720_440.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313616/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_600_367.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313616/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_300_183.jpg 300w"></figure><p>In terms of supported markets, Trust Wallet supersedes MetaMask. For example, MetaMask only comes with support for the Ethereum network when setting it up for the first time. It also supports Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche &#8211; but users need to add these networks manually. And unlike Trust Wallet, MetaMask does not support Bitcoin.</p><p>&nbsp;Nonetheless, we like that MetaMask is completely free to use and allows users to add custom tokens. This is the case across all supported networks. We also like that MetaMask supports browser extensions for Firefox, which Trust Wallet doesn&#8217;t. Moreover, the Trust Wallet app for iOS <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trustapp/comments/nvmmoj/the_dapp_browser_will_be_completely_removed_on/">often has difficulties</a> connecting to dApps. These issues are not present with MetaMask. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The MetaMask browser extension comes with more functionality than Trust Wallet&nbsp;</li><li>Stake and swap tokens without leaving the browser extension interface</li><li>Supports Firefox browsers &#8211; which Trust Wallet doesn&#8217;t</li><li>Great reputation and is <a href="https://metamask.io/">used by over 30 million people</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Unlike Trust Wallet &#8211; does not support Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP, or Solana</li><li>Charges 0.875% on in-wallet swap fees&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>5. Binance &#8211; Great Trust Wallet Alternative for Active Traders and Investors &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Binance is the best Trust Wallet alternative for active cryptocurrency traders. Crucially, the wallet offers unfettered access to the Binance exchange. Not only does this provide <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges">significant levels of liquidity</a> and some of the lowest commissions in the market. For every $100 traded, Binance charges just $0.10.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, Trust Wallet only supports <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">decentralized exchanges</a>, meaning limited liquidated and wider spreads. What&#8217;s more, Trust Wallet uses third parties when users stake their cryptocurrencies. Binance, however, offers a direct service without any markups. Binance also offers savings accounts, dual investments, and yield farming.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2592" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_2592_1314.jpg 2592w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_608.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_900_456.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_720_365.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_600_304.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_300_152.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Competitive rates are available on many cryptocurrencies. For example, AXS and DOT are currently yielding 32% and 14.9% on 90-day and 120-day terms, respectively. Unlike Trust Wallet, Binance also offers access to leveraged derivatives. This allows users to trade with more money than they have in their accounts. Leverage can be accessed via spot trading, options, and futures.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Binance is a custodial wallet, it comes with greater security features than Trust Wallet. This includes two-factor authentication and cold storage on the majority of client funds. This is in addition to an internal insurance fund and IP address whitelisting. &nbsp;In contrast, Trust Wallet is only secured by a PIN or password. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Convenient web wallet that does not require users to look after their private keys</li><li>Security includes an insurance fund, two-factor authentication, and cold storage&nbsp;</li><li>Pay just $0.10 in fees for every $100 traded&nbsp;</li><li>Offers some of the best interest yields in the market &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Custodial storage will not appeal to all cryptocurrency investors&nbsp;</li><li>Withdrawals come with a flat fee that is above the real-time GAS price &nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>6. Exodus &#8211; Non-Custodial Desktop Wallet for Windows and Mac &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Exodus is also one of the best Trust Wallet alternatives for 2023. Unlike Trust Wallet, Exodus offers native software for Windows and Mac. The wallet is non-custodial and is protected by a password. The wallet can be recovered via a 12-word passphrase if the password is forgotten. Private keys are secured and encrypted on the user&#8217;s device.&nbsp;</p><p>Exodus supports over 50 blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, Tron, Monero, and Binance Smart Chain. Any token from a supported network can be added to Exodus manually. We also like that Exodus is suitable for beginners and experienced pros alike. It takes just seconds to get started and navigating the wallet is seamless.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2446" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313618/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313618/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_2446_1282.jpg 2446w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313618/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_1200_629.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313618/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_900_472.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313618/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_720_377.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313618/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_600_314.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313618/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_300_157.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Exodus also makes it simple to assess the performance of invested cryptocurrencies. All tokens within the user&#8217;s wallet are priced in US dollars. Users also have the option of changing the default currency to GBP, EUR, and others. In terms of fees, Exodus does not levy any charges to store and receive cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>GAS fees on outgoing transactions do not come with any markups. There will be fees when using third-party tools that are integrated into the wallet. This includes fiat payments, token swaps, and staking. Finally, we should also mention that Exodus offers a mobile app and browser extension. Supported operating systems include iOS, Android, Chrome, and Brave. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Best Trust Wallet alternative for Windows and Mac software</li><li>No fees to store or receive cryptocurrencies</li><li>Portfolio management tool offers real-time valuations in fiat money</li><li>Supports all tokens on over 50 blockchain standards &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Charges fees when users stake and swap cryptocurrencies&nbsp;</li><li>Similar security features to Trust Wallet&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>7. OKX &#8211; Decentralized Wallet App Integrated With 200+ Exchanges &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>OKX is one of the best Trust Wallet alternatives for earning high yields on idle cryptocurrency investments. It has developed a &#8216;bridge aggregator&#8217; that connects to over 200 decentralized exchanges. This means that users can deposit their cryptocurrencies into a staking pool with the highest APYs.&nbsp;</p><p>The bridge aggregator ensures that the user does not need to leave the OKX wallet when earning yields. In addition to staking, yields can also be earned via savings accounts and liquidity farming. OKX is also one of the best Trust Wallet alternatives for swapping tokens anonymously. Users simply need to select the tokens they want to swap, and OKX will secure the best rates.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2186" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313619/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313619/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_2186_1210.jpg 2186w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313619/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_1200_664.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313619/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_900_498.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313619/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_720_399.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313619/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_600_332.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313619/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_300_166.jpg 300w"></figure><p>The wallet is completely decentralized and operates independently from the main OKX exchange. This means no account is required to use the wallet. In terms of security, the OKX wallet is protected by a PIN and biometrics. Users also have the option of switching over the Multi-Party Computation (MPC) storage.&nbsp;</p><p>In a nutshell, MPC technology distributes private keys across multiple devices. Each device will only have access to a <i>segment</i> of the private keys. Meaning &#8211; a remote hack wouldn&#8217;t provide access to the wallet. In terms of supported cryptocurrencies, the OKX wallet is compatible with dozens of blockchains.

We also found that some Trust Wallet alternatives offer support for additional devices and operating systems.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In this section, we explore some of the key reasons why the above Trust Wallet alternatives are worth considering.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Devices</strong></h3><p>While <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trust-wallet-review.htm">Trust Wallet</a> is compatible with multiple devices, it comes with various shortcomings.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Trust Wallet supports Chrome, Edge, and Brave &#8211; but not Firefox. Those using Firefox will need to consider a Trust Wallet alternative like MetaMask. Furthermore, the Trust Wallet browser extension comes with limited functionality.&nbsp;</p><p>While it enables users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies &#8211; staking and token swaps can only be accessed on the mobile app. &nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="732" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313621/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313621/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_732_1184.jpg 732w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313621/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_720_1165.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313621/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_600_970.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313621/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_300_485.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Moreover, Trust Wallet does not offer desktop software for Windows or Mac. The best Trust Wallet alternative for desktop users is Exodus.&nbsp;</p><p>Another point to consider is that iOS users have issues accessing the decentralized web. While Android users can connect to dApps directly, iOS smartphones require a workaround. This requires users to go through WalletConnect, which is far from convenient.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Fiat Payments</strong></h3><p>Although Trust Wallet allows users to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money, this service is provided by Simplex. This is a third-party payment processor that charges <a href="https://support.simplex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014078420-What-fees-do-you-charge-for-card-payments-#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20Simplex's%20fees%20range,higher%20than%20the%20aforementioned%20range.">between 3.5% and 5%</a> on debit/credit card payments. These fees are passed on to the user.&nbsp;</p><p>What&#8217;s more, the minimum payment fee is $10. This is especially problematic for those wishing to buy a small amount of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For instance, say a user meets the minimum payment amount of $50.&nbsp;</li><li>Paying a fee of $10 equates to a commission of 20%.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The minimum payment amount of $50 is also considered high.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, some Trust Wallet users buy cryptocurrencies with a debit/credit card because they need ETH or BNB to pay GAS fees.&nbsp;</li><li>After all, without the required GAS fees, ERC20 and BEP20 transactions cannot be processed. This ends up being expensive when using fiat money on Trust Wallet. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now let&#8217;s compare the same process with eToro.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The minimum fiat deposit on eToro is much lower than Trust Wallet at just $10</li><li>While Trust Wallet charges up to 5% on debit/credit cards, the maximum fee on eToro is 0.5%</li><li>If the debit/credit card is denominated in US dollars, eToro reduces the fee to 0%</li></ul><p>Additionally, there is no minimum fee when using eToro. For example, if the user deposits the minimum of $10, the 0.5% fee will still apply. As such, the user will only pay $0.05.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Non-Custodial Security</strong></h3><p>Although some investors like Trust Wallet for its non-custodial and anonymous nature, the wallet lacks robust security features.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>In fact, the Trust Wallet app is only protected by a PIN or fingerprint ID.&nbsp;</li><li>Equally, the Trust Wallet browser extension is only protected by a password.&nbsp;</li><li>If a bad actor is able to remotely hack the user&#8217;s credentials, they might be able to access the wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>After all, Trust Wallet is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-hot-wallets.htm">hot wallet</a> that always remains online.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In comparison, some of the best Trust Wallet alternatives discussed today offer much greater security features.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Trezor is never exposed to the internet, as it&#8217;s a cold wallet that is always offline.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there&#8217;s Best Wallet, which is one of the only non-custodial wallets to offer two-factor authentication. This is in addition to biometrics and passwords.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the OKX wallet allows users to secure their private keys via MPC technology. As noted earlier, this splits the private keys across multiple locations, making a remote hack redundant. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Custodianship</strong></h3><p>Some cryptocurrency investors do not want to go through the hassle of securing private keys. Instead, they simply want to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without compromising safety.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, one of the best Trust Wallet alternatives for custodianship is eToro. This custodial wallet is regulated in multiple locations, including the US and UK. It keeps the majority of client cryptocurrencies offline in cold storage. eToro also enables users to protect their wallets with two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2864" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_2864_1040.jpg 2864w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1200_436.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_900_327.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_720_261.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_600_218.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_300_109.jpg 300w"></figure><p>If the eToro risk management team detects suspicious activity, they will ask the user for additional verification. This is in addition to eToro&#8217;s KYC policy, where all users must be identified.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the above security tools are implemented behind the scenes. From the perspective of the user, they simply need to log into their accounts to access the wallet. In other words, eToro takes full responsibility for the user&#8217;s private keys <i>and</i> cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Customer Support</strong></h3><p>Another area to consider when searching for alternatives to Trust Wallet is customer support. This is a specific area where Trust Wallet lacks. There is no live chat option, nor a telephone support line.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, users are redirected to the Trust Wallet website to fill out a support ticket. <a href="https://community.trustwallet.com/t/urgent-matter-and-no-email-respond-from-support/359774">Some Trust Wallet users</a> have reported waiting several weeks for a reply.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1158" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313624/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117282/313624/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_1158_998.jpg 1158w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313624/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_900_776.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313624/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_720_621.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313624/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_600_517.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117282/313624/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-___media_library_original_300_259.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Now let&#8217;s compare this to wallets like eToro and Binance. Both of these providers offer live chat support around the clock. In most cases, users are connected with a support agent in minutes. This enables users to receive assistance on urgent matters quickly.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3><p>Although Trust Wallet comes with various drawbacks, it&#8217;s one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-decentralized-crypto-wallets.htm">best decentralized wallets</a> for supported cryptocurrencies. It supports over 70 blockchain networks, as well as custom tokens. According to <a href="https://trustwallet.com/">Trust Wallet</a>, this means the wallet supports over 4.5 million digital assets.&nbsp;</p><p>With this in mind, ensure the preferred cryptocurrencies are supported when searching for an alternative to Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, those holding Bitcoin, XRP, or Cardano won&#8217;t be suited for MetaMask. This is because MetaMask does not support these networks.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Similarly, users should ensure that their chosen Trust Wallet alternative allows custom tokens to be added.&nbsp;</li><li>For instance, suppose an investor is holding a newly launched BEP20 token.</li><li>Even if the token is listed on a cryptocurrency exchange, it can be added to Exodus instantly.&nbsp;</li><li>This is because Exodus supports the Binance Smart Chain and, thus &#8211; all BEP20 tokens.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ultimately, it makes sense to have just <i>one</i> cryptocurrency wallet to manage. So be sure to check what cryptocurrencies are supported before getting started.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wallet Fee</strong></h3><p>Users should also consider fees when selecting the best Trust Wallet alternative. All of the alternatives discussed today allow users to store and receive cryptocurrencies for free.&nbsp;</p><p>However, hardware devices like Trezor must be purchased. The entry-level model costs $69, while the most advanced edition retails for $219.&nbsp;</p><p>Users should also check whether the wallet adds a markup to GAS fees. While Trust Wallet doesn&#8217;t, Binance does. For example, the <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">Ethereum blockchain is currently charging average GAS fees of $0.58</a>. While <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee">Binance is charging $1.37</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, users should check what fees apply for additional services, like token swaps and staking. Trust Wallet doesn&#8217;t charge for these services, but others do. For instance, MetaMask charges 0.875% on token swaps.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>In summary, there are many Trust Wallet alternatives that offer increased security, reduced fees, and access to more features and tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Best Wallet is a great alternative to Trust Wallet. This non-custodial wallet offers two-factor authentication and biometric security &#8211; not to mention in-built staking for desktop and mobile users.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the Best Wallet website to get early access before the wallet is officially launched. &nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><ol><li><a href="https://wert.io/fiat-onramp">https://wert.io/fiat-onramp</a></li><li><a href="https://trezor.io/compare">https://trezor.io/compare</a></li><li><a href="https://walletconnect.com/">https://walletconnect.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trustapp/comments/nvmmoj/the_dapp_browser_will_be_completely_removed_on/">https://www.reddit.com/r/trustapp/comments/nvmmoj/the_dapp_browser_will_be_completely_removed_on/</a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/</a></li><li><a href="https://community.trustwallet.com/t/urgent-matter-and-no-email-respond-from-support/359774">https://community.trustwallet.com/t/urgent-matter-and-no-email-respond-from-support/359774</a></li><li><a href="https://trustwallet.com/">https://trustwallet.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee">https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee</a></li><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">https://etherscan.io/gastracker</a></li><li><a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/meaning-kyc">https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/meaning-kyc</a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges">https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges</a></li></ol><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>Which is better Coinbase or Trust Wallet?</strong></h4><p>Coinbase will appeal to users that want to store cryptocurrencies in a regulated environment, while Trust Wallet offers non-custodial storage.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What is the best Trust Wallet alternative?</strong></h4><p>For increased security and features while using non-custodial storage &#8211; Best Wallet is the best alternative to Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What fees does Trust Wallet charge?</strong></h4><p>While Trust Wallet offers fee-free storage, staking, and token swaps &#8211; it charges fees when using fiat money to purchase cryptocurrencies (up to 5%).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
