At the same time, this is a convenient alternative to banks whose transaction or conversion fees are considered too high for one&rsquo;s taste or pocket. There are few quick legit ways how to buy Ethereum with PayPal.</p><p>Since late 2020, you can <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/paypal-begin-to-allow-cryptocurrency-usage-8434.htm">buy cryptocurrencies using your PayPal</a> e-wallet. All you need to do is have a funded PayPal account, choose the cryptocurrency you want to buy, and confirm your purchase.</p><p>However, buying ether on PayPal has its own caveats. For instance, PayPal does not allow you to withdraw your crypto assets into a private self-hosted wallet, meaning that you won&#8217;t be able to use it for anything else but selling it back to PayPal once its price goes up or down. The essence of cryptocurrency is the ability to own private digital cash without having to rely on any intermediaries and send or receive them in a censorship-resistant way. At least for now, getting cryptocurrency via PayPal is a safe way to get exposure to the asset class, but it does not let you use it in ways it was made to be used &#8211; as a free and open peer-to-peer (P2P) financial system without trusted intermediaries.</p><p>Luckily for you, there actually are three other methods of how you can buy Ethereum with PayPal instantly via other platforms that give you full ownership of your digital assets.</p><h2>Buy Ethereum With PayPal via eToro</h2><p>The easiest way to buy Ethereum with PayPal is by using the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro">eToro</a> platform. Although it is primarily a CFD&rsquo;s trading platform, you can also buy, hold, and send cryptocurrencies using eToro wallet. Aside from Ethereum, you can also use PayPal to buy <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash">Bitcoin Cash</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/litecoin">Litecoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dash">Dash</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple">Ripple</a> cryptocurrencies. The platform itself is super easy to use and is often regarded as one of the best places for beginning investors. The minimum deposit starts from $200. In 2019, eToro is planning to release support for more coins and enter the US market, too.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><i>Paypal payment is not available for US users.&nbsp; eToro USA LLC does not offer CFDs, only real Cryptocurrencies are available for US users.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p><ul>
<li>You can read our full <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/etoro">eToro review</a> here.</li>
</ul><h2>Buying Ethereum With PayPal via LocalEthereum</h2><p>Another option is to visit LocalEthereum as an informal exchange platform on which you can find and get in touch with people who sell ether in various areas. Depending on their preferences, they may accept PayPal payment from you.</p><p>LocalEthereum operates as a website which connects you with people who want to sell Ethereum in your local area or worldwide. It is like &ldquo;eBay of Ethereum.&rdquo; Depending on how thorough you are in your search, sooner or later you will find someone willing to accept PayPal payments. If you want to buy ETH with PayPal in this manner, you should pay attention to any aspect of a transaction in advance, as you alone will bear the risk of dealing with scammers. Some of them may claim that they never received your payment, so go for reputable traders only. Make sure you check their terms of trade and try to learn as much about them as possible before clicking on a payment button.</p><p>These are the most convenient ways to purchase Ethereum with PayPal. If you want to learn more about how to buy other cryptocurrencies, see our &ldquo;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-altcoins.htm">How to get altcoins</a>&rdquo; guide.</p>

MyEtherWallet is also compatible with all major hardware wallets such as Trezor, and Ledger.</p><p>The only drawback to MEW is its lack of support for Ethereum-incompatible altcoins.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Mobile app and browser extension</li><li>Cross-chain support</li><li>NFT Marketplace</li><li>Strong security features</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Only supports ETH-based tokens</li></ul><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></td><td>Software</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of Supported Cryptos</strong></td><td>Any ETH-compatible</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fee to Buy ETH</strong></td><td>Customizable</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mobile App</strong></td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>How Do Ethereum Wallets Work?</h2><p>Beginner investors can easily choose the best Ethereum wallet from our list. However, it is imperative to understand how crypto wallets work to trust the allocation of your digital assets to them.</p><p>Ethereum wallets provide a secure, efficient and user-friendly mechanism to store ETH, NFTs and other crypto tokens and then later <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-can-you-buy-with-ethereum.htm">buy products with Ethereum</a> if they so wish.</p><p>Crypto wallets are not unlike regular cash wallets. They also allow users to digitally hold their assets, the key difference being that crypto assets are not physically stored in the wallet.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies are bits of data that are located on a blockchain. The wallets essentially store the user&rsquo;s proof of ownership of crypto assets.</p><p>ETH tokens are stored in Ethereum&rsquo;s Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). Most Ethereum wallets allow users to generate a new Ethereum account. Traders do not need to use a previously generated Ethereum account.</p><p>Users operate their ETH tokens through two cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Public Key</strong>: A public key can be intuitively visualized as a bank account number. Users can transfer ETH tokens from to others using their public key. Public keys are named so because users can publicly distribute this key to receive crypto assets from others.</p><p><strong>Private Key</strong>: A private key is an alpha-numeric passcode that proves a user&rsquo;s ownership of an Ethereum account. Every Ethereum EOA has an associated private key. As the name suggests, a private key needs to be protected at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p>If a malicious actor gets hold of the key, they can easily claim possession of all the crypto assets associated with it. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, in most cases, users cannot even recover their accounts.</p><p>A private key has another important use. Ethereum uses a user&rsquo;s private key to cryptographically generate a digital signature. This digital signature is used to sign all outgoing crypto transactions. A malicious actor can use the private key to forge transactions.</p><p>A wallet is primarily responsible for protecting this private key. Furthermore, a wallet can also generate multiple public keys. A public key is cryptographically derived from a private key. While the public key can be distributed, it can be used to track certain details about a user such as transaction history and account balance. Therefore, modern wallets generate a new public key after every transaction to protect a user&rsquo;s privacy.</p><p>A crypto wallet uses a seed phrase to authenticate the user&rsquo;s ownership of the wallet. Therefore, it is imperative that users protect their seed phrases from ever being stolen. Users can also choose to store the phrase at multiple locations for surety.&nbsp;</p><h2>Types of Ethereum Wallet</h2><p>While all wallets generally perform the same set of functions, there can be several key differences between them. A beginner user needs to understand the tradeoffs involved in order to choose the best Ethereum wallet.</p><p>Based on the mode of availability, wallets are generally categorized into three categories: software wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets.&nbsp;</p><h3>Software Wallet</h3><p>A software wallet is an application that allows users to store their crypto assets by digitally securing their private keys.</p><p>A software wallet&rsquo;s best feature is its accessibility. Users can access these applications on commonly used devices such as Android and iOS phones, personal computers and even web browsers. They do not require the purchase of any new equipment or device.</p><p>Software wallets are commonly referred to as hot wallets. While those terms may be used interchangeably, a hot wallet is technically referred to as any wallet that is connected to the internet.</p><p>Software wallets being connected to the internet results in a tradeoff between ease of use and security. Software wallets allow users to quickly purchase and sell crypto assets using their private keys. The<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm"> best crypto apps</a> can also often support a wider range of crypto tokens and provide seamless transactions. Furthermore, they provide a range of payment options such as credit/debit cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay and PayPal.</p><p>While software wallets provide a bevy of advantages, they are considered less secure than hardware wallets. The connectivity to the internet can allow hackers and other malicious actors to gain access to a user&rsquo;s private key.</p><p>A software wallet can be further categorized into three categories: mobile wallets, desktop wallets and web wallets.</p><ul><li><strong>Mobile Wallet</strong>: As the name suggests, mobile wallets are applications that users can run on their Android or iOS platforms. Best Ethereum wallets such as Best Wallet offer these applications on both Google Play Store and Apple app store.</li><li><strong>Desktop Wallet</strong>: Desktop wallets are wallet interfaces that users can download on their personal computers. Desktop applications store the private key on the computer&rsquo;s local storage.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Web Wallet</strong>: Web wallets are one of the most popular kinds of software wallets. Users can usually search for these wallet services on the internet and add them as a web browser extension. While these wallets provide extremely user-friendly interfaces, they are considered the least secure. They can be subjected to keylogger hacks and distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Hardware Wallets</h3><p>Hardware wallets are considered one of the most secure forms of crypto storage. These wallets are physical pieces of equipment that secure the private-public key pair. Users need to connect the equipment to a device such as a personal computer to operate the wallet.</p><p>An Ethereum hardware wallet is also referred to as a cold wallet. Cold wallets are defined as any crypto storage device that does not connect to the internet. The lack of internet connection ensures that malicious actors cannot steal the confidential information of the users. Software wallets are as secure as the platform they are operating on while hardware wallets provide additional multiple layers of security for users.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="4164" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/responsive-images/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd___media_library_original_4164_2780.jpg 4164w, https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/responsive-images/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd___media_library_original_1200_801.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/responsive-images/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd___media_library_original_900_601.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/responsive-images/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd___media_library_original_720_481.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/responsive-images/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd___media_library_original_600_401.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/responsive-images/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Hardware wallets can also provide additional security features. For example, modern cold wallets use security features such as a PIN code or a biometric scan that makes it impossible for a malicious actor to access the crypto tokens. Hardware wallets are also coming up with additional technology to replace seed phrases, thus eliminating the single point of failure.</p><p>While hardware wallets are secure, they also have some key disadvantages. Most importantly, hardware wallets are considered to be less user-friendly than software wallets. These wallets need to be connected to another device such as a desktop to operate.</p><p>Hardware wallets are also considered significantly more expensive than software wallets &#8211; the price of a hardware wallet can usually range between $50 &#8211; $300 and can be a deal breaker for several users.&nbsp;</p><h3>Paper Wallets</h3><p>Ethereum paper wallet involves crypto asset holders writing down their private-public key pair on a piece of paper. This is an old method of storage that is rarely used with the advent of modern crypto wallet technology.</p><p>Paper wallets are a kind of cold wallet. However, unlike hardware wallets, they are considered unreliable and risky. Users with paper wallets require an interface to access the blockchain. Therefore, they often end up depending upon exchanges or software wallets, negating any advantage of cold storage.</p><p>Furthermore, paper wallets are a massive single point of failure risk. The private key can be lost, stolen or destroyed, making it impossible for the user to ever access their crypto assets.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Find Safe Ethereum Wallets?</h2><p>The primary function of an Ethereum wallet is to secure a user&rsquo;s private key and the crypto assets allocated to it.&nbsp;</p><p>Investors, especially those just entering into crypto investment are always keen to know if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-cryptocurrency-safe.htm">cryptocurrency is safe to invest in</a> and wallets are a necessary feature of participating in the space. However, there are several factors that a user can consider to choose the most secure Ethereum wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3>Reputation of the Provider</h3><p>Due to the decentralized nature of crypto, scams and rug pulls are one of the biggest threats to the digital assets of a user.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, considering the reputation of a wallet provider is the easiest step a user can take to trust the authenticity of the wallet.</p><p>For example, a wallet that is regulated by a leading regulatory body can generally be trusted. Similarly, providers with a strong track record of traditional financing can also be trusted with their crypto products.</p><h3>Security Features</h3><p>A good understanding of the various security features offered by crypto wallets can help users select the best wallet.</p><p>Hardware wallets are usually considered the most secure option. These wallets are not connected to the internet, preventing any malicious activity to access the user&rsquo;s confidential data. They can also provide additional security features such as biometrics and a PIN code.</p><p>On the other hand, a software wallet can also be trusted if it provides comprehensive security features.</p><h3>Testing the Wallet</h3><p>Testing the wallet may be the best way to develop trust. Users can send a small amount of crypto assets using the wallet before trusting it for significant amounts. A number of Ethereum wallets also allow users to try out the wallet on the testnet using fake crypto assets.&nbsp;</p><h2>How To Choose The Best Ethereum Wallet For You?</h2><p>The choice for the best Ethereum wallet is a matter of personal choice and can differ from user to user. Here are the key factors that can help users make an informed choice.&nbsp;</p><h3>Security</h3><p>As we have already discussed, a wallet&rsquo;s primary role is to ensure the security of a user&rsquo;s crypto assets. Therefore, users need to consider security as their top priority while selecting the Ethereum wallet. Beginners need to choose a wallet that is reputed and is certified by a regulatory body.</p><p>Beginners are also susceptible to losing their private keys. Therefore, they need to choose a wallet with proper wallet recovery options such as seed phrase, two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, it is possible to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-avoid-crypto-taxes.htm">avoid paying tax on crypto</a> if you simply keep it in your wallet and don&#8217;t sell it, but you want peace of mind that it will still be there when you return.</p><h3>Supported Coins&nbsp;</h3><p>Beginners can be overwhelmed by the wide variety of assets available in the crypto market. A high-quality wallet supports a large number of crypto tokens, thus allowing users to diversify their portfolios.</p><p>Many top wallets are also universal in nature as they support more than one blockchain network.</p><h3>Fees</h3><p>Another important factor to consider is the fees required to purchase certain crypto assets through a wallet. Different wallets use different exchanges to allow users to purchase crypto tokens from the wallet interface. Hardware wallets can often partner with third-party services to offer crypto functionality to users.</p><p>Fees can be of various types such as processing fees, network fees, trading fees, withdrawal fees, etc. Hardware wallets also require users to purchase the device upfront which can be expensive.</p><h3>User-Friendliness</h3><p>Beginners need to consider that the wallet they choose is user-friendly. The idea of user-friendliness can differ from user to user. Beginner users may prioritize the ability to operate their Ethereum wallets from their mobile phones. Proper customer support and a broad ecosystem can also make wallets like Best Wallet user-friendly.</p><p>Most importantly, wallets must provide users with a clear user interface to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><h3>Features</h3><p>Users may prioritize the availability of certain features in their wallets. For example, NFT enthusiasts may prioritize that the wallet provides NFT support. Seasoned investors may require staking, farming and yield functionality in their wallets.&nbsp;</p><h3>Type of Wallet and Mobile Availability</h3><p>Users need to make a careful choice between hardware wallets and software wallets. Most beginners prefer the availability of mobile wallets. Therefore, they need to ensure that the wallet of their choice provides Android or iOS support.</p><p>Seasoned investors may choose a multi-layered approach that involves both hot wallets and cold wallets. Such users usually store their assets in cold storage and transfer them to a hot wallet when they are looking to trade.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Get &amp; Use A Ethereum Wallet &#8211; Step-by-Step</h2><p>By now, a user has enough information to choose the best Ethereum wallet of their liking. Now, let&rsquo;s go over how users can operate an Ethereum wallet seamlessly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a decentralized platform for building and using applications on a blockchain distributed ledger.
 
It&rsquo;s also referred to as a &ldquo;world computer&rdquo;, since the Ethereum platform uses the computing power of the computers connected to its&#8230;</p><p>What is Ethereum? It&rsquo;s a decentralized platform for building and using applications on a blockchain distributed ledger. Find out more in our What Is Ethereum Guide. Here, we try to answer the most common internet searches such as &ldquo;What is Ethereum for beginners,&rdquo; &ldquo;what is Ethereum and how does it work&rdquo; and &ldquo;Getting started with Ethereum.&rdquo;</p><p>How does Ethereum work? Simply, it&rsquo;s also referred to as a &ldquo;world computer&rdquo;, since the Ethereum platform uses the computing power of the computers connected to its network. The information is stored on each computer, or &ldquo;node&rdquo;, meaning it&rsquo;s decentralized and controlled by no one, unlike a traditional database. There&rsquo;s no limit on the number of such computers that can connect to the network.</p><p>Ethereum history starts from development by programmers Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson, and it was launched in 2015. The project was financed by issuing its own cryptocurrency &ndash; ether. The market capitalization of this coin (aka &ldquo;ethereum&rdquo;) had already exceeded USD 70 billion as of December 2017, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The Ethereum platform supports the creation of decentralized applications, or &ldquo;dapps&rdquo;, which, not controlled by a third party, store data, transfer assets, and so on. They&rsquo;re resistant to downtime, censorship, and fraud. These applications are run by so-called &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo;, which are computer codes. (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">Read about smart contracts here</a>.)</p><p>Basic facts that you should know about Ethereum are, for example, that it is often used for Initial Coin Offering projects, since it&rsquo;s helpful for creating one&rsquo;s own cryptocurrency to sell and kickstart a project. Other applications already built on Ethereum include systems for voting, real estate crowdfunding, lotteries, gaming, social networking, lending, money transfers, and more. Future projects may address the Internet of Things, predictions markets, the energy transfer business, and so on. However, this might be not everything you need to know about Ethereum, but there are many books written on the subject which might help you.</p><p>The technology is still young, with constant new developments and improvements. Meanwhile, other platforms like NEM have entered the same field and offer their own solutions for building applications on their blockchains. In March 2017, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was established. It connects enterprises from the Fortune 500 (a list of the world&rsquo;s largest companies), startups, academics, and technology vendors with Ethereum subject matter experts. The Alliance&rsquo;s aims is business-friendly Ethereum solutions. </p><p><i></i></p><p>Previous &#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-accept-bitcoin-in-business.htm">How to accept Bitcoin in business</a><br>

However, a larger use case for ether is its usage for gas payment when building <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dapp">decentralized applications</a> (dapps) and other financial networks on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>The Ethereum blockchain is not only about powering financial transactions. In fact, the popularity of the blockchain comes from its capacity to allow software developers to build various applications on it, ranging from decentralized platforms for lending money to social media networks.</p><p>For any such decentralized app on Ethereum, ether acts as the &#8220;fuel.&#8221; Any activity on the blockchain requires an amount of ether to power it, which is why ethereum network fees are also known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum-gas-fees-explained.htm">&#8220;gas.&#8221;</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum.org</a>, the primary online resource for the Ethereum community, calls ether the lifeblood of Ethereum. That is because users need to pay a fee in ether to get block space on the Ethereum network, which is used to send ETH to other users or use an ETH-based application.&nbsp;</p><p>The fee paid in ether is an incentive for block producers (miners or validators) to process and verify transactions, secure the network, and add new blocks to the blockchain. Miners are responsible for checking and verifying transactions and making sure no one is cheating &#8211; e.g., trying to double spend their coins.&nbsp;</p><p>In exchange for their work, miners are rewarded with ether. The current block reward is two ETH per block plus all the priority fees contained in the block. Priority fees, also called tips, are additional fees made to have the transaction completed faster.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1400" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/2857/211717/adobestock-478330019-editorial-use-only.jpeg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/2857/211717/responsive-images/adobestock-478330019-editorial-use-only___media_library_original_1400_700.jpeg 1400w, https://cimg.co/guide/2857/211717/responsive-images/adobestock-478330019-editorial-use-only___media_library_original_1200_600.jpeg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/2857/211717/responsive-images/adobestock-478330019-editorial-use-only___media_library_original_900_450.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/2857/211717/responsive-images/adobestock-478330019-editorial-use-only___media_library_original_720_360.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/2857/211717/responsive-images/adobestock-478330019-editorial-use-only___media_library_original_600_300.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/2857/211717/responsive-images/adobestock-478330019-editorial-use-only___media_library_original_300_150.jpeg 300w"><figcaption>Source: Adobe / jroballo</figcaption></figure><p>As Ethereum moves closer to its much-anticipated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum-2-0.htm">Ethereum 2.0 upgrade</a>, when it migrates from the energy-intensive <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-work.htm">proof-of-work consensus</a> mechanism to a less resource-intensive <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm">proof-of-stake system</a>, ETH will become even more important.&nbsp;</p><p>That is because proof-of-stake uses validators instead of miners to secure the network and verify transactions. And in order to become a validator, a user needs to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-stake-eth-for-ethereum-2-0.htm">stake ETH 32 first</a>. In this system, validators are expected to be honest, meaning they do not try to attack the network; otherwise, they would lose their staked ETH.</p><p>Since ether underpins the Ethereum financial system, the token can also be used as collateral to generate different cryptocurrencies on Ethereum-based decentralized applications. Moreover, users can borrow, lend, and earn interest on their ETH and other ETH-backed tokens.</p><p>It is worth noting that use cases for ether grow every day, largely courtesy of the programmability of Ethereum. While ether was originally used as a trustless currency, the proliferation of decentralized exchanges and other dApps now allow users to trade ETH with other tokens, earn interest on ETH and other Ethereum-based tokens, and even use it to get stablecoins.</p><h2>Why is ether valuable?</h2><p>Ether is valuable to different people in different ways. On the surface, ether is a digital currency and can be used to pay for goods and services at certain stores and marketplaces. Most notably, users can now spend Ether like cash via the <strong>BitPay Card</strong>, which is accepted by hundreds of merchants.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, for users of the Ethereum blockchain, ETH is valuable because it lets them pay transaction fees. If a user has millions of dollars worth of crypto assets parked in their Ethereum wallet, they can&#8217;t move or do anything with their crypto unless they have enough ETH to cover the gas fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Some see ETH as a digital store of value because the creation of new ETH slows down over time. In fact, after the transition to proof-of-stake, ether is projected to become a deflationary coin, meaning that a greater sum of ETH will be burned than created.</p><p>More recently, ETH has become even more valuable to users of financial apps on Ethereum, who can use the coin as collateral for crypto loans, or as a payment system. And of course, some may view ether as an investment, similar to bitcoin or other <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-cryptocurrency.htm">cryptocurrencies</a>.</p><h2>Characteristics of ether</h2><p>At its core, ether is a cryptocurrency, meaning its transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography. This has some significant implications for users.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Ether lets owners be their own banks</strong> since ETH holders have full control over their funds. They can easily send tokens to other users without the need for third parties or intermediaries.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>ETH is decentralized and global.</strong> There&#8217;s no company or bank that can decide to print more ETH, or change the terms of use. Also, people from all jurisdictions can access ETH. An internet connection and an Ethereum wallet are all one would need to accept ETH.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Notably, users don&#8217;t have to buy one whole ether to get started, they can purchase a fraction of the coin. ETH is divisible up to 18 decimal places, meaning one can buy as little as 0.000000000000000001 ETH if they want.</p><h2>What is the difference between ether and Ethereum?</h2><p>Ethereum refers to the entire Ethereum blockchain that is home to digital money, global payments, and decentralized applications. The Ethereum blockchain is decentralized, open-source, and comes with smart contract functionality.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, ether is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. As noted above, ether acts as the fuel for decentralized apps built on the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, ether powers any activity on the blockchain, making it a crucial part of the network.</p><p><i>Previous &#8211; </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm"><i>What is a smart contract?</i></a><br><i>Next &#8211; </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm"><i>What is blockchain?</i></a></p><p><i>Have any suggestions about this entry? </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/have-a-story.htm"><i>Let us know</i></a><i>.</i></p>

No, you didn&rsquo;t miss anything, there is a thing called gas fees. They are charged by certain blockchains to pay for the services that they provide. Think of gas fees as fuel for a vehicle. This guide is your road map to gas fees. Buckle up &#8211; we are going to fill your &lsquo;Crypto tank&rsquo; full of &lsquo;gas fee&rsquo; knowledge.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zRkKK8WTTV71_c7Jp5jeXYtCjwmfCbDlErYBhCo_wx8w9cf7W30vp2cJ1AQaVraJRgZS0SFYpKPwf8oct0Mm1hPSV2tiTVB9JWgyTFxEk9vBH1Zb3pa8JjNE2o6oVrFHFkiWs6H2pFhy9nPDUg" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source: Elizabeth Bopp / Cryptonews.com</figcaption></figure><h2>What are Gas Fees?</h2><p>Gas is a term used in crypto. Gas fees are compensation to cover work computed to complete transactions. Gas fees can have different names or functions based on the blockchain being used and not all blockchains use gas fees in the same sense that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum.htm">Ethereum blockchain</a> does, which we are going to discuss here.</p><h2>What is EVM?</h2><p>For this guide, we will focus on<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/"><u> Ethereum&rsquo;s Virtual Machine (EVM)</u></a>. At the time of writing this guide, EVM is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-work.htm">Proof-of-Work</a> Layer 1 blockchain (which is planning to switch to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm">Proof-of-Stake</a> in the near future) whose native coin is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">ether aka ETH</a>. Proof-of-Work blockchains have a person verifying, validating, and completing each transaction.</p><h2>How Does EVM Work, What is Proof-of-Work?</h2><p>Miners, validators, and node operators are the stakeholders performing the &lsquo;work&rsquo; in these transactions that need fees. The pay here is not measured by the hour but by work performed. People or companies who contribute work to completing transactions receive ETH as a reward. Therein, we have a proof-of-work style consensus and gas fees. The larger the transaction, or, the more block space it takes, the larger the gas fee will be. Transaction gas fees can also get much larger when the network is congested.&nbsp;</p><p>Ethereum&#8217;s necessity to use a Proof-of-Work style blockchain is best described in their &lsquo;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf">Yellow Paper&rsquo;</a>. The latest edition was released in April 2022:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mining proof-of-work (PoW) exists as a cryptographically secure nonce that proves beyond reasonable doubt that a particular amount of computation has been expended in the determination of some token value n. It is utilized to enforce blockchain security by giving meaning and credence to the notion of difficulty (and, by extension, total difficulty). However, since mining new blocks comes with an attached reward, the proof-of-work not only functions as a method of securing confidence that the blockchain will remain canonical into the future, but also as a wealth distribution mechanism.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2>How Are Gas Fees Calculated?</h2><p>Now that we have more context for the proof-of-work blockchain consensus, we can take a look at how gas fees are broken down. Fortunately for us, Ethereum provides great tools for learning about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/"><u>gas fees</u></a>! Here are two tables that show how gas fees are calculated:</p><figure class="image"><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CW3FmGAmMHzWowgicE4lw51VtMP_XEWltjKhVSH9egLwwYJ1coFGZl6UiGpTCYnuyc3f5rj28jVVuL6Jl3nHYus7zQI3ZleYL81tLXSAd6dwgBXIZdXJ1NSaS9gQ0d1woK0ie-ikSkBaXsOK2w" data-srcset=""></a><figcaption>Source: Ethereum.org</figcaption></figure><p>The table above demonstrates how every transaction has a base fee &#8211; this base fee is calculated based on the size of the transaction in relation to how many transactions are processed in each block. We can see that the maximum base fee is a 12.5% increase which remains at that maximum until the target block is reached. The base fee increase then resets and the gas used in previous transactions is burned.</p><figure class="image"><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ov9bg6fXQQCgKRj5shsijMu25cEWuXu2sl-JkM5y4LgGvQVyheJ574t4mTd6otZ5fgo5mgiIdc00cm7wA9FJycbGPyofKsXXxl65sOWyNLVQloOb0E_YcIpreqBRQnxXOB3pFqxLxGomrsdjHA" data-srcset=""></a><figcaption>Source. Ethereum.org</figcaption></figure><p>Above we are shown how gas prices could rise to an unfeasible rate by packing as many transactions into each block as possible. This would raise the gas price rate as well as slow down the network. EVM is designed to prevent this from happening, as it would be harmful to the ecosystem as well as consumers.&nbsp;</p><h2>How To Lower Gas Fees Paid in a Transaction?</h2><p>Below is an image of a MetaMask Wallet that is about to perform a transaction sending ETH. We&rsquo;ll use MetaMask as an example because it is a widely adopted custodial wallet of ethereum and related cryptocurrencies.</p><p>MetaMask also has options to adjust the gas prices, at your own risk. While the Gas Limit must remain at least 21,000, MetaMask will not allow you to move to the next part of the transaction if the gas limit is below 21,000. However, you will notice sometimes the gas limit value is much higher than 21,000. You can certainly lower that value but it is not promised that the network would be able to complete your transaction anytime soon, thus your transaction may be rejected. In such cases, you would have to return to your wallet and raise the gas limit.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/N8ybP-wQquDhheub6Mfd-EQHeo0oghRGLmad3jqDalC727j0463TgerKyYPN3xQdgtRIDKU0tNo03x4TowcZYZ5yuw7_wHAgn1IC2EB9g0Hal4hkA38dcOo8xBqC_QMz2QptMGLjApOS2a3uag" data-srcset=""></figure><p>To the left of the gas limit, you see the gas price (GWEI), which is the smallest unit of ETH and is used to pay gas fees. Gwei is short for Gigawei, and 1 ETH is equivalent to 1 billion Gwei. As shown in the image above, 0.03 is the gas price in Gwei, which is a good gas price. Often times when the network is congested you will find that you cannot lower the gas price in Gwei below 1.</p><p>In Metamask if you were to accept these fees and proceed to the next screen there is an advanced option that allows you to add a tip, there are also normally options to send the transaction slower at a cheaper rate, or, of course, faster for a higher rate. Often times MetaMask will default to &lsquo;market&rsquo; which is right in the middle of the two.</p><h2>Overview of How EVM Works&nbsp;</h2><p>Because of EVM&rsquo;s speed and its ability to execute transactions for cryptocurrencies, sign <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>, as well as transactions to transfer and store NFTs (just to name a few of its abilities).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find a great 116-page PDF booklet &#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://github.com/takenobu-hs/ethereum-evm-illustrated"><u>Ethereum EVM Illustrated</u></a><u> </u>on GitHub.&nbsp;The following diagrams are all sourced from the PDF on GitHub (link above) and will help give us a better understanding of the process that one transaction must complete before being confirmed in our wallets. Furthermore, an explanation of why we have to pay gas fees on EVM.</p><p>Starting with a basic model of EVM architecture, you can see three main components, immutable, volatile, and persistent.<br><br>The EVM code is stored virtually and is necessary for any EVM transaction. The Machine state is the computer used for the transaction. This is where some information is kept to build the stack, as well as the gas, some sort of wallet, or crypto stored on the computer. The third component is the &lsquo;world state&rsquo;, which is the container that stores data for a transaction.</p><figure class="image"><a href="https://github.com/takenobu-hs/ethereum-evm-illustrated" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Aad-0aGYXukDAyP7mUTO1B1SwmYn95CL2XKWhBKjHXpm90I2qRBuutzYxWZkurjGhTMHADmecb2e83i-yVd0w370cFCylMq30d9DelJav5CxkzbrVmWUnxmBJqmsCpuNirlogOxzmzGKVHje0A" data-srcset=""></a><figcaption>Source: Ethereum EVM Illustrated / Github.</figcaption></figure><p>The following diagram shows the code (transaction) being executed on EVM. This is a great example to show why every transaction executed on EVM requires gas fees to be paid.</p><figure class="image"><a href="https://github.com/takenobu-hs/ethereum-evm-illustrated" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uXb9KOkiLXoJIayS9K_0n2F8qvktSIH2_h9IAYkRZ7EGr_LWev-RZeZt0hj9mBmOoV_X2w9-tToUyjVVsTEDjhqs0svfM5ptVti869DEUy_ZxW4EMQEPhO2APgm5HgPTMHDLZw7KVY2DkflY6w" data-srcset=""></a><figcaption>Source: Ethereum EVM Illustrated / Github.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the diagram there are two World state containers, in the middle, there was some sort of message, on the right container you can see &lsquo;update&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>The way the information flows, the first version of World state is sent in two separate channels to EVM, one with the code and the other is storage. Then a change is made to the smart contract (or some part of the transaction). That change is sent to EVM along with the original World state. The original world state creates another transaction in order to create the updated world state with the updated data. Each time you see a line on the diagram, there is a person executing the task therefore, there is a gas fee paid.</p><h2>Gas and Fees</h2><p>Below we have a few more diagrams to show gas fees by the numbers, in a custodial, moc-transaction, and now the technical illustration of how gas fees are computed on EVM.</p><p>As you can see below there is a transaction (outside of the world state container) going into the EOA (Externally Owned Account). This would be, for example, your custodial wallet. It is shown that the EOA is sending a message along with the gas fee. Remember there is a gas limit, so each transaction must have a gas limit of 21,000. In the diagram below it appears that the transaction is only to sign a contract. This transaction did not use the limit of 21,000, so the leftover amount is refunded to the EOA. You will never have to pay more gas than required &#8211; unless you choose to tip the validator or speed up your transaction.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><a href="https://github.com/takenobu-hs/ethereum-evm-illustrated/blob/master/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/555NhSslPpIQX2B4IBQ4MOFhnO3rzLnHScBbiXzRtm4PbUATPppqUlRW9FZ1uaL9DZuf-XIRiYzhNpfkVS1clebWcK6h8jjMfIi_pHvm0wAKolUrSttF4uR7PyR3Cr7HFs1oJ0g6phV6HdxcNA" data-srcset=""></a><figcaption>Source: Ethereum EVM Illustrated / Github.</figcaption></figure><p>Below is a basic diagram of how gas is charged throughout various stages of a transaction. You start with the gas available on your computer. The EVM code is embedded in the transaction that you are prompted to execute, there is the first gas fee. The operation or transaction type is put in a stack and saved to internal memory (to save to your computer&rsquo;s memory there is no gas fee).&nbsp;</p><p>However, to move that operation from the stack to the storage on EVM there is a gas fee. There is one more gas fee in this transaction to make the operation a message call, in other words, to set the transaction into action. The diagram below is showing us on a gas-focused scale, the same series of tasks performed in the previous diagram displaying the execution of coding on EVM. The two arrows go from the World state (storage on EVM) to the EVM. One of those arrows (gas fee) are for the transaction data. The other arrow is for the storage on EVM, where the stack with your transaction&rsquo;s data gets put onto a block.</p><figure class="image"><a href="https://github.com/takenobu-hs/ethereum-evm-illustrated/blob/master/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uzenmrmMWupez0GNdp9lP701v2IJaeiU64D0Mue8ImXyCWp7BNHC-fJvXCfew4NoxxQfBN5RAma4uXrNXsx5VHjAbSBw7gxiBbyLJUOCNKZwqpAWIZZNdVpVuK1sAPrMCDQ-kMsiGbKoc9zQMg" data-srcset=""></a><figcaption>Source: Ethereum EVM Illustrated / Github.</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Key Takeaways and Tools</h2><p>Gas fees are a bit more complex than they sound. But that is the beauty of the technology, custodial wallets, smart contracts, and blockchain technology &#8211; we do not need to fully understand the cryptography behind the EVM or its gas fees in order to use it.</p><p>The basic principle is that there is a person verifying, validating, and pushing data along to complete each transaction, and for their work, they are rewarded in ETH. When you simplify the concept, EVM is similar to a bus, a bus needs gas to drive around and pick-up or drop off the people riding in it. The people are like the data. The gas fees are&hellip; the fuel the bus would take to drive from destination to destination.</p><p>Ethereum is a great provider of information as well as tools to navigate gas fees. Below are the links for a few sites that you can visit to check the average gas fee at that specific moment, you are able to see if the network is congested, maybe you should wait to make your transaction if the gas fees are too high. If you need a transaction to happen fast, then you know you may want to tack on some extra gas fees to get your transaction through in a timely manner.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocknative-eth-gas-estim/ablbagjepecncofimgjmdpnhnfjiecfm"><u>Blocknative ETH Gas Estimator</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker"><u>https://etherscan.io/gastracker</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://ethgasstation.info/"><u>ETH Gas Station</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://github.com/takenobu-hs/ethereum-evm-illustrated"><u>https://github.com/takenobu-hs/ethereum-evm-illustrated</u></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://ethereum.org/en/"><u>https://ethereum.org/en/</u></a></li></ul><p>In conclusion, sometimes gas fees can be a pain, sometimes they are very little and well worth the speedy transaction that they paid to make happen. There are many layer one and even layer two blockchains with protocols to be interoperable with EVM and aim to minimize or eliminate gas fees. With everything in crypto, it is best to always do your research when investing your money.</p>

Until then, let&#8217;s take a brief look at the promises of Ethereum 2.0.</p><h3>What is Ethereum 2.0?</h3><p>Ethereum Serenity, or Ethereum 2.0, is not an alternate cryptocurrency. It is best to think of Ethereum 2.0 as an upgrade to the Ethereum network. This upgrade attempts to tackle many key issues of the blockchain, like scalability, usability, and sustainability. Although Ethereum has reached unprecedented levels of market valuation this year, popular projects like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zilliqa/">Zilliqa</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/algo-algorand/">Algorand,</a> and others could potentially threaten Ethereum&#8217;s position as the second biggest crypto coin if it doesn&#8217;t solve many of its problems.</p><p>Not surprisingly, newer protocols boast of higher transactions per second, better scaling solutions and network fees that won&#8217;t break the bank. Newer technology often has an advantage over older technology since years of development take place in bolstering blockchains, so upgrades are needed for older tech to keep up. Ethereum is no exception to this.</p><h3>Usability</h3><p>Ethereum, in its current non-upgraded state, has been hit with enormous transaction fees, called gas fees. Gas fees are paid in order to provide the energy needed to validate and work out transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. These high fees happen when the network is busy processing tons of transactions. Even making a simple transaction on decentralized applications can be upwards of USD 200 on busy days. To whales who have millions of dollars of ETH to play with on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> applications, this may seem like child&#8217;s play. However, to the average person who works a 9-5 job, forking over USD 200 to transfer a cute digital monster NFT in a video game isn&#8217;t palatable.</p><p>This has made it increasingly difficult for average users to partake in Ethereum applications like trading crypto on Uniswap or buying a digital cat on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cryptokitties/"><strong>CryptoKitties</strong></a>. The usability of the blockchain would take a hit since the barrier to entry would be too high for the average person to use.</p><h3>Scalability</h3><p>Let&#8217;s imagine that these gas fees are actually low enough for the average crypto user not to bat an eye when making transactions, like a USD 0.25 per transaction instead of 80 times that amount with USD 200. Even with this, Ethereum can only process 15 transactions per second (tps) as of right now. By comparison, Visa does around 1,700 tps, more than a hundred times of Ethereum&#8217;s non-upgraded version.</p><p>Although Ethereum&#8217;s transaction speed is three times greater than <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s 5tps, if decentralized applications are going to be commonplace, then they should at least be close to the speed of traditional financial tools like Visa. It&#8217;s hard to imagine Ethereum to be as scalable as traditional financial institutions when the transaction speed remains small.</p><p>Granted, using blockchain technology feels so much faster than going through all those Know-Your-Customer questions and other banking hoops. In crypto, you just input your wallet address, and you&#8217;ll receive. Even Bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, feels quick to wire without the hoops. Still, once the scalability solutions come about, there will be even more reason to turn to the decentralized world for financial needs.</p><h3>Sustainability</h3><p>Proof-of-Work consensus mechanisms have been under attack by media outlets as unsustainable because of environmental impact, even though cryptocurrencies have been proven to not have the large-scale environmental impact the outlets claim. Even so, whatever helps in creating a more sustainable, decentralized ecosystem will be welcome by many. Proof-of-Stake offers this solution by running validator nodes instead of mining. Since immense electrical input is needed to mine blocks in Proof-of-Work, running validator nodes to validate blocks will save tons of energy, making sustainability a reality.</p><p>Serenity, or Ethereum 2.0, if successful, will have the usability, scalability and sustainability to operate for users all over the world. This will make DeFi applications like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/aave-new/">Aave</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/comp-compoundd/">Compound</a> easier to run. If decentralized financial tools need USD 100 to make a single transaction, not many will believe in decentralized protocols as an alternative to mainstream finance. Also, if it takes that amount to sell a piece of digital property or artwork, one would wonder about the widespread use of it all.</p><p>Hopefully, Ethereum 2.0 will put to end all of those concerns and allow its extensive worldwide user base to continue operating smoothly.</p><h3>Ethereum 2.0 Solutions</h3><p>Ethereum 2.0 is said to have next-generation blockchain solutions to these problems. The scalability will be solved by using an alternative consensus mechanism or a way in which computers in a network can be in agreement. If computers all over the world are going to be using Ethereum, then they need a way to function together. The current consensus mechanism for Ethereum is Proof-of-Work, which uses mining in order to validate blocks or data sets. These often come with some problems that Proof-of-Stake tries to solve.</p><h3>How Does Proof-of-Stake Work?</h3><p>Instead of mining, which requires vast electrical input, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm">Proof-of-Stake</a> uses what are called validator nodes in order to secure the network. Validator nodes are the alternatives to mining, in which users set up a node for a single ETH. These nodes, or computers processing the network, will be picked at random to create blocks. Blocks are the cryptographic files in which data is recorded, a digital ledger in cryptography.</p><p>In traditional mining, you need to have incredible resources to effectively mine blocks for Ethereum and other legacy cryptocurrencies. In this way, it heavily favors those with resources. By staking ETH and running validator nodes, all you need is a decent computer with a good CPU or GPU, not a mining rig that costs thousands of dollars. The validator nodes, in turn, have the same chance of a person with a regular rig mining a block and a company with vast resources and multiple nodes. It won&#8217;t be like in mining, where more computational power will result in a far higher chance of blocks being mined. Every validator node will have the same chance of receiving the same block rewards. Although a company can have a hundred validator nodes, each of those nodes has the same chance of rewards as a regular person&#8217;s one computer node. This is because the rewards are randomized. The company will have a higher chance of rewards only because they have a hundred of them, not because their rig is more powerful.</p><p>The threat of a 51% attack or an attack that controls the network seems more possible. However, there isn&#8217;t much incentive to do this as it would devalue the network. Imagine that you use a few hundred billion dollars to gain the majority stake and control all of Ethereum. You would probably lose hundreds and hundreds of millions, maybe even a billion if you controlled the network and made the millions of users around the world trust it less.</p><p>Firsthand, it does seem that Proof-of-Stake is an overall improvement to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-work.htm">Proof-of-Work</a>. This isn&#8217;t a certainty, however, since the protocol is still in its infancy, which is the main knock against Proof-of-Stake. Time will tell if it will truly usurp Proof-of-Work forever.</p><h3>The Beacon Chain</h3><p>The Beacon Chain is how the future Ethereum network will be coordinated and will be the one that introduces Proof-of-Stake into the network. It will set up the shard chains that improve the speed of transactions and make the network larger. The Beacon Chain is the base of a more secure, sustainable, and scalable Ethereum. It will manage old Ethereum, the mainnet, into the Proof-of-Stake system.</p><p>The Beacon Chain is Phase 0, so truly the building block of Ethereum 2.0.</p><h3>The Merge</h3><p>This is where the main Ethereum network will fuse with Proof-of-Stake using the Beacon chain to create a possibly better Ethereum. Right now, Proof-of-Work still secures the Ethereum network, running in parallel with Proof-of-Stake. The Merge, which sounds like the beginning of an epic movie, is when these will be fully intertwined. Mining will cease as a way to secure the network. And according to Ethereum, this will lead to endless shard chains and&tilde;endless scalability for Ethereum.</p><h3>Shard Chains</h3><p>Across 64 chains, the shard chains will expand the network&#8217;s load and make for an&tilde;endless scalability post-merge, keeping node requirements low. Sharding, in computer science parlance, is a way to split a database horizontally. In Ethereum, this will make the load more manageable for a network, increasing the number of transactions per second and reducing network congestion in these fresh chains or shards. The projected transactions per second (tps) will be 100,000 tps compared to the 10-15 transactions per second of Ethereum now. This is known as Shard Chain Version 1: data availability. Shard Chain Version 2: code execution will give a lot more features to shards, like smart contract execution and account management.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p>Ethereum is the largest platform for the creation of decentralized applications. After its implementation, DeFi applications like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-use-aave.htm">Aave</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-use-compound.htm">Compound</a> will be easier to run. If decentralized financial tools need USD 100 to make a single transaction, not many will believe in decentralized protocols as an alternative to mainstream finance. Also, if it takes that amount to sell a piece of digital property or artwork, one would wonder about the widespread use of it all. Ethereum serenity will attempt to cure these problems.</p><p>With all the funding and intelligence being put into its continued development, as well as its army of fans and developers, Ethereum will most likely stay relevant in blockchain for years, if not decades, to come. Ethereum Serenity, or Ethereum 2.0, will be the test to see if Ethereum will continue its use-dominance over other protocols. Only time will tell if an Ethereum-killer will finally slay the mystical beast or if Ethereum continues to be the main network of decentralized applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

With <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a> becoming a household name and thousands of applications being run on the Ethereum network, it&rsquo;s no wonder the token has become so hot recently.</p><p>With all of this happening, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/will-ethereum-reach-serenity-this-year-5508.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum Serenity</a>, or <b>Ethereum 2.0</b>, is one of the most hyped upgrades in the industry. And with that, the question that brews in the minds of bullish Ethereum fans is: How do I stake my ETH for the upgraded version of the most used protocols around?</p><p>Let&#8217;s explore.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="what-is-ethereum-2.0?">What is Ethereum 2.0?</h3><p>Serenity, or Ethereum 2.0, if successful, will have the usability, scalability, and sustainability to operate for users all over the world. In its current state, Ethereum has high transaction fees, sometimes even costing USD 200 to go through. And even if it&rsquo;s usable, one would find it difficult to scale and create a whole new world of next-generation decentralized applications if the transactions per second remain at 10-15 when traditional financial tools like Visa operate on 17,000. Also, mining uses immense electrical energy. Although media often exaggerates this, it is still great that this issue will be handled by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proof-of-Stake</a>, which is an alternative to the mining mechanism <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-work.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proof-of-Work</a>.</p><p>Once Proof-of-Stake comes out, Ethereum will operate on an alternate consensus mechanism. It currently runs on Proof-of-Work, which uses mining in order to validate blocks. Proof-of-Stake runs on validator nodes and should be more usable, scalable, and sustainable.</p><p>This will make <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a> applications like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/aave-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aave</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/comp-compoundd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound</a> easier to run. If decentralized financial tools need USD 100 to make a single transaction, not many will believe in decentralized protocols as an alternative to mainstream finance. Also, if it takes that amount to sell a piece of digital property or artwork, one would wonder about the widespread use of it all.</p><p>Ethereum 2.0 aims to put to an end all of those concerns and allow its extensive worldwide user base to grow and make use of the protocol smoothly.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="ethereum 2.0" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60f/ecf25d96bb.jpeg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60f/ecf25d96bb.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60f/ecf25d96bb.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60f/ecf25d96bb.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60f/ecf25d96bb.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60f/ecf25d96bb.jpeg 1200w"><figcaption>Source: Adobe Stock (edited).</figcaption></figure><h3 data-param="2" id="why-stake-ethereum-for-ethereum-2.0?">Why Stake Ethereum for Ethereum 2.0?</h3><p>The main reason why many would probably want to stake Ether is to acquire the <b>APR</b> or <b>Annual Percentage Revenue</b>, which can range from <b>6% &#8211; 15%</b>. The minimum requirement is <b>32 ETH</b>, so you can net anywhere from 2 &#8211; 5 ETH with these rates. (disclaimer: this isn&rsquo;t financial advice).</p><p>What&rsquo;s the catch? You have to lock up your ETH for years. To some who don&rsquo;t have 32 ETH to just lock up on the fly or like to use ETH for other decentralized applications, they would be hesitant to choose this option. You have to do this until the Ethereum 2.0 protocol rolls around, which may not take place until years from now. For those who have limited ETH or use them regularly, staking Ethereum for Ethereum 2.0 won&rsquo;t be a viable option.</p><p>Alternatively, you can put them on an exchange to stake and earn rewards, but you aren&rsquo;t necessarily running a validator node and staking for Ethereum 2.0. </p><p>The other reason why someone would want to stake ether is to help out the network. In order for the network to secure legitimacy, it needs to be validated by nodes, which are the individual computers that have staked ETH that are running. If you want to validate the network, help it out and get a decent reward while doing so, that could be your reason for staking.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="possible-risks-of-staking-eth">Possible Risks of Staking ETH</h3><p>Always make sure to have all of your bases covered and consult a financial advisor if you&rsquo;re planning to be serious with staking Ethereum. The rewards are promising, but there are risks involved.</p><p><b>1. What will be Ethereum 2.0&rsquo;s value?</b></p><p>While this may not be a problem in the long run if Ethereum 2.0&rsquo;s value is incredibly high, you should still take note that the value of Eth 2.0 is unknown as of this point and will likely be different than Ether. If you&rsquo;re confident that Ethereum 2.0 will be a successful project, then you should be confident that running a validator node will be beneficial.</p><p><b>2. Liquidation</b></p><p>Another possible risk is a lack of liquidation. You will not be able to withdraw your earned ETH and your staked ETH until Ethereum 2.0 is launched, which might not happen for 2 years or possibly longer. If you are not a long-term holder and are planning to sell Ethereum in this bull run or the next, then this might not sit well with you. </p><p>If you believe that cryptocurrencies will be the future and are planning to hold onto it long term, running a validator node might be your choice. If you plan to hold ethereum for 5+ years, you have good incentives to do so with the rewards involved.</p><p>Although there are ways to stake Ether on exchanges, which would make them more liquid, doing so does not directly support the network or decentralization in general.</p><p><b>3. Bugs</b></p><p>And although Ethereum is one of the most reliable blockchain networks around and powers thousands and thousands of applications that are being used daily, you should still be aware that if there are any bugs. You may lose some or, in the unlikely worst scenario, all of your Ethereum in the case of an extreme bug. Although there have been very few instances of this happening, be aware that they are a possibility.</p><p>That being said, there are tons of investors already running validator nodes, so it isn&rsquo;t as if you&rsquo;re left on an island. You&rsquo;ll be part of a whole Ethereum community that has already supported and staked on the blockchain for years.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="hardware-requirements-for-staking-ethereum-2.0">Hardware Requirements for Staking Ethereum 2.0</h3><p>Although not as intensive as mining, you still need a decent rig in order to set up a validator node. This is to ensure that the applications you are using to stake are running at optimal capacity. If you are planning to stake, then having the best possible setup will give you the necessary tools.</p><p>Prysm has these requirements for staking Ethereum:</p><p><i>Minimum specifications<br>
<b>Operating System:</b> 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X 10.14+, Windows 64-bit<br>
<b>Processor:</b> Intel Core i5&ndash;760 or AMD FX-8100 or better<br>
<b>Memory:</b> 4GB RAM<br>
<b>Storage:</b> 20GB available space SSD</i></p><p><i>Recommended specifications<br>
<b>Processor:</b> Intel Core i7&ndash;4770 or AMD FX-8310 or better<br>
<b>Memory:</b> 8GB RAM<br>
<b>Storage:</b> 100GB available space SSD</i></p><p>All of these specifications can be found on modern PCs, so they shouldn&rsquo;t be too unrealistic for many crypto holders who are already planning to stake, given the barrier to entry already in place.</p><p>Keep in mind, just because these are the recommended specifications doesn&rsquo;t mean that you won&rsquo;t benefit from a stronger system. The stronger your system, the more failsafe it will be.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="costs-of-staking-eth">Costs of Staking ETH</h3><p>The current price of ETH at the time of writing hovers around USD 2,500, meaning that USD 80,000 is already necessary to even have the possibility of the option.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t factor in other costs like hardware and electricity to keep the node up and running. With all of these factored in, you will be spending a pretty penny to set one up.</p><p>If you are only planning to stake for ETH, then you can do this on several exchanges without factoring in hardware costs. Alternatively, there are <a href="https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple staking pools</a> that you can choose from that may not require you to stake the full amount of ETH.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="best-places-to-stake-for-ethereum-2.0">Best places to Stake for Ethereum 2.0</h3><p>Although you can stake ETH on exchanges like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>, it is probably better to use decentralized protocols to staking Ethereum. Not only does this keep up with the spirit of decentralization, but you are solely responsible for that validator node, rather than any of your stake being dictated by exchange or centralized application. </p><p>Setting up your own node through Prysm or the ones Ethereum suggests seems to be the way to go.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough ETH, you can always stake in a pool. Although you are not running your own validator node, you are at least using your Ethereum to stake for rewards and allowing others to pool it and run validator nodes. In the coming months, more and more DeFi projects will come about that allow you to stake ether for Ethereum 2.0 in pools. A notable one is <a href="https://www.rocketpool.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RocketPool</a>, a decentralized way to stake, which is based on much of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin</a>&rsquo;s own ideas about staking Ethereum 2.0. However, RocketPool and many of these other applications coming out are not available at the moment. RocketPool will also provide a way for you to stake your ETH 2.0.</p><figure class="center"><a href="https://www.rocketpool.net/" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="rocketpool" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60f/ecaa29be3f.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60f/ecaa29be3f.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60f/ecaa29be3f.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60f/ecaa29be3f.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60f/ecaa29be3f.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60f/ecaa29be3f.png 2106w"></a><figcaption>Source: Rocketpool.net</figcaption></figure><p>So if you want to wait for these staking options to open up, then that might be better if you want to hold for a long time. This does mean that you will have to wait on the possible rewards since getting started early will earn you more rewards.</p><p>If you can&rsquo;t wait to start earning on your extra ETH, then perhaps choosing the centralized versions out now would be better for you since you&rsquo;ll immediately be starting to earn rewards. If you have the resources, both options are available.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="binance-beth?">Binance BETH?</h3><p>Although the steps to stake on here are <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/eecd04618b5042c79f2a5b07f895c498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredibly simple</a>, this way you will stake BETH. BETH is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> token version of Ethereum which has near a 1:1 value to ETH. Although it is easy to do this on exchanges like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> since they cover several of the costs you would have to make like hardware and electricity, keep in mind that this isn&rsquo;t decentralized. You would also be earning BETH, which you can convert into ETH on the exchange.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t care so much about the values of decentralization and want something convenient, then you could use this method. Exchanges like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kraken</a> all have a way of staking ETH.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="ethereum-2.0-validator-node-staking-process">Ethereum 2.0 Validator Node Staking Process</h3><p>The official one requires you to have your own 32 ETH. It is recommended to use a hardware wallet to stake ETH as those are less susceptible to attacks than entirely hot wallets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-guide-how-to-set-up-metamask-wallet.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metamask</a>.</p><p>1.

Everyone&rsquo;s question suddenly became, &ldquo;How can I get in on this?&rdquo; As it turns out, buying ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, does not have to be a chore. It&rsquo;s as simple as deciding how much you want to buy, what exchange you prefer, and then signing up and following the requisite steps to do so. Don&rsquo;t forget to transfer the ETH to your own wallet later and keep your private keys and seed words extremely secure!</p><p>Ethereum was proposed in 2013, crowdfunded in 2014, whereas the network itself went live in 2015. Vitalik Buterin, its founder, realized that technologies like Bitcoin could benefit from other applications besides money. His idea was to create something with the same principles of decentralization, immutability, and transparency, but with a scripting language that would enable it to run other applications, making the possibilities practically limitless.</p><p>The network&#8217;s capabilities were quickly recognized, and today&mdash;six years after it first launched&mdash;the Ethereum network hosts over 3.5k decentralized apps or dapps. This popularity was one reason why the ether cryptocurrency price soared far beyond what it had reached before this. Now, it is still garnering a lot of interest from retail and institutional investors alike.</p><h2 id="how-to-buy-ethereum-in-2021">How to Buy Ethereum in 2021</h2><p>Buying Ethereum has never been easier, thanks to the number of different exchanges available. You&rsquo;re almost guaranteed to find the perfect platform for your ether purchasing needs&mdash;all you have to do is read on. The specifics of buying an asset on a cryptocurrency exchange are almost the same everywhere: you will need to sign up, potentially go through a KYC verification process that can take some time to resolve, and then choose the perfect trading pair. Some exchanges don&rsquo;t deal with fiat, so you may have to look elsewhere if you want to buy with USD or EUR. Here are the best five exchanges for buying ETH:</p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/609/ee02566ee4.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/609/ee02566ee4.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/609/ee02566ee4.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/609/ee02566ee4.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/609/ee02566ee4.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/609/ee02566ee4.jpg 1200w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance</a>. This is the biggest exchange by 24-hour trading volume, which is not surprising, considering their excellent trading pair offer. First off, you don&rsquo;t even need to go through KYC to trade, which is not common in the crypto world. They also have great global coverage, so the chances of your country being excluded are pretty slim. When it comes to trading ETH, you can buy it with fiat options (that include credit card purchases), as well as within more than 90 cryptocurrency trading pairs. </p>

Another big crypto asset platform, Crypto.com, includes several different services. However, for buying ETH, you will need their exchange, which is also available in their mobile app, with great perks that are often not found elsewhere. Crypto.com is one of the best choices for mobile users who prefer to trade on the go. Here, too, you can trade ETH against both fiat and crypto with meager fees. A significant perk is that you can also order the Crypto.com VISA card, which lets you spend your crypto anywhere&mdash;remember you will have to go through extra KYC checks to do this. </p>

This is one of the most beginner-friendly exchanges you can find, although the fees are not the lowest compared to the industry standard. However, with their unsurpassed simplicity, this can be a worthy tradeoff. With multiple ways to buy crypto (using credit/debit cards, wire transfers, local payment providers, etc.), you&rsquo;re almost guaranteed to find one that works for you. When buying ETH, aside from the aforementioned fiat options, you can also choose from many crypto trading pairs. In case you&rsquo;re stuck at any point, the platform provides easy-to-understand and straightforward explanations of each step of the way for every specific crypto you&rsquo;re interested in. </p>

If you&rsquo;re looking for an exchange with a huge spread of altcoins and privacy at its forefront, HitBTC is the place for you. As it does not force its users to go through the KYC process, it is perfect for those who value their privacy&mdash;still, there is an option to do so regardless, which can probably turn out to be safer in the long run. It is, however, not quite for beginners, as it takes some preexisting know-how to navigate the exchange, withdraw your funds, and follow safety procedures. You can trade ETH against several cryptocurrencies, but fiat itself isn&rsquo;t supported, except through a Changelly integration. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/hitbtc/">To learn more about HitBTC, read our full review here.</a></p>

This US-based exchange is one of the most secure exchanges that take safety measures and self-regulation very seriously. Fees are among the lowest in the industry, and their coverage is almost completely global (with very few exceptions). Due to security, all users have to go through the KYC process, which can take anywhere between a few minutes and a few days, depending on the level you want to obtain. The platform also offers margin and forex trading for more experienced investors, while high volume traders may benefit from their OTC service. When trading ETH, you will be able to choose from more than 40 crypto trading pairs, as well as a wide range of fiat options. </p>

However, what this list provides is a starting point for everyone who is not sure how or where to take that first step; once you know your priorities when it comes to crypto trading, narrowing it down to one or two exchanges that work for you will be a breeze. Still, you should always remember not to invest more than you&rsquo;re willing to lose; the cryptocurrency market is still highly volatile, and you should take every reasonable precaution to protect yourself.</p><p>Good luck trading ether!

Yet, can you make use of its qualities to buy Ethereum (ETH) without hassle?</p><p>The answer is yes. Since late 2020, you can <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/paypal-begin-to-allow-cryptocurrency-usage-8434.htm">buy cryptocurrencies using a PayPal</a> wallet. All you need to do is have a funded PayPal account, choose the cryptocurrency you want to buy, and confirm your purchase.</p><p>However, buying ether on PayPal has its own caveats. First and foremost, PayPal does not allow you to withdraw your crypto assets into a private self-hosted wallet, meaning that you won&#8217;t be able to use it for anything else but sell it back to PayPal once its price goes up or down.&nbsp;</p><p>The essence of cryptocurrency is the ability to own private digital cash without having to rely on any intermediaries and send or receive them in a censorship-resistant way. At least for now, getting cryptocurrency via PayPal is a safe way to get exposure to the asset class, but it does not let you use it in ways it was made to be used &#8211; as a free and open peer-to-peer (P2P) financial system without trusted intermediaries.</p><p>Luckily for you, there actually are three other methods of how you can buy Ethereum with PayPal instantly via other platforms that give you full ownership of your coins. However, the procedure might not be as simple as the title may lead you to conclude.</p><p>First, you can forget the idea to use PayPal to buy Ethereum directly on regular crypto exchanges. Yes, this may change in the future, but, at the moment, your safest bet is to fire up your PayPal to get non-limited Ethereum via other trading platforms.</p><h2>1. Buy Ether with PayPal via eToro</h2><p>The first of the 3 methods to Buy ETH with PayPal instantly is to use <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro">eToro brokerage platform</a>. Although for a long time, eToro was just CFD&#8217;s broker, since 2019, it has become one of the most rapidly growing crypto trading services. It allows users to purchase 14 different cryptocurrencies and their CFDs, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/">Bitcoin Cash</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/litecoin/">Litecoin</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple">Ripple</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dash">Dash</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum-classic/">Ethereum Classic</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/iota/">IOTA</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/stellar">Stellar</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano">Cardano</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/eos">EOS</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/neo">NEO</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zcash">Zcash</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">Binance Coin</a></li></ul><p>You buy the actual asset whenever you long it. You can also withdraw your coins to a dedicated eToro wallet, but it doesn&#8217;t support every coin on the platform yet. It does support Ethereum, though, making <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro">eToro</a> one of the most beginner-friendly ways to buy ether with Paypal.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><i>Paypal payment is not available for US users.&nbsp; eToro USA LLC does not offer CFDs, only real Cryptocurrencies are available for US users.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries. No consumer protection.

Buy Ethereum with PayPal via LocalBitcoins</h2><p>The second method is to visit the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/localbitcoins/">LocalBitcoins</a> site, which operates as an informal peer-to-peer exchange for BTC enthusiasts. Depending on who you get in touch with, that person may be willing to accept PayPal payment from you in exchange for their Bitcoins, which you can promptly convert into Ether. For that, you&#8217;ll also need to register on an altcoin exchange like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance">Binance</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bittrex">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/hitbtc">HitBTC</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/poloniex">Poloniex</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kucoin">KuCoin</a> or similar.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews">reviews</a> and guide on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-altcoins.htm">how to get altcoins</a> to see which exchange suits you best.</p><h2>3.

Look for reputable traders with an established history as the only thing standing between you and a successful scam is your wits.</p><p>As you can see, there are multiple ways to get ETH with PayPal.

Ethereum (ETH) is predicted to become the most important global cryptocurrency after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. In the meantime, Ether is already gaining traction among various businesses, which is why we give you five reasons to accept Ethereum or at least consider it if you do not want to risk being left behind. </p><h3 data-param="2" id="1.-save-on-transaction-fees-">1. Save on Transaction Fees </h3><p>Money makes the world go round, and that is the most important reason why your business should accept ETH. Yes, Ethereum actually allows you to keep more money in your pocket, as it dramatically reduces the transaction costs you have in dealing with your customers. Be it a payment system such as PayPal or a regular bank; ETH will offer you more competitive transaction costs than conventional methods which actually profit from being middlemen in this case.  </p><h3 data-param="2" id="2.-faster-transactions">2. Faster Transactions</h3><p>The second reason on the list also indirectly relates to money. If time is money, then Ethereum will allow you to save both, since the transactions with ETH are processed within minutes. There is no reason to wait for the money to get to your bank account at a snail&rsquo;s pace.   </p><h3 data-param="2" id="3.-globalize-your-outreach">3. Globalize Your Outreach</h3><p>Businesses have never been globalized to a greater degree than they are today. Failing to catch up with this trend can benefit your competitors and damage your company. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum allow you to procure goods for your business from other countries without having to worry about currency exchange rates. Similarly, your customers from abroad will feel closer to your business if they do not have to take into account various conversion fees that come with using a diverse range of currencies. </p><h3 data-param="2" id="4.-additional-payment-option-is-always-good">4. Additional Payment Option is Always Good</h3><p>Speaking of customers, you cannot have too many of them, can you? Adding a payment option which involves Ethereum will expand your business&rsquo; reach and allow you to tap into the crypto enthusiast community and beyond. An additional payment option can hardly hurt your business as it will benefit your business efforts by offering more flexibility to your customers. </p><h3 data-param="2" id="5.-say-goodbye-to-frauds">5. Say Goodbye to Frauds</h3><p>With Ethereum, frauds and scams will quickly become a thing of the past, as paying with it does not require you to enter any personal or account data. With ETH, this process will become much more natural, and the customers will feel safer once they have an opportunity to buy from you without unnecessary risks and while enjoying the benefits of anonymity. Additionally, your online business won&#8217;t ever suffer from chargeback frauds again, too, since it is impossible to reverse Ethereum transactions.</p><p>Besides, Ethereum projects like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/monetha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monetha</a> (MTH) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/utrust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UTRUST</a> (UTK) are working on reputation management systems that will record every fraud on an immutable ledger. </p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="CoinGate payment gateway" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c9/8d7d969289.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c9/8d7d969289.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c9/8d7d969289.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c9/8d7d969289.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c9/8d7d969289.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c9/8d7d969289.png 2480w"><figcaption>ETH payment gateway by CoinGate</figcaption></figure><h3 data-param="2" id="most-popular-ethereum-payment-gateways">Most popular Ethereum payment gateways</h3><p>Making Ethereum as one of your payment options can be as simple as getting an ETH wallet address and making it visible on your site. However, that may not entirely satisfy your business needs. You will be glad to learn that there are services that help you to accept ETH payments and pay out fiat directly into your bank account. </p><p>Here are some of the most popular Ethereum payment gateways that can help your business to accept Ethereum payments.</p><ul><li>CoinPayments</li><li>Coinbase Commerce</li><li>ethPay</li><li>Pay With Ether</li><li>Coingate</li><li>The Big Coin</li><li>Savvy.io</li></ul><p>Some of the services also enable you to accept other altcoin payments, which may be beneficial for your business, too.</p><p><i>Also see: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/who-accepts-ethereum.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Who Accepts Ethereum</a></i></p>
