										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><img class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334962/10-best-cold-wallets.jpg" alt="10 best cold wallets" width="854"></h2><p>Cold wallets, also known as hardware wallets, are one of the safest storage solutions for your cryptocurrencies. That&rsquo;s because they store your wallet&rsquo;s seed phrase offline while being encrypted. In other words, if a hacker compromises your computer, they won&rsquo;t be able to see the seed phrase and steal your funds.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, hardware wallets require that you authorize each transaction by pressing physical buttons. So unless someone holds your hardware wallet and knows your PIN number to unlock it, they can never transfer funds out of your cold wallet. Given that over <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/01/tech/crypto-hacks-2022/index.html"><u>$3.8 billion worth of crypto was stolen in hacks in 2022</u></a>, having a cold wallet could have saved you from being in such a statistic.</p><p>To find the best cold wallets this year, we compared multiple options in terms of features and ease of use. Read more to find our top picks.</p><h2><strong>The Top 10 Cold Wallets Ranked&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In 2023, cold wallets remain the gold standard for cryptocurrency security, with top contenders like Ledger Nano S Plus and Trezor Safe 3 leading the market.</p><ol>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><strong><u>Ledger Nano S Plus</u></strong></a> &mdash; The best crypto cold wallet that comes with over 5,500 coins and tokens supported, and a companion app that lets you buy coins with a card, transfer coins or stake them to earn passive income while enjoying the Ledger safety.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><strong><u>Trezor Safe 3</u></strong></a> &mdash; This is a popular cold storage wallet that aside from protecting your coins, you can obscure your crypto transactions or use Shamir Backup to restore your account.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><strong><u>Ledger Stax</u></strong></a> &mdash; A premium cold wallet designed for NFT enthusiasts. It boasts Bluetooth connectivity and wireless charging, as well as a large E Ink touchscreen.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><strong><u>Trezor Model T</u></strong></a> &mdash; Trezor&rsquo;s premium model comes with an additional safety feature via a micro SD card slot that further protects access to your funds with an encrypted PIN. It also comes with LED touchscreen buttons.</li>
<li><strong>ELLIPAL Titan Cold Wallet</strong> &mdash; Leading crypto cold wallet designed with 100% protection via full metal cover, air-gapped and with self-destruct technology in case of device tampering.</li>
<li><strong>KeepKey</strong> &mdash; An affordable cold wallet with Thorchain exchange integration for seamless swapping of coins.</li>
<li><strong>Blockstream Jade</strong> &mdash; A Bitcoin-only wallet that comes with one of the lowest prices for a cold wallet. It supports multisig technology for approving transactions, a camera for scanning QR codes and more.</li>

<li><strong>CoolWallet Pro</strong> &mdash; is a credit card-sized crypto wallet with a strong battery that lasts up to two weeks. It connects to your smartphone via encrypted Bluetooth where you can stake your coins or make transactions.</li>
</ol><h2><strong>The Best Cold Crypto Wallets Reviewed</strong></h2><p>Let&#8217;s explore the most popular cold storage wallets that crypto investors are using right now to secure their altcoin holdings.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1. Ledger Nano S Plus &mdash; Overall Best Cold Crypto Wallet, Supported By Live App</strong></h3><p>This is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger&rsquo;s</u></a> entry-level wallet. But don&rsquo;t let this fool you. Ledger Nano S Plus offers the same functionality as the more expensive Ledger Nano X. The main difference between the two is that the Ledger Nano X has Bluetooth and it feels like it&rsquo;s made with higher-quality materials.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Ledger Nano S Plus" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334939/ledger-nano-s-plus.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p><br>The app that all Ledger devices use is called Ledger Live. This is both a mobile app and a desktop app. You can use it to buy coins with a credit card, swap them using decentralized exchanges like 1Inch and others, or stake your coins.</p><p>Ledger Nano S Plus supports over 5,500 coins, which is the same as the more expensive Nano X version, and you can also hold NFTs in your wallet.</p><p>Since it doesn&rsquo;t support Bluetooth connectivity, you can connect your Ledger cold wallet via a USB-C cable with your smartphone or computer. This shouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal if you mostly use your Ledger wallet for storing coins. If you plan to actively transfer coins or trade, the Ledger Nano X could be the better option due to its Bluetooth support.</p><p>Ledger&rsquo;s support is top-notch. If something happens to your device, say it breaks or malfunctions, Ledger will send you a replacement free of charge. All this makes Ledger Nano S Plus the best cold wallet in 2023.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Ledger Live mobile and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports staking, swapping and buying with a card</li>
<li>Over 5,500 coins and tokens supported</li>
<li>Multiple accessories to customize your Ledger</li>
</ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul>
<li>No Bluetooth</li>
<li>No wallet seed phrase backup recovery yet</li>

Trezor Safe 3 &mdash; Obscure Transactions &amp; Restore Your Seed Phrase if Lost</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><u>Trezor Safe 3</u></a> is the best offering from Trezor because it offers the same functionality as the most expensive cold wallet but at an affordable price. Trezor Safe 3 comes with a monochromatic OLED screen where you can see the transaction information, and USB-C connectivity since it doesn&rsquo;t have Bluetooth.</p><p>This shouldn&rsquo;t be a dealbreaker, though, as cold wallets are designed for long-term storage and not active trading.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Trezor Safe 3" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334943/trezor-safe-3.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Some of the safety features of this Trezor cold wallet include the Secure Element (EAL6+) and the passphrase to unlock your device, which makes it hard for hackers to steal your assets. Another feature of Trezor cold wallets is the Shamir Backup, which splits your seed phrase into up to 16 pieces to help you recover your seed phrase if you lose it, meaning if you lose one piece or it gets stolen, you can still recover your assets.</p><p>As a companion to this Trezor cold wallet is the Trezor Suite app available on mobile, desktop and browser. Via the app, you can send, receive and trade over 8,000 cryptocurrencies</p><p>Unlike most cold wallets, Trezor has open-source software, which can be examined by anyone to ensure it&#8217;s safe. Another interesting feature is that you can go incognito with Coinjoin, which lumps multiple transactions into one, thus obscuring your transactions, and you can protect your identity with Tor.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>

<li>Supports sending, receiving and trading via the app</li>

Ledger Stax &mdash; Store Over 5,000 Cryptocurrencies, Wireless Charging &amp; Bluetooth Connectivity</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger Stax</u></a> is one of the most innovative cold wallets you can find. It looks like a small ebook reader because of its curved E Ink touchscreen. Because of that, it is mostly designed for storing your NFT collections because you can put your favorite NFT on the screen like an ebook cover.</p><p>Aside from its interesting design, it supports wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and it&rsquo;s highly customizable. This means you can connect your Stax with your Ledger Live mobile app and sign transactions without using cables.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Ledger Stax" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334944/ledger-stax.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>As the name suggests, you can &ldquo;stack&rdquo; multiple Stax wallets one on top of the other, if you have multiple wallets. For example, one Stax could hold your Ethereum NFTs, a second one could store your Solana NFTs, and a third could store your coins.</p><p>Of course, one Stax is enough to hold all of the above. But if you want to have multiple Stax&rsquo;s, say one for yourself, another for a family member, all with different screen images, you can easily do so.</p><p>Similar to the other two Ledgers, Stax uses the Ledger Live mobile and desktop app to swap coins, stake coins or buy them with a card. Also, the Ledger Live app is used to update your cold wallet&rsquo;s firmware.</p><p>With all these features and functionality, Stax comes with an eye-watering price of around $279, which is on the higher end compared to other cold wallets. Despite that, if you are an NFT enthusiast and you can afford it, Stax is one of the best cold wallets you can get.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>

</figure><h2><strong>What is a Cryptocurrency Cold Wallet?</strong></h2><p>A crypto cold storage wallet, also known as a hardware wallet, is a device with specifically designed hardware to encrypt and store your wallet&rsquo;s seed phrase offline and in a safe environment. Hot wallets, on the other hand, store your seed phrase online. If a hacker has access to your computer, they can see your seed phrase and use it to steal your funds.</p><p>Cold wallets typically have physical buttons, or touchscreen buttons depending on the device, which are used for signing transactions on the blockchain. This makes it hard for scammers and hackers to steal your funds unless they physically hold the device. What&rsquo;s more, each cold wallet is locked with a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA. The fraudsters will also need to know that to unlock your wallet.</p><p><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Ledged crypto app" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334952/ledger.jpg" data-srcset=""><br>Using a companion app, these wallets can store crypto assets including cryptocurrencies and NFTs. You can also trade, swap, stake and more with these apps, giving cold wallets the same functionality as hot wallets but with added security.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, you can connect your cold wallet to a hot wallet like MetaMask or Phantom, which makes connecting to DeFi applications seamless. For every transaction you make, you will have to sign it with the buttons on your device.</p><h2><strong>How do Cold Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>All cold storage crypto wallets have a seed phrase, consisting of 12 or 24 words, which you can use to restore your wallet and access your crypto funds in case something happens to your computer or smartphone. That&rsquo;s because your crypto wallet and assets are stored on the blockchain. Using the seed phrase you actually prove that you own the wallet.</p><h3><strong>Cold Wallets Store Your Seed Phrase Offline</strong></h3><p>Cold wallets generate and store the user&rsquo;s private keys on the physical device. This means the seed phrase is never exposed on your computer screen while you&rsquo;re connected to the Internet. This way, hackers can never see your seed phrase via your computer even if your computer is compromised.</p><p>If the user needs to restore a private key, they enter the seed phrase directly on the device itself, which is encrypted and offline.</p><h3><strong>You Need to Press a Button to Sign Transactions</strong></h3><p>Aside from keeping your seed phrase safe, cold wallets have another safety feature. You have to physically press buttons on the cold wallet to authorize transactions. This way, no one can authorize the transaction except the person who holds the cold wallet device.</p><p>To increase security, cold wallets use a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA to unlock the device. If someone manages to steal your hardware wallet, they would need to know your access codes to unlock it.</p><blockquote>
<h3><strong>Why Is The Seed Phrase Important?</strong></h3>
<p>The crypto wallet seed phrase, often made of 12 to 24 randomly generated words, is the backup key to your wallet. This sequence of words is linked to the private keys and acts as a mnemonic representation to retrieve access to the assets within the wallet.</p>
<p>For example, you create a crypto wallet and you don&rsquo;t save the seed phrase. If you need to reinstall your operating system, someone steals your computer or your cold wallet breaks and you don&rsquo;t know your wallet&rsquo;s seed phrase, you won&rsquo;t be able to access your digital wallet and your funds will be trapped.</p>
<p>To protect your seed phrase, you need to write it down on a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe. Some cold wallet providers, like Ledger, sell metal seed phrase protectors that can withstand fire and damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><h2><strong>Advantages of Cold Crypto Wallets</strong></h2><p>The main advantage of a cold wallet is enhanced security. Since you need to physically press buttons on the wallet, you are safe from remote access hacks.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3><p>The best advantage of cold crypto wallets is their superior protection against online vulnerabilities. Cold wallets aren&rsquo;t connected to the internet, making them immune to cyber attacks.</p><p>This includes protection from hacking attempts, phishing schemes, malware infections and other malicious activities. By storing private keys offline, cold wallets ensure that access to your funds is protected.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Unauthorized Access Protection</strong></h3><p>Cold wallets require that you physically press a button to sign a transaction. In the unfortunate event that a malicious actor has gained access to your computer accounts and companion cold wallet app, they can&rsquo;t move your funds without you pressing the buttons.</p><p>This acts as a physical barrier against unauthorized access and theft, giving you peace of mind that your funds are protected even when you sleep.</p><h3><strong>Long-Term Safekeeping</strong></h3><p>Crypto cold wallets are designed for the long-term storing of your crypto assets. That&rsquo;s because the safety feature of pressing buttons to authorize transactions can become a nuisance if you plan to use your cold wallet device for active trading. What&rsquo;s more, active trading requires that you connect to multiple decentralized apps, which could potentially pose a threat if they&rsquo;re hacked.</p><p>Unlike hot wallets, which are designed for frequent transactions and daily use, cold wallets are better suited for &#8220;hodling&#8221;, which is for keeping your assets safe long-term.</p><h3><strong>Immune to Platform Failures</strong></h3><p>Online platforms and exchanges are known to experience downtimes, glitches and even hacks. For example, <a href="https://decrypt.co/150669/defi-exchange-curve-finance-confirms-various-ethereum-pools-hacked"><u>DeFi exchange Curve Finance had various Ethereum pools hacked</u></a> where $52 million were stolen.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/13/north-korean-attackers-linked-to-54m-coinex-hack-blockchain-data-suggests/"><u>CoinEx lost $54 million in a hack</u></a>. If you had funds in these two platforms or any other where the assets were compromised, you could have lost all your funds.</p><p>Cold wallets eliminate this risk because you have full control over your assets and how they move.</p><h2><strong>Cold Wallets vs Hot Wallets</strong></h2><p>Both cold wallets and hot wallets are designed to store your digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But there are some differences between the two.</p><h3><strong>Assets Safety</strong></h3><p>One of the main differences between cold wallets and hot wallets is safety. Hot wallets provide you with a seed phrase visible on your computer screen or smartphone when you open a new wallet. Cold wallets, on the other hand, provide you with a seed phrase directly on the screen of the hardware wallet, which isn&rsquo;t connected to the internet.</p><p>This means that unless someone looks directly at your hardware wallet&rsquo;s screen when you read and write the 12 to 24 words, there is no way that they can know your seed phrase to steal your funds.</p><h3><strong>Transaction Execution</strong></h3><p>Another difference between these two types of wallets is how transactions are executed. You can sign transactions with one click using hot wallets, which makes it an excellent choice for frequent trading or using decentralized apps.</p><p>Cold wallets, however, have buttons that you have to physically press to sign the transaction. What&rsquo;s more, you need to unlock your crypto cold wallet device with a PIN, a passphrase or 2FA. This makes signing transactions more complex but also safer.</p><h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3><p>Due to being safer, the best cold wallets are designed for long-term safekeeping. This means that once you buy your crypto assets, you send them to your cold wallet and you leave them there until you decide to sell.</p><p>Hot wallets are designed to be exploited daily. Connect your hot wallets to decentralized exchanges, yield farming protocols or NFT marketplaces and feel free to continuously sign transactions. You can always move your profits into your cold wallets for safekeeping.</p><h2><strong>How to Choose a Cold Cryptocurrency Wallet</strong></h2><p>Choosing the best cold wallet is a decision that requires weighing in several factors, including security features, supported cryptocurrencies, mobile app experience as well as pricing.</p><h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3><p>This is the main reason to get a cold wallet. But there are nuances that you have to consider as not all cold wallets are created equal. For example, some users prefer Bluetooth connectivity so they can easily sign transactions on their smartphones without using cables.</p><p>Other users may consider Bluetooth as a liability and prefer to have air-gapped devices, meaning they have no wireless contact of any kind that could compromise security.</p><p>Also, look for wallets that have a proven track record of security, like Ledger and Trezor, which employ strong encryption methods. Additionally, consider the wallet&#8217;s recovery options. In case the wallet is lost or damaged you will have to use your seed phrase to access your wallet.</p><p>But sometimes you could lose your seed phrase as well. Every Trezor cold wallet has a solution for this via something called Shamir Backup where you split your seed phrase into several pieces. If one piece is lost or stolen, you can still recover your wallet.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Ledger Recover" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334956/ledger-recover.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Ledger has recently employed a similar <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/24/crypto-wallet-maker-ledger-officially-rolls-out-recover-unleashing-fresh-round-of-snark/"><u>wallet recovery feature called Ledger Recover</u></a>. This is a paid feature where you have to submit valid ID documents and a selfie recording. Once approved, your device will encrypt your seed phrase and split it into three fragments, which will be used to recover your seed phrase. Because your seed phrase is locked to your ID, you can be the only one who can request the recovery fragments.</p><blockquote>
<h3><strong>What is Shamir Backup?</strong></h3>
<p>Shamir Backup is a security standard that aims to protect your seed phrase. The way it works is your seed phrase is split up into pieces, called recovery shares, and you can store them at various places. If one of the pieces is lost or damaged, you can still recover your assets.</p>
<p>Recovery shares are sequences of 20 or 33 words that carry part of the cryptographic secret. When you combine the number of shares you create a master seed, which you can use to recover your wallet.</p>
</blockquote><h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>Most crypto cold wallets support the most popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, but they also support thousands of other coins and tokens. However, some wallets, like Blockstream Jade, support only Bitcoin and no other coin.</p><p>That is why you have to consider what you really need before buying a cold wallet. If you only want to hold Bitcoin and sell it in 10 years, then Blockstream Jade could be a perfect wallet; it&rsquo;s cheaper, it&rsquo;s reliable and it&rsquo;s safe. But if you want to store multiple coins and do multi-chain swaps, then Trezor or Ledger wallets are typically the way to go.</p><h3><strong>Companion Mobile App</strong></h3><p>Even though cold wallets are designed to be offline storage devices, most of them come with companion mobile apps that allow you to monitor your portfolio, to initiate transactions, to stake your idle coins, to use decentralized apps like Uniswap and 1inch exchange, and more.</p><p>That is why it&rsquo;s important to consider cold storage wallets that meet your requirements. Ledger&rsquo;s Ledger Live app is one of the best companion apps, where you can stake your idle coins. This feature isn&rsquo;t available in most other cold wallet apps.</p><p>Another valuable app is the Trezor Suite, which has similar functionalities to Ledger Live, but it can also help obscure your transactions with Coinjoin.</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Trezor Suite" width="900" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334958/trezor-suite.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><h3><strong>Device Cost</strong></h3><p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/21/mark-cuban-lost-nearly-900000-dollars-to-crypto-hackers.html"><u>Mark Cuban lost nearly $900,000 to crypto hackers</u></a> by installing a fake MetaMask app. If this happened to him it could happen to everyone. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to own a cold wallet and never share your seed phrase regardless of the device&rsquo;s cost.</p><p>However, if two or more devices share a similar price point while offering the same functionality, you could spend the extra money investing in crypto. Compare the wallets you are willing to get and see whether paying a premium is worth it.</p><h2><strong>Limitations of Cold Wallets</strong></h2><p>While cold wallets offer security advantages, there are some limitations to consider. Before opting for a cold wallet, weigh the benefits against the potential inconveniences associated with cold storage.</p><p>Susceptible to physical attacks. Someone could steal your hardware wallet or it could be damaged or lost. If you don&rsquo;t have your seed phrase ready, you won&rsquo;t be able to recover your assets.</p><p>Regular transactions. Cold wallets are designed for storage, which makes them inconvenient for everyday transaction signing. That&rsquo;s because you have to physically press a button every time you wish to make a transaction. If you&rsquo;re making hundreds of transactions each day, it could be tedious to approve them every time on your hardware wallet.</p><p>Cost. While hot wallets are free to use, cold wallets come with a purchase price. Of course, this is a small price to pay for the safety of your crypto assets. But you still have to weigh in whether you really need a cold wallet or not for your intended use cases.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The 10 best cold wallets for 2023 stand out not only for their robust security features but also for their user-friendly companion apps, a wide range of coin support and innovative functionalities. Whether you&rsquo;re a beginner in the crypto space or a seasoned investor, buying a cold wallet is probably one of the most prudent investments you can make.</p><p>Consider one of the three Ledger devices to hold your crypto assets. These are some of the best on the market, with strong safety features and a mobile app that lets you stake your coins or trade them whenever you want.</p><p>Ledger S Plus supports over 5,500 coins for an affordable price. But if you&rsquo;re looking for Bluetooth connectivity, Ledger Nano X could be a better option.</p><div class="raw-html-embed">

</ol><h2>The Top Crypto Exchanges Reviewed</h2><p>We compared the best crypto exchanges, including features, pros and cons, and trading fees.</p><h3>1. eToro &#8211; Crypto and Stock Trading Platform With Innovative Copy Trading Tools and $100k Demo Account</h3><p>Started in 2007 as a trading platform focused on transparency and ease of use, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> initially offered forex trading, letting users trade currencies easily. Over time, the platform added stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and then added cryptocurrency trading in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>What started as a Bitcoin-only offering has grown to over 80 cryptocurrencies available for trading, including popular choices like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIBxM).&nbsp;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro's crypto selection" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334257/etoro-overview.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>eToro&rsquo;s approach to trading makes it one of the best crypto exchanges for beginners, although experienced traders will also feel at home due in part to eToro&#8217;s advanced TradingView charts with up to 100 market indicators. On both mobile and desktop, the interface is bright, inviting, and easy to navigate. A simple search box at the top of the screen helps you discover new assets to trade, news stories, and posts from other traders, which leads to one of eToro&rsquo;s strongest selling points: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/etoro/"><u>eToro Social Trading</u></a>.</p><p>You can follow posts from other investors (or share your own thoughts), but eToro also lets you copy the trades of other traders using their intuitively named Copy Trading. In the US, copy trading is currently limited to crypto trades (and cryptos supported in the US). Elsewhere in the world, you can copy trades for crypto, stocks, ETFs, and even commodities. Just find a trader that interests you, and check their trading history &mdash; including long-term performance, risk level, and percentage of profitable weeks &mdash; and then click &ldquo;copy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You choose the investment amount for each copy trade, and you can also set a &ldquo;stop loss&rdquo; by choosing a level to exit the trade if the market turns south.</p><p style="text-align: center"><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro copytrading" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334258/etoro-copy-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>eToro also offers a demo account called a Virtual Portfolio. Every account gets $100,000 in virtual funds with which to test trading strategies or just learn the ropes of trading crypto on eToro. It&rsquo;s a risk-free way to learn, and very few competing exchanges offer the feature.</p><h4>eToro Trading Fees</h4><p>eToro uses a flat 1% trading fee for cryptocurrencies. Here&rsquo;s how it works.&nbsp;</p><p>For a $100 BTC purchase, you&rsquo;ll pay $1 in trading fees. You&rsquo;ll also pay 1% when you sell, which may be higher or lower than $1 based on the value when you close the position. For standard orders, you&rsquo;ll buy at the ask price (and sell at the bid price), so you also pay a spread. We&rsquo;ll cover bids, asks, and spreads in more detail later in the guide.&nbsp;</p><p>eToro&rsquo;s 1% crypto trading fee is easy to understand and makes trading costs predictable, a welcome approach compared to many popular exchanges. Coinbase, for example, uses two different fee schedules, and both have several levels.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>eToro offers over 80 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Shiba Inu (SHIBxM &#8211; SHIB in millions)</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>
<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>
<li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
<li>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</li>
</ul><h4>eToro Pros and Cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Newbie-friendly interface</li>
<li>Copy trading: copy the trades of successful investors</li>
<li>Smart portfolios: Choose from ETF-style targeted investments</li>
<li>PayPal support</li>
</ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul>
<li>Limited support for crypto storage in eToro Money wallet</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t move crypto onto the platform</li>
<li>$5 withdrawal fee</li>

</div><h3>2. Coinbase &#8211; Publicly Traded Crypto Exchange With Over 250 Cryptos, Advanced Trading, and Staking</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/en">Coinbase</a> dates back to 2012 and the exchange is currently the largest publicly traded exchange worldwide. Being a publicly traded company brings more transparency for users because Coinbase discloses its <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx"><u>SEC statements</u></a> and <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"><u>financial statements</u></a> to comply with regulatory requirements. Following the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/rise-fall-crypto-exchange-ftx-2022-11-10/"><u>collapse of FTX</u></a> in 2022, transparency has become more important than ever.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll find over 250 cryptocurrencies available for trading on Coinbase, ranging from top assets like BTC and ETH to newly launched tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>Like eToro, Coinbase is known for its user-friendly interface. However, Coinbase uses two trading platforms&nbsp; &mdash; simple and advanced &mdash; which can add some complexity for newer traders.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="coinbase wallet trade crypto" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334260/coinbase-trading.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>There&rsquo;s also a third trading option called Coinbase One. With a $30 monthly subscription, traders can trade with no additional fees. Coinbase reports that subscribers save an average of $55 per month with Coinbase One.</p><p>Most new traders will gravitate toward Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades, which you can access through conveniently placed Buy &amp; Sell buttons throughout the site. While easy to use, it&rsquo;s worth noting that simple trades come with higher fees, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/"><u>Coinbase&rsquo;s fee structure</u></a> varies based on the amount of the trade as well as the funding source.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center"><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="coinbase buy crypto preview" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334261/coinbase-simple-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>One key advantage of using Coinbase or a similar full-featured crypto exchange like Kraken (up next), is that you can move your crypto off the exchange easily. Many traders prefer to keep larger balances in a crypto wallet they control rather than on the exchange. eToro also supports this for Bitcoin and seven other assets, but many crypto assets can&#8217;t be moved off the eToro platform.</p><h4>Coinbase Trading Fees</h4><p>Coinbase offers simple trades, as mentioned above, but also provides an advanced trading platform called Coinbase Advanced. You&rsquo;ll save money by trading on Coinbase Advanced, but expect to invest some time in learning the platform. You&rsquo;ll find a myriad of buttons, toggles, and settings to trade with precision.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the cost difference between simple trades and Coinbase Advanced.</p><p><strong>Trading fees for a $100 Bitcoin purchase:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Simple trades: </strong>$3.84 + 1% spread</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase Advanced (market order):</strong> $0.80 + market spread (buy at ask price)</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase Advanced (limit order):</strong> $0.60 (no spread with limit orders)</li>
</ul><p>Coinbase Advanced offers lower fees compared to eToro. However, eToro brings lower trading costs compared to Coinbase&#8217;s simple trades.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>Coinbase offers over 250 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>
<li>Solana (SOL)</li>
<li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
<li>Polygon (MATIC)</li>
</ul><h3>Coinbase Pros and Cons</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Learning rewards for passing quizzes</li>
<li>Easy-to-use simple trades</li>
<li>Reduced fees with advanced trades</li>
<li>Easily move crypto to and from Coinbase</li>
<li>Interest paid on USDC balances</li>
<li>Staking rewards for several assets, including ETH</li>

</div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>3. Kraken &#8211; Security-Focused Crypto Exchange With Proof-Of-Reserves, 200+ Cryptos, and Low Fees</h3><p>As one of the oldest crypto exchanges, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/en">Kraken</a> has earned a loyal following through transparency combined with low trading fees. Kraken was founded in 2011, just two years after Bitcoin came onto the scene as the first cryptocurrency. Now, this San Francisco-based exchange offers 200+ cryptocurrencies and provides trading services in nearly 200 countries worldwide. This gives Kraken a wider footprint compared to Coinbase, which operates in just over 100 countries.</p><p>Transparency has always been paramount with Kraken, and the company was the first to provide <a href="https://www.kraken.com/proof-of-reserves"><u>proof-of-reserves</u></a>, which is a blockchain-based method of proving that the company has the crypto it shows for your account.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="kraken exchange buy bitcoin" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334265/kraken-simple-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Like Coinbase, Kraken offers both simple trades and advanced trading, with the latter being called Kraken Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the Pro moniker, you can use Kraken&rsquo;s advanced trading platform as a beginner or intermediate trader to enjoy lower fees and access advanced analytics at a glance.&nbsp;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="kraken trading dashboard" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334266/kraken-pro.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><h4>Kraken Trading Fees</h4><p>Similar to Coinbase, Kraken offers two trading platforms. The simpler of these is called Instant Buy/Sell and brings higher trading costs compared to the advanced platform as well as eToro&rsquo;s 1% fee. Instant Buy/Sell orders use a variable &ldquo;display fee,&rdquo; which you see on your details before you confirm, plus a spread that can vary based on market conditions.</p><p>Like many simple buy boxes, it can be a pricier way to trade crypto. The real trading-cost savings come from Kraken Pro, where you&rsquo;ll pay just 0.26% for market orders and 0.16% for limit orders. This compares well against Coinbase Advanced where you&rsquo;ll pay 0.8% or 0.6%, respectively.</p><p>Watch out for higher fees on debit card transactions, however.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are the fees we saw in sample trades for $100 worth of Bitcoin:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Instant Buy/Sell (bank transfer):</strong> $1.97</li>
<li><strong>Instant Buy/Sell (debit card):</strong> $5.42</li>
<li><strong>Kraken Pro (limit order): </strong>$0.16</li>
<li><strong>Kraken Pro (market order): </strong>$0.26</li>
</ul><p>Healthy trading volume combined with low fees help make Kraken one of the best bitcoin exchanges and crypto exchanges overall.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>Kraken offers over 200 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>
<li>Solana (SOL)</li>
<li>Tron (TRX)</li>
<li>Chainlink (LINK)</li>
</ul><h3>Kraken Pros and Cons</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Proof of reserves (per account)</li>
<li>Low fees on Kraken Pro</li>
<li>200+ cryptos</li>
<li>Available in 190+ countries</li>
</ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul>
<li>High trading fees for Instant Buy/Sell trades</li>
<li>High debit card fees</li>

</div><h3><br>&nbsp;4. Binance &#8211; Full-Featured Exchange With 350+ Cryptocurrencies, Low Fees, and Trading Bots</h3><p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/binance/en">Binance</a> is the largest crypto exchange worldwide by trading volume, but whether you can use the platform depends on where you live in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>US residents aren&rsquo;t able to use the main exchange but can use Binance.US. Currently, Binance.US does not support bank deposits (crypto deposits only), which makes an otherwise easy-to-use exchange less beginner-friendly. Traders from other areas of the world will find Binance.com offers basic trading with plenty of room to grow into advanced trading, including futures, leveraged trades, crypto loans, and much more.</p><p>With over 350 cryptocurrencies available for trading, Binance offers one of the largest crypto selections in our roundup, giving you access to staples like BTC and ETH, as well as many lesser-known cryptocurrencies like RDNT or ARB.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="binance trading chart" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334269/binance-advanced-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>You&rsquo;ll also find more trading on Binance pairs compared to many other exchanges. Above, you&rsquo;ll see the RDNT/BTC trading pair. Many exchanges don&rsquo;t offer smaller cryptocurrencies at all and BTC trading pairs are typically limited to very high-volume assets like UDST or ETH. Binance offers more flexibility in trading, but like many other exchanges, much of the functionality revolves around the advanced trading platform rather than the instant buy boxes you&rsquo;ll see throughout the site.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="buy crypto with binance" width="1576" height="449" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334270/binance-easy.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>To its credit, Binance makes instant buys affordable. You&rsquo;ll pay the base trading fee of 0.1% plus a 0.5% fee for using the instant buy box. This compares well against Kraken, which charges about 2% for instant buys, and Coinbase, which charges 3.84% for a $100 simple trade. Binance instant buys are also more affordable compared to eToro. However, eToro&rsquo;s ease of use combined with innovative features like Copy Trading make it a popular choice.</p><h4>Binance Trading Fees</h4><p>Binance puts less distance between trading fees for its advanced platform vs its simple trading platform. For <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/"><u>Binance Advanced</u></a>, you&rsquo;ll pay 0.1% for both limit and market orders. Using instant buys, the simpler trading interface, adds a 0.5% fee to the trade and reduces the number of cryptocurrencies you can trade to just under 100.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>Binance offers over 350 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>FLOKI (FLOKI)</li>
<li>PEPE (PEPE)</li>
<li>Gala (GALA)</li>
<li>dYdX (DYDX)</li>
<li>Sui Network (SUI)</li>

OKX &#8211; Lowest-Cost Exchange With Copy Trading, Trading Bots, and 350+ Cryptocurrencies</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/en">OKK</a> offers many of the advanced features you&rsquo;ll find on Binance but with even lower fees for limit orders. This could make OKX the best Bitcoin exchange if trading fees are your main consideration and you&rsquo;re comfortable using an advanced trading platform. (OKX offers a demo account perfect for learning.)</p><p>You&rsquo;ll pay just 0.08% for limit orders while market orders parallel Binance&rsquo;s trading fees at 0.1%.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, like Binance, OKX has over 350 cryptocurrencies available, including BTC, ETH, and a host of newer tokens to discover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="okx bitcoin trading platform" width="1600" height="799" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334273/okx-advanced.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>One downside, however, is that OKX is not available in the US or Canada. Instead, traders in (northern) North America &mdash; and elsewhere &mdash; can use OKcoin, a sister exchange that serves over 190 countries and offers a simple trading interface.&nbsp;</p><p>Trading fees on OKcoin come in slightly higher at 0.1% for limit orders and 0.2% for market orders, both of which are more affordable than Kraken or Coinbase.</p><p style="text-align: center"><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="OKX buy bitcoin" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334274/okcoin.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>The main exchange at OKX offers trading bots, which are programmable automated traders that buy and sell according to the rules you define. You&rsquo;ll also find perpetual futures trading, a way to bet on the future price of a cryptocurrency without buying it, and a demo account so you can practice your trades or tune up your trading bots before you turn them loose in real-world trades.</p><h3>OKX Pros and Cons</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>

Nexo &#8211; Easy-To-Use Crypto Platform With 60+ Cryptos, Crypto Lending, and Crypto Loans</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/nexo/en">Nexo</a> dates back to 2018. Since its launch, the Swiss-based crypto exchange has grown to over 6 million users in over 200 countries worldwide. With 60+ cryptocurrencies available for trading, you&rsquo;ll find the most popular crypto assets, like BTC and ETH, as well as some that can be more difficult to find, like TRON (TRX)&nbsp; and XRP.&nbsp;</p><p>Nexo&rsquo;s features parallel many of those you&rsquo;re familiar with from banks. In many regions (but not in the US), you can earn interest on your cryptocurrency held on the exchange. You can also easily borrow against your crypto holdings. Notably, Nexo also offers a credit/debit card you can use to access the value of your crypto.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="nexo spot trading dashboard" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334276/nexo-pro.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Fees are beginner-friendly, with no extra trading fees on Nexo&rsquo;s main platform. Instead, Nexo uses a spread that&rsquo;s included in the price. If you choose to use Nexo Pro, the advanced trading platform, you can buy without a spread with trading fees at 0.3% for limit orders, half the cost of Coinbase Advanced.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>Nexo offers over 60 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>

With the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/strike/en">Strike</a> app, you can buy any crypto you want, as long as it&rsquo;s Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>Built by Bitcoin HODLers for Bitcoin HODLers, Strike lets you put your BTC stacking on autopilot. Choose an investment amount and frequency and set up a payment method. Strike does the rest, delivering your Bitcoin to your Strike wallet on schedule with no fees.&nbsp;You can also buy BTC on demand.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="strike crypto exchange buy BTC" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334278/strike-buy-bitcoin.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Like many other platforms, Strike makes its profit from the spread, but unlike on other platforms, there are no trading fees. You can even withdraw BTC from your Strike wallet to a self-custody Bitcoin wallet without network fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Strike also functions as a payment app, letting you send money globally, but the Bitcoin network &mdash; and specifically Bitcoin&rsquo;s Lightning network &mdash; is the wizardry behind the curtain. The Lightning network is a second layer on the Bitcoin network that enables fast transactions for a fraction of the cost.</p><p>Strike&rsquo;s easy setup and no-fee structure might make it the best Bitcoin exchange for absolute beginners or Bitcoin-only investors.</p><p>The downside, of course, is that if you want to buy other cryptos, like ETH, you have to look elsewhere.

</div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>8. Bitstamp &#8211; Beginner-Friendly Crypto Platform With 80+ Cryptos and No Fees for Low-Volume Traders</h3><p>Bitstamp&rsquo;s fee structure makes it easy to get started with smaller investment amounts. If your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitstamp/en">Bitstamp</a> trading volume is under $1,000 per month, you&rsquo;ll pay <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/fee-schedule/"><u>no trading fees</u></a> on the advanced platform. At $1,000 per month or less (based on trailing 30-day trading volume), limit order fees come in at 0.3%, which is lower than you&rsquo;ll find on Coinbase Advanced, for example. Market orders in the same tier cost 0.40%.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s often a tradeoff to no-fee trades, and in this case, it&rsquo;s withdrawal fees &mdash; which can get spendy. BTC withdrawal fees, for instance, are 0.005 BTC, or about $13 at today&rsquo;s BTC price. If you&rsquo;re taking advantage of Bitstamp&rsquo;s no-fee trades at lower volume, it might be best to let your position build up before withdrawing.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="bitstamp exchange welcome page" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334230/bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>The platform offers both a simple interface and an advanced interface.

</div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>What is a Cryptocurrency Exchange?</h2><p>A crypto exchange is a marketplace where you can buy cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, with traditional (fiat) currencies, like the USD or GBP. Exchanges work like on ramps, a way to convert your fiat money into crypto and back again if you decide to sell. A crypto exchange or platform also acts as an intermediary, a go-between that allows buyers and sellers to transact without ever meeting, much like a stock exchange.</p><p>Full-featured exchanges like Binance or OKX also allow you to trade one cryptocurrency for another using trading pairs (trade this for that). For instance, you may want to trade some ETH (Ether from the Ethereum blockchain) for BTC (Bitcoin). If there&rsquo;s a trading pair on the exchange, you can trade one for the other, adjusting your crypto portfolio in one trade.</p><p>Some platforms don&rsquo;t offer everything you&rsquo;ll find on an exchange, however, meaning you may not be able to trade one crypto for another. eToro is one example, favoring ease of use over crypto-to-crypto exchanges. Depending on how you trade or invest, this might make eToro a perfect fit. Simpler platforms may forgo the extras that many people won&rsquo;t use but still allow you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, converting your crypto back to cash when you exit your position.</p><blockquote>
<h4>Crypto Exchanges vs. Crypto Brokers</h4>
<p>Both crypto exchanges and crypto brokers provide a way to trade cryptocurrencies. There are differences going on behind the scenes, however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchanges use an order book, a list of open buy and sell orders. You&rsquo;re buying and selling against existing orders placed by other traders or market makers. If you use an advanced trading platform on an exchange like Kraken, you can see these orders.</p>
<p>Crypto brokers, on the other hand, are intermediaries between traders and the market. Brokers are in the middle of the transaction and you&rsquo;re really buying from or selling to the broker rather than other traders. The broker then fills the buy or sell order through market makers and orders placed by other traders.</p>
</blockquote><p>Crypto trading platforms also offer basic crypto storage. The exchange or platform provides a built-in crypto wallet called a custodial wallet that you can access with your account login.</p><p>The details above all refer to centralized exchanges, trading platforms run by a company and often regulated by local governments. There&rsquo;s another type of exchange called a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm"><u>decentralized exchange</u></a> (DEX) run by computer programs on the blockchain. DEXs let users swap crypto directly from their crypto wallets. We&rsquo;ll focus on the best centralized exchanges in this guide. A third (and less common) type of crypto exchange, called a P2P or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm"><u>Peer-to-Peer exchange,</u></a> allows buyers and sellers to transact directly.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cryptocurrency Exchange Fees</h2><p>You can often avoid deposit fees by linking a bank account and depositing to your trading account from your bank account. Debit card transactions often come with additional fees of up to 4%. But there are some other fees to understand as well.</p><h3>Trading Fees</h3><p>We&rsquo;ll discuss fees for specific types of trades in more detail in a bit, but crypto trading fees can come in several forms, depending on the platform and the type of trade.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Fixed fees and simple trading fees:</strong> Many exchanges and platforms use a specific fee structure for trades that use a simple buy/sell widget as opposed to an advanced trading platform. Often, you&rsquo;ll pay a fixed fee, which varies based on the transaction amount. The fee schedule may convert to a percentage-based fee as the transaction value crosses a certain threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Maker and taker fees:</strong> Advanced trading platforms use a maker/taker fee schedule, with the fee percentage typically driven by your 30-day trading volume. Placing a fixed price limit order maker you a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; because you&rsquo;re making a market for other traders. &ldquo;Takers&rdquo; take liquidity off the market by trading against existing limit orders with a (buy at) market order. Take orders usually cost more in trading fees compared to maker orders.</li>
<li><strong>Spread fees:</strong> The spread generally refers to the difference in price between the highest-priced limit buy order and the lowest-price limit sell order. Exchanges may use a spread fee as the trading fee itself or in addition to a simple trading fee.</li>
</ul><h3>Withdrawal Fees</h3><p>Like trading fees, withdrawal fees come in more than one type.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Fiat withdrawal fees:</strong> Some exchanges charge a fee to withdraw your money from the exchange. On eToro, for example, some transactions require a $5 withdrawal fee. If the exchange uses a fixed dollar amount for a fee, waiting until you can withdraw a larger amount reduces the cost of the withdrawal fee as a percentage of the withdrawal amount.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto withdrawal fees:</strong> If you withdraw crypto from an exchange by sending it to another wallet, you&rsquo;ll pay a network fee. These fees vary by cryptocurrency type and the network to which you withdraw. For example, withdrawing ETH on the Ethereum network may cost several dollars depending on network activity. However, if you withdraw ETH on the Abitrum network, you&rsquo;ll pay pennies rather than dollars. The size of the transaction does not affect network fees, but some platforms may charge a fixed withdrawal fee for crypto transactions.</li>
</ul><h2>How do Crypto Trading Platforms Work?</h2><p>We discussed crypto exchanges as a marketplace to buy crypto with fiat money, such as USD or GBP, for example. Larger exchanges typically attract more buyers and sellers, making the pricing for common cryptos like Bitcoin competitive with the price elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>For creating this marketplace and transferring crypto between buyers and sellers, the exchange typically charges a fee on trades. However, you may find some platforms that don&rsquo;t charge a trading fee. Generally, those platforms make money on the spread instead, which we&rsquo;ll discuss in a bit.</p><p>To comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations, many exchanges also require proof of identity. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges.htm"><u>Some exchanges don&rsquo;t require KYC</u></a>, however. Typically, these include decentralized and P2P exchanges.</p><h3>How Crypto Trades Work</h3><p>Mechanically, there&rsquo;s a lot going on under the hood of a cryptocurrency trading platform.</p><p>Beginner-friendly platforms like eToro obscure the complicated mechanics, giving you a simple trading interface and fee structure.&nbsp;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro open bitcoin trade" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334231/etoro-buy-btc.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>On eToro, you can buy crypto like Bitcoin with USD. When you&rsquo;re ready to sell, you&rsquo;ll get USD in exchange for your Bitcoin. eToro charges a 1% fee to buy and 1% to sell. All of this is reflected in the buying price and selling price, so there are no surprises.</p><p>Advanced exchanges, like OKX or &#65532;Coinbase Advanced, show more of what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes, including the ever-changing order book and executed orders flashing in real time.</p><p>The order book is at the heart of any exchange. As the name suggests, it&rsquo;s a list of open orders. You&rsquo;ll see sell orders stacked on top and buy orders listed at the bottom. These are all limit orders, meaning the trader sets a fixed price for the order. These are also called &ldquo;maker&rdquo; orders because the traders are making a market with their orders.&nbsp;</p><p>Without maker orders, there are no trades because there&rsquo;s no one to buy from or sell to, at least not visibly. As the market-making heroes of the story, maker orders typically earn lower trading fees.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro crypto order book" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334232/coinbase-advanced-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>In the screenshot of Coinbase Advanced above, you&rsquo;ll also see the spread ($0.68) right above the limit buy orders and below the limit sell orders in the order book. Often, the spread on BTC is just $0.01 between the lowest-priced sell order (called the ask) and the highest-priced buy order (called the bid). However, spreads can be wider depending on which orders are open.&nbsp;</p><p>On cryptocurrencies that don&rsquo;t trade often or on low-volume exchanges, you can sometimes see much wider spreads.</p><blockquote>
<h4>Spreads as Trading Fees</h4>
<p>Some platforms and exchanges use the spread as their fee, rather than charging a trading fee, while others might charge both a trading fee and a spread fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, sometimes, a spread isn&rsquo;t a spread as we described earlier. Instead, the spread may be a fixed percentage fee, as seen with Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades. With Coinbase simple trades, you&rsquo;ll pay a trading fee plus a 1% &ldquo;spread.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchanges may use spread fees to lock in a price for your trade because ask prices can change quickly.</p>
</blockquote><p>When you buy or sell without setting a price, it&rsquo;s called a market order. You&rsquo;re buying from or selling to other traders who placed limit orders on the exchange. Another name for a market order is a &ldquo;taker&rdquo; order because you&rsquo;re taking liquidity provided by the maker orders in the order book.</p><p>In the example below, if you wanted to buy 1 BTC, you could place a fixed-price limit order, which may or may not fill, or you could buy with a market order. None of the existing orders offer one full BTC, however, so your order would fill from the bottom of the list and move up in price until you fill your order for 1 BTC. This is called slippage; the order slips into the next order in the order book changing the average price for your order.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro crypto order book trade history" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334233/coinbase-order-book.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>You&rsquo;ll also pay a bit more for the market order on many exchanges due to higher fees for taker orders. For example, Coinbase Advanced charges 0.6% on maker orders but 0.8% on taker orders.</p><blockquote>
<h4>The Role of Market Makers in Crypto</h4>
<p>Odds are good that many of the orders you see in an exchange order book are from market makers rather than individual buyers and sellers. Market makers are people or companies that keep an inventory of an asset ready to sell (and cash ready to buy) while making a profit from the difference between the buy and sell price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This parallels the role of market makers on stock exchanges, where they fill a similar role: reducing spreads and providing liquidity (making a ready trading market available). Typically, market makers earn a very small percentage on the asset they trade, making their profits from volume rather than margin.</p>
</blockquote><h3>How Crypto Storage Works on Exchanges</h3><p>Once you&rsquo;ve made your trade, the exchange holds your crypto for you. Technically, your crypto is in a crypto wallet controlled by the exchange called a custodial wallet.</p><p>Crypto wallets work a lot like mailboxes. You can send things from an address or receive things at an address. In this case, it&rsquo;s crypto rather than bills and postcards.</p><p>Unlike a mailbox, where your mail is hidden from view, the whole world can see the transactions in your crypto wallet, as shown in the transaction below from <a href="https://etherscan.io/"><u>Etherscan</u></a>.</p><p><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etherscan history transaction hash" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334234/etherscan.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>The good news is that it&rsquo;s unlikely that the average blockchain detective knows your wallet address belongs to you.</p><p>For many traders, this custodial arrangement with exchanges works well. The exchange provides custody for your crypto and you use your login to access your account. As your crypto balance grows, however, or if you want to do things with your crypto, you may want to research the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm"><u>best crypto wallets</u></a> so you can self-custody your crypto.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Crypto Exchange</h2><p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking for the best crypto exchanges for beginners, the best bitcoin trading platform, or the best crypto trading platform for advanced traders, there are several factors to weigh. Features, fees, and safety all play important roles when choosing a platform that fits your trading needs and that won&rsquo;t break the bank with surprise fees. Of course, it&rsquo;s also essential to choose a platform that won&rsquo;t disappear tomorrow, especially as your balance grows.</p><h3>Regulation/Licenses</h3><p>Much of the crypto industry remains unregulated, but some exchanges and trading platforms have taken steps to register with regulators and obtain licenses to operate in certain jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, eToro operates in over 140 countries throughout the world and <a href="https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/regulation-license/"><u>is regulated in several larger trading markets</u></a>.</p><ul>
<li>US: FINRA, SEC</li>
<li>UK: FCA</li>
<li>Australia: ASIC</li>
<li>Europe: CySEC</li>
</ul><p>Regulatory oversight offers an extra safeguard for investors that helps ensure cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto trading platforms follow regulations and conform to best practices. However, where each company is licensed or regulated matters. Exchanges often do business under different business units in various parts of the world. If you live in the UK, but the company is regulated in another country, UK safeguards may not apply.</p><p>Ideally, look for exchanges that are regulated in your country or region. Recently, the FCA named dozens of exchanges that it says are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-09/huobi-kucoin-among-crypto-firms-added-to-uk-fca-s-warning-list"><u>promoting financial services without the FCA&rsquo;s permission</u></a>. While this, in itself, doesn&rsquo;t make the named exchanges unsafe, it does illustrate regulatory risk. Exchanges that come under fire from regulators can be forced to change the business dramatically, as happened with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101"><u>Binance.US and the SEC</u></a>, or may even fall into insolvency, as happened with FTX (also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219"><u>charged by the SEC</u></a>).</p><h3>Available Cryptos</h3><p>Most exchanges offer BTC and ETH, which together represent about 70% of the total crypto market cap. Bitcoin alone represents about 50% of the market and often moves the rest of the market with its ebbs and flows. But you might not find the latest crypto that people are talking about on social media on some of the most popular exchanges.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro crypto selection by market cap" width="725" height="528" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334280/screenshot-from-2023-10-1.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Etoro offers 80 cryptos worldwide, whereas Binance and OKX offer over 350 each. More isn&rsquo;t always better, however, and too many options can be confusing for new and experienced traders alike. But if you have your sights set on a particular cryptocurrency that&rsquo;s only available at a few exchanges, that&rsquo;s likely to drive your decision.</p><h3>Trading Fees and Additional Fees</h3><p>Many exchanges offer competitive fees if you use the advanced platform. However, the advanced platforms often look like a hacker&rsquo;s terminal, with numbers flashing in green and red and trades whooshing by. It&rsquo;s not a welcoming place for beginners. By contrast. simpler trading platforms often come with higher fees.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, using Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades will rack up $3.84 in fees to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin. By comparison, eToro, which also uses a simple trading interface, costs just $1 for the same $100 buying transaction.</p><p>Weigh trading fees in the context of how you&rsquo;ll use the platform. Low fees for advanced trading don&rsquo;t mean much if you think you&rsquo;ll only use the simple trading interface. But also consider other fees that may apply to how you trade. Among these may be deposit fees, withdrawal fees, and inactivity fees.&nbsp;</p><p>To use eToro as an example again, you won&rsquo;t pay a deposit fee, although conversion fees may apply if you&rsquo;re not depositing in USD. However, eToro has a $5 withdrawal fee and an <a href="https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/help/1835159142/what-happens-if-i-do-not-log-into-my-etoro-investment-account/"><u>inactivity fee</u></a> that kicks in after 12 months with no login. These are both easy to work with, but in some cases, additional fees can create a strong headwind.</p><h3>Crypto Wallet</h3><p>Centralized crypto exchanges and trading platforms offer a built-in crypto wallet, but it&rsquo;s not always obvious. In short, the exchange holds your crypto in a crypto wallet that they control. You access your funds through your account login.</p><p>Many exchanges also offer a separate wallet that allows you to send and receive supported cryptocurrencies or move cryptocurrencies off the platform. For example, Coinbase offers Coinbase Wallet, which supports Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs using a mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center"><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="coinbase crypto wallet dashboard" width="694" height="1392" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334236/coinbase-crypto-wallet.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Coinbase Wallet can be more complicated to set up, though, compared to simpler wallets like eToro&rsquo;s wallet, called eToro Money, or the Strike app, which serves as a Bitcoin Lightning wallet.</p><p>Some traders never need or want a separate crypto wallet, although two benefits of crypto wallets merit consideration.</p><p>Crypto wallets allow you to store your crypto in a wallet you control. The custodial exchange wallets on FTX were controlled by FTX. Customers who held balances on the exchange are now <a href="https://time.com/6236610/ftx-account-holders-money-back/"><u>unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy process</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto wallets allow you to put your crypto to use elsewhere. Crypto held on an exchange usually doesn&#8217;t do much. The price goes up and down, but you often can&rsquo;t use it to earn a yield. However, ETH, for example, can be moved off the exchange and used in decentralized finance&nbsp; (DeFi) applications like Lido or Balancer to earn yield with your crypto.</p><p>The availability of a crypto wallet with the platform&rsquo;s branding is of lesser importance than the ability to move your crypto off the platform to a crypto wallet of your choosing.</p><h3>Trading Tools &amp; Features</h3><p>Consider which tools you&rsquo;re likely to use when trading. OKX and Binance both offer trading bots, for example, which are rules-driven digital traders that work for you 24-7. You may not need these digital gizmos, but you might want access to advanced charts like the customizable TradingView charts on eToro (with 100 available indicators).&nbsp;</p><p>And there isn&rsquo;t always one answer. You might use OKX for its trading bots or Strike for its Bitcoin DCA, while also using eToro for its copy trading, which lets you copy money-making traders trade-for-trade.</p><h3>Available Payment Methods</h3><p>Sometimes, how you can pay for trades (and the fees for those payments) makes all the difference. eToro supports bank deposits, debit cards, and PayPal with no deposit fees. Coinbase also supports all these payment methods but charges a 2.5% fee on PayPal deposits and nearly 4% on debit card transactions.</p><p>Generally, bank transfers are the cheapest way to fund your trading account. But some platforms, like eToro, don&rsquo;t make you choose between convenience and costly deposit fees.</p><h3>Reputation and Customer Service</h3><p>Overall, crypto exchanges have a pretty spotty record when it comes to customer service. Check a rating site like Trustpilot before you make a move. But bear in mind that, like the insurance industry and many other financial services, the crypto industry tends to garner low customer satisfaction ratings.</p><p>Coinbase, for example, has a <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/coinbase.com"><u>1.5 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. Binance isn&rsquo;t much higher with its <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/binance.com"><u>2.1 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. These are two of the largest crypto exchanges on the planet. eToro is the standout in this group with an impressive <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.etoro.com"><u>4.4 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>.</p><p>Also, look for ways you can reach out if you have a question or problem. Many platforms offer chat or email support. A handful, like Coinbase, offer a customer service phone number.</p><h3>Mobile App&nbsp;</h3><p>Nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/"><u>60% of internet traffic</u></a> happens on mobile devices now, so a full-featured mobile app becomes a must for many traders. Both eToro and Coinbase offer mobile apps that closely match the trading experience you&rsquo;ll find on the desktop app.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro mobile app portfolio dashboard" width="700" height="1342" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334237/etoro-money-wallet.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p><br>Strike, on the other hand, is a mobile-first app, although there&rsquo;s also a Chrome extension available.&nbsp;</p><p>Check the App Store or Play Store ratings for the exchanges you&rsquo;re considering if you think you&rsquo;ll be accessing your trading account with a phone or tablet.</p><h2>Are Cryptocurrency Exchanges Legal?</h2><p>Crypto exchanges are legal in many parts of the world, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, but it&rsquo;s important to note that they&rsquo;re unregulated, meaning the chances of being covered by financial compensation schemes are very slim. However, centralized trading platforms are subject to certain regulations that share a common theme. In the US, for example, exchanges fall under the scope of the <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html"><u>Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</u></a>, which focuses on anti-money laundering (AML) and similar financial crimes. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered why you need to prove your identity before you can trade, AML and KYC (<a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/meaning-kyc"><u>Know Your Customer)</u></a> banking standards are at the heart of this requirement.</p><h3>US Cryptocurrency Laws</h3><p>In the US, cryptocurrencies fall under the purview of the SEC if they are securities. A security refers to a financial instrument in which there is an investment of money and in which the expected profits are due to the actions of someone else. For example, if you buy TSLA stock, your expected returns are based on the actions of Tesla&rsquo;s management and workers. TSLA is a security. Cryptocurrencies don&rsquo;t all share this third-party element, although the topic is a source of constant controversy with the SEC. The agency <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102"><u>sued Coinbase in 2023,</u></a> alleging the sale of unregistered securities, one of many such lawsuits.</p><p>Complicating the crypto scene in the US further, each of the US states has its own laws and licensing requirements. As a result, many crypto exchanges that operate in the US don&rsquo;t operate in all 50 states.</p><h3>UK Cryptocurrency Laws</h3><p>Trading crypto is legal in the UK, but <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-bill-2022-factsheets/fact-sheet-cryptoassets-technical"><u>exchanges that operate in the UK must register with the FCA</u></a> and comply with AML rules such as proof-of-identity requirements. The FCA also introduced <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-introduces-tough-new-rules-marketing-cryptoassets"><u>new rules regarding crypto marketing</u></a> designed to protect new investors.</p><h3>Australia Cryptocurrency Laws</h3><p>Crypto trading platforms operating in Australia <a href="https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/your-industry/digital-currency-cryptocurrency/digital-currency-exchange-providers"><u>must register with AUSTRAC</u></a>, the country&rsquo;s anti-money laundering authority. This brings with it the familiar identity verification requirements we see on most centralized exchanges. Exchanges also fall under the purview of the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/"><u>Australian Securities and Investments Commission</u></a> (ASIC), Australia&rsquo;s equivalent of the SEC in the US.</p><h3>Canada Cryptocurrency Laws</h3><p>In Canada, regulators see crypto assets as securities, a distinction still open to debate in the neighboring US. Like other securities, including stocks, cryptocurrencies are legal in Canada, although the country has enacted tougher rules regarding trading limits, prompting exchanges like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-will-proactively-withdraw-canada-2023-05-12/"><u>Binance to leave the Canadian market</u></a>. The <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/"><u>Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)</u></a> oversees crypto trading in Canada.</p><p>While trading cryptocurrencies is legal in many countries, it&rsquo;s prudent to stay up-to-date on the regulatory climate where you live, as well as which crypto exchanges may encounter trouble with local regulators. After the SEC sued Binance, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/banks-to-cut-off-binance-access-to-us-banking-system-exchange-says.html"><u>US-only exchange lost its banking partners</u></a>, causing temporary chaos in trading for USD-based trading pairs on the platform as there was no easy way to take USD off the exchange.wise</p><h2>Are Crypto Exchanges Safe to Use?</h2><p>No exchange or trading platform is 100% safe to use, but there are ways to reduce your risk. There&rsquo;s also a possibility of outsized gains that might make the risk worth taking. Between 2011 and 2021, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-vastly-outperformed-gold-and-sp-500-over-the-past-decade"><u>Bitcoin rewarded investors with more than 437,000% returns</u></a>.</p><p>First, it&rsquo;s important to understand that there&rsquo;s no government insurance available. The exception is pass-through insurance available on cash balances on platforms like eToro and Coinbase. In both cases, US customers enjoy pass-through FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) on cash balances of up to $250,000. However, crypto assets are not covered by FDIC insurance or any similar program. This theme is carried throughout the crypto industry. For example, eToro (UK) carries <a href="https://www.etoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Insurance-Disclosure-to-Clients-17.11.2020.docx.pdf"><u>Excess of Loss insurance</u></a>, which safeguards investors against broker insolvency. However, this policy excludes real cryptocurrencies.</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no insurance at all. Coinbase carries a policy that <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured"><u>insures against platform breaches</u></a>. But generally, your crypto assets are uninsured.</p><p>By choosing a platform that&rsquo;s regulated in major markets, such as eToro, Coinbase, Kraken, or Bitstamp, you&rsquo;ll have government regulators as allies, a set of well-trained eyes watching over the exchange. You can also look for crypto trading platforms that offer proof-of-reserves (POR) to verify the platform has your crypto. Kraken and OKX both offer POR.</p><p>Lastly, if you trade in size or as your account grows, you can consider moving your crypto to a self-custody wallet like MetaMask (Ethereum) or Electrum (Bitcoin). It comes down to the old adage about eggs and baskets. Moving some crypto off the exchange can reduce your risk if the exchange runs into trouble.</p><h2>Types of Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2><p>Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and brokers like eToro represent the most common way to buy crypto with traditional currencies. But what is a centralized exchange, and what is the alternative?</p><h3>Centralized Exchanges</h3><p>A centralized exchange (CEX) is a crypto trading platform run by a company that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Coinbase may be the most well-known example. When you trade on Coinbase, you&rsquo;re not trading directly with another trader. Instead, you&rsquo;re buying or selling against on order book, a list of open fixed-priced orders on the exchange.</p><p>Centralized exchanges offer a convenient way to convert fiat money, like USD or GBP, to cryptocurrency or to sell crypto for fiat currencies. But centralized exchanges also offer custodial storage, meaning they can hold your crypto for you on the exchange. Similarly, centralized exchanges typically offer ways for you to take your crypto off the exchange.</p><p>Centralization makes is easier to establish fiat on-ramps and off-ramps. In many cases, it also means the exchange may be subject to regulation in many jurisdictions. One potential downside, however, is that the exchange controls your crypto wallet on the exchange. They have the ability to pause or freeze withdrawals.</p><h3>Decentralized Exchanges</h3><p>Where centralized exchanges are run by management teams, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is run by software called smart contracts. A smart contract is a computer program on the blockchain that users can interact with to perform various transactions.</p><p>Instead of an order book, decentralized exchanges typically use liquidity pools. Crypto investors can deposit one or more types of crypto into a liquidity pool, and this pool and other traders use the pool to swap crypto A for crypto B.</p><p>Decentralized exchanges let you trade from within your own crypto wallet, so you don&rsquo;t have to deposit your crypto before making a swap. Swap fees typically come in low as well, often at 0.3% or lower.</p><p>To make swaps on a decentralized exchange, though, you&rsquo;ll need crypto to swap. In many cases, you can buy crypto through a third-party provider partnered with the DEX. Fees can be higher than using a centralized exchange, however.</p><p>Many traders buy on centralized exchanges and then transfer the crypto to a self-custody wallet where they can use their crypto for swaps, to provide liquidity (and earn trading fees), or in several other ways.</p><p>The most popular decentralized exchanges, including Uniswap and Balancer, run on the Ethereum network. Many also support Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum or Polygon.</p><h2>Buy Crypto Within Cash and Payment Apps</h2><p>Sometimes, the best crypto exchanges aren&rsquo;t exchanges at all. Several payment apps, including Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, provide a convenient way to buy popular cryptocurrencies. You won&rsquo;t find a massive selection of hundreds of choices, however. But if you&rsquo;re primarily interested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other cryptos, you may not need to learn a new platform. You can build your stack with an app you may already use daily.</p><h3>Cash App</h3><p>Cash App offers Bitcoin as its only crypto option, but the popular payment platform also offers over 1,800 stocks and exchange-traded funds.</p><p>Bitcoin trading fees on Cash App come in higher than you&rsquo;ll find on an advanced trading platform like Coinbase Advanced or Gemini Active Trader but compare well with user-friendly platforms like Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades.</p><p>For example, to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Cash App, you&rsquo;ll pay $2.25 in fees. Using Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades, you&rsquo;d pay $3.84 for the same purchase amount. <a href="https://cash.app/help/3103-bitcoin-fees">Cash App Bitcoin fees</a> range from 0.75% to 3%, depending on the transaction amount.</p><p>Cash App also provides a Bitcoin wallet, so you can send or spend your Bitcoin or move it to another crypto hardware wallet if needed.</p><h3>PayPal</h3><p>With a few more cryptocurrencies available, PayPal offers another way to buy popular crypto assets like Bitcoin. In total, PayPal offers five options.</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
<li>Bitcoin Cash</li>
<li>Ethereum</li>
<li>Litecoin</li>
<li>PayPal USD (PYUSD)</li>
</ul><p>Like Cash App, PayPal lets you withdraw your crypto to a separate crypto wallet.</p><p>PayPal used a fixed fee schedule to purchase crypto in amounts of $200 and under. At the lowest tier (up to $4.99), you&rsquo;ll pay $0.49. The cost to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin falls into the highest fixed fee tier at $2.49, or about 2.5%.</p><p>Above $200, fees range from 1.5% to 1.8%.</p><p>PayPal supports crypto purchases for personal accounts but disables the feature for business accounts.</p><h3>Venmo</h3><p>PayPal owns Venmo, and now both platforms offer the same lineup of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Crypto buying and selling fees parallel PayPal as well, with both platforms using a fixed fee schedule for purchases up to $200. A purchase for up $100 worth of Bitcoin costs $2.49 on Venmo.</p><p>Similar to Cash App, you&rsquo;ll need to use the mobile app to buy and sell crypto, however. The web app for both platforms offers limited functionality.</p><h2>How do Crypto Exchange Fees Work?</h2><p>Earlier in the guide, we discussed limit orders, market orders, and spreads. Here&rsquo;s how they all come together to determine crypto exchange fees.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Commission:</strong> Brokers like eToro charge a commission, which is another name for a trading fee. The difference, in eToro&rsquo;s case, for example, is that the commission is a fixed percentage of the order and does not change based on trading volume.</li>
<li><strong>Trading fees:</strong> Exchanges like OKX charge a trading fee based on the value of the trade and your trading volume (usually looking at a 30-day history). These trading fees might also differ depending on whether you place a market order or a limit order.
<ul>
<li><strong>Market orders</strong> (also called taker orders) mean you&rsquo;re buying at market price from the existing orders in the order book. On many exchanges, you&rsquo;ll pay a higher fee for market orders compared to limit orders (up next).</li>
<li><strong>Limit orders</strong> (also caller maker orders) mean you&rsquo;re placing an order at a fixed price. These orders sit on the order book until there&rsquo;s a match or a market order in the price range of your order. You&rsquo;ll usually pay a lower fee for limit orders, but there&rsquo;s also a chance that your buy or sell order might not be filled if the market price is too far away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Spreads: </strong>A spread refers to the price difference between the lowest price limit sell order and the highest price limit buy order. On busy exchanges and with high-volume cryptos like BTC, the spread is often just $0.01. However, we showed a screenshot earlier where the spread was $0.68. For BTC, which trades at over $26,000 currently, that $0.68 spread is still quite small, but for thinly traded cryptos, the spread can be much wider relative to the trading price, possibly causing a sub-optimal trade.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<h4>How Display Fees Work</h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s another type of fee structure you&rsquo;ll see on Coinbase&#8217;s simple trades or Kraken&rsquo;s simple trades, for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These easy-to-use trading boxes can come with much higher fees and often use complicated schedules that assign a different fee based on the value of the order and the payment method. Kraken, for instance, calls this a display fee, meaning you&rsquo;ll see it displayed before you make your trade.</p>
<p>Typically, trades with a display fee also bring an additional cost in the form of a spread. In this case, the spread may be much wider than you&rsquo;ll see in order-book spreads. Usually, the spread is in the quoted price, so it&rsquo;s not hidden, but it&rsquo;s also not shown precisely.</p>
<p>Always check the price for your trade &mdash; including spreads and fees &mdash; to be sure the trade still makes sense for you.</p>
</blockquote><p>There are a few other fees to watch out for, but not all exchanges charge these fees. Consider the big picture in regard to costs when choosing the best crypto exchange for your needs. A cryptocurrency trading platform with low trading fees might charge other fees that make trading costlier.</p><ul>
<li>Deposit fees</li>
<li>Withdrawal fees</li>
<li>Conversion fees</li>
<li>Inactivity fees</li>
</ul><p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Bitstamp with no trading fee. If your balance stays at $100 and you want to withdraw, you&rsquo;ll pay about $13 in withdrawal fees or about 13% of your investment&rsquo;s value. However, if you continue buying and your balance grows to $5,000, that same $13 fee drops to 0.26% of your investment&rsquo;s value.</p><p>Weigh how you&rsquo;ll use the platform and how additional fees might affect your trading cost on each of the crypto trading platforms you&rsquo;re considering.</p><h2>How to Use a Cryptocurrency Exchange &#8211; 5 Simple Steps</h2><p>When you&rsquo;re ready to buy cryptocurrency, you can follow these 5 simple steps. We chose <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> for this example because the onboarding process is smooth, the exchange is well-regulated, and crypto trading fees are a flat 1%. This winning combination makes eToro well-suited to new traders.</p><h3>Step 1: Open an Account</h3><p>Visit <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro.com</a> to open a trading account. Expect the basics here, like name and address as well as a username and password. You&rsquo;ll also need to provide a phone number for two-factor authentication via text message.</p><h3><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro create account" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334282/screenshot-from-2023-10-1.jpg" data-srcset=""></h3><h3>Step 2: Verify Your Identity and Address.</h3><p>To comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, you&rsquo;ll need to upload a copy of your proof of identity. Accepted forms of ID vary by country, so pay careful attention to the on-screen instructions. In the US, for example, you can use a passport or a valid driver&rsquo;s license.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose an Investment Amount.</h3><p>Think about how much you want to invest. On eToro, you can get started with just $10. Some traders might want to start with a larger amount because eToro also offers stocks and ETFs, which lets you build a diversified portfolio on one platform.</p><h3><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro fund account" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334239/etoro-choose-investment-amount.jpg" data-srcset=""><br>Step 4: Fund Your Account.</h3><p>Choose from PayPal, a bank account, or a debit card, and then link your account for deposits. eToro walks you through the simple steps to link your funding account. In some markets, like the UK, you may also be able to use Neteller or Skill as funding options.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 5: Make Your First Trade.</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s buy some Bitcoin. Look for the search at the top of the page and search for BTC or Bitcoin. If you&rsquo;re looking for something else, just search for the asset you want to trade.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve found what you want to trade, click on buy.</p><p>eToro includes the 1% buy/sell fee in the price, and your order is priced at the ask price we discussed earlier in the guide. Choose a purchase amount and then click on &ldquo;open trade.&rdquo;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="buy btc via etoro" width="634" height="719" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334240/etoro-buy-btc-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Easy enough. Now, your crypto position will show in your portfolio, which you&rsquo;ll find on the left menu. Optionally, you can set a &ldquo;take profit&rdquo; order for the position to lock in profits or a &ldquo;stop loss&rdquo; order to protect your downside.</p><h2>Why Trust Us</h2><p>Our editors are committed to independent and fair reviews. Wherever possible, we use the products or services we review to bring you a real-world perspective on the pros and cons of each.</p><p>For this exchange review, we made real trades with real money. This gives us the ability to speak knowledgeably about each aspect of the exchange and trading platforms reviewed from a user perspective.</p><p>When appropriate, we used a data-driven ranking system to determine which exchanges and trading platforms earned a spot.</p><h2>Our Methodology</h2><p>We evaluated dozens of different exchanges, trading platforms, and crypto trading apps.</p><p>The trading fees shown for each platform reflect the cost of trading at various volume tiers. Where possible, simple trading platforms and advanced trading platforms on the same exchange were also compared. Additionally, we compared the cost to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on each platform.</p><p>In this review of the best crypto exchanges, we looked for benefits that can help you save or make more money while also being mindful of features or limitations that may create a stumbling block for newer users. On each exchange, we used the advanced trading platform or simple trading platform, depending on which options were available, and compared the experiences.</p><p>The best crypto exchange in a given area may not have earned a top pick overall. In ranking the top exchanges, we considered the following criteria.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Simple trades:</strong> We evaluated both trading costs and ease of use for platforms that offered simple buy/sell widgets.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced trades</strong>: For platforms with advanced trading features, we weighed trading options as well as ease of use and charting ability.</li>
<li><strong>Available cryptocurrencies:</strong> Support for Bitcoin was mandatory, but we also evaluated the depth of available cryptocurrencies on each exchange and which other popular or trending cryptos were available.</li>
<li><strong>Overall trading costs:</strong> We considered other fees and expenses people may encounter, including deposit fees, withdrawal fees, inactivity fees, and spread costs.</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources for new investors:</strong> We weighed the educational content available on each platform as well as help tip placement near trading widgets that could be confusing for new users.</li>
<li><strong>Security features:</strong> We evaluated account security, custodial storage, and the ability to move crypto assets off the platform if needed.<br>Regulation: Where applicable, we detailed the regulatory agencies that oversee each exchange in major markets.</li>
</ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There&rsquo;s a trading platform available for nearly every trading style. Crypto trading platforms like Kraken and OKX give you room to grow as a crypto trader, but they can be trickier to use as a beginner. eToro, on the other hand, gives you the freedom to diversify your portfolio with crypto, stocks, and ETFs while using a familiar and easy-to-use interface on both desktop and mobile. But one of the top features is copy trading, which lets you copy the trades of successful traders on the platform. This strategy can eliminate the need for technical analysis before making a trade.&nbsp;</p><p>eToro also gives every trader a $100,000 demo account, which provides the perfect sandbox to learn crypto trading before you invest real money. And when you&rsquo;re ready to invest, eToro&rsquo;s flat 1% trading fee on crypto trades makes trading costs easy to understand.&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed">

If that&#8217;s not enough, active Best Wallet users become eligible for the $BEST token airdrop.</li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/youhodler/"><strong><u>YouHodler</u></strong></a> &#8211; This is is a top rated crypto wallet that comes with multi-chain support and 15% APY on certain coins.

Instead, users simply need to log into their eToro account to access their cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2142" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_2142_1138.jpg 2142w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_1200_637.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_900_478.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_720_382.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_600_318.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_300_159.jpg 300w"></figure><p>That said, eToro also offers a crypto wallet app for iOS and Android. This will appeal to investors wanting more control of their cryptocurrencies. For example, to send or receive funds via the blockchain. eToro supports a huge range of cryptocurrencies across many different networks. This includes Bitcoin, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, XRP, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, BNB, and many others.&nbsp;</p><p>The eToro wallet also allows investors to trade cryptocurrencies. The minimum trade requirement is just $10, or about 820 INR. Trading commissions amount to 1% of the trade size. eToro is also ideal for first-time investors that do not currently own cryptocurrencies. This is because its wallet supports fiat payments, including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Skrill, and bank wires.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1888" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_1888_1282.jpg 1888w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_1200_814.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_900_611.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_720_488.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_600_407.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88127/221409/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-05-32___media_library_original_300_203.jpg 300w"></figure><p>eToro will also appeal to long-term investors that prefer to have their crypto portfolios managed on their behalf. Its smart portfolio feature offers hand-picked baskets of cryptocurrencies. eToro rebalances each portfolio periodically based on broader market conditions. There are no additional fees, but smart portfolios require a minimum investment of $500, or about 41,000 INR.</p><p>Another popular feature of eToro is its in-built staking tool. This allows investors to automatically earn interest on their cryptocurrencies. Supported coins include Tron, Cardano, and Ethereum. eToro also offers a copy trading feature. This is another passive investment tool. But instead of investing in hand-picked portfolios, users will mirror the positions of a seasoned crypto trader.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1670" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1670_1120.jpg 1670w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1200_805.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_900_604.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_720_483.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_600_402.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312861/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_300_201.jpg 300w"></figure><p>We also like eToro for its customer service department.

Ledger &#8211; Cold Crypto Wallet Device for the Highest Security &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/">Ledger </a>is one of the best crypto wallets for Indian investors seeking the highest level of security. Launched in 2014, Ledger offers hardware devices that keep cryptocurrencies offline in cold storage. This is the safest way to store digital assets, as they are not exposed to hacking attacks. In fact, the Ledger wallet even remains offline when transferring funds.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because the wallet connects to mobile and desktop devices via a USB cable or Bluetooth. Moreover, outgoing transactions can only be confirmed on the device itself. This is achieved by entering a PIN, which the user creates when setting the Ledger device up. Ledger also provides users with a 24-word passphrase.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2718" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_2718_1210.jpg 2718w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_1200_534.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_900_401.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_720_321.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_600_267.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_300_134.jpg 300w"></figure><p>This is the private key for the wallet, so should be kept somewhere safe. Ledger also allows users to add a 25th word of their choosing &#8211; up to 100 characters. This means that even if a bad actor knows the 24-word passphrase, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to access the wallet. We also like that Ledger can be recovered remotely if the device is stolen.&nbsp;</p><p>Ledger comes with both a mobile and desktop app (Ledger Live) where users can monitor their crypto portfolios. The Ledger app also allows users to connect with third-party services such as 1inch DEX, MoonPay, and Lido staking. They provide a software wallet that can be connected to the hardware wallet for increased functionality.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_900_393.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_720_314.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_600_262.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_300_131.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Ledger is a major competitor to Trezor, another hardware wallet. It also offers three main products &#8211; Ledger Stax, Ledger Nano X, and Ledger Nano S Plus.

Trezor &#8211; Simple and Popular Hardware Wallet With High Levels of Security&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><u>Trezor</u></a> has been around for over 10 years now, is extremely well respected, and is simple to use while being very powerful. As a hardware wallet, Trezor is ahead of other hot wallets when it comes to security. Because the funds are kept in your physical Trezor device instead of online, it is much harder for them to be stolen.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334490/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334490/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_900_441.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334490/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_720_353.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334490/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_600_294.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334490/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_300_147.jpg 300w"></figure><p>So a major USP with Trezor is that the user has full ownership over all coins. Data is also anonymous, because when users login to web applications they are often far more vulnerable. Three versions are currently available &#8211;&nbsp; Model One, Trezor Safe 3, and the advanced Model T. These models can be compared on the site.</p><p>The beauty of Trezor is that it is very simple to set up and operate, but there are multiple optional add-on features that users can select depending on what they are looking for. For instance, it&#8217;s possible to create multiple wallets within Trezor, or take advantage of CoinJoin for increased privacy. A sign and verify features allows crypto addresses to be vetted, while the Tor browser is supported within the Trezor application. Plus, a whopping 8,000 coins and tokens are supported.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_900_372.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_720_298.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_600_248.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334491/responsive-images/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at___media_library_original_300_124.jpg 300w"></figure><p>For the Indian investors who are purely concerned with security, Trezor is definitely the way to go.

They operate much like a bank account, allowing Indians to store, send and receive funds. But unlike a bank account, crypto wallets are connected to the blockchain network.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that transactions are processed without the sender or receiver revealing their identity. Instead, wallet transactions are sent to a &#8216;public address&#8217;. This is similar to a bank account number. All crypto wallets come with a unique public address, and there is no limit to the amount that can be created.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto wallets also come with &#8216;private keys&#8217;. This provides access to the crypto wallet, much like a bank account password. Investors should never reveal their private keys to anyone. If they do, a bad actor can access the wallet and steal the cryptocurrency tokens being stored.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1280" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/finance-gf775d132b-1280.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_1280_853.jpg 1280w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_1200_800.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_900_600.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316028/responsive-images/finance-gf775d132b-1280___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w"></figure><p>As a decentralized technology, there is no third party to help recover stolen cryptocurrencies. Moreover, it is important that the private keys are kept somewhere safe but easily accessible. This is because the private keys will be needed if the user forgets the password to their wallet. If both the password <i>and</i> private keys are no longer available, the wallet cannot be recovered.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two different types of crypto wallets &#8211; non-custodial and custodian. Non-custodial wallets, otherwise referred to as &#8216;self custody&#8217;, give investors full control of their private keys. This means that third parties &#8211; including the wallet provider, cannot access the cryptocurrencies being stored. Non-custodial wallets are best suited for experienced crypto investors.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How do Crypto Wallets Work?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We will now explore how crypto wallets work in much more detail.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Public Address</strong></h3><p>All crypto wallets will come with a public address. This will be a unique, long string of numbers and characters. There is no harm in sharing a public address. On the contrary, the public address will need to be sent to the sender when receiving funds.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Suppose an Indian investor wants to buy Bitcoin from an online exchange</li><li>They buy 0.5 BTC and now want to withdraw the tokens to a private wallet for safekeeping</li><li>The investor would need to copy their public address from their wallet</li><li>They would then paste the address into the exchange platform when making the withdrawal</li><li>Once approved, the 0.5 BTC should arrive in the private wallet in 10-20 minutes</li></ul><p>The above example highlights that crypto transactions are not too dissimilar to bank account transfers. After all, the recipient will provide the sender with their account number so that they can receive funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Public wallet addresses, however, are long and complex.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of an online Bitcoin wallet address:</p><p><strong>3MgEAFWu1HKSnZ5ZsC8qf61ZW18xrP5pgd</strong></p><p>The above wallet address belongs to the crypto exchange <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okx/">OKX</a>, as per <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3MgEAFWu1HKSnZ5ZsC8qf61ZW18xrP5pgd">BitInfoCharts</a>. The blockchain is transparent, so we can see that the wallet currently holds over 31,551 BTC tokens, valued at almost $979 million.&nbsp;</p><p>The transparent nature of cryptocurrencies is something to bear in mind when sharing a wallet address. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3><p>Crypto wallets are protected by private keys. They provide full ownership of the wallet and any cryptocurrencies being stored.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if the user forgets the password to their wallet, they can regain access by typing in the private keys. The private keys do not need to be entered on the same device that the wallet is stored on.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, the wallet can be accessed at any time, anywhere, as long as the private keys are known. This should be a reminder that private keys should be kept safe in a secure location. Most crypto investors will write their private keys down.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of what a Bitcoin private key looks like:</p><p><strong>E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262</strong></p><p>As is evident, private keys are even more complex than public addresses. This increases the risk of making a mistake when writing them down. &nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2000" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_2000_1170.jpg 2000w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_1200_702.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_900_527.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_720_421.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_600_351.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/118605/316046/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-___media_library_original_300_176.jpg 300w"></figure><p>This is why the best crypto wallets in India provide users with a &#8216;backup passphrase&#8217; rather than the full private key. This is usually a string of 12 or 24 words. The passphrase must be written down in the correct order. Otherwise, they won&#8217;t work when attempting to recover a wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Custodianship</strong></h3><p>Understanding how custodianship works is also important when learning about crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>Non-custodial wallets do not have access to the user&#8217;s private keys. This information is only provided to the owner of the wallet, meaning the owner has full control over their funds.</p><p>Some investors in India do not feel comfortable taking the above risks. This is because of a lack of knowledge or experience of wallet security.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative option is to store cryptocurrencies in a custodial wallet. This will be controlled by a third party, which also presents risks. However, the best custodial wallet providers are regulated entities.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, eToro is regulated by bodies in the UK, Australia, Cyprus, and the US. The eToro custodial wallet also comes with solid security features. For example, eToro sends an SMS with a unique code when logging into the wallet. Without the code, access to the wallet is prohibited.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do You Need a Crypto Wallet? Key Reasons Explained&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Whether or not a crypto wallet is needed depends on the goals of the individual.</p><ul><li>For example, many Indian investors will buy cryptocurrencies from a regulated platform that does not offer non-custodial wallets.&nbsp;</li><li>This is because the platform will have its own centralized wallet that stores all client-owned cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li><li>This enables investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without actually needing a wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>As long as the chosen platform is credible, secure, and regulated &#8211; the cryptocurrencies will remain safe.&nbsp;</li><li>When the investor wishes to cash out back to INR, they can sell the cryptocurrencies and make a withdrawal to a bank account or debit/credit card.</li></ul><p>Some investors will want more control over their cryptocurrencies. For example, those wanting to send or receive funds via the blockchain will need a wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, if an investor does not want to trust a third-party custodian, they will need to choose a wallet that offers non-custodial storage. This means that only the investor has access to the private keys. And hence, they can transact freely without requiring approval from a custodian.</p><p>A private wallet is also required to invest in DeFi products. For example, earning interest on <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, Uniswap, or PancakeSwap.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Indian investors will need to consider their objectives and prior experience. In doing so, they can choose the best crypto wallet in India for their individual profile.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What are the Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets?</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Investors will need to choose between a software or hardware wallet. Both come with varying levels of security and convenience. For example, software wallets make it easy to transact but come with reduced security. While Bitcoin hardware wallets are much safer but are less convenient. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Still not sure how crypto wallets work? In this section, we discuss the different types of crypto wallets alongside their pros and cons.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Casual investors and active traders will be suited for a software wallet. These are &#8216;hot&#8217; wallets, meaning they are always connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>This increases the risks, considering that software wallets are not immune to hackers. This is why it&#8217;s important to pick a software wallet with adequate security features.&nbsp;</p><p>Software wallets come in many different forms. Desktop wallets, for example, can be downloaded to a laptop or PC. Mobile wallets come as mobile apps and offer added convenience.&nbsp;</p><p>Web wallets are also an option. These are offered by custodians like eToro and can be accessed from any desktop or mobile device with an internet connection.&nbsp;</p><p>Some wallets also offer a browser extension. This is also a convenient option but limits access to desktop devices. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Long-term investors and traders with large balances might opt for a crypto hardware wallet. This wallet type comes as a small physical device. The wallet only will need to confirm transactions on the device itself, usually via a PIN.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto hardware wallets are also known as &#8216;cold wallets&#8217;. This is because they are not connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this makes them immune to online hacking attempts. One of the best crypto hardware wallets is the Ledger Nano S Plus. This is available to buy for $79 directly from the <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger website</a>. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>Another way to keep cryptocurrencies in cold storage is a paper wallet. The wallet&#8217;s private keys are written or printed on a sheet of paper and then kept somewhere safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering that the private keys are always stored offline, hacking risks are alleviated. While paper wallets can be recovered remotely, the process can be cumbersome.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because the private keys will need to be manually imported into a software wallet. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tips for Selecting the Best India Bitcoin Wallet&nbsp;</strong></h2><blockquote><p>While the best India Bitcoin wallets come with solid security tools, investors should also consider other factors. For example, does the wallet offer additional features like staking or trading? Investors should also explore how user-friendly the wallet is and whether it&#8217;s suitable for their experience level. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Considering how many India crypto wallets there are, knowing which one to choose can be difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>We have created a checklist to help Indians choose the best crypto wallet for their needs.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>The first thing to check is what coins are supported by the crypto wallet. For example, Electrum only supports Bitcoin. Similarly, MyEtherWallet only supports Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Indians with a diversified portfolio might consider the Best Wallet. This supports Ethereum, Polygon, BNB and dozens of other popular cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/best-wallet.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_900_374.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_720_299.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_600_249.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333548/responsive-images/best-wallet___media_library_original_300_125.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Trust Wallet is also a good option for supported coins. It is compatible with over 70 blockchain networks and allows users to add custom tokens.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wallet Type</strong></h3><p>Indian investors should also think about the <i>type</i> of crypto wallet they prefer.&nbsp;</p><p>First, consider whether a custodial or non-custodial wallet is more suitable.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Inexperienced investors might prefer a custodial wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>Those wanting more control over their crypto tokens might be better suited for a non-custodial wallet.</li></ul><p>Additionally, investors should think about the device they want to store the wallet on. For example, Best Wallet offers a mobile app with the web app being built. While Ledger is available as a hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Desktop users might consider Exodus, as it supports over 50 blockchain networks and is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3><p>Investors should also ensure the crypto wallet aligns with their experience level.&nbsp;</p><p>Complete beginners might prefer a user-friendly custodial wallet like best Wallet. This is because no prior knowledge of wallet security is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>More experienced investors might prefer the OKX wallet. This offers non-custodial storage alongside MPC technology. It also supports cross-chain token swaps and staking.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3><p>Basic wallet functions are usually free, such as receiving and storing cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Software wallets are also free to download and maintain. But hardware wallets will come at a cost. For example, the Ledger Nano S Plus retails for $79. But the more advanced Ledger Stax costs over $279.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, check what fees apply when sending cryptocurrencies to another wallet. The GAS charges quoted should reflect the current blockchain fee.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Trading and Other Features</strong></h3><p>Indians should also explore what features the wallet comes with.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Indian Bitcoin wallets discussed today allow investors to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. But it&#8217;s important to assess what charges will apply for these services.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Best Wallet users who stake their coins will pay no fees to swap coins.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, MetaMask charges up to 5% when buying crypto with fiat money. This is also the case with Trust Wallet and Ledger.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for this is that these wallets use third parties for fiat transactions. eToro, on the other hand, handles payments directly &#8211; so is able to offer competitive fees. &nbsp;</p><p>Some investors in India will also look for wallets that support staking. This allows users to earn passive rewards without leaving the wallet. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Get and Use an India Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Ready to get started with a crypto wallet but need some guidance?</p><p>If so, follow the three-step walkthrough below to set up the Best Wallet mobile app. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download the Best Wallet app</strong></h3><p>Indian investors need to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">download the Best Wallet app</a> on the App Store or Google Play to use it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="323" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333558/bw7.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333558/responsive-images/bw7___media_library_original_323_700.jpg 323w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333558/responsive-images/bw7___media_library_original_300_650.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2: Open the Best Wallet App</strong></h3><p>Once you open the app, you&#8217;ll have to verify your email address. If you want to increase your app&#8217;s security, now is your chance. You&#8217;ll be asked to activate two-factor authentication. You can skip this step if you don&#8217;t want to, though. You can always activate this feature later on.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333557/bw4.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333557/responsive-images/bw4___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333557/responsive-images/bw4___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Regardless of whether you skip this step or activate 2FA, you will have to set up a four-digit password. If your device supports biometrics such as fingerprint or face ID, you can activate this feature as well.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Wallet</strong></h3><p>Create your main wallet, which is on the Ethereum blockchain. During this step, you can create multiple wallets and give them names, such as &#8220;Storage&#8221; or &#8220;NFT wallet&#8221;. You can also change the background color, so you can easily identify each wallet within the app.</p><p>Tap &#8220;Continue&#8221; when you&#8217;re done.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="341" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333556/bw3.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333556/responsive-images/bw3___media_library_original_341_700.jpg 341w, https://cimg.co/guide/118630/333556/responsive-images/bw3___media_library_original_300_616.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3><p>With your wallet set up, you can now buy coins with a card or you can receive coins from exchanges or your other wallets. The Best DEX is available for you to start swapping coins and using the wallet.

A good starting point is to differentiate between custodial and non-custodial wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>If the investor opts for a custodial wallet, then they must do some due diligence on the custodian itself. For example, most custodians are <i>unregulated</i> exchanges. This option should be avoided.&nbsp;</p><p>If the investor opts for a non-custodial wallet, then they will be responsible for keeping the cryptocurrencies and private keys safe.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If the private keys are misplaced and end up in the wrong hands, the cryptocurrencies will likely be stolen</li><li>If the investor forgets their password and no longer has access to the private keys, the cryptocurrencies in the wallet will be lost forever&nbsp;</li></ul><p>To reduce the risk of losing access to the non-custodial wallet, look for providers that offer the following security features:</p><ul><li>Multisig permissions, which require transactions to be approved from two or more wallets. This removes a single point of failure.&nbsp;</li><li>A single point of failure can also be avoided by using an <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/mpc-wallet">MPC wallet</a>. This splits the private key across multiple locations.&nbsp;</li><li>Cold storage wallets will keep the private keys offline at all times, removing their exposure to live servers.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ultimately, if the investor has a significant amount of cryptocurrency to hand, cold wallets are the best option.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><p>As cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming popular in India, investors now have many options when selecting a wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the best crypto wallet in India is Best Wallet. Access the wallet via its iOS or Android app and swap coins between multiple blockchains. Future releases will include market insights, crypto news and token analytics, which will make Best Wallet the most powerful Web3 wallet. &nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison"><strong>https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/298361"><strong>https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/298361</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain"><strong>https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/"><strong>https://pancakeswap.finance/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://opensea.io/"><strong>https://opensea.io/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://aave.com/"><strong>https://aave.com/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okx/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okx/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3MgEAFWu1HKSnZ5ZsC8qf61ZW18xrP5pgd"><strong>https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3MgEAFWu1HKSnZ5ZsC8qf61ZW18xrP5pgd</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/6512619-using-mew-offline-current-mew-version-6"><strong>https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/6512619-using-mew-offline-current-mew-version-6</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mew-crypto-wallet-defi-web3/id1464614025"><strong>https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mew-crypto-wallet-defi-web3/id1464614025</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myetherwallet.mewwallet&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US"><strong>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myetherwallet.mewwallet&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/mpc-wallet"><strong>https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/mpc-wallet</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-gb/glossary/kyc"><strong>https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-gb/glossary/kyc</strong></a></li></ul><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>What crypto wallets are available in India?</strong></h4><p>Many crypto wallets are available in India, and some of the best include Best Wallet, YouHodler, Ledger, and Trust Wallet. &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Is Trust Wallet safe in India?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Trust Wallet is a safe, non-custodial wallet offering decentralized storage to many Indian crypto traders. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Is MetaMask available in India?</strong></h4><p>Yes, MetaMask is available in India and remains one of the most popular non-custodial wallets in the market.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What is the best crypto wallet for Indian traders?</strong></h4><p>The best crypto wallet for Indian traders is Best Wallet, available on iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

So what games does the Mega Dice Telegram casino support? Well, it&#8217;s considered one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-slots-sites.htm">best Bitcoin slots sites</a>, with top-rated games like Gates of Olympus and Wanted Dead or a Wild available. Other popular slot games include Book of Ra Deluxe and Sweet Bonanza.&nbsp;</p><p>These slot games are provided by licensed casino developers, so safety and legitimacy is assured. Moreover, unlike other Telegram gambling games, users get to enjoy a fully immersive experience. This is because Telegram has integrated a live video feed into its Telegram bot.

This includes blackjack, roulette, and other casino staples. What&#8217;s more, live dealer tables can also be accessed.

Wall Street Memes Casino &#8211; New Telegram Casino Offers 200% Welcome Bonus + 200 Free Spins</strong></h3><p>The next Telegram bot on our list is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wsmcasino/">Wall Street Memes Casino</a> &#8211; a newly launched casino and sports betting platform. By using the Telegram bot, Wall Street Memes Casino gives users no-KYC access to the casino platform and offers instant deposits and withdrawals.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Wall Street Memes Casino bonus offer" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126508/334431/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>The casino has been launched by Wall Street Memes &#8211; a popular meme platform with over 1 million followers.

<div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration: none;color: white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wsmcasino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">Visit Wall Street Memes Casino</a></div>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4. WeathersBot &#8211; Get Localized Weather Updates in any City 24/7</strong></h3><p>One of the best Telegram bots for weather updates is WeathersBot. This completely free-to-use bot offers a user-friendly and reliable service around the clock. After joining the <a href="https://t.me/WeathersBot" rel="nofollow">WeathersBot Telegram chat</a>, the user will be asked to type in their location. This can be the city, town, postcode, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Each weather update will cover various metrics, such as the temperature, wind speed, and precipitation estimate. This is in addition to a general overview of local weather conditions. Best of all, WeathersBot allows users to set up custom notifications. This will come through as a Telegram alert.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Weathersbot Telegram bot" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323011/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Notifications can be set daily, or over a 5/10-day period. Moreover, we like that WeathersBot can be added to another Telegram group. For example, friends planning a trip can add the bot to a custom group, showing daily weather updates for their destination.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5. File Converter &#8211; Convert Various File Types Directly in the Telegram App</strong></h3><p>Another use case for Telegram bots is file conversions. Rather than needing to use a desktop device, files can now be converted directly in the Telegram app. One of the best Telegram bots for this purpose is <a href="https://t.me/newfileconverterbot">File Converter</a>. Not only does File Converter support images but videos and audio too. We like that users are not required to specify the type of file that they want to convert.&nbsp;</p><p>On the contrary, users can click on the attach button and upload the file to the chat box. File Convert will automatically detect the file type. Users will then be given a range of options for the output file. For example, after uploading a JPG image to File Converter, we can convert it to a JPEG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, TIF, TIFF, GIF, ICO, PDF, or OCR.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="File Converter Telegram bot" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323012/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Users can set their preferred file type by clicking on the respective button. After clicking on &#8216;PNG&#8217;, the Telegram bot got to work. In fact, it took less than five seconds for the file conversion to complete. We can then click on the &#8216;Download&#8217; button to download the new file directly to our smartphone device.&nbsp;</p><p>Although File Converter is free to use, it does come with usage limitations. For instance, all users start with 30 credits. 1 credit is required to convert a file. File Converter relies on donations to keep its bot operational.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>6. Hangbot &#8211; Play Hangman Games With Friends on Telegram</strong></h3><p>Looking to play games with a bunch of friends on the Telegram app? If so, Hangbot is one of the best Telegram bots for groups. This Telegram bot replicates the popular Hangman game. Two or more players are required and the bot is completely free to use.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s how it works; After joining the <a href="https://telegram.me/hangbot" rel="nofollow">Hangbot Telegram chat</a> and starting a new game, it will generate a secret word. For instance, suppose the word is &#8216;Enterprise&#8217;. Players will only see the word displayed like this; &#8216;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&#8216;. In other words, 10 blank spaces.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Hangbot Telegram game" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323015/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Player 1 will then need to guess one letter from the secret word. We&#8217;ll say they opt for &#8216;E&#8217;. As the secret word contains the letter E, it will now look like this; &#8216;E&#8211;e&#8212;&#8211;e&#8217;. The player will then be given the opportunity to guess the complete word.&nbsp;</p><p>On Hangbot, players can type their guess and send it as a message. If correct, the player wins the game. If not, they lose a life. Lives are also lost if the player guesses a letter incorrectly. Hangbot is a free Telegram bot but it requires at least two players.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>7. EspressoBot &#8211; Create a New Cryptocurrency in Minutes via Text Prompts&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>One of the most innovative <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-bot-tokens.htm">Telegram bot tokens</a> in the market is <a href="https://t.me/espressoTGbot" rel="nofollow">EspressoBot</a>. This bot allows complete novices to create their own cryptocurrency. Zero knowledge of coding or programming is needed. Instead, EspressoBot creates a new cryptocurrency based on text prompts.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, the user will initially be asked for the name of their custom cryptocurrency. Additional questions will follow, such as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s ticker symbol, supply, burning mechanism, and tax structure.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="EpressoBot account set up" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323016/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>After confirming the fundamentals, EspressoBot will then create the cryptocurrency, alongside its unique smart contract. EspressoBot cryptocurrencies are owned solely by the user. Moreover, the cryptocurrency will be an ERC20 token, meaning it operates on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum blockchain</a>. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>8. AirTrack &#8211; Find the Cheapest Flight Deals for Any Destination</strong></h3><p><a href="https://t.me/airtrack_bot" rel="nofollow">AirTrack</a> is one of the best Telegram bots for travel. In a nutshell, this Telegram bot helps users to find the cheapest flight deals in the market. Everything is automated and updated in real-time. After joining the AirTrack Telegram chat, users will be asked for details of their itinerary.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, this includes the departure and arrival airports, and whether it&#8217;s a single or return ticket. Users will then be asked for their preferred travel dates. A few seconds later, AirTrack will display the best-priced flights, alongside a link to where users can purchase tickets.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="AirTrack flight tracker Telegram bot" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323017/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>AirTrack comes with plenty of other innovative features. For example, after setting the flight parameters, users can click the &#8216;Track Prices&#8217; button. This will send a notification to the user when prices go up or down.&nbsp;</p><p>Users can set the frequency at which they receive alerts. For instance, hourly or daily. Although AirTrack is free to use, it also offers a premium service. This costs just $12 per year and includes alerts on the best flight deals. It also comes with 24/7 customer support.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>9. Poker Bot &#8211; Play Live Poker With Over 670,000 Other Users&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>One of the best Telegram bots for playing poker is Poker Bot. This free-to-use Telegram bot specializes in Texas Hold &#8217;em games. After joining the <a href="https://telegram.me/PokerBot" rel="nofollow">Poker Bot Telegram</a> chat, users will be given 1,500 virtual chips.&nbsp;</p><p>These chips are used to place bets in live poker games. That said, Poker Bot lacks when it comes to interactiveness, as it uses emojis and text for each hand. Although this initially slows the pace of the game, the system works well once players understand how things work.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Poker Bot gambling " data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323019/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>For example, after reviewing their hole cards, players can call, raise, or fold. The specific move is given as a text command. The bot will then ask the next player to make their move. Poker Bot also has a leaderboard that displays the best-performing players, based on their chip count.&nbsp;</p><p>Those looking to gamble with cryptocurrencies rather than virtual funds might consider Mega Dice, which is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-casinos.htm">best Telegram casinos</a> for 2023. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>10. Babelgram &#8211; Instantly Translate Telegram Messages Across Dozens of Languages&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://telegram.im/@babelgrambot" rel="nofollow">Babelgram</a> is one of the most popular Telegram bots around, with more than 60,000 people subscribed to its channel. Put simply, this is the best Telegram bot for translation services. Unlike other bots in this niche, Babelgram translates messages in real-time.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, suppose a German speaker joins a Telegram group that is denominated in English. After configuring their settings, all English messages will instantly be translated to German in real-time. Not only that, but Babelgram also works in reverse.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Babelgram language translation bot" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323022/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>This means that when the German speaker sends a message in their native tongue, it will be posted to the Telegram group in English. Babelgram is completely free but users are required to join its main Telegram group to access the bot.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>11. Taskobot &#8211; Streamline Tasks and Reminders via the Telegram App&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Taskobot is one of the best Telegram apps for setting reminders. Users can ditch their diaries and instead input tasks directly on the Telegram app. After joining the <a href="https://t.me/tasko_bot">Taskobot Telegram chat</a>, users can click on the &#8216;New Personal Task&#8217; button.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, they can type in the task that they want to be reminded of. For instance, &#8216;Go for a Run&#8217;. Users can then set the time and date for the event. In doing so, Taskobot will log the request and send a notification when the specified time and date arrives.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Taskobot setting up tasks" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323023/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Additionally, Taskobot is useful for teams. This is because the bot can be added to custom Telegram groups. Before getting starting, users should configure their preferred timezone, as the bot is unable to detect this automatically.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>12. CryptoBot &#8211; Buy and Sell Crypto on Telegram Without Using an Exchange &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>One of the best Telegram bots for cryptocurrency investors is CryptoBot. No longer do investors need to use an exchange to buy and sell tokens. Instead, CryptoBot brings the cryptocurrency markets to Telegram.&nbsp;</p><p>After joining the <a href="https://t.me/CryptoBot">CryptoBot Telegram</a> chat, users can click on the &#8216;Exchange&#8217; button, followed by &#8216;Exchange Now&#8217;. CryptoBot will then list a range of pairs, such as &#8216;ETH/USDT&#8217;, &#8216;BTC/USDT&#8217;, and &#8216;BUSD/USDT&#8217;. After clicking on the preferred pair, CryptoBot lists real-time order books. &nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Crypto Bot cryptocurrency exchange" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323024/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>For each exchange rate, it displays the amount of liquidity available at that specific price point. Should the user want to proceed, they can swap tokens instantly. But first, users need to fund their CryptoBot wallet.</p><p>Users simply need to transfer cryptocurrency to their unique wallet address, which is provided by CryptoBot. The CryptoBot exchange service is completely decentralized. There is no requirement to open an account or provide any personal details.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>13. Chess Exercises &#8211; Puzzle-Style Games for Chess Players &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Chess fans might find that <a href="https://t.me/chessexercisesbot" rel="nofollow">Chess Exercises</a> is the best Telegram bot for 2023. This is a puzzle-style game that can be played solo or with friends. The bot will initially post an image of a chessboard. This will be a screengrab from a game that is mid-way through.&nbsp;</p><p>Chess Exercises will then ask the user what move the player should make. While there isn&#8217;t a right or wrong decision per se, the most favorable move is determined by statistical probability. If the player guesses correctly on the first attempt, they will be awarded points.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Chess Exercises chess bot" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323025/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>The long-term objective is to accumulate points and climb the global leaderboard. Players will be given a second attempt if they guess incorrectly. Players can also ask for the solution if they aren&#8217;t sure &#8211; this will save the player from losing points. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>14. Quizarium &#8211; Multiplayer Telegram Quiz Game With Custom Topics &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-telegram-games.htm">best Telegram games</a> for quiz fans is <a href="https://telegram.me/QuizariumBot" rel="nofollow">Quizarium</a>. This free Telegram bot allows friends to play quiz games directly on the Telegram app. Players will first need to create a custom Telegram group and manually add the bot.&nbsp;</p><p>To start a new game, players need to instruct the bot on what topics they want to cover. For example, music or science. Players can also choose the number of questions in each round. The bot will then post questions as a Telegram message.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Quizarium Telegram quiz bot" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323026/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Players will need to reply to the message with their answer in the fastest time possible. Quizarium awards points for each correct answer. Players can also aim to make the global rankings board. This ranks players based on the number of correct answers on a daily and weekly basis.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What are Telegram Bots?</strong></h2><p>Telegram bots are increasingly becoming popular, but what exactly are they? In simple terms, Telegram bots are pre-programmed algorithms that replicate specific tasks. They are created by independent developers, rather than Telegram itself. Moreover, users engage with Telegram bots via a chat box.</p><p>Each Telegram bot will serve a certain purpose. For example, the Mega Dice Telegram bot facilitates online gambling. It&#8217;s a regulated casino that now offers its services on the Telegram app. So, those using the Mega Dice Telegram bot can gamble cryptocurrencies on casino games like blackjack and plinko.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Mega Dice Telegram casino" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323027/screenshot-2023-08-09-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Then there&#8217;s &nbsp;WeathersBot, which provides Telegram users with real-time weather updates. Users simply need to type in their location and WeathersBot offers a localized weather summary. In another example, File Convert is a Telegram bot that allows users to convert images, video, and audio. For instance, converting a JPEG file into a PNG. &nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>Irrespective of the use case, Telegram bots operate autonomously. This means that the bot is not able to &#8216;think&#8217;, much like artificial intelligence. Instead, the Telegram bot can only follow the pre-defined conditions it has been programmed to follow. Nonetheless, Telegram bots are usually free to use, so there is no harm in seeing what&#8217;s out there.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><h2><strong>Why Use Telegram Bots?</strong></h2><p>Telegram bots come in many different shapes and sizes. The use cases will vary widely depending on the individual&#8217;s requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s explore why Telegram bots are becoming so popular.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Automation</strong></h3><p>One of the main benefits of Telegram bots is that they can automate manual tasks. The possibilities are endless in this regard.&nbsp;</p><p>Take Babelgram as a prime example. This Telegram bot allows users to chat on Telegram in any language of their choosing. Everything is automated, so there is no need to keep copying and pasting translations on a third-party website.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, suppose the user speaks English but wants to join a Japanese Telegram group. If they type &#8216;Hello, Good Afternoon&#8217; into the group, the Babelgram bot will automatically translate the message into Japanese. And when users reply in Japanese, the Babelgram bot will show the message in English.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, File Converter automates the file conversion process. Once again, rather than using a third-party website, users can convert files within the Telegram app. For example, suppose the user has an MP3 file on their smartphone. By directly uploading it to File Converter, the user can instantly convert it to a WAV file.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Privacy and Anonymity&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Privacy sits at the heart of the Telegram app. Unlike other social platforms like Facebook and Twitter, Telegram does not collect or sell user data. In fact, users are not even required to provide Telegram with their name. Instead, Telegram offers an anonymous service.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that the best Telegram bots can also be accessed anonymously. For example, the Mega Dice Telegram bot allows users to gamble without revealing their identity or needing to upload any KYC documents. This will appeal to those that want to gamble privately.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Mega Dice crypto wallet" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323032/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>This is in stark contrast to traditional online casinos, which are legally required to collect a government-issued ID from players. But because Mega Dice only deals with cryptocurrencies on Telegram, players can avoid the KYC procedure completely.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Real-Time Information</strong></h3><p>Telegram bots are also useful for obtaining real-time information from the internet. This can be achieved without needing to manually search for data. Some Telegram bots even allow users to set their own preferences on which data to receive and when.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>For example, AirTrack is one of the best Telegram bots for finding cheap flights.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Users can set their departure and arrival airports and the required flight dates.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Initially, AirTrack will scan the internet to find the lowest-priced seats available.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Users will also receive notifications if the price declines.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Ordinarily, users would need to manually check flight prices frequently &#8211; so AirTrack simplifies the process. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Socialization and Collaboration&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Just like WhatsApp, Telegram is one of the best apps for staying in touch with friends and families. Many of the Telegram bots discussed today can be imported into group chats. This means that Telegram bots promote socialization.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Hangbot game can be played by two or more friends on Telegram. This is a simple Hangman-style game that requires players to guess hidden words. There are no time limits on Hangbot, so friends can make their move at their own pace.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>Telegram bots also promote collaboration between colleagues and team members. For instance, Taskobot allows teams to streamline tasks and objectives through real-time reminders and notifications. The bot could be added to a work-related project to help team members stay on track. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><h3><strong>Free-to-Use&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The best Telegram bots are completely free to use. Most developers make bots for their own enjoyment. While some developers will ask for donations to help keep the bot operational, this isn&#8217;t mandatory.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, users can try as many Telegram bots as they want without needing to pay any money. We also like that Telegram bots do not display ads. This is usually the case when downloading a free app from the App Store or Google Play.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Types of Bots on Telegram</strong></h2><p>There are many different types of bots available on Telegram. As such, there is something to suit all requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s explore the different types of Telegram bots in the market right now.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Gaming Bots</strong></h3><p>Some of the best Telegram bots are aimed at gamers. For instance, we discussed Hangbot earlier, which is a Hangman-style gaming bot. We also discussed Quizarium, which allows users to play quiz games with their friends.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, Telegram group bots do come with their limitations. This is because most bots use text and emojis, which often means a sub-par gaming experience.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>For example, Poker Bot is a free gaming bot that allows users to play poker.&nbsp;</li>
<li>But instead of hands being played in real-time,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Poker Bot uses a turn-based approach. Initially, the player will see their own cards as emojis.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They will then need to manually type their next move.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For instance, /raise or /fold. The game remains stagnant until the next player takes their turn.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Nonetheless, Telegram bots are not designed to replace conventional gaming consoles. Instead, they offer a free and convenient way to enjoy games on the Telegram app, either solo or with friends.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Gambling Bots</strong></h3><p>Telegram bots look set to revolutionize the online gambling industry. Instead of opening an account with a regular online casino, players can now gamble on the Telegram app.&nbsp;</p><p>Put simply, Mega Dice is by far the best Telegram bot for gambling. As we mentioned earlier, Mega Dice is the only licensed casino bot on Telegram. It supports popular casino games like roulette and blackjack via a live pop-up window.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Mega Dice Blackjack" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323029/screenshot-2023-08-08-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>As per the image above, the Mega Dice Telegram casino even supports human dealers. After choosing a table, users will place bets on the Telegram app and the dealer will action it in real-time. This offers a far more enjoyable gambling experience than playing with Telegram emojis. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Trading Bots&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Trading bots are also becoming popular on the Telegram app. A good example is CryptoBot. This Telegram bot allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without leaving the Telegram app.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p><ul>
<li>First, users join the CryptoBot Telegram chat to reveal their unique wallet address.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Users transfer cryptocurrencies to this address and wait a few minutes for the balance to update. CryptoBot will send a notification on Telegram when this happens.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Then, users can select the cryptocurrency that they want to buy.&nbsp;</li>
<li>After finalizing the request, CryptoBot will complete the swap on behalf of the user.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Just like gambling bots, the appeal here is that users can trade cryptocurrencies privately. No accounts are required, so users don&#8217;t need to worry about a cumbersome <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-gb/glossary/kyc">KYC process</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Information Bots</strong></h3><p>Some Telegram bots specialize in real-time information services. This removes the need for users to manually search the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we mentioned earlier that WeathersBot provides real-time weather updates to users. Once the local city is selected, users will receive daily forecasts directly on the Telegram app. Users can also set up notifications. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, some Telegram bots alert users when their preferred news website publishes a new article. This enables users to remain up-to-date on specific niches and markets.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Educational Bots</strong></h3><p>Telegram bots can also be used for educational purposes. This is especially the case when learning a new language.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, PronunciationBot can instantly convert words into audio across dozens of languages. This helps users to learn the correct pronunciation of specific words and phrases.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, WordBot is great for understanding the meaning of words. By typing in a word, the Telegram bot instantly gives its definition.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Find Bots on Telegram</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>There are thousands of bots on Telegram across every niche imaginable. But finding the best Telegram bots requires a bit of legwork. There is no centralized database or filters on Telegram, so the only way to find a bot is by searching for its username.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><p>Here are some tips on how to find the best bots on Telegram.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Use Keywords to Manually Find Bots</strong></h3><p>Users with a specific requirement in place can try and find a suitable bot manually. First, open the Telegram app and click on the &#8216;Chat&#8217; icon.</p><p>Click on the &#8216;Search&#8217; icon and type in the required bot function. For example, in the image below, we have searched for &#8216;Weather&#8217;. It then shows us Telegram usernames related to our search. We can then see that WeathersBot is displayed, which is the weather forecast bot we discussed earlier.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Weather Telegram bots" width="934" height="1231" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122048/323031/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>While this method sometimes works, it depends on how common the keyword is. For example, searching for &#8216;Games&#8217; will bring up a significant number of results. Being more specific will have a more effective outcome. For example, &#8216;Chess Game&#8217; or &#8216;Blackjack Game&#8217;. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Join the /TelegramBots Subreddit&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TelegramBots/">/TelegramBots Subreddit</a> is also worth exploring. With over 30,000 members, this Subreddit group is specifically aimed at Telegram bots.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, when a developer has built a new bot, they will often let the group know. Group members can then test the bot out and leave some feedback.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Use Third-Party Websites&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>There are many third-party websites that offer a real-time directory of the best Telegram bots. <a href="https://telegramchannels.me/bots">TelegramChannels</a> is a great option in this regard. This website offers information on hundreds of Telegram bots. It also has filters so that users can find their preferred bot type.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, users can choose to view bots related to betting, finance, marketing, games, and dozens of other metrics. Moreover, TelegramChannels allows users to rate each Telegram bot. This helps others assess whether or not the bot is worth trying.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Are Telegram Bots Safe?</strong></h2><p>Most Telegram bots offer a safe and private experience. Crucially, users are not required to hand over any personal information when using a Telegram bot. In fact, this is also the case when joining Telegram itself &#8211; as the app only requires a mobile number.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Telegram bots are generally free to use. So there isn&#8217;t a requirement to spend money on a bot before trying it. Nor is there a need to enter any sensitive financial details, like credit card or bank account numbers.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>While privacy is a hot commodity on Telegram, it also presents challenges. For example, scammers are prevalent on the Telegram app, not least because they can operate anonymously. So if a Telegram bot asks for personal information &#8211; delete it immediately.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><p>Moreover, avoid clicking on any links when using a Telegram bot &#8211; they could be a virus. Restricting private messages from unknown users is also worth considering. This will prevent scammers from being able to make direct contact. This can be switched on in the Telegram settings. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>In summary, we have discussed some of the best Telegram apps to try today. One of the top picks is TG.Casino, which is a fully licensed Telegram casino. Users do not need to complete any KYC registration, and can access this online casino directly through the Telegram app.&nbsp;</p><p>The casino has also just listed its native token, $TGC, on presale. The token is used to get exclusive access to casino games, and earned as rewards. $TGC is currently priced at $0.125 on presale.</p><div class="raw-html-embed">

Best Wallet &#8211; Overall Best Wallet for Storing and Managing ERC20 Tokens &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We rank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet">Best Wallet</a> as the overall best ERC20 wallet as it has a built-in decentralized exchange that supports trading for all <a href="https://bitpay.com/blog/erc-20-tokens-what-they-are-and-how-they-are-used/">450,000+ ERC20 tokens</a> plus those on other chains such as the Binance Smart Chain.</p><p>The decentralized, non-custodial, multi-chain wallet also has features that other wallets don&#8217;t have, making it more than just a destination to trade and store tokens.</p><p>As well as the built-in DEX it has other DeFi features, made possible through holding native ERC20 token $BEST &#8211; which is launching soon. The token offers staking rewards and also entitles holders to get reduced fees when trading other tokens.</p><p>Best Wallet also features unique insights into trending crypto projects, airdrops and NFT collections and offers early access into new token ICOs and presales.</p><p>Moreover, we like that Best Wallet comes packed with security tools &#8211; this includes biometrics and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-multifactor-authentication-e5e39437-121c-be60-d123-eda06bddf661">multi-factor authentication</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Best Wallet users can swap ERC20 tokens instantly without leaving the wallet. Users can also stake tokens to earn passive rewards. While Best Wallet also supports fiat payments, users should be aware that a 4% fee will apply. Nonetheless, payments are processed by a <a href="https://wert.io/fiat-onramp">regulated entity</a>, Wert &#8211; licensed in the US and EU.</p><p>Best Wallet also supports Bitcoin, Dash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and many other leading cryptocurrencies. This is a decentralized wallet, so users can store, send, and receive ERC20 tokens anonymously. Only the user has access to their private keys, which gives full control of the cryptocurrencies stored.&nbsp;</p><p>The wallet has only just launched and not all features are live at the time of writing. However, $BEST tokens will be airdropped to active users in the near future, with 10% of the max supply to be distributed.</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of ERC20 Wallet</strong></td><td><strong>Custodianship</strong></td><td><strong>Supported Coins</strong></td><td><strong>Fee to Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></td><td><strong>App?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest Rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>Non-custodial</td><td>All ERC20 tokens and cross-chain functionality.&nbsp;</td><td>Determined by third-party, WERT&nbsp;</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes, in-built staking tools and staking of $BEST</td><td>TBC</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Overall best ERC20 wallet for 2023</li><li>Compatible with <i>all</i> ERC20 tokens &#8211; even those unlisted&nbsp;</li><li>Built-in DEX and multi-chain functionality&nbsp;</li><li>Unique insights into new crypto projects, NFTs, airdrops</li><li>Early access to new tokens and reduced fees</li><li>$BEST token airdrop</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Not all features are live at the time of writing &nbsp;</li></ul><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. eToro &#8211; Web and Mobile Wallet Backed by a Regulated Exchange &nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro">eToro</a> is the next best ERC20 wallet to consider and the best custodial one. This wallet provider is backed by an established exchange with multiple tier-one licenses. Regulation is from FINRA (US), ASIC (Australia), FCA (UK), and CySEC (Cyprus). This ensures that the ERC20 tokens are kept secure by a reputable provider that takes regulation seriously. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The eToro wallet is custodial, so investors do not need to secure their own private keys. eToro has a 24/7 risk management team in place, and it keeps the majority of cryptocurrencies in cold wallets. Moreover, two-factor authentication is required to access the wallet. We also like that the eToro wallet is accessible online and via its native app for iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2142" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_2142_1138.jpg 2142w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_1200_637.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_900_478.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_720_382.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_600_318.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222670/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-00-31___media_library_original_300_159.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Both options are user-friendly and come packed with features. For example, users can stake tokens automatically without needing to opt in. eToro distributes up to 90% of the staking rewards directly into the user&#8217;s wallet. eToro also offers an exchange that supports crypto-to-fiat pairs. This means that users can trade ERC20 tokens against the US dollar.&nbsp;</p><p>What&#8217;s more, eToro supports fiat deposits via debit/credit cards and e-wallets. There are no fees charged when making the deposit in US dollars (0.5% for other currencies). Additionally, the eToro wallet supports copy trading. This is an innovative tool that allows users to replicate an experienced crypto trader. All positions will be copied automatically at a proportionate amount. &nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of ERC20 Wallet</strong></td><td><strong>Custodianship</strong></td><td><strong>Supported Coins</strong></td><td><strong>Fee to Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></td><td><strong>App?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest Rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Web wallet and mobile app</td><td>Custodial</td><td>90+ cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, and a range of ERC20 tokens.</td><td>1% trading commission.

Your capital is at risk.&nbsp;</i></p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. Trust Wallet &#8211; Supports All ERC20 Tokens Plus 70 Other Blockchain Standards &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Trust Wallet is a non-custodial ERC20 wallet that is free and simple to use. It supports multiple devices, including browser extensions and smartphones. The latter includes an app for both iOS and Android. Trust Wallet is protected by a PIN and a 12-word passphrase. The passphrase is encrypted on the user&#8217;s device, and Trust Wallet cannot access it.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, this is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-decentralized-crypto-wallets.htm">best decentralized crypto wallets</a> for storing ERC20 tokens. In fact, we like that Trust Wallet supports custom tokens. In a nutshell, this means any ERC20 token can be added. Moreover, Trust Wallet is integrated with CoinMarketCap. This means that if the ERC20 token is listed on CoinMarketCap, Trust Wallet displays its value in real-time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1872" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1872_1190.jpg 1872w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1200_763.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_900_572.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_720_458.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_600_381.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_300_191.jpg 300w"></figure><p>In addition to ERC20 tokens, Trust Wallet supports more than 70 other blockchains. This includes Bitcoin, XRP, Arbitrum, Litecoin, Cardano, and Binance Smart Chain. The Trust Wallet app comes with staking tools and allows users to instantly swap ERC20 tokens. These features are not available on the browser extension.&nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of ERC20 Wallet</strong></td><td><strong>Custodianship</strong></td><td><strong>Supported Coins</strong></td><td><strong>Fee to Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></td><td><strong>App?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest Rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Browser extension and mobile app</td><td>Non-custodial</td><td>4.5 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs across 70 blockchain networks.

MetaMask &#8211; User-Friendly Browser Extension For Desktop Users &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>MetaMask is one of the best ERC20 wallets for desktop users. Its browser extension is user-friendly and supports Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Brave. It takes seconds to download and set up a new MetaMask wallet. Users simply need to choose a strong password and write down their 12-word backup passphrase.&nbsp;</p><p>MetaMask comes pre-installed to support the Ethereum network only. This makes it ideal for storing ERC20 tokens in one safe place. If an ERC20 token isn&#8217;t initially recognized, users can manually add it via the contract address. MetaMask supports five other networks &#8211; Arbitrum, Binance Smart Chain, Optimism, Avalanche, and Polygon.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2102" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_2102_1214.jpg 2102w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_693.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_900_520.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_720_416.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_600_347.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_300_173.jpg 300w"></figure><p>These networks will need to be added manually, and all native tokens are supported. MetaMask supports staking within its wallet interface, but only for Ethereum. This feature is provided by <a href="https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html">Rocket Pool</a> and Lido. Users can also swap ERC20 tokens on MetaMask. This attracts a 0.875% fee, built into the exchange rate.&nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of ERC20 Wallet</strong></td><td><strong>Custodianship</strong></td><td><strong>Supported Coins</strong></td><td><strong>Fee to Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></td><td><strong>App?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest Rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Browser extension and mobile app</td><td>Non-custodial</td><td>All ERC20 tokens.

Ledger &#8211; Hardware Wallet for Storing ERC20 Tokens Offline &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Ledger is one of the best ERC20 wallets for security. Unlike the other providers discussed so far, this is a hardware wallet. It comes as a physical device that encrypts the private keys internally. The key safeguard is that Ledger is never connected to the internet. Instead, ERC20 transactions are broadcasted to the network via Bluetooth or a USB cable, depending on the model.&nbsp;</p><p>All Ledger models require outgoing transactions to be authorized on the device. This requires the user to enter their PIN. If the PIN is forgotten, the wallet can be recovered with the backup passphrase. This is provided by Ledger when installing the wallet and should be kept on a sheet of paper. The backup passphrase is also required if the Ledger device is lost or stolen.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2694" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313167/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313167/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_2694_1100.jpg 2694w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313167/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_490.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313167/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_900_367.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313167/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_720_294.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313167/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_600_245.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313167/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_300_122.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Although Ledger offers one of the safest ERC20 wallets in the market, it is far from convenient. This won&#8217;t be an issue for long-term investors, but those wishing to stake or swap ERC20 tokens will find the process cumbersome. The Ledger Nano S Plus is available to <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison">buy for $79</a>. The most advanced model &#8211; Ledger Stax, retails for $279. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of ERC20 Wallet</strong></td><td><strong>Custodianship</strong></td><td><strong>Supported Coins</strong></td><td><strong>Fee to Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></td><td><strong>App?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest?</strong></td><td><strong>Staking/Interest Rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hardware wallet</td><td>Non-custodial</td><td>All ERC20 tokens.

Coinbase Wallet &#8211; DeFi Wallet App Supporting Any ERCToken &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Coinbase Wallet is also one of the best ERC20 wallets in the market. Not only does Coinbase Wallet support <i>any</i> ERC20 token, but also Bitcoin, Solana, Optimism, Avalanche, and more.

Binance &#8211; Popular ERC20 Wallet for Active Traders &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Active traders might consider Binance the best ERC20 wallet. This is a centralized wallet that connects to the Binance exchange &#8211; so users will not have access to their private keys. Instead, Binance is responsible for keeping client cryptocurrencies safe. The wallet is secured by two-factor authentication, which is required when logging in.&nbsp;</p><p>Binance sends a separate code to the user&#8217;s cell phone <i>and</i> email, which offers an extra layer of security. By choosing the Binance wallet, users will have access to industry-leading commissions. This amounts to just <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/trading">0.1% per slide</a> &#8211; which is reduced when holding BNB tokens. The Binance exchange has over 350 pairs, including many ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2592" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_2592_1314.jpg 2592w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_608.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_900_456.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_720_365.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_600_304.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-___media_library_original_300_152.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Additional ERC20 tokens can be found on the Binance Innovation Zone, which also connects to its wallet.

ERC20 tokens can be stored in wallets that support the Ethereum network. Even if the specific token isn&#8217;t supported, some ERC20 wallets allow users to add them manually. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>ERC20 tokens need to be stored in cryptocurrency wallets that support the Ethereum network. As the world&#8217;s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">second-largest cryptocurrency</a> by market capitalization, this means the number of ERC20 wallets in the market is extensive. Not only that, but there are many different types of ERC20 wallets to choose from.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, while some ERC20 token holders prefer web-based wallets, others feel more comfortable with a hardware device.&nbsp;</li><li>Some investors opt for a mobile wallet app for added convenience.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Either way, ERC20 wallets come with a unique Ethereum address. This address will support all ERC20 tokens. That said, users should check whether custom tokens can be added to the ERC20 wallet. If not, then the user will only be able to deposit ERC20 tokens that are supported. Nonetheless,<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users"> sending ERC20 tokens to a wallet address takes just 15 seconds on average</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, wallet-to-wallet transactions require <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/">GAS fees</a>. And when ending ERC20 tokens, GAS fees need to be paid in <i>Ethereum</i>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, suppose an investor wants to transfer Aave from their ERC20 wallet to an exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>Irrespective of how many AAVE tokens are being sent, the user will need to cover the Ethereum GAS fee.&nbsp;</li><li>This is determined by how busy the Ethereum blockchain is at the time of the transaction. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>ERC20 wallets come with a unique password &#8211; known as &#8216;private keys&#8217;. But not all ERC20 wallets share this information. This will depend on whether the user opts for a custodial or non-custodial wallet. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why Do I Need an ERC20 Wallet?</strong></h2><p>ERC20 wallets provide many different functions. Not only for storing and transferring ERC20 tokens but accessing DeFi products.&nbsp;</p><p>Read on to discover why ERC20 investors need a suitable wallet to engage with the Ethereum ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Storage</strong></h3><p>Both short and long-term investors need a safe place to store their ERC20 tokens. This means keeping the tokens off unregulated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">crypto exchanges</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The best ERC20 wallets offer various security tools to protect the tokens from hackers. For example, custodial wallets usually offer two-factor authentication via SMS and/or email.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2592" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_2592_1206.jpg 2592w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_1200_558.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_900_419.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_720_335.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_600_279.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-___media_library_original_300_140.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Non-custodial wallets give users control of their private keys, which are usually encrypted on the respective device.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wallet-to-Wallet Transfers</strong></h3><p>To send or receive ERC20 tokens, a wallet is needed. Users simply need to provide the Ethereum wallet address when sending ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be unique to the wallet, but all ERC20 tokens will be sent to the same address.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, suppose the user is given the following Ethereum address by their chosen wallet:</p><p><strong>0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe</strong></p><p>In this instance, all incoming ERC20 tokens will be sent to this address.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Ethereum DeFi Ecosystem</strong></h3><p>The Ethereum blockchain is the go-to network for DeFi platforms. Some of the most popular include UniSwap, Curve, SushiSwap, DODO, OpenSea, and Kine Protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>The best ERC20 wallets allow users to connect to DeFi platforms directly. This means users can swap tokens, earn staking rewards, and even borrow funds without leaving the wallet interface.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Fiat Payments</strong></h3><p>Some ERC20 wallets allow users to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money. This removes the need to use an external exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>Users should, however, keep an eye on fees. For example, while the eToro wallet offers fee-free fiat payments in USD, the same transaction would cost up to 5% on Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Best ERC20 Wallets: Our Ranking Criteria&nbsp;</strong></h2><blockquote><p>While security is a crucial factor when choosing the best ERC20 wallet, other metrics also need to be considered. This includes usability, fees, customer service, supported networks, and core features.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>When compiling our list of the best ERC20 wallets, we focused on the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Custodianship:</strong> First, ERC20 token holders should explore the custodianship of a wallet. This determines whether or not the user has access to their private keys. If so, this is a non-custodial wallet. If not, the wallet is custodial. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> The best ERC20 wallets do not charge fees for storing tokens. Nor should there be any extra fees for sending transactions. Instead, this should replicate the blockchain GAS fee. Just remember, while software wallets are free to use, hardware wallets need to be purchased.</li><li><strong>Wallet Type:</strong> Beginners are best suited for mobile or web-browser wallets, for the convenience on offer. That said, some ERC20 token holders prefer desktop or hardware wallets, depending on their requirements. We covered a broad range of wallet types to suit all needs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported Coins:</strong> Be sure to choose a wallet that supports <i>all</i> ERC20 tokens. The wallet should have a feature that allows users to add a custom token manually. If it doesn&#8217;t, the wallet will only support a limited number of ERC20 tokens. Leading ERC20 wallets also support Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-arbitrum-network-tokens.htm">best Arbitrum network tokens</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> The primary purpose of an ERC20 wallet is to keep investments safe. This means that the chosen ERC20 wallet should have suitable security features. For example, Best Wallet comes with biometric security, while eToro offers two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote><p>Overall, the best wallets for ERC20 tokens cover a good blend of security and convenience, plus support for a wide range of ERC20 tokens and features.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2><strong>How do ERC20 Wallets Work? The Basics</strong></h2><p>ERC20 wallets come with various fundamentals that should be learned before proceeding. First, investors will be provided with a unique ERC20 wallet address. Not only does this enable them to receive Ethereum, but all ERC20 tokens. This is because ERC20 tokens operate on top of the Ethereum framework. As such, Ethereum and ERC20 tokens use the same wallet standard.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it is important to assess whether the chosen wallet accepts <i>custom</i> ERC20 tokens. If it does, then users can add an ERC20 token to their wallet even if it isn&#8217;t listed on an exchange. All the user needs to do is paste the contract address into the wallet. Thereon, any incoming ERC20 tokens transactions will be reflected in the wallet address.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2864" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_2864_1040.jpg 2864w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_1200_436.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_900_327.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_720_261.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_600_218.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-___media_library_original_300_109.jpg 300w"></figure><p>When sending ERC20 tokens to another wallet, the user will need the correct address. If any mistakes are made, the transaction will be sent to a dead wallet address. In other words, the ERC20 tokens will be unrecoverable. Do remember that <i>sending</i> ERC20 tokens requires GAS fees. And as noted earlier, GAS fees must be paid in ETH and not the ERC20 token being sent.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>For example, if an investor wants to transfer Dai, they must have enough ETH in their ERC20 wallet to cover transaction fees. This is quoted by the Ethereum network and will vary depending on demand. Currently, ERC20 token transfers <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">cost $1.73</a> or about 0.0010 ETH. This is considered competitive, as ERC20 GAS fees will often exceed $10. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>ERC20 token holders should also be aware of how private keys work. After all, if opting for a non-custodial wallet, private keys are the responsibility of the user. All of the non-custodial wallets discussed today convert private keys to a 12 or 24-word passphrase. This makes it easier to write down and recover the ERC20 wallet if needed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Different Types of ERC20 Wallets</strong></h2><p>We have now covered the basics of how ERC20 wallets work. Next, let&#8217;s explore the most common <i>types</i> of ERC20 wallets, including hardware, software, and paper.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>ERC20 Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Most ERC20 token holders will opt for a software wallet. Especially those that actively buy, sell, and trade ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>Options include a mobile wallet, which comes as an app for iOS or Android. This is the most convenient option, as users can send and receive ERC20 tokens anywhere, at any time. Moreover, mobile wallets are protected by screen locks, biometrics, and a backup passphrase.</p><p>Desktop and browser-based wallets are also popular. These options are suitable for ERC20 token holders that prefer transacting on a laptop or PC. In some cases, desktop wallets come with two-factor authentication, requiring users to verify access via an SMS code. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>ERC20 Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>ERC20 hardware wallets will appeal to two types of investors. First, those with a large value of ERC20 tokens in their portfolio. Or those that want to hold their ERC20 tokens long-term.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because hardware wallets come with unprecedented security controls. For instance, a PIN needs to be entered on the device when authorizing transactions. What&#8217;s more, the hardware device remains in cold storage, as it&#8217;s never connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>ERC20 Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>An alternative option is to use an ERC20 paper wallet.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The user will first need to create an ERC20 wallet address.</li><li>This can be done from most software wallets, such as Trust Wallet.</li><li>The user will then transfer the ERC20 tokens to the newly generated wallet address.&nbsp;</li><li>Next, they will print the wallet address and the private keys onto a sheet of paper.&nbsp;</li><li>Then, the paper is kept somewhere safe, and thus &#8211; the private keys remain in cold storage at all times.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While this makes it challenging to actively send and receive funds, paper wallets are one of the safest and most cost-effective ways to store ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How Safe Are ERC20 Wallets?</strong></h2><p>The safety of an ERC20 wallet depends on various factors, for example:</p><ul><li>Whether the wallet is non-custodial or custodial</li><li>Whether it&#8217;s a hot or cold wallet</li><li>The specific security features provided by the wallet</li></ul><p>Let&#8217;s break the above list down into more detail &#8211; starting with custodianship.&nbsp;</p><p>Custodial wallets are responsible for keeping the user&#8217;s ERC20 tokens safe. While they don&#8217;t share the user&#8217;s private keys, the best custodial wallets offer a range of security controls.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, eToro keeps the majority of client funds in cold storage.&nbsp;</li><li>It also has a 24/7 security team and allows users to secure their wallets with two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</li><li>What&#8217;s more, eToro is regulated by multiple licensing bodies, including those from the UK, US, EU, and Australia.</li></ul><p>The security of a non-custodial wallet will depend on whether the user opts for hot or cold storage.</p><ul><li>Cold storage, available as a hardware or paper wallet, keeps the private keys offline at all times. This removes the threat of the wallet being hacked remotely.&nbsp;</li><li>Hot storage keeps the ERC20 tokens online at all times, which offers added convenience. Most non-custodial hot wallets are secured with a PIN, password, or biometrics. But two-factor authentication is not an option, as non-custodial wallets are decentralized.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ultimately, ERC20 token holders should do their due diligence on the security of a wallet before proceeding.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Set up an ERC20 Wallet?</strong></h2><p>Setting up an ERC20 wallet is relatively straightforward. Beginners can follow the step-by-step walkthrough below to get started with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">Best Wallet</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download Best Wallet</strong></h3><p>Best Wallet is currently available as a mobile app with a desktop browser currently in development.</p><p>It can be found in the App Store or Play Store on Android/iOS and can be downloaded for free.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1080" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_1080_648.jpg 1080w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_900_540.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_720_432.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_600_360.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_300_180.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2: Create Account</strong></h3><p>Users only need to input an active email address to create an account, as Best Wallet is decentralized and non-custodial and there is no <a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process">KYC process</a> to complete.</p><p>Next, users decide what security settings to add &#8211; a four-digit passcode is the minimum but there is the option to add two-factor authentication and/or fingerprint ID. This can also be added/removed later.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Transfer or Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></h3><p>A Best Wallet account has now been created and users will be redirected to the dashboard, where they can either purchase ERC20 tokens via third-party WERT or trade thousands of other tokens on the built-in DEX.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1080" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/best-wallet-homescreen.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_1080_2055.jpg 1080w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_900_1713.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_720_1370.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_600_1142.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_300_571.jpg 300w"></figure><h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><p>After reviewing the top ERC20 wallets for 2023, we found that Best Wallet is our top option.&nbsp;</p><p>This decentralized, non-custodial wallet has just launched as a free mobile app and gives users full control over managing their crypto holdings.</p><p>We also like that Best Wallet has numerous other features that make it more than just a wallet, including unique insights on tokens, early access to new projects and reduced fees while trading.</p><p>That is make possible by the $BEST token, which has not yet launched but will be airdropped to active users of the wallet in the near future.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users"><strong>https://www.coinbase.com/blog/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/"><strong>https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://support.simplex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014078420-What-fees-do-you-charge-for-card-payments"><strong>https://support.simplex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014078420-What-fees-do-you-charge-for-card-payments</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html"><strong>https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison"><strong>https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://mycoinify.com/fees/"><strong>https://mycoinify.com/fees/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/trading"><strong>https://www.binance.com/en/fee/trading</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker"><strong>https://etherscan.io/gastracker</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process"><strong>https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process</strong></a></li></ul><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>What is an example of an ERC20 wallet?</strong></h4><p>ERC20 wallets support tokens on the Ethereum standard, and examples include Best Wallet, eToro, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Where can I get an ERC20 wallet?</strong></h4><p>Dozens of ERC20 wallets can be downloaded for free as an app or browser extension, with leading examples including Best Wallet, eToro, Exodus, and MetaMask.</p><h4><strong>How do I know if I have an ERC20 wallet?</strong></h4><p>If the wallet is on the Ethereum blockchain and the receiving address starts with an &#8216;0x&#8217;, then it supports ERC20 tokens.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What is the best ERC20 wallet?</strong></h4><p>Overall, we like Best Wallet, which not only offers non-custodial storage for any ERC20 token, but also Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and other major cryptocurrencies.

Unlike centralized wallets, only the user has access to their private keys.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In a nutshell, decentralized wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrency tokens safely. This is because users control their private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>This is in contrast to centralized wallets, which are often provided by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> or brokers. This is because centralized wallets do not provide users with their private keys. This means users need to trust the centralized provider will keep their funds safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, when setting up a decentralized wallet, private keys are usually provided in a simplified form. This is often a 12-word passphrase that needs to be entered in the correct order. Nonetheless, the decentralized wallet provider will never have access to the private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>This means users are responsible for safeguarding their wallets. If the wallet is compromised or the private keys are misplaced &#8211; the provider cannot help recover the funds.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Benefits of Using a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Some of the core benefits provided by decentralized wallets include sole custody of the private keys, access to dApps, and faster transaction times.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Still not sure if a decentralized wallet is the best option?</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of using a decentralized wallet for storing cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Full Control of Crypto Tokens</strong></h3><p>The main attraction of decentralized wallets is that users control their funds. This is because only the user has access to their private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, only the user can authorize outgoing transactions. Moreover, entities &#8211; whether that&#8217;s the wallet provider or the government, cannot access the crypto funds.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows users to store wealth outside of the conventional financial system. In other words, users do not need to trust decentralized wallet providers as they do with centralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Faster Transactions</strong></h3><p>The best decentralized crypto wallets offer much faster transaction times when compared to centralized options.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because there is no requirement to have the transaction authorized by a third party.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, consider the process involved when storing crypto tokens on a centralized exchange&nbsp;</li><li>First, the user would need to request a withdrawal from the exchange</li><li>The user would need to wait for the exchange to approve the transfer</li><li>This could take minutes, hours, or days &#8211; this can vary widely depending on the centralized exchange</li><li>Once approved, only then will the crypto tokens be transferred to the recipient&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In comparison, there is no third-party approval process with decentralized wallets. As such, the transaction will be executed on the blockchain as soon as it is verified by the wallet owner.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Store a Great Number of Tokens</strong></h3><p>When using a centralized wallet, the number of supported tokens will often be limited. This is because users can only store tokens that are supported by the exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, the best DeFi wallets support thousands, sometimes <i>millions,</i> of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Take Trust Wallet as a prime example. We found that Trust Wallet is compatible with over 70 blockchain networks and 4.5 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This enables investors to store all of their digital assets in one safe place.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Access Web 3.0 dApps&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The best decentralized crypto wallets provide seamless access to Web 3.0 dApps.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1838" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1838_924.jpg 1838w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1200_603.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_900_452.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_720_362.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_600_302.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_300_151.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Some of the most commonly supported dApps include:</p><ul><li>UniSwap</li><li>SushiSwap</li><li>PancakeSwap</li><li>OpenSea</li><li>Compound</li><li>Yearn.finance</li></ul><p>But there are hundreds more. Crucially, these dApps offer access to decentralized finance tools, such as token swaps, staking, yield farming, and dual investments. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Anonymity &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Another popular feature of decentralized crypto wallets is they offer complete anonymity. This means users can create a wallet without providing any personal information or contact details.&nbsp;</p><p>All users need to access their wallet is the respective password or private keys. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Centralized vs Decentralized Wallets</strong></h2><blockquote><p>The responsibility of &#8216;custodianship&#8217; is how DeFi and centralized wallets are differentiated. Centralized wallet providers are tasked with keeping the user&#8217;s cryptocurrencies safe. While DeFi wallets give users full control &#8211; meaning they are responsible for looking after their private keys.</p></blockquote><p>DeFi and centralized wallets both enable users to store their cryptocurrency tokens. The key difference is in who takes responsibility for safeguarding the wallet&#8217;s private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of centralized wallets, private keys are secured by the provider. This is often a crypto exchange or broker. As such, users do not have access to their private keys. In turn, if the custodian is hacked or goes bankrupt (like FTX), the user&#8217;s crypto funds are at risk.&nbsp;</p><p>DeFi crypto wallets, on the other hand, give users full control of their funds and private keys. This means that there is no reliance on a third-party custodian. Users can send and receive funds at any time without needing approval from another person or entity.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there is nowhere to turn if the DeFi wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys. Therefore, while DeFi wallets give users control of their wealth &#8211; appropriate security practices should be taken.&nbsp;</p><p>This means keeping the private keys offline at all times &#8211; preferably written down on a sheet of paper. In doing so, the user can recover their wallet if they forget their password or the device is lost or stolen. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Different Types of DeFi Wallets</strong></h2><p>Now that we have established the difference between centralized and DeFi wallets, we can explore the different types available.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Most crypto investors opt for a software-based decentralized wallet. Software wallets are often referred to as &#8216;hot storage&#8217;. This is because the funds remain online at all times, increasing both convenience and risk.</p><p>Software wallets come in many forms, but mobile apps are particularly popular. Decentralized wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet both offer an app for iOS and Android. This enables users to secure their crypto funds with a PIN or fingerprint ID.&nbsp;</p><p>Mobile wallets are very convenient for actively managing crypto portfolios. At the click of a button, users can send, receive, and trade crypto right from their smartphones.&nbsp;</p><p>Software wallets also come as a browser extension. For example, MetaMask offers an extension for Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox browsers. This enables users to access the crypto markets whenever they are on their laptops. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Some decentralized wallets come as desktop software, but this is less common. One of the most popular desktop wallets is Electrum, which safely stores Bitcoin on Windows, Mac, and Linux.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Hardware wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrencies on a device. The private keys are held on the device and kept offline at all times. &nbsp;</p><p>To transfer crypto to another wallet, users must enter a PIN on the hardware device. This offers an ultra-secure way to store large amounts of crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>Equally, hardware wallets are far from convenient for active crypto traders. This is because making last-minute trades is cumbersome, considering access to the hardware device is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>The leading hardware wallet providers are Trezor and Ledger Nano. Both are decentralized, as neither provider has access to the device&#8217;s private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>However, do remember that users will need to provide some personal and financial information when buying a hardware wallet online.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>Paper wallets also offer a decentralized way to store crypto tokens. As we mentioned earlier, BitAddress allows users to instantly create a Bitcoin wallet address and private keys. &nbsp;</p><p>Both are represented by a QR code, which the user can print onto a sheet of paper. As long as the paper is kept somewhere safe and private, the crypto funds remain unhackable.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How Secure Are Decentralized Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2><p>First and foremost, there is no requirement to trust a third party when using a decentralized wallet. After all, decentralized wallets merely provide a bridge between crypto transactions and the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>However, decentralized wallets will always be at risk from remote hacking attempts and theft. As such, users must ensure that they follow sensible security practices to keep their crypto funds safe.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, those using a mobile wallet should ensure that a suitable PIN is used. This should be in addition to a lock-screen password for the smartphone. If someone is able to bypass these security measures, they will have access to the wallet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2124" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_2124_810.jpg 2124w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1200_458.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_900_343.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_720_275.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_600_229.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_300_114.jpg 300w"></figure><p>This is also the case for desktop and browser extension wallets. Another way for hackers to access a decentralized wallet is through &#8216;links&#8217;. For example, a scammer might impersonate the wallet&#8217;s support team and send a link for the user to click.&nbsp;</p><p>Unwittingly, the link might install a virus or keylogger, enabling the scammer to access the wallet remotely. The safeguard here is to never click links from unknown sources &#8211; whether that&#8217;s on social media or emails.&nbsp;</p><p>The safest option is to keep the crypto wallet offline at all times. For example, consider installing the wallet on a cheap smartphone that is never connected to the internet. Similarly, users might also consider a paper wallet that is stored away from the risk of theft or damage,&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, decentralized wallets <i>are</i> safe, but users must also take responsibility too. Users also need to consider that increased convenience often leads to reduced security.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, while software wallets are convenient for actively trading and investing crypto, the private keys will always be vulnerable to hackers. As such, users should only keep small amounts of crypto in a software wallet. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Select the Best Decentralized Crypto Wallet?</strong></h2><p>Choosing a suitable wallet is a crucial part of the crypto investing process.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this section highlights the most important factors to look for when choosing the best decentralized crypto wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>Decentralized wallets provide users with their private keys, ensuring that wealth is built and maintained without third parties.&nbsp;</p><p>However, decentralized wallets are still vulnerable to hackers. As such, choosing the best decentralized wallet requires users to consider what security features are included.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Mobile wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask are secured by a PIN</li><li>Desktop and browser-based wallets are secured by a password</li><li>Hardware wallets are secured via cold storage. Plus, users need to enter a PIN on the device to transfer funds</li></ul><p>In comparison, centralized wallets offer additional security features. This can include device whitelisting, two-factor authentication, and even insurance. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Networks</strong></h3><p>The number and type of blockchain networks supported by decentralized wallets will vary wildly. For example, Trust Wallet supports over 70 networks. This includes Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> &#8211; like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1734" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1734_824.jpg 1734w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1200_570.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_900_428.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_720_342.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_600_285.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_300_143.jpg 300w"></figure><p>In contrast, Electrum only supports one cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin. Crucially, users should check which networks and cryptocurrencies are supported by choosing a decentralized wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Device Type</strong></h3><p>Consider the most convenient and secure device type to store the decentralized crypto wallet. Options include desktop software, browser extensions, and mobile apps.&nbsp;</p><p>For offline storage, consider a hardware or paper wallet. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3><p>Another factor to consider is user-friendliness.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, beginners should explore whether the chosen decentralized wallet is suitable for their skill set. Sending and receiving crypto should be simple, as should setting up and securing the wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>More experienced crypto investors might seek a crypto wallet with more advanced features. For example, Electrum offers multi-signature permissions. While this adds a great level of security to the wallet, this feature is not suitable for newbies.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Investment and Trading Features</strong></h3><p>The best decentralized wallets enable users to maximize their crypto investments. For example, OKX has an in-built aggregator tool that connects to over 200 dApps.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2554" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_2554_866.jpg 2554w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_1200_407.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_900_305.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_720_244.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_600_203.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-___media_library_original_300_102.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Users can search for the crypto they currently hold in the OKX wallet and locate the highest APYs available. OKX also comes with an in-built token-swapping tool, not to mention a fully-fledged NFT marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, the likes of BitAddress and Electrum do not offer any such features.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Use a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Below, we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up an account and use our top decentralized wallet, Best Wallet, which should only take five minutes.</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download Best Wallet App</strong></h3><p>First, find the Best Wallet app, which is available on mobile for Android and iOS in the App Store and the Play Store and download it.</p><p>A desktop browser extension is currently in development and will be released soon.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1080" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_1080_648.jpg 1080w, https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_900_540.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_720_432.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_600_360.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_300_180.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2: Create an Account</strong></h3><p>As a leading self-custody, decentralized wallet, all that&#8217;s needed to create an account is an active email address.</p><p>There is no KYC requirements to fill in, allowing for anonymous storage and transfers.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Choose Security Settings</strong></h3><p>Next, choose the level of security you wish to attach to the account.</p><p>All accounts will require a four-digit passcode to be input and confirmed, while there is the option to add two-factor authentication and/or fingerprint ID.</p><p>Once that step is complete, an account will have been created, but users should head to the settings tab and note down their private key.</p><h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3><p>An account has now been created and users will be redirected to Best Wallet dashboard, where they will be able to purchase or store crypto an trade on the built-in DEX.</p><p>As outlined above, some features are not yet live at the time of writing but will be launched in the coming weeks and months.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1080" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/best-wallet-homescreen.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_1080_2055.jpg 1080w, https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_900_1713.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_720_1370.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_600_1142.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/responsive-images/best-wallet-homescreen___media_library_original_300_571.jpg 300w"></figure><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>In summary, decentralized wallets offer many benefits for crypto investors. This includes having full control of the wallet&#8217;s private keys, enabling investors to become their own bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized wallets are also ideal for connecting to Web3 applications, as well as remaining anonymous. That said, do remember that decentralized wallets also invite risk. If the wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys &#8211; the crypto funds will likely be unrecoverable.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to choose wisely when selecting a decentralized wallet, with Best Wallet our top pick and an excellent choice. The self-custody wallet allows for accounts to be created in less than five minutes with no KYC verification needed, with users able to securely store crypto and trade tokens via built-in DEX.</p><p>It stands out ahead of its rivals because it is more than just a crypto wallet &#8211; its native token $BEST can be staked to earn rewards and holding it also grants other benefits such as early access to new projects and NFTS and reduced fees, while the platform will also offer unique insights and data on trending tokens.</p><p>$BEST is not yet live but will be airdropped to active users of the wallet in the near future.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Best Wallet</a></div></div><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://trezor.io/compare"><strong>https://trezor.io/compare</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://crypto.com/"><strong>https://crypto.com/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://metamask.io/"><strong>https://metamask.io/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180731005764/en/Binance-Acquires-Trust-Wallet---A-Popular-Mobile-Crypto-Wallet"><strong>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180731005764/en/Binance-Acquires-Trust-Wallet&#8212;A-Popular-Mobile-Crypto-Wallet</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/"><strong>https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022"><strong>https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.moonpay.com/learn/defi/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees"><strong>https://www.moonpay.com/learn/defi/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org"><strong>https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org</strong></a></li></ul><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><p><strong>Which wallets are decentralized?</strong></p><p>There are dozens of decentralized crypto wallets in the market &#8211; ranging from Best Wallet, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet to Electrum and OKX.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the safest decentralized crypto wallet?</strong></p><p>The most secure decentralized wallets are hardware-based, with providers like Trezor and Ledger Nano leading the market, although users need to purchase physical devices which can be expensive.</p><p><strong>Is Coinbase Wallet decentralized or centralized?</strong></p><p>Yes, the Coinbase Wallet is a decentralized wallet that operates independently from the main Coinbase exchange.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is Trust Wallet decentralized or centralized?</strong></p><p>Yes, Trust Wallet is a decentralized wallet for iOS, Android, and Chrome browser extensions.</p><p><strong>What fees do decentralized wallets charge?</strong></p><p>Most decentralized wallets are free to use and maintain, with users only needing to cover gas fees when transferring funds. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>How secure are decentralized crypto wallets?</strong></p><p>While Decentralized wallets give users full control of their private keys away from centralized third parties, they are not immune to remote hacking attempts. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

Trust Wallet &#8211; Decentralized Crypto Wallet App With Plenty of Tools and Products&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Trust Wallet is perhaps the best crypto wallet in the UK for those seeking a non-custodial storage option.

This is a big deal for some crypto traders, as it ensures that there is full ownership of the underlying tokens at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, Trust Wallet does not have access to the private keys. On the flip side, if the investor forgets their password and is unable to locate the private keys for the wallet, Trust Wallet will not be able to help regain access.

Wallet?</strong></h2><p>After buying crypto assets such as Bitcoin and BNB, the tokens need to be stored in a wallet. This ensures that the tokens remain safe at all times. This is not too dissimilar to how traditional money is stored in a regulated bank account.&nbsp;</p><p>At a minimum, crypto wallets enable investors to send and receive tokens. This is conducted on a wallet-to-wallet basis via a public address. A non-custodial crypto wallet is protected by private keys, which provide access to the digital assets remotely &#8211; often via a 12-word backup phrase.&nbsp;</p><p>However, custodial wallets &#8211; which are typically offered by crypto exchanges and brokers, do not enable users to access their private keys. Instead, the private keys will be safeguarded by the respective provider.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the best crypto wallets in the UK go one step further when it comes to core features. For example, the eToro wallet enables investors to buy, sell, and even swap tokens &#8211; in addition to making a deposit with a debit/credit card or e-wallet.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why Crypto Investors Need a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Crypto investors are advised to obtain a secure wallet with the view of keeping their digital assets safe and away from the wrong hands. Once again, this follows the same concept as depositing traditional money in a bank account for safekeeping and easy access to the funds.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of a crypto wallet, access to the funds is often protected by a range of safeguards. For example, custodial wallet providers like eToro will keep the vast majority of client digital assets offline in cold storage. This ensures that the tokens cannot be accessed by a remote hacker.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1950" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_1950_692.jpg 1950w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_1200_425.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_900_319.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_720_255.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_600_212.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_300_106.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Other security features include two/three-factor authentication, biometric and facial logins, and IP address whitelisting. Top crypto wallets in the UK will also make the process of sending and receiving funds seamless and convenient.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>The underlying mechanics of Bitcoin and crypto wallets will vary slightly depending on the chosen device type.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, there are a lot of similarities that most crypto wallets possess.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Each crypto wallet will have its own public address. This is similar to an account number and sort code associated with UK banks.&nbsp;</li><li>As such, investors can receive funds by supplying the public address for their crypto wallet.</li><li>Similarly, when sending funds out of the wallet to another person, the public address will need to be entered&nbsp;</li><li>Once the transaction is confirmed, the person sending the funds will pay a blockchain &nbsp;fee, which can vary depending on the network and broader market conditions</li></ul><p>Here&#8217;s an example of what a Bitcoin wallet address looks like:</p><p><strong>3FZbgi29cpjq2GjdwV8eyHuJJnkLtktZc5</strong></p><p>Although it is safe to give a crypto wallet address to other people, it is important to remember that digital assets operate on the blockchain ledger.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that by knowing somebody else&#8217;s public address, it is possible to see how much the wallet is storing, in addition to any previous transactions that have been conducted. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3><p>All crypto wallets are backed and secured by private keys. This is similar to a password associated with an online banking account. In other words, those with access to the private key can log into the wallet and authorize transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it is crucial that wallet private keys are never shared with anyone. With that said, whether or not the user has access to the private keys will depend on the wallet type.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Custodial wallets are controlled by third parties, such as crypto exchanges. This means that the user will not have access to the wallet&#8217;s private keys. However, if the user forgets their password, they can ask the third party for help regaining access to the wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>Non-custodial wallets, such as Best Wallet, provide users will full control over their digital assets and private keys. No third party can access the wallet without knowing the private keys. However, if the non-custodial wallet device is lost and the user cannot access their private keys, the digital assets will be unrecoverable.</li></ul><h2><strong>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets</strong></h2><p>Choosing the best crypto wallet in the UK is often a decision that needs to focus on the <i>type</i> of storage option.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we cover the main types of crypto wallets available to UK investors.</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Software wallets enable investors to access their crypto funds remotely. This is typically a choice between a mobile app, desktop software, a browser extension, or a centralized web wallet.</p><p>Either way, software wallets make it a convenient process when it comes to sending and receiving funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, some software providers support multiple device types that each connect to one another. For example, eToro offers both a web and mobile wallet with custodial protections. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Hardware wallets come in the form of physical devices. Leaders in this space include Trezor and Ledger Nano &#8211; both of which we reviewed earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Hardware wallets offer the highest level of security, but transferring funds can be cumbersome.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for this is that the user must enter the wallet PIN on the hardware device itself in order to authorize the transfer.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>Paper wallets offer a cost-effective way to store crypto assets offline and away from the threats of a remote hacking attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>The user will usually print the wallet&#8217;s private keys onto a sheet of paper via a QR code. Then, the paper will be stored somewhere safe.&nbsp;</p><p>If the user needs to send crypto out of the paper wallet, they can do this remotely from a mobile device by scanning the QR code.&nbsp;</p><p>This option, while cost-effective and safe, makes it extremely cumbersome to transfer funds. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Choose the Best UK Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2><p>In this section, we explore some of the most important considerations to make when selecting the best Bitcoin wallet in the UK.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>At a minimum, the best Bitcoin wallets in the UK offer solid security features that are tasked with keeping the crypto assets safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of top-rated security tools to look for include:</p><ul><li>Two or three-factor authentication</li><li>Fingerprint ID</li><li>Cold storage on custodial wallets</li><li>IP address whitelisting</li><li>Device whitelisting</li><li>Notifications on outgoing transactions&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For added security, consider choosing a wallet that is offered by a regulated provider. Both OKX and eToro are authorized and regulated by the FCA to offer trading services in the UK.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>The best Bitcoin wallets in the UK support multiple blockchain networks. This ensures that investors can keep their entire crypto portfolio in a single wallet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1998" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_1998_862.jpg 1998w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_1200_517.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_900_388.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_720_310.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_600_258.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_300_129.jpg 300w"></figure><p>At eToro, its Money crypto wallet supports more than 500 pairs, while Best Wallet has a built-in decentralized exchange meaning it can trade thousands of different pairs with tokens such as USDT or ETH.</p><h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3><p>The best crypto wallets in the UK are free to use. The only fee that should be payable is when it comes to sending tokens to another wallet address.&nbsp;</p><p>There should be no markup on this, meaning that users simply pay the network fee charged by the underlying blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, fees will also be charged if the wallet provider supports GBP deposits and crypto trading services.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>User Experience</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The chosen crypto wallet should offer a suitable user experience that aligns with the objectives of the trader.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a Bitcoin hardware wallet will likely offer superb security, sending and receiving funds can be cumbersome.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the eToro wallet offers the perfect balance between security and convenience.</p><h2><strong>How to Get a Cryptocurrency Wallet in the UK</strong></h2><p>Overall, we found that Best Wallet offers the best Bitcoin wallet in the UK for investors of all skill sets and trading goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, in this section, we will explain how to get and set up the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">Best Wallet</a> mobile app in less than five minutes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download App&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Best Wallet is available through a dedicated mobile app on both Android and iOS &#8211; visit the Play Store or App Store and download the correct app, which should only take 30 seconds to complete.</p><p>A desktop browser extension is also in development and will be launched in the coming months.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" width="1080" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_1080_648.jpg 1080w, https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_900_540.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_720_432.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_600_360.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_300_180.jpg 300w"></figure><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/"><strong>Visit Best Wallet Now</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Step 2: Create Account and Choose Security Settings</strong></h3><p>After downloading the app it is time to create an account, this can simply be done with an email address.&nbsp;</p><p>Then it is time to add security settings to your account.

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT come with up to 12% APY, which is one of the highest yields you can get on stablecoins.</p><p>However, to get this yield you need to advance your levels by trading or holding a certain amount of funds in your account. The Basic level APY is 7% for LTC and 6% for stablecoins.

It employs a custody-based system comprising a web wallet and a mobile wallet, saving Australian investors the trouble of understanding the complex world of crypto wallets.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/1-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/responsive-images/1-1___media_library_original_900_484.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/responsive-images/1-1___media_library_original_720_387.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/responsive-images/1-1___media_library_original_600_323.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267289/responsive-images/1-1___media_library_original_300_161.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Another notable feature of eToro is the availability of 2FA, which adds an extra layer of security to user accounts. Clients are required to verify login attempts using a one-time SMS code. Our research indicates that most eToro users prefer the web wallet, which provides additional features such as the ability to send and receive tokens.</p><p>The web and mobile wallet options offered by eToro are user-friendly and well-suited for beginners. When it comes to purchasing crypto in Australia, eToro remains the top contender. With a minimum trade size of only $10, it caters to many cryptocurrencies. Australian clients can deposit funds through various methods, including debit cards, POLi, PayPal, and Neteller, with a modest initial deposit of $50.

Custodial wallets involve a third-party service, like an exchange or a wallet provider, holding private keys on behalf of users. While they offer the convenience of easy access and management, users must trust the service to keep their keys secure, which can be risky.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="854" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/untitled-design-2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/responsive-images/untitled-design-2-1___media_library_original_854_480.jpg 854w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/responsive-images/untitled-design-2-1___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/responsive-images/untitled-design-2-1___media_library_original_600_337.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110262/267308/responsive-images/untitled-design-2-1___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Non-custodial wallets give users complete control over their private keys, allowing them to store and manage their cryptocurrencies independently. This offers better security but requires users to take responsibility for safeguarding their private keys.</p><p>There are various types of custodial and non-custodial wallets, including software, hardware, paper, and web wallets. Each type has its unique features and security levels. To keep your crypto wallet safe, choose the right one based on your needs, take advantage of backup and recovery options, and use strong security measures such as encryption and two-factor authentication.</p><h2><strong>Why Crypto Investors Need a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Crypto wallets are vital for investors looking to venture into the world of crypto. These digital wallets allow users to store, send, receive, and manage various digital assets securely and efficiently. Let&#8217;s see why crypto investors need a crypto wallet:</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>The primary function of a crypto wallet is to secure users&#8217; digital assets. Wallets use advanced cryptographic techniques to generate unique private keys that are required for accessing and managing cryptos.</p><p>For instance, hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor provide an additional layer of security by storing private keys offline, mitigating the risk of online hacks and thefts. Investors can also enable 2FA to further enhance their crypto wallets&#8217; security.</p><h3><strong>Control</strong></h3><p>Crypto wallets give investors complete control over their digital assets. Unlike leaving funds on exchanges, where users are vulnerable to hacks, wallet owners can manage their cryptocurrencies as they see fit.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, investors can quickly transfer funds between wallets or utilize DeFi platforms directly from their wallets, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet.</p><h3><strong>Convenience</strong></h3><p>Best crypto wallets simplify the process of sending, receiving, and managing cryptos. They often come equipped with user-friendly interfaces and support multiple cryptos, allowing investors to manage all their digital assets from a single location.&nbsp;</p><p>Some wallets even offer built-in exchange features, enabling users to swap cryptos without using external platforms.</p><h3><strong>Interaction with dApps</strong></h3><p>Best crypto wallets, especially those compatible with Ethereum, enable users to interact with dApps and smart contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, MetaMask, a popular Ethereum-based wallet, allows users to directly access various DeFi applications and NFTs platforms, such as Uniswap and OpenSea, from the wallet interface.</p><h2><strong>How do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>Bitcoin wallets enable users to store, send, and receive digital assets seamlessly. A Bitcoin wallet comprises two critical elements: public and private keys. The public key, or wallet address, is an alphanumeric sequence that is the destination for sending and receiving Bitcoin. Sharing the public key poses no risk to security.</p><p>Conversely, the private key is a secret alphanumeric code providing access to the wallet&#8217;s funds. Safeguarding private keys is crucial, as misplacing them can lead to permanent fund loss while disclosing them exposes the wallet to theft.</p><h3><strong>The Transaction Process</strong></h3><p>To receive Bitcoin, share the wallet&#8217;s public address with the sender. The wallet relies on the private key to authorize the transaction to send Bitcoin. This transaction is then transmitted to the Bitcoin network, where it undergoes verification and is added to the blockchain.</p><h3><strong>Protecting Your Wallet</strong></h3><p>Maintaining the security of a Bitcoin wallet is of utmost importance. Consider the following best practices:</p><ul><li><strong>Backups</strong>: Schedule regular wallet backups to prevent data loss from hardware malfunction or theft.</li><li><strong>Multi-Signature</strong>: Opt for wallets necessitating multiple private keys for transactions, increasing security levels.</li><li><strong>2FA</strong>: Implement 2FA (two-factor authentication) to shield your wallet from unauthorized entry.</li><li><strong>Offline Storage of Private Keys</strong>: Keep private keys in an offline environment, minimizing exposure to hackers or malware.</li></ul><h2><strong>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Before selecting a storage solution for their digital assets, investors should familiarize themselves with the different crypto wallets available in Australia.

The best Bitcoin wallet in Australia or any other region should be secure, user-friendly, and compatible with various currencies. This section will guide you through choosing the perfect crypto wallet for you and exploring the key factors to consider, such as security, private key ownership, supported coins, fees, mobile experience, and more.</p><h3><strong>Prioritizing Security</strong></h3><p>Your crypto wallet&#8217;s security should be a top priority. When looking for the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, consider wallets with robust security measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA), biometric authentication, and encryption.</p><p>Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, are among the most secure options. These wallets store your private keys offline, making it difficult for hackers to access your funds. Examples of the best crypto hardware wallets include Ledger Nano and Trezor.</p><h3><strong>Ensuring Private Key Ownership</strong></h3><p>Owning your private keys is essential for maintaining control of your assets. You can choose a wallet that gives you full ownership of your private keys rather than entrusting them to a third party. Non-custodial wallets, such as MetaMask and OKX, grant you complete control over your private keys.</p><h3><strong>Considering Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>Different wallets support different cryptos, so make sure your wallet accommodates the coins you own or plan to invest in. The top crypto wallets in Australia, like eToro, typically support many digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Ensure your wallet supports all the cryptos you want to avoid compatibility issues.</p><h3><strong>Evaluating Fees</strong></h3><p>Transaction fees vary depending on the wallet you choose. Some wallets, such as the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, offer competitive prices, while others may charge a premium for their services.&nbsp;</p><p>Research the costs associated with each wallet before deciding, and factor in the frequency of your transactions. Some wallets allow users to set custom fees, providing greater flexibility in terms of costs.</p><h3><strong>Assessing Mobile Experience</strong></h3><p>If you plan on managing your cryptos on the go, consider a wallet with a user-friendly mobile app. Some Australian crypto wallets offer seamless mobile experiences, allowing users to easily monitor their portfolios, trade, and transfer funds. Ensure the mobile app is compatible with your device&#8217;s operating system, whether iOS or Android.</p><h3><strong>Examining User Interface and Usability</strong></h3><p>A simple and intuitive user interface is vital, particularly for those new to cryptos. When evaluating the best Bitcoin wallets in Australia, consider wallets that offer simple navigation and a clean layout.&nbsp;</p><p>Wallets like MetaMask and OKX are known for their user-friendly interfaces, making them suitable for beginners.</p><h3><strong>Preparing for Backup and Recovery</strong></h3><p>In case you lose access to your wallet, it&#8217;s crucial to have a backup and recovery plan in place. When comparing Australian crypto wallets, opt for wallets that provide a secure backup solution and clear instructions on recovering your funds in an emergency. Most wallets offer a recovery phrase or seed phrase, which can be used to restore your wallet on a new device.</p><h3><strong>Exploring Additional Features</strong></h3><p>Some wallets offer extra features that can enhance your overall experience. For instance, built-in exchanges allow you to trade cryptos directly within the wallet, while staking features enable you to earn passive income on your holdings. When choosing the top crypto wallets in Australia, consider the additional functionalities that could benefit your needs.</p><h2><strong>How to Get a Cryptocurrency Wallet in Australia</strong></h2><p>Choosing the best Bitcoin app or wallet can significantly impact the ease of getting started in the world of digital currencies. This section will discuss installing Best Wallet, which we consider the best crypto wallet for Australian investors and newcomers.</p><h3><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Download Best Wallet</strong></h3><p>Best Wallet is available as a mobile app on both Android or Google so head to the Play Store or the App Store and download it.</p><p>It should take less than a minute to complete.

For example, Litecoin offers the highest annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 15%, while Solana has an APY of up to 13%, which is more than the 8% APY you can get by staking it on the Solana blockchain.</p><p>Stablecoins have a solid APY of up to 12% for USDT and USDC. But to get this yield, you need to advance your levels by trading or holding a certain amount of funds in your account.

In simple terms, cryptocurrency wallets are software programs or hardware devices that allow users to store, manage, and transfer popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.</p><p>These wallets act as the holder&#8217;s &#8220;portal&#8221; to the crypto market, making it easy to hold crypto assets safely over the long term. Various types of wallets are on offer, such as &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets, which offer varying degrees of safety and functionality.</p><p>We&#8217;ll explore these wallet types in more detail later, but it&#8217;s important to note that all wallets have a &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;private&#8221; key. These keys are essential since they prove asset ownership and enable wallet holders to send/receive funds.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="810" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/crypto-wallets-explained.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/responsive-images/crypto-wallets-explained___media_library_original_810_540.jpg 810w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/responsive-images/crypto-wallets-explained___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/responsive-images/crypto-wallets-explained___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/responsive-images/crypto-wallets-explained___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w"></figure><p>According to a report by <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/">TripleA</a>, it&rsquo;s estimated that over 420 million people worldwide own crypto. Most of these people are based in Asia and North America, although this figure is growing every month. Due to this vast customer base, the importance of using crypto wallets is more significant than ever &ndash; especially since the market is still relatively unregulated compared to &#8220;traditional&#8221; asset classes and hackers and scammers are extremely active.</p><p>Ultimately, crypto wallets act as a way to store crypto safely without keeping it on an exchange or brokerage account, giving an individual more power over their holdings. &nbsp;Although there are various types of crypto wallets with specific features and security measures, all of them are designed to serve this purpose.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>How Do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>Whether someone&rsquo;s looking to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> or is more interested in well-established coins, it&#8217;s vital to understand how wallet storage works. Regardless of where the Bitcoin account is held, using a crypto wallet is critical for protecting crypto asset holdings from cyber attackers and other bad actors.</p><p>The simplest way of viewing crypto wallets is as a method for protecting an investor&#8217;s holdings, via access to their public and private keys. As noted above, these keys have essential use cases &ndash; but what do they do? Here&#8217;s a quick overview:</p><ul><li><strong>Public Key</strong>: The public key can be considered the wallet&#8217;s &#8220;account number&#8221; and is used to receive funds from other individuals/businesses.</li><li><strong>Private Key</strong>: The private key is an alphanumeric code unique to each wallet and used to prove ownership of the crypto assets inside. In this sense, the private key is like a password &ndash; meaning it should never be shared with anyone else.</li></ul><p>Crypto wallets store and manage the private key &ndash; <i>not</i> the actual crypto assets. This is because the crypto assets are still held on the blockchain, meaning the private key simply provides <i>access</i> to them.</p><p>Crypto wallets are so important because they use advanced cryptographic techniques to protect the user&#8217;s private key, essentially a password. Different wallets have different approaches, but they can range from DDoS protection to biometric verification &ndash; and even 3D face scans.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1008" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/how-do-they-work.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_1008_698.jpg 1008w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_900_623.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_720_499.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_600_415.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_300_208.jpg 300w"></figure><p>The best crypto wallets usually offer backup and recovery options that ensure users can&rsquo;t lose access to their crypto. In the past, if a user lost their private key, their crypto assets could never be re-accessed. Nowadays, many wallet providers have recovery seed phrases and other features that can restore access, although it is important individuals also take great care not to share or lose those.</p><p>Whether a user opts for a crypto hardware wallet or a software wallet, partnering with a well-respected provider is essential. Moreover, it&#8217;s also vital that users follow security practices, like ensuring their private keys remain confidential and implementing a backup procedure.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Why Do You Need a Cryptocurrency Wallet?</strong></h2><p>Finding and using the best crypto wallet available is an integral part of the crypto-trading journey for beginners, especially if they plan to hold, trade or manage large sums of crypto. These wallets are essentially for safely storing, sending, and receiving digital currencies, making them like a &#8216;crypto bank account&#8217;.</p><p>As we&#8217;ve touched on earlier, traders need these crypto wallets since they keep the private key safe. The private key is the only way for someone to gain unauthorized access to the user&#8217;s funds &ndash; if this key is kept safe, the funds are inaccessible.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="960" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/why-do-you-need.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_960_639.jpg 960w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_900_599.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_720_479.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_600_399.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Moreover, many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-things-to-buy-with-bitcoin.htm">best things to buy with Bitcoin</a> can only be purchased by sending payment from a reputable wallet provider. Since crypto wallets make it easy to send crypto payments, they&rsquo;re vital for buying goods/services online that are denominated in digital currencies.</p><p>Another critical feature of crypto wallets is that they allow users to have complete control over their crypto assets. Since cryptocurrencies are decentralized, they aren&#8217;t held by intermediaries like banks. Even holding on a centralized exchange comes with its own risk, as FTX customers previously found when the exchange collapsed leading to billions of dollars in investor losses, or if the exchange is hacked &#8211; like has been recently seen with Huobi Global, when $8 million was stolen in September 2023. Thus, having a self-custody crypto wallet will ensure that only the user &#8220;owns&#8221; the associated crypto assets.</p><p>Finally, crypto wallets are also important because they make it easy to access the crypto market. Most wallets allow users to instantly buy/sell crypto from within the wallet&#8217;s interface and many providers offer support for NFTs and DeFi protocols, significantly broadening the investment possibilities.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Types of Crypto Wallets &#8211; Hardware and Software, Hot and Cold, Paper</strong></h2><p>Deciding to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-altcoins.htm">buy altcoins</a> or crypto tokens is a huge decision &ndash; yet choosing where to store them post-purchase is just as important.&nbsp;</p><p>We&rsquo;ve already discussed what crypto wallets are, but there various types of wallets on offer with a litany of language that can leave beginners confused.</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets (Hot Wallet)</strong></h3><p>Software wallets are the most popular type of storage solution for crypto assets, especially for beginners. These digital platforms allow users to store and manage cryptos in a user-friendly manner. The most important thing to note about these wallets is that they&rsquo;re connected to the internet &ndash; which is in stark contrast to hardware wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two main types of software wallets:</p><ul><li><strong>Mobile wallets</strong>: These are smartphone apps designed to provide on-the-go access to the user&rsquo;s cryptos. Mobile wallets are often offered for free by many top exchanges, like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/">eToro</a>.</li><li><strong>Desktop wallets</strong>: These are applications that can be downloaded and installed on the user&#8217;s computer. Desktop wallets are slightly safer than mobile wallets since they store the user&#8217;s private key locally on the computer &#8211; MetaMask is one such is example.</li></ul><p>Either way, these wallet types are considered &#8220;hot&#8221; since they&#8217;re connected to the internet. This makes them more susceptible to cyberattacks than &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets which have no connection to the internet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets (Cold Wallet)</strong></h3><p>Alternatively, crypto holders can store their assets in hardware wallets, which are also often referred to as cold wallets &#8211; think cold storage &#8211; as they are not connected to the internet until a user connects a physical device.</p><p>A Bitcoin hardware wallet is a physical device used to store the user&#8217;s private keys. These devices usually look like USB sticks and hold the private key offline &ndash; meaning hackers can&#8217;t access it.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1855" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/hardware-wallets.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_1855_667.jpg 1855w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_1200_431.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_900_324.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_720_259.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_600_216.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_300_108.jpg 300w"></figure><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-crypto-hardware-wallet">Kraken</a>, hardware wallets are one of the most effective ways for a user to protect their private key and are a must for investors or traders who are managing extremely large sums of crypto.</p><p>It is simply not safe to have huge holdings linked to the internet at all times.</p><p>However, these wallets must be connected to another device, such as a laptop or smartphone, to initiate transactions. So, although they have a much higher security level, hardware wallets aren&#8217;t as user-friendly as software wallets.</p><p>Another downside is that as they are physical devices they come with additional cost to purchase &#8211; Trezor&#8217;s latest Model T, for example, costs in excess of $200.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>The third wallet type is paper wallets. Unlike an online Bitcoin wallet, paper wallets are a type of &ldquo;cold&rdquo; storage that involves a user writing their public and private keys on a piece of paper.</p><p>The user would then store this piece of paper somewhere safe where nobody else could access it &#8211; for example in a safe, safety deposit box or locker.</p><p>The downside to this approach is that those with paper wallets still eventually need to use a crypto wallet app to spend or transfer digital assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, paper wallets are relatively impractical and considered less safe than the alternatives &ndash; hence why they aren&rsquo;t widely used.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>How to Find Safe Crypto Wallets</strong></h2><p>Finding the best Bitcoin wallet can be tricky &ndash; especially since so many options exist. However, we&rsquo;ve identified three tactics that traders can employ to find safe crypto wallets effectively:</p><h3><strong>Use a Reputable Provider</strong></h3><p>The most important tactic to use is only choosing crypto wallets offered by reputable providers. It&#8217;s a good idea to read online reviews and check a potential provider&#8217;s track record before downloading the wallet that they offer. Many crypto wallet providers are even endorsed by high-profile individuals or businesses, which can boost credibility.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Many of the top providers listed in this guide have a long track record of success in the space and high security scores. However, even highly-trusted wallets can be susceptible to attacks &#8211; Atomic Wallet was one of the leading providers in the space before North Korean hacker group Lazarus stole more than $100 million of customer funds.</p><h3><strong>Consider the Wallet&rsquo;s Security Features</strong></h3><p>When <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm">choosing a Bitcoin wallet</a>, it&#8217;s also essential to thoroughly research the wallet&#8217;s security features. We&#8217;ll explore this further in the next section, although it typically involves checking the type of encryption on offer and deciding whether to use a hot or a cold wallet.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1618" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/consider-security-features.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_1618_728.jpg 1618w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_1200_540.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_900_405.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_720_324.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_600_270.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_300_135.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Test the Wallet Before Making Large Transfers</strong></h3><p>Finally, it may be best to test out a wallet with a small amount of crypto before fully committing. This minimizes the risk of catastrophic loss while allowing users to test the wallet&#8217;s functionality and security features. Assuming the wallet is up to the task, users can confidently transfer more significant amounts of crypto.</p><h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2><p>Much like when choosing between the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best AI crypto trading bots</a>, deciding which cryptocurrency wallet to use involves analyzing various factors and will also come down to user preference.</p><p>Let&#8217;s take a look at six of the most important factors to consider:</p><h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3><p>The single most important factor to review when choosing a crypto wallet is its security features. This includes the encryption technology it uses, how it manages the user&#8217;s private key and any backup options it has.</p><p>Many of the best Bitcoin wallets also offer two-factor authentication and biometric verification to enhance security further. There are even wallets that have multi-signature support, which means they have two private keys rather than one.</p><p>Cold wallets are automatically much safer than hot wallets &#8211; due to them not being connected to the internet, hackers cannot access those funds without having physical access to the hardware device.</p><h3><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></h3><p>Another important consideration is the type of wallet to use. This can be boiled down to using either one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-hot-wallets.htm">best hot wallets</a> or a cold wallet. As noted earlier, the former is connected to the internet, while the latter isn&#8217;t.</p><p>A crypto hardware wallet is generally considered the safest way to store a trader&#8217;s private key. However, they can sometimes be impractical; if practicality is the primary concern, a software wallet may be more suitable.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Those trading crypto daily would likely prefer a hot wallet as they want fast and easy access to funds.&nbsp;</p><p>But users should always choose a cold wallet if they are holding large sums of crypto over an extended period of time, and only connect to the internet when they wish to make a specific transaction &#8211; buying, selling or transferring elsewhere &#8211; and then disconnect.</p><h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3><p>Navigating the market can be tricky for beginners, so user-friendliness is an important consideration. Users should review a wallet&#8217;s interface design and ease of setup, both of which are crucial for making the trading process accessible to beginners.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2828" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/user-friendliness.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_2828_592.jpg 2828w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_1200_251.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_900_188.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_720_151.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_600_126.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_300_63.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Another thing to consider is whether the wallet comes with any help or support. Most prominent providers, like eToro and OKX, have dedicated help centers with answers to the most commonly-asked questions, which can be a blessing to newbie investors.</p><p>Hardware wallets are not particularly difficult to use but add a another step compared to software wallets, with the likes of Trezor not having a mobile app on iOS also another thing to consider.</p><h3><strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3><p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the crypto market is now valued at over $1.08 trillion with tens of thousands of coins available.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the scale of the market, more new coins and tokens are springing up every week &ndash; so it&rsquo;s a good idea to choose the best cryptocurrency wallet for asset selection.</p><p>Almost all crypto wallets will support the largest coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the top wallets also offer support for lesser-known tokens and stablecoins, which can be highly beneficial.</p><p>MetaMask is one of the best wallets for supported cryptos as it has multi-chain functionality and supports a massive range of tokens, as well as those new to the market.</p><h3><strong>Features &amp; Functionality</strong></h3><p>Users should also check out the wallet&#8217;s features and functionality. For example, if a user wishes to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-defi-coins.htm">best DeFi coins</a>, they should check whether the wallet provides access to the decentralized web.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2166" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/features-functionality.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_2166_1072.jpg 2166w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_1200_594.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_900_445.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_720_356.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_600_297.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_300_148.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Many wallets also provide functionality for NFT storage alongside their crypto storage options. This can be a great benefit for investors interested in obtaining cryptos and NFTs to create a well-rounded portfolio of digital assets.</p><p>For NFTs specifically, investors who hold images from highly valuable collections should also consider placing them in cold storage and only connecting to the internet when carrying out a specific task such as selling.</p><h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3><p>Finally, users should also consider the fees associated with using a crypto wallet. Most software wallets are free to download and use &ndash; the only fees to be aware of are network fees that occur during transfers.</p><p>As mentioned above, those who choose to use a Bitcoin hardware wallet must be aware that these wallets have an up-front cost since they are physical devices.&nbsp;</p><p>The price of these devices can vary significantly, although it usually ranges between $50 and $300, depending on the provider and model.</p><h2><strong>How to Get &amp; Use a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Before ending this guide on the best crypto wallets, let&#8217;s look at how to download and use one of these wallets. As noted earlier, our recommended crypto wallet app is offered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a>, which is free to download, simple to use, and available on iOS and Android devices.</p><p>With that in mind, detailed below are the simple steps to download the Best Wallet app and begin using it today:</p><h3><strong>Step 1 &ndash; Download Best Wallet App</strong></h3><p>Best Wallet is available as a mobile app on both Android and iOS, so the first step is to head to the Play/App store and download the Best Wallet app. It is free and shouldn&#8217;t take long to be added to your phone.</p><figure class="image"><img class=" lazyload" data-src="" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" data-srcset=""></figure><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Open a Best Wallet Account</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 2 &ndash; Create Account</strong></h3><p>Next, the app will ask you to use a current email address to create your account.

Wild.io &#8211; Play Weekly Slot Tournaments With Fair Terms and Payouts &nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wild.io/">Wild.io</a> is one of the best offshore casino sites for playing slot tournaments. Unlike other casino tournaments, Wild.io has fair terms and payouts. This is because tournament points are based on win multipliers rather than the amount being staked. As such, those staking small amounts have a fair chance of winning.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, there is a weekly slot tournament on selected titles. The prize pot is 1,000 USDT and 1,000 free spins. The pot is split between the top 10 players, based on points. For instance, suppose a player bets $1 per spin and lands a 40x payout. This means the player adds 40 points to their tournament score.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2730" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-___media_library_original_2730_1312.jpg 2730w, https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-___media_library_original_1200_577.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-___media_library_original_900_433.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-___media_library_original_720_346.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-___media_library_original_600_288.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-___media_library_original_300_144.jpg 300w"></figure><p>In addition to tournaments, Wild.io offers nearly 3,000 slot games.

But players should still check the licensing status of the casino before proceeding. Regulated offshore casinos like Mega Dice and Lucky Block display their licensing details at the bottom of their homepage.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Software Providers: </strong>Just as important is the type of software providers that supply games to the offshore casino. We only consider offshore casinos that use regulated and reputable software developers. Examples include Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, Quickspin, and Hacksaw. This ensures that players are gambling in fair and random conditions.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported Games: </strong>Players should also consider what casino games they want to play. We found that the best offshore online casinos support table games, slots, live dealers, and sports betting. Provably fair games are also worth exploring.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Customer Support: </strong>Offshore casinos deal with players from all over the world, so 24/7 customer support should be expected. This is usually offered through live chat. This prevents the need for players to spend money calling a casino located thousands of miles away.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Welcome Package and Ongoing Bonuses: </strong>The welcome package is also important when assessing the best offshore casino online. We like matched deposit bonuses with fair terms and conditions. Mega Dice and Lucky Block both offer a 200% deposit bonus to new players. We also like when offshore casinos offer ongoing bonuses for existing players, such as deposit reloads. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Payment Methods and Terms: </strong>We also explore what payment methods are accepted by offshore casinos. This often ranges from bank wires and debit/credit cards to e-wallets and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we check minimum deposit requirements, payout limits, and withdrawal times</li></ul><h2><strong>What is an Offshore Casino?</strong></h2><p>When using an online gambling site based outside of the player&#8217;s home country, this is defined as an &#8216;offshore&#8217; casino. For example, suppose someone in France plays online slots with a Panama-based casino. As the casino is located outside of France, the player is using an offshore provider.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is often a negative spin on offshore casinos, most operate solid business models. The main concept is that offshore casinos accept players from most countries. This will appeal to players that do not have access to local casino sites.&nbsp;</p><p>This might be because online gambling is banned in the respective country. Or, perhaps the quality and service of domestic casino sites are sub-par. Some players use offshore casinos to obtain certain perks, such as enhanced bonuses or more competitive odds. Offshore casinos are also suitable for players who want to gamble anonymously.&nbsp;</p><p>But this is only the case when players deposit digital assets like Bitcoin. When using traditional payment methods, such as bank wires, offshore casinos must initiate a KYC process. Crucially, not all offshore casinos are legitimate. While platforms like Mega Dice and Lucky Block are regulated and safe, unlicensed offshore providers should be avoided.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How Do Offshore Casinos Work?</strong></h2><p>Offshore casinos are usually located in countries that have favorable gambling laws. This is often in the Central American region, such as Cura&ccedil;ao, Panama, and the Cayman Islands. In turn, this enables offshore casinos to accept players from all over the world.&nbsp;</p><p>After choosing a suitable provider, players will need to open an account. Some platforms, such as Mega Dice, only require an email address, username, and password. In contrast, offshore casinos like BetOnline require much more information &#8211; including the player&#8217;s name, nationality, and residential address.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2246" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_2246_1150.jpg 2246w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_1200_614.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_900_461.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_720_369.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_600_307.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_300_154.jpg 300w"></figure><p>After the account is opened, players can deposit some funds. The best offshore casinos accept debit/credit cards, e-wallets, bank wires, and cryptocurrencies. Depositing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is often the best option. This usually enables players to avoid a KYC process and have their withdrawals processed instantly.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the account is funded, players can begin gambling. Most offshore casinos support slots, blackjack, video poker, roulette, and other popular gambling games. These are usually provided by reputable software providers, such as Evolution, Pragmatic Play, and Microgaming. This ensures that each gambling game is fair and random.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Offshore casinos enable players to request a withdrawal at any time. If gambling with fiat money, withdrawals must be sent to the same payment that was used to deposit. This ensures that the offshore casino complies with anti-money regulations. Cryptocurrency payouts can be sent to any wallet address, providing lots of flexibility for players.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Safe?</strong></h2><p>The simple answer is yes &#8211; the vast majority of offshore casinos offer a safe gambling experience. This industry is largely based on trust and reputation, so offshore casinos must provide a satisfactory service to players. This means fair gambling conditions, transparent fees, and reasonable payout speeds.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is important to remember that not all offshore casinos are legitimate. Just like any other industry, a small segment of offshore providers do not operate credible businesses. We found that the best offshore casinos are regulated. Many leading providers, such as Mega Dice, Lucky Block, BC.Game, and Metaspins, are licensed by the Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao.&nbsp;</p><p>Strict guidelines must be met by Cura&ccedil;ao-regulated casinos, ensuring that players can gamble safely and fairly. After all, the &nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/about-us">Cura&ccedil;ao Gaming Control Board</a> supervises its domestic casino sites, as it has done since 1999.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Legal?</strong></h2><p>Those using an offshore casino for the first time might be concerned about the legality of this industry. The first point to consider is the location of the offshore provider. That is to say, the casino must comply with the regulations stipulated by the country it is based. This means that those holding a Cura&ccedil;ao gambling license are governed by Cura&ccedil;ao legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, those based in the UK would need to hold a license with the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UK&#8217;s Gambling Commission</a>. There is more flexibility with European casinos, as providers can be regulated by any EU member. Most hold licenses with the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/">Malta Gaming Authority</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2294" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_2294_660.jpg 2294w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_1200_345.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_900_259.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_720_207.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_600_173.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_300_86.jpg 300w"></figure><p>The second point to consider is the location of the player. For example, UK citizens are prohibited from using an online casino that isn&#8217;t regulated by the Gambling Commission. This is why some offshore casinos do not accept players from the UK. This is often the case with players from the US too. Crucially, the onus is on the offshore casino, not the players themselves.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Offshore casino laws are complex and difficult to enforce. Many offshore casinos do not have KYC processes, as permitted by their respective license issuer. This is the case when offshore casinos accept cryptocurrency payments, rather than debit/credit cards, bank wires, etc. In this instance, players are not asked for their country of residence when signing up.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Fair?</strong></h2><p>Most offshore casinos offer a fair gambling experience. This will be the case when using a regulated offshore provider like Mega Dice. For example, Mega Dice has an automated payment system, so deposits and withdrawals are processed instantly. This means players do not need to wait for payments to be approved manually by the casino.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, regulated offshore casinos like Mega Dice offer games from licensed software providers. This includes the likes of NetEnt, Novomatic, Pragmatic Play, Hacksaw, Push Gaming, and Microgaming. All of these software providers must use <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/page/test-houses">regulated testing houses</a> when launching a new game. Put simply, this tests that the casino game is fair and random.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we also came across offshore casinos that use unlicensed software providers. These providers do not have their games audited by regulated third parties. This means that games are not tested before they are launched. Ultimately, the best practice is to stick with regulated offshore casinos that offer games from regulated and reputable software providers.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Offshore Casinos?</strong></h2><p>Offshore casinos do not develop their own games. On the contrary, games are supplied by software providers. This means that supported games will depend on <i>which</i> software providers the offshore casino has done deals with.&nbsp;</p><p>In most cases, the best offshore casino sites offer the following games:</p><ul><li><strong>Table Games</strong>: All offshore providers supply table games, considering that this is the most popular casino product. At a minimum, this will include blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and video poker. To ensure players stay entertained, offshore casinos usually offer different variations of each table game. For instance, roulette can often be played with either the European or American rules. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Live Dealers</strong>: Offshore casinos also offer live dealers. This means that players are connected with a human dealer in real-time. For instance, suppose a player opts for live roulette. After placing their bets on-screen, the dealer will spin the roulette wheel &#8211; which is recorded live and shown to players. This offers an immersive offshore casino experience.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Slots</strong>: The best offshore casinos also offer a comprehensive library of slot games. This often includes bonus buys, Mega ways, and classics. Some slots connect to progressive jackpot networks, offering 7-figure payouts. It&#8217;s best to stick with slots with a high <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/how-to-calculate-return-to-player-rtp">return-to-player (RTP)</a>. This reduces the house edge and increases the payout frequency. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Provably Fair</strong>: Provably fair games are relatively new in the offshore casino space. These are casino games backed by blockchain technology &#8211; ensuring transparency and fairness. Some of the most popular provably fair games include Aviator, plinko, keno, dice, and mines.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sports Betting</strong>: Some offshore casinos double as a sportsbook. Mega Dice, for example, offers competitive odds on American football, tennis, cricket, baseball, ice hockey, and many other sports. It also offers in-play betting, allowing players to gamble on sporting events that are still in progress.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Players can check what games an offshore casino supports by visiting its website.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Offshore Casino Bonuses &amp; Promotions</strong></h2><p>We found that the best offshore casinos offer lucrative bonuses when opening an account for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>This includes the following:</p><h3><strong>Matched Deposit Bonuses&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The matched deposit bonus is simple; the offshore casino will increase the initial payment made by the player. Each matched deposit bonus will come with a percentage amount and a limit.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, Mega Dice matches the first deposit by 200%, up to 1 BTC.&nbsp;</li><li>Lucky Block also matches the initial payment by 200%, but up to &euro;10,000.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Players will need to wager the bonus a minimum number of times before they can withdraw the funds. This prevents players from claiming a bonus just to cash it straight out.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, the Mega Dice matched deposit bonus comes with 40x wagering requirements. This means that $40 needs to be wagered for every $1 received in bonus funds.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Players should also check the terms and conditions to see what games the bonus funds can be used on. Slots usually contribute 100% to the bonus target. Live dealer games often contribute just 10% &#8211; sometimes less. This will make the wagering requirements even more difficult to meet.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Free Spins&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Some offshore casinos offer slot-related bonuses, known as &#8216;free spins&#8217;. The player can use the free spins on selected slot games without using their own balance. So no risks need to be taken.&nbsp;</p><p>After using the free spins, winnings will need to be wagered. Once the wagering requirements have been met, players can withdraw their winnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Mega Dice offers 50 free spins to new players that deposit &euro;20 or more. The free spins can be used on Wanted Dead or a Wild and come with wagering requirements of 40x.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When claiming a free spins bonus, check the value of each spin. For example, suppose each spin is worth $2. If a free spin lands a multiplier of 50x, the player wins $100. But if the free spin is worth just $0.25, the 50x win is reduced to $12.50.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>No Deposit Bonuses&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Looking for an offshore casino no deposit bonus? The best option that we came across is BC.Game&#8217;s &#8216;Lucky Wheel&#8217; promotion.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="742" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_742_1184.jpg 742w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_720_1149.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_600_957.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_300_479.jpg 300w"></figure><p>After opening an account with BC.Game &#8211; which doesn&#8217;t require any personal information, players can spin the Lucky Wheel to win up to 5 BTC.

As such, players should check this before claiming a bonus.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Payment &amp; Withdrawal Options at Offshore Casinos</strong></h2><p>Players should assess what payment method they wish to use before choosing an offshore casino. After all, deposits and withdrawals form an integral part of the online gambling experience.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Traditional Payment Methods</strong></h3><p>Most offshore casinos support traditional payment methods. This enables players to deposit funds in their domestic currency, such as euros or pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Debit/credit cards issued by Visa and MasterCard are usually accepted. Some offshore casinos also accept American Express and Discovery.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2312" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_2312_1118.jpg 2312w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_1200_580.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_900_435.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_720_348.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_600_290.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_300_145.jpg 300w"></figure><p>However, it is crucial to check what fees apply when using a debit/credit card. This is also the case with e-wallets. For example, 7bit Casino charges 2.5% on debit/credit cards, Skrill, and Neteller. &nbsp;</p><p>Withdrawal fees should also be considered. For instance, 7bit Casino charges 2.5% on bank wire payouts.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Looking for a chargeback offshore casino? It is important to note that initiating a chargeback on casino losses is illegal. Chargebacks should only be used if an unauthorized payment was taken by the offshore casino.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Cryptocurrency Payments&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>A much better alternative when funding an offshore casino account is cryptocurrencies. For example, Mega Dice offers fee-free cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it supports some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrencies</a>, like Dogecoin, BNB, and Cardano.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Mega Dice offers KYC-free accounts when gambling with cryptocurrencies. Not to mention instant payouts. We also found that cryptocurrency payments come with lower minimums. For example, the minimum Bitcoin deposit at Lucky Block is just 0.0001 BTC, or about $3.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Offshore Casino Software Providers</strong></h2><p>We mentioned earlier that offshore casinos use third-party software providers when building their gaming suites. So it&#8217;s important to check the reputation of each provider before proceeding.&nbsp;</p><p>To offer some insight, Mega Dice, one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vpn-friendly-casinos.htm">best VPN-friendly casinos</a>, has partnerships with over 50 reputable software providers. This includes NetEnt, Hacksaw, Fantasma, Fugaso, Mascot Gaming, Evolution, Playson, Kalamba, and Pragmatic Play.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of these providers are regulated by tier-one gambling bodies like the Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority. This means gaming outcomes are fair and random. Plus, licensed software developers have their games audited &#8211; before <i>and</i> after they are launched.</p><h2><strong>New Offshore Casinos &#8211; What to Look for</strong></h2><p>New offshore casinos need to stand out in the market &#8211; so they often go above and beyond to attract players. This begins with the welcome package. New online offshore casinos will offer huge bonuses to new players, often as a matched deposit with free spins.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Mega Dice is one of the best new offshore casinos. It offers a 200% deposit bonus and 50 free spins to first-time customers. However, while reputable market entrants like Mega Dice are regulated, many aren&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p><p>We strongly suggest that players avoid unregulated offshore casinos &#8211; irrespective of whether they are new or established.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Play at an Offshore Casino</strong></h2><p>In this section, we explain how to gamble online at an offshore casino. We guide beginners through the registration and deposit processes step-by-step.
