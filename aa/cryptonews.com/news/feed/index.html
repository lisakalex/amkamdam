<p>Based on <a href="https://bithomp.com/nft-statistics">data from Bithomp</a>, a total of 3,357,404 NFTs have been created using <a href="https://dev.to/ripplexdev/xrp-ledger-nfts-are-here-9jb">the XLS-20 standard</a>. This brings the overall count of NFTs to 2,994,775, owned by 30,972 different individuals.</p>
<p>The total number of NFT issuers has grown to 5,831, while 347,429 of these digital assets have been burned.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been 1,403,970 transfers of NFTs, and there are currently 92,860 NFTs that can be sold for XRP.
</p>
<h2>XRP Ledger NFT Growth</h2>
<p>
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) created by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lawyers-project-ripple-emerge-as-winners-over-sec-future-appeals.htm">Ripple</a> has been operational for over a decade, offering a range of features. Among these features are swift and cost-efficient transactions, outperforming many other currency-centric networks.</p>
<p>Additionally, XRPL provides native capabilities such as issued currencies, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/market-distortion-caused-by-regulation-disparity-in-token-prices-in-centralized-vs-decentralized-exchange.htm">decentralized exchange</a> (DEX), escrow functionalities, and token management.</p>
<p>Even though XRPL lacks support for smart contracts, it competently carries out various functions similar to other networks. These include handling NFTs, stablecoins, synthetic assets, and other programmable settlement layer assets.</p>
<p>A significant milestone for the XRP Ledger occurred in October 2022 with the introduction of the XLS-20 standard. This standard facilitated the creation of native <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/non-fungible-tokens-explained.htm">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) on the XRP Ledger, allowing for the representation, transfer, and ownership of unique assets.</p>
<p>It also introduced features like royalties and robust anti-spam measures, propelling XRPL&#8217;s growth and achievements.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-xrp-ledger-q3-2023?utm_source=twitter_messari&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=state_of_xrp_ledger_q3_2023">October 27 report from Messari</a>, an on-chain analytics company, XRPL&#8217;s average daily NFT transactions increased by 7.3% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 16,700.</p>
<p>Notably, the NFTokenBurn transaction type witnessed a substantial 135.7% quarter-over-quarter growth, with 1,700 daily transactions. NFTokenMints also experienced consecutive quarterly growth, rising by 13.1% in Q3 to 6,300 daily transactions.</p>
<p>However, other NFT transaction types, including NFTokenCreateOffer, NFTokenAcceptOffer, and NFTokenCancelOffer, declined by 7.0%, 7.4%, and 2.0% quarter-over-quarter, respectively.</p>
<p>NFTokenMint emerged as a dominant force, driven by a significant surge in mints, thanks to collaborative efforts from projects like XNS (an identity solution) and <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPFamilyNFT">XRP Family NFT</a> (a profile picture project).</p>
<p>By the end of Q3, a remarkable milestone was reached, with a total of 3 million NFTs minted using the XLS-20 standard. Notably, the &#8220;<a href="https://xpunks.club/">XPUNKS</a>&#8221; NFT collection led in sales volume, achieving a remarkable 4.4 million XRP in sales.</p>
<p>This achievement firmly establishes the XRP Ledger as a key player in the NFT landscape. As the NFT ecosystem continues to evolve, it will be intriguing to observe how other blockchain companies respond to Ripple&#8217;s success and whether they adopt similar eco-friendly and scalable approaches to attract a broader user base.</p>

<p>
As <strong>decentralized finance</strong> (DeFi) continues to plug along in its quest to capture market share, PancakeSwap, one of the <strong>leading decentralized exchanges</strong>, has recently taken a step toward optimizing its service offerings. On Monday, <a href="https://blog.pancakeswap.finance/articles/experience-single-token-liquidity-provisioning-with-bril-finance-using-pancakeswap-position-manager">PancakeSwap announced a collaboration with DeFi protocol Bril Finance</a>, introducing a <strong>portfolio manager function</strong>.</p>
<p>This feature seeks to augment the financial strategies of PancakeSwap users by <strong>diversifying their investments</strong> into various liquidity pools.</p>
<p>The addition of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spanish-police-save-kidnapped-crypto-portfolio-manager-from-gunpoint-ordeal.htm">portfolio manager</a>&nbsp;allows users to <strong>deposit single assets</strong> into vaults. From there, the assets are automatically distributed to different <strong>liquidity pools</strong>, providing an enhanced <strong>risk-adjusted return</strong> on investments. With cryptocurrencies like USDT, BTC, BNB, and Ether eligible for deposits, this development could lead to a transition in how users manage their crypto portfolios on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">decentralized exchanges</a>.
</p>
<h2>A Mechanism for Optimized Returns</h2>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@bril-finance/bril-finance-partners-with-pancakeswap-to-bring-its-high-yield-automated-portfolio-management-tool-11e32db55130">According to the announcement</a></p>
<p>, the portfolio manager deploys an <strong>automatic liquidity provision algorithm</strong> with rebalancing features. The collaboration between PancakeSwap and Bril Finance simplifies the <strong>asset management process</strong> for users. Initial tests claim that this system has already yielded an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp#:~:text=The%20internal%20rate%20of%20return,a%20discounted%20cash%20flow%20analysis.">internal rate of return</a> (IRR) of <strong>over 24%</strong>, a metric that gauges the compound annual growth rate of an investment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_123448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123448" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-123448 size-full lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="PancakeSwap Bril Portfolio Manager" width="720" height="388" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698687782-0_rukq7dm3ugxvlynh.webp" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-123448" class="wp-caption-text">PancakeSwap Bril Portfolio Manager, <em><a href="https://medium.com/@bril-finance/bril-finance-partners-with-pancakeswap-to-bring-its-high-yield-automated-portfolio-management-tool-11e32db55130">Medium</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the first four weeks following the feature&#8217;s rollout, users will be eligible for additional rewards in the form of <a href="https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics">PancakeSwap&rsquo;s governance token</a>, CAKE. PancakeSwap will initially be the sole platform offering access to <strong>Bril&#8217;s portfolio management system</strong>. This exclusivity highlights PancakeSwap&#8217;s dominance in the DeFi exchange space and its focus on diversifying and enriching its financial product suite.
</p>
<h2>Broader Implications for Decentralized Exchanges</h2>
<p>
&#8220;We aim to become a hub for all of DeFi and integrations such as this, allowing us to become a one-stop shop for portfolio management,&#8221; said <strong>PancakeSwap&#8217;s CEO</strong>, <a href="https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/team/the-kitchen-team">colloquially known as the Head Chef.</a> &#8220;Bril&#8217;s automated technology and its integration with PancakeSwap will allow PancakeSwap users to enjoy the core features and functionalities they are already accustomed to and seamlessly earn on their assets in a hands-off manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/uniswap-vs-pancakeswap">PancakeSwap is the second-largest decentralized exchange</a> in terms of daily volume, this new feature can be seen as a concerted effort to <strong>fortify its market position</strong>. The integration of Bril&#8217;s portfolio manager is a strategic move in advancing not just PancakeSwap, but potentially setting a <strong>precedent for other decentralized exchanges</strong>.</p>
<p>The integration of a portfolio manager function by PancakeSwap, in collaboration with Bril Finance, represents a strategic shift in how decentralized exchanges are adapting to the evolving needs of their user base. This update not only seeks to optimize returns for individual investors but also underlines the growing sophistication of financial tools available in the DeFi sector.</p>

The partnership seeks to launch a unique collection of <strong>digital sneakers as non-fungible tokens</strong> (NFTs) on the Solana blockchain. The collection aligns with Aoki&rsquo;s existing NFT-based membership club, A0K1VERSE.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Stepnofficial/status/1719001290812825815">The Steve Aoki x Stepn collection</a> consists of 300 limited-edition digital sneakers in four distinct designs&mdash;Walker, Jogger, Runner, and Trainer. 240 of these will be sold via the <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/mooar">MOOAR marketplace</a> between October 31 and November 4 for 3,500 GMT (approximately $695). An additional 60 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/nft/">NFT</a>s will be allocated to Aoki&rsquo;s fan community, rounding off the collection at 300 NFT editions.</p>
<h2>The Collection and its Real-World Implications</h2>

<h2>The A0K1VERSE Connection</h2>
<p><a href="https://a0k1verse.xyz/">A0K1VERSE</a>, Steve Aoki&#8217;s NFT-based membership club, offers an array of exclusive benefits to its holders. This new digital sneaker collection is an extension of Aoki&rsquo;s broader engagement with the NFT space, which has seen <a href="https://medium.com/@a0k1verse/happy-birthday-a0k1verse-and-welcome-to-season-two-96fe449555bd">partnerships with companies like Gala Games and Nickelodeon</a>, as well as famed comic book artist <strong>Todd McFarlane</strong>.</p>

<p>The collaboration between Steve Aoki and Stepn adds another layer to the ongoing conversation about the integration of NFTs in sectors beyond pure digital art. As NFTs find various applications, from collectibles to utility-driven assets, this partnership shows how existing platforms are exploring new ways to engage with their user base.</p></div>

<p>Digital asset investment funds saw a record $326 million in net outflows last week, marking the largest single week of inflows since July 2022.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-155-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-c509d7ea4610" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent report by CoinShares</span></a>, the surge in investor interest can be attributed to growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>&#8220;Month-to-date inflows are now close to half a billion dollars,&#8221; the report said, noting that this indicates an increase in investor confidence.</p>
<p>While the weekly inflow is undoubtedly positive for Bitcoin, it is worth noting that it ranks as only the 21st largest on record, suggesting that investors are still exercising caution.</p>
<p>However, industry experts believe that the approval of a spot-based Bitcoin ETF in the coming months is highly likely.</p>
<p>Such an approval would represent a significant regulatory milestone for the industry and potentially drive further investment.</p>
<p>Regionally, the United States accounted for only 12% of the inflows, with $38 million, as investors eagerly await the potential launch of the spot-based ETF.</p>
<p>The major contributors to the inflows were Canada, Germany, and Switzerland, with inflows of $134 million, $82 million, and $50 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Asia also witnessed a surge in weekly inflows, reaching $28 million.</p>
<p>With total assets under management now standing at $37.8 billion, the highest since May 2022, the digital asset market is experiencing substantial growth.
</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Dominates Weekly Inflows</h2>
<p>
Bitcoin dominated the inflows, capturing 90% of the total at $296 million.</p>
<p>However, the recent price surge also prompted $15 million in inflows into short-Bitcoin investment products, reflecting the hedging strategies employed by some investors.</p>
<p>In addition to Bitcoin, Solana experienced significant inflows of $24 million.</p>
<p>Although some other altcoins also saw inflows, this wave of optimism did not extend to Ethereum, which experienced outflows totaling $6 million.</p>
<p>The <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-cantor-fitzgerald-grows-confident-heres-why.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">anticipation of a spot ETF approval</span></a> has led to a surge in Bitcoin&rsquo;s price in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency rallied towards $35,000 earlier this month, driven by market speculation surrounding the potential approval of a spot ETF.</p>
<p>The surge in price has not only caught the attention of investors but has also sparked a renewed interest in crypto trading, leading to a significant increase in daily exchange volumes.</p>
<p>As <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoins-climb-to-35000-fuels-surge-in-crypto-trading-activity-is-the-bull-market-starting.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a>, the seven-day moving average for spot exchange volumes across reputable platforms breached an impressive $24 billion on October 26, a level not seen since the end of March.</p>

<p>The digital asset market has recorded several wins this month with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a 16-month high and surging activities around decentralized finance (DeFI) applications.</p>
<p>According to data from DefiLlama, the <a href="https://defillama.com/?volume=true&amp;minTvl=100000000&amp;maxTvl=">total value locked</a> (TVL) on DeFi protocols has soared to $42 billion, marking a three-month high, gaining $6.2 billion from its $35.8 billion standpoint two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The whooping $6.2 billion growth in roughly 14 days comes on the heels of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-is-up-over-120-from-2022s-lows-here-is-how-high-it-could-pump-this-bull-market.htm">renewed market activity</a> as new liquidity gets pumped into the market. This can be seen in increasing activities of most protocols as altcoins continue to climb.</p>
<p>Several analysts have pinned the growth in the market on the rise in the price of BTC although the major factors changing the tide for DeFi protocols are rising prices of related tokens and inflows from investors looking to earn rewards.</p>

<h2>Defi transactions surges</h2>
<p>
Data from DefiLlama show that DeFi transactions tapped a seven-month high with $4.4 billion recorded on Oct 24 as staking protocols continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) biggest lending protocol, Marinade notched a 120% growth in TVL following a rollout of its native token which was spiked in recent days by renewed market activities.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has found new momentum by a recent rally that propelled Bitcoin’s value towards the $35,000 mark.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a> №cryptocurrency<a href="https://t.co/VB8NxT8cMP">https://t.co/VB8NxT8cMP</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Jito, Marinade&rsquo;s competitor, saw the TVL on its platform soar by 190% to $168 million while similar products across other chains also recorded growth.</p>
<p>This year, Solana has been described as an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-dominates-altcoin-inflows-as-crypto-funds-experience-fourth-week-of-gains.htm">institutional investor </a>favorite following its multiple weeks of inflows rising to new highs around trading activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) has struggled this year as institutional investors lack confidence in its products leading to massive outflows.</p>
<p>However, the last two weeks have seen the largest altcoin surge in market prices and trading volumes. At press time, ETH trades at $1,782 an increase from $1,590 at the same time frame.</p>
<p>Enzyme Finance, Spark, and Stafer also recorded mass inflows and growth ranging between 35% and 55%, below their Solana counterparts but a massive increase from previous weeks.
</p>
<h2>The wider market goes green</h2>
<p>
Avalanche and Lido saw massive inflows of 34% and 25% respectively alongside Sui which posted a TVL growth of 40 million taking it over the $70 million mark.</p>
<p>Similar growth was recorded in the Aptos network as layer 1 networks also benefited from the market&rsquo;s new wave.</p>
<p>Bitcoin currently <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">trades at $34,511</a> recording a 27.77% growth in the last 30 days on the backs of a potential spot BTC ETF approval.</p>
<p>While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected every previous spot BTC ETF application, certain experts and wealth management firms believe that approval is imminent and could come next year.</p>

<p>The <strong>Celestia </strong>mainnet, the first modular data availability network, is set to launch tomorrow (<strong>14:00 on October 31 UTC</strong>). This will also release its native token TIA for trading with an airdrop of <a href="https://blog.celestia.org/genesis-drop/">60 million</a> tokens, 6% of the tokens in circulation, for active users on Ethereum Layer 2s Cosmos Hub, and Osmosis, making it one of the biggest airdrops seen in 2023.</p>
<p>The snapshot of the airdrop was taken on January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The Block <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/259970/celestia-mainnet-tia-token">confirmed</a> the Celestia network&rsquo;s launch date and time, as Celestia&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/milestones">GitHub</a> repository also indicated its launch timeline.</p>

<p>Celestia introduces a unique approach by solely focusing on arranging and sharing transactions, unlike conventional networks that also execute these transactions. This distinctive feature creates a division between the consensus on transactions and their actual execution.</p>
<p>By redesigning the fundamental architecture of blockchain, Celestia aims to reduce the cost of developing decentralized applications. Thus, the simplified framework presents a more accessible and cost-effective platform for innovators in the industry.</p>
<p>The network also anticipates community-generated content post Celestia&rsquo;s launch. The additional features and improvements that may come include support for pruning historical blob data to reduce node storage requirements, a &ldquo;partial node&rdquo; type for light nodes that verify the Celestia L1 state transitions, and the Blobstream deployment to Ethereum Mainnet for Layer 2s to use Celestia.</p>
<p>In October 2022, Celestia Labs raised $55 million in a funding round led by Bain Capital Crypto and Polychain Capital.</p>

<p>Binance, the crypto exchange that for long has dominated global crypto trading, has seen its market share continue to decline even as the overall market has surged higher.</p>
<p>The continued decline in market share for the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange was pointed to in a recent opinion <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/259575/binances-marketshare-continues-to-decline-amid-rally">piece</a> by The Block&rsquo;s Frank Chaparro, where he said that Binance&rsquo;s market share among exchanges without USD support has fallen from 74% in December last year to 50% as of this month.</p>
<p>The decline in market share has happened as Binance has continued to lose key employees, with at least 16 executives leaving the firm over the past couple of years, a fact that was also pointed to in Chaparro&rsquo;s piece.</p>
<p>Perhaps most notable among them was the departure of then-CEO of Binance.US, the former regulator Brian Brooks, who abruptly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/poloniex-settles-with-the-sec-new-digital-yuan-giveaway-more-11362.htm">left the company in August 2021</a> after serving only three months as CEO.</p>
<p>Brooks later revealed that the real reason he left Binance.US was because he was &ldquo;not actually the one running this company,&rdquo; noting that Binance&rsquo;s global CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was the one who was really charge.</p>
<p>Following Brooks&rsquo; departure, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cbdc-race-blockdaemon-unicorn-harmony-algorand-pour-millions-more-news.htm">Brian Shroder took over as CEO</a> of the exchange, before he also quit in mid-September this year in the midst of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm">regulatory storm around Binance.US</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to these CEOs, executives including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/beleaguered-binance-loses-another-chief-executive-from-its-uk-office-whats-going-on.htm">Binance UK Head Jonathan Farnell</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-us-loses-key-executives-as-regulatory-issues-intensify-heres-latest.htm">chief risk officer Sidney Majalya</a>, and Citadel veteran Seth Levy have all left the company within a short period of time.
</p>
<h2>Executive departures causing nervousness</h2>
<p>
Not surprisingly, the departures have caused some degree of nervousness among Binance users who still have last year&rsquo;s collapse of FTX fresh in mind.</p>
<p>In his piece, Chaparro quoted a professional crypto options trader as saying that the regulatory actions taken against Binance has scared trading firms from committing too much capital to the exchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is tough for institutional guys to commit resources given the headline risk. [High frequency trading] guys have outsized volume due to the nature of the trading style,&rdquo; the trader was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Binance had a &ldquo;normalized&rdquo; 24-hour spot trading volume of $4.6 billion.</p>
<p>This compares to the $1.3 billion in normalized spot volume that rival exchange OKX boasts, CoinGecko data shows.</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sbf-testifies-ftx-had-no-risk-management-team-denies-defrauding-anyone-a-lot-of-people-got-hurt.htm">continued his testimony</a> while fielding grilling questions from the prosecution in Manhattan federal court on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The defense finished their direct examination of Bankman-Fried earlier this morning, prompting Bankman-Fried to begin his cross-examination conducted by US Assistant Attorney Danielle Sassoon.
</p>
<h2><b>Prosecution grills Bankman-Fried</b></h2>
<p>
Sassoon began Bankman-Fried&#8217;s cross-examination by pushing the often circuitous Bankman-Fried to answer the questions presented directly, which included a number of statements Bankman-Fried made to the public and media.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX">number of tweets</a>, Bankman-Fried wrote that FTX was the &#8220;most regulated crypto exchange by far&#8221; and that &#8220;funds and safety come first&#8221; on the platform. Similarly, in November 2022, Bankman-Fried claimed that Alameda played by the same rules as everyone else on the exchange.</p>
<p>In October 2022, Bankman-Fried claimed that customers would always be allowed to withdraw whatever funds they had on FTX. However, nearly two weeks later, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto empire would collapse.</p>
<p>Moreover, Sassoon grilled Bankman-Fried on the relationship between FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, causing the soft-spoken Bankman-Fried to hesitate. In several instances, Judge Kaplan asked Bankman-Fried to answer the question he was asked after the defendant failed to do so adequately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you say you were not at all involved in Alameda&#8217;s trading in 2022,&#8221; Sassoon questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on how you define trading,&#8221; the FTX founder responded.
</p>
<h2><b>Damning Twitter messages</b></h2>
<p>
In another pointed moment during his time on the witness stand, Bankman-Fried was asked to read Twitter messages he sent to journalist Kelsey Piper in November 2022, which included admitting that much of what he said in regards to regulation was &#8220;just PR.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was quickly followed by another message written by the disgraced &#8220;king of crypto&#8221; that read &#8220;f-ck regulators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sassoon then pointed out that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bankman-fried-continues-testimony-i-didnt-want-to-be-known-as-the-kansas-city-royals-of-crypto-exchanges.htm">Bankman-Fried</a> would leverage Twitter as a means of communicating with users and potential customers who were a part of Crypto Twitter. Bankman-Fried then acknowledged he called a subset of these users &#8220;dumb motherf-ckers&#8221; in a private conversation.
</p>
<h2><b>SBF&#8217;s congressional testimony comes back to bite him</b></h2>
<p>
Sassoon then probed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sbf-testifies-in-hearing-claims-alameda-research-had-right-to-borrow-funds.htm">Bankman-Fried on his testimony</a> before Congress, where the FTX founder claimed that users had &#8220;refunded collateral deposits instead of credit extensions&#8221; on the exchange.</p>
<p>The prosecution then noted that Alameda&#8217;s account on the exchange was allowed a $65 billion line of credit. Moreover, Alameda&#8217;s &#8220;special privileges&#8221; were never disclosed to customers or the public.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried claimed in an interview with Bloomberg that FTX and Alameda were &#8220;wholly separate entities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried will continue his cross-examination this afternoon.</p>

<p>Indian think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (<a href="https://gtri.co.in/default.asp">GTRI</a>) is seeking to incorporate crypto discussions into the WTO e-commerce framework.</p>
<p>India has asked the WHO member countries to include crypto-related issues while negotiating any agreement on the e-commerce sector. The crypto market has recently garnered global attention, however, under WTO, the e-commerce framework remains ambiguous, the think tank noted.</p>
<p>GTRI suggested during a meeting involving senior officials of the World Trade Organization (<a href="https://www.wto.org/">WTO</a>) members in Geneva last week.</p>
<p>According to GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava, the &ldquo;multifaceted dynamics of the e-commerce landscape&rdquo; pave for a significant global digital trade.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The inclusion or exclusion of cryptocurrencies and the diverse positions of influential nations will shape the future of international e-commerce policies.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The member nations of WTO currently discuss e-commerce under a joint initiative and moratorium, consisting of 89 members. Further, the joint initiative on e-commerce considers topics including tariffs, customs clearance, paperless trading, online privacy and cyber security.</p>
<p>Members countries of WTO must prioritize crypto discussions before they &ldquo;start taking liberties with interpretation leading to disputes,&rdquo; Srivastava added.
</p>
<h1>Clarity on Crypto Exchanges</h1>
<p>
GTRI has sought clarity on whether crypto exchanges fall under the category of &#8216;electronic transmissions&#8217; within the scope of WTO e-commerce.</p>
<p>The negotiations need to factor in cryptos as exchanges involve digital transmission, qualifying it as an e-commerce transaction, he said.</p>
<p>The e-commerce moratorium was introduced in 1988, which restricts countries from applying customs duties on electronic transmissions. The moratorium was extended for two years in June 2022 and received opposition from India upon its continuation.</p>
<p>India argued that the moratorium adversely impacts developing nations and they need to preserve policy space for their digital advancement. It also stressed the regulation of imports, and generate revenue through custom duties.</p>
