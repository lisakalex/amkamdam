<p>Steve Aoki and Stepn collaborate to release a limited series of NFT digital sneakers. <em>Image by <a class="blue science-text js-contributor-link" href="https://stock.adobe.com/ca/contributor/209563916/gulyaevstudio?load_type=author&amp;prev_url=detail" data-ingest-clicktype="details-contributor-link">GulyaevStudio</a>, Adobe Stock.</em>In a recent collaboration that brings together the <strong>entertainment industry and cryptocurrency</strong>, electronic musician and NFT creator <strong>Steve Aoki</strong> has teamed up with the <strong>mobile move-to-earn game Stepn</strong>. The partnership seeks to launch a unique collection of <strong>digital sneakers as non-fungible tokens</strong> (NFTs) on the Solana blockchain. The collection aligns with Aoki&rsquo;s existing NFT-based membership club, A0K1VERSE.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Stepnofficial/status/1719001290812825815">The Steve Aoki x Stepn collection</a> consists of 300 limited-edition digital sneakers in four distinct designs&mdash;Walker, Jogger, Runner, and Trainer. 240 of these will be sold via the <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/mooar">MOOAR marketplace</a> between October 31 and November 4 for 3,500 GMT (approximately $695). An additional 60 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/nft/">NFT</a>s will be allocated to Aoki&rsquo;s fan community, rounding off the collection at 300 NFT editions.</p>
<h2>The Collection and its Real-World Implications</h2>
<p>&#8220;Collaborating with Stepn is an exciting step towards bringing the metaverse and real world closer together,&#8221; Steve Aoki said in a release.</p>
<p>The NFTs, when connected to mobile phones via the Stepn platform, allow users to <strong>earn crypto rewards</strong> based on their physical movements, such as walking or jogging. Created by <strong>Find Satoshi Lab</strong>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/22/play-move-to-earn-solana-stepn-gamefi/">Stepn claims to have over 2 million active monthly users</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shitirastogi/?originalSubdomain=uk">Shiti Manghani</a>, the COO of Find Satoshi Lab, <a href="https://decrypt.co/203667/steve-aoki-dropping-digital-sneakers-move-earn-game-stepn">spoke about the collaboration</a> saying, &#8220;Steve Aoki continues to push boundaries and demonstrate immense innovation. This partnership highlights our commitment to this cause and underscores the potential of our industry.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The A0K1VERSE Connection</h2>
<p><a href="https://a0k1verse.xyz/">A0K1VERSE</a>, Steve Aoki&#8217;s NFT-based membership club, offers an array of exclusive benefits to its holders. This new digital sneaker collection is an extension of Aoki&rsquo;s broader engagement with the NFT space, which has seen <a href="https://medium.com/@a0k1verse/happy-birthday-a0k1verse-and-welcome-to-season-two-96fe449555bd">partnerships with companies like Gala Games and Nickelodeon</a>, as well as famed comic book artist <strong>Todd McFarlane</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/steve-aoki-launches-his-own-metaverse-and-nft-membership-platform-the-a0k1verse1/">In an earlier interview in 2022</a>, Aoki revealed he was &#8220;building his own world&#8221; through A0K1VERSE.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://findsatoshilab.com/">Find Satoshi Lab</a>, the startup behind Stepn, has also disclosed its plans for a new game called <a href="https://www.gashero.com/">Gas Hero</a>.</p>
<p>Although details about Gas Hero are sparse, it is an MMO game that will be playable via web browsers and mobile phones. The game is set in a future dystopian world, and its development indicates the company&#8217;s further foray into the cryptocurrency gaming sector.</p>
<p>The collaboration between Steve Aoki and Stepn adds another layer to the ongoing conversation about the integration of NFTs in sectors beyond pure digital art. As NFTs find various applications, from collectibles to utility-driven assets, this partnership shows how existing platforms are exploring new ways to engage with their user base.</p></div>

He contended that the case should be dismissed on grounds of free speech, asserting that the knock-off Bored Ape NFTs were sold and distributed as a form of protest against alleged hidden anti-Semitic imagery in the original collection.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://youtu.be/a61QU5MQRxE"></oembed></figure><p>Ripps and Cahen&#8217;s lawyer, Thomas Sprankling, emphasized that Ryder Ripp was selling the NFTs as avant-garde artistic expression that pushed the boundaries of free speech. He argued that Yuga&#8217;s lawsuit should be dismissed under a California law designed to prevent intimidating lawsuits, known as strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP).</p><p>Sprankling explained that California&#8217;s anti-SLAPP statute acts as a preventive measure, going beyond the protections of the First Amendment to ensure people are not threatened or deterred from expressing themselves freely. The hearing showcased the complexities and nuances surrounding the intersection of free speech, artistic expression, and NFTs in the legal realm.</p><p>The anti-SLAPP motion contended that Yuga Labs had filed the lawsuit as a response to Ripps&#8217; criticism of Bored Apes on social media, with the intention of silencing him and burdening him with legal costs.</p><p>However, the judges on the panel appear skeptical of this argument, focusing their analysis on the secondary sale of the copycat NFTs, not the additional criticisms from Ripps and Cahen.</p><p>Circuit Judge Morgan Christen expressed doubt, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m still not seeing it,&#8221; and suggested they were looking for a clearer principle to determine whether this legal action is permissible.</p><h2>Legal Battle Unfolds as Artist Accuses Bored Ape NFTs of Controversial Imagery</h2><p>In January 2022, Ripps began posting on his social media claiming BAYC NFT artwork contained racist caricatures of Black and Asian individuals, and that the project&#8217;s logo and branding incorporated references to Nazi symbolism and language.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://youtu.be/XpH3O6mnZvw"></oembed></figure><p>In mid-May, Ryder Ripps launched RR/BAYC (Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club), an NFT project that directly borrowed imagery and names from BAYC as a form of conceptual art protest.</p><p>Later In June 2022, Yuga Labs initiated legal proceedings against Ripps and Cahen, accusing them of making millions of dollars through trademark infringement, false advertising, cybersquatting, amongst other charges. This legal action stemmed from the release of a derivative NFT collection named RR/BAYC.</p><p>Yuga Labs&#8217; legal team contended that RR/BAYC was intentionally causing confusion among potential BAYC customers, leading them to believe that RR/BAYC had a legitimate association with Yuga Labs.</p><p>In response, Ripps has argued that the RR/BAYC project serves as a form of satire and appropriation, with the intention of protesting and educating people about BAYC and the world of NFTs.</p><p>In April, a United States District Court for the Central District of California found that Ripps and Cahen had <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bored-ape-yacht-club-copycats-dealt-legal-blow-by-us-court.htm">infringed</a> Yuga Lab&rsquo;s trademarks with their NFT collection.</p><p>The court has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.855658/gov.uscourts.cacd.855658.225.0.pdf">ruled</a> that Yuga Labs is entitled to an injunction and damages, which will later be determined at trial to assess the scope of damages to be paid to Yuga Labs.</p><p>However, the Californian District Court Judge John Walter has already held a bench trial to assess the scope of damages but is yet to announce the conclusion of the case, including the potential damages fee to be paid.</p>

Such cases have led to legal disputes in both the U.K. and the U.S.</p><p>Dame Caroline Dinenage MP, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, expressed concerns about the unauthorized use and promotion of artists&#8217; work.</p><p>&#8220;Artists are at risk of seeing the fruits of their hard work pinched and promoted without permission while fraudulent and misleading adverts add an extra layer of jeopardy for investors involved in what is already an inherently risky business.&#8221;</p><p>The committee initiated an inquiry into NFTs in November to delve deeper into the growing phenomenon.</p><p>In addition to addressing copyright infringement, the report also raised concerns about the release of tokens by U.K. football clubs.&nbsp;</p><p>These tokens offer members exclusive benefits such as voting rights on club decisions, access to merchandise, and unique experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>The committee highlighted the potential financial risks associated with fans speculating on sports-based crypto assets, which could harm supporters and tarnish the reputation of football clubs.</p><p>&#8220;In the world of sport, clubs are promoting volatile crypto asset schemes to extract additional money from loyal supporters, often with promises of privileges and perks that fail to materialize,&#8221; Dinenage said.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the committee urged those involved in promoting NFTs to assume responsibility for consumer protection.&nbsp;</p><p>This call for accountability emphasizes the importance of safeguarding individuals who engage with this emerging market.</p><h2>New U.K. Regulations Come into Effect</h2><p>The&nbsp;<strong>United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</strong>&nbsp;has implemented new rules, which require crypto firms to register with the financial regulator and have their marketing materials approved by an FCA-authorized firm.</p><p>Key updates include exchanges providing clear warnings to customers about the risks associated with crypto investments.&nbsp;</p><p>Marketing materials must be fair, transparent, and not misleading. Additionally, a 24-hour cooling-off period for new customers is required.</p><p>While the FCA extended the deadline for implementing technically challenging features like the cooling-off period until January 2024, firms are expected to adhere to the &#8220;core rules&#8221; from October 8.</p><p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchanges-adapt-coinbase-revolut-binance-update-apps-for-uk-regulations-heres-latest.htm">reported</a>, leading crypto exchanges&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>, Revolut, and&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>&nbsp;have updated their mobile and web applications to comply with the new regulations.</p><p>Coinbase and Revolut informed their customers via email about the changes, which included the addition of &#8220;risk disclaimers&#8221; for crypto transactions. Users were also requested to update their mobile applications accordingly.</p><p>Binance, on the other hand, launched a dedicated webpage specifically for its UK customers.&nbsp;</p><p>The exchange temporarily halted operations through its mobile app but later resumed, assuring its British users of compliance with the new regulations.</p>

the announcement read.&nbsp;</p><p>With the launch of OpenSea Studio, creators now have full control over the entire NFT drop process, allowing them to configure allowlists, upload media and metadata with previews, and create dedicated project pages.&nbsp;</p><p>The platform also enables users to mint NFTs directly into their personal wallets, expanding their creative possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenSea Studio supports a wide range of OpenSea-compatible blockchains, which include&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/"><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/matic-matic-network/"><strong>Polygon (MATIC)</strong></a>, Klaytn,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/"><strong>Solana (SOL)</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/arbitrum/"><strong>Arbitrum (ARB)</strong></a>, Optimism,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/"><strong>Avalanche (AVAX)</strong></a>, BNB, Zora, and Base.</p><h2>OpenSea Studio Touts User-Friendly Interface</h2><p>According to OpenSea, one of the standout features of OpenSea Studio is its user-friendly interface, which eliminates the need for technical expertise when launching NFT projects.&nbsp;</p><p>It also allows collectors to mint NFTs using credit or debit cards, simplifying the acquisition process.</p><p>The platform said it has plans to enhance OpenSea Studio with additional functionality in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>Users can expect new collection pages that offer immersive multimedia experiences, including videos, images, and text modules.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the platform will introduce improved features such as roadmaps and FAQs to enhance user engagement.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;This will allow all creators and brands to showcase their work on a richer surface, and make it easier for collectors to learn about projects, right on the collection page.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>OpenSea Continues to Expand Market Footprint</h2><p>OpenSea has been actively expanding its market footprint in the competitive NFT industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, the marketplace&nbsp;<a href="https://fr.cryptonews.com/news/opensea-pro-envisage-de-recuperer-des-parts-de-marche-a-blur.htm">introduced OpenSea Pro</a>, a platform that aggregates listings from 170 different markets, offering traders the most competitive deals available.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenSea Pro also provides live cross-marketplace data, delivering near-real-time updates on user and collection activity across all NFT marketplaces, making it a valuable tool for traders and collectors alike.</p><p>While OpenSea continues to innovate and expand, it has faced challenges along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, the marketplace experienced a security breach that potentially exposed users&#8217; API keys.</p><p>It is worth noting that despite the setbacks caused by the 2022 crypto crash,&nbsp;<strong>Web3&nbsp;</strong>continues to intrigue marketers, particularly in the activewear and luxury brand sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nfts-metaverse-activewear-luxury-brands-embrace-web3-innovation.htm">reported</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Byron Sorrells</strong>, CEO and co-founder of&nbsp;<strong>Dispatch</strong>, a platform facilitating friction-free purchases in various digital experiences, has said that the 2022 crash provided a much-needed distinction between speculation and the real utility of Web3 technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Sorrells claimed that he sees Web3 as a technology that augments existing practices rather than entirely replacing them.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame it took these big events for that to happen, but you do start to see that what&#8217;s survived are some genuine use cases,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
