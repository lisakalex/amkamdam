As a matter of fact, you can boast of the highest concentration of Bitcoin ATM&rsquo;s, service providers, and retailers who accept it as a means of payment. </p><p>Despite that, the regulatory climate concerning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the US is unclear and treats crypto investments like commodities rather than regular currency.</p><p>Nevertheless, bitcoin is still legal in the US and is recognized as a digital asset which can be used for trading or purchasing goods and services. </p><p>As such, many bitcoin marketplaces are operating within the US jurisdiction. Whether you want to buy bitcoin from a person, online broker, or stock exchange-like market, this short guide will help you to do just that. </p><h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-bitcoin-exchange-in-the-us?">How to choose the best bitcoin exchange in the US?</h2><p>Choosing a cryptocurrency exchange can be an overwhelming task. Most regular cryptocurrency traders have multiple cryptocurrency exchange accounts that they use for various purposes. Whether you need to access specific altcoins or trust some exchanges more than others depend entirely on you, but here are some common factors to pay attention to when choosing an exchange. </p><p><b>Jurisdiction of the exchange.</b> Despite the borderless nature of the digital currencies and the internet, the regulatory environment of the financial institutions you use still play a pivotal role. Make sure to use exchange is trustworthy, regulated, reputable, and you won&rsquo;t experience any issues when trying to access it from your country. </p><p>Check out our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange reviews</a> to get a comprehensive picture of differences between various crypto exchanges and their features.</p><p><b>Fees and transaction limits.</b> All cryptocurrency exchanges charge fees for trading, withdrawals, and, in some cases, deposits. Make sure that none of the charges come as a surprise. </p><p><b>Security.</b> See if the exchange has experienced any hacks in the past and whether it deployed appropriate security measures to prevent those from happening in the future. </p><p><b>Supported currencies.</b> All exchanges list different digital assets, fiat pairs, and stablecoins. Make sure that the exchange you sign up for has listed all the digital assets you want. Besides, some exchanges act as a fiat onramp, meaning that you can exchange your digital assets to your native currency in a blink of an eye. </p><p>To learn more on the subject of how to choose a cryptocurrency exchange, see our related guide on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-an-exchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to choose a cryptocurrency exchange. </a></p><h3 data-param="2" id="different-ways-of-buying-bitcoin-(btc)-in-the-us">Different ways of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in the US</h3><p>There are different ways to buy BTC in the US, and they all depend on your preferred payment method and medium.  You can buy bitcoin with cash, bank transfer or credit/debit card using your smartphone, computer, a local cryptocurrency ATM, and so on. In brief, BTC acquisition methods can be classified in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges</li><li>Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange services. </li><li>Bitcoin ATMs.</li><li>In-person trade.</li><li>Cash app.</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at each of these options.	</p><h2 id="1.-buy-and-sell-bitcoin-in-the-us-via-crypto-exchanges-or-brokerages">1.

Some of the best bitcoin and cryptocurrency on-ramps include platforms such as:</p><ul><li><a href="https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=62737&amp;nci=5343&amp;utm_campaign=english&amp;afp6=english&amp;utm_term=french&amp;afp2=guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinmama</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/xcoins" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Xcoins</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinbase</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitstamp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bitstamp</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">eToro</a></li><li>Gemini</li><li>CEX.io</li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kraken</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitfinex" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bitfinex</a></li><li><a href="https://changelly.com/?ref_id=28os9ll34i4cl6r1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changelly</a></li></ul><p>The possible transfer methods to the exchange include wire transfer, which takes from 1 to 3 days depending on your bank. Alternatively, you can use credit and debit cards (though you must mind the fees) as well as other cryptocurrencies. Besides, most of the above-mentioned cryptocurrency exchanges have multiple ways of accessing their platform, including browser applications and smartphone apps. </p><p>Keep in mind that most exchanges will require you to pass KYC/AML to purchase Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with fiat, so they are not entirely private. </p><h2 id="2.-buy-and-sell-bitcoin-in-the-us-using-peer-to-peer-(p2p)-platforms">2. Buy and sell bitcoin in the US using peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms</h2><p>If you don&rsquo;t want to use cryptocurrency exchanges, you can look for ways to buy and sell bitcoin directly from individuals or organizations. There are plenty of peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange services, which can be categorized as:</p><ol type="1"><li>P2P platforms and sales points.</li><li>Decentralized exchanges.</li></ol><p>P2P platforms are online marketplaces where you can connect to other Bitcoin users and traders. The most popular P2P exchanges include:</p><ol type="1"><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/localbitcoins" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LocalBitcoins</a></li><li>Paxful</li><li>Wall of Coins</li><li>BitQuick</li><li>Mycelium P2P platform</li></ol><p>All of them give you a slightly different interaction process and fees. The most commonly accepted one is LocalBitcoins, which work the following way:</p><ol type="1"><li>You register on the platform. In some cases, you will need to pass KYC/AML regulations.</li><li>You post an advertisement or look for one which offers you to buy or sell bitcoins with your preferred method of exchange. </li><li>Inspect their reputation on the platform (don&rsquo;t deal with untrustworthy accounts with a bad reputation).</li><li>You and your partner text each other and negotiate the terms of the deal.</li><li>You follow through agreement and finalize the deal.</li></ol><p>Many individuals are willing to exchange the perceived convenience of cryptocurrency exchanges and deal in the P2P marketplaces instead. Many of them offer enhanced privacy and anonymity which come in handy in the currency surveillance economy and thus is considered one of the safest ways to deal in bitcoins.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="Bisq decentralized exchange buy btc US" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5d2/d620bb575d.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5d2/d620bb575d.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5d2/d620bb575d.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5d2/d620bb575d.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5d2/d620bb575d.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5d2/d620bb575d.jpg 1326w"><figcaption>Bisq decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.</figcaption></figure><p>Alternatively, you could try a decentralized Bitcoin exchange like <b>BISQ</b> or <b>Coinffeine</b>.

There may also be limits on how much bitcoins you can buy and sell so despite the convenience, the high ATM fees and friction in the purchasing process may outweigh the benefits of using them in the first place. </p><h2 id="4.-buy-or-sell-bitcoin-in-the-united-states-in-person">4. Buy or sell bitcoin in the United States in person</h2><p>Bitcoin enables convenient person to person wealth exchanges. You can always look for people nearby or in your local community who are willing to trade bitcoin with you in person. </p><p>One of the easiest ways to find local bitcoin traders is to attend or organize a local bitcoin or cryptocurrency meetup. There you can meet all sorts of people who might want to buy or sell you some BTC in private or cash, leaving you without any risk of exposing your identity or sacrificing your anonymity. </p><h2 id="5.-other-bitcoin-sales-points-in-the-us">5.

</figure><p>You&rsquo;re thinking about buying bitcoin, but you&rsquo;re not quite there yet. Something is missing, but you&rsquo;re not sure what. Well, you won&rsquo;t learn everything there is about Bitcoin and blockchain in a day, though there are few things you should be aware of before you buy bitcoin.</p><p>This guide focuses on three things you should know before you buy bitcoin.</p><ol type="1">
<li>What is bitcoin actually and what does it mean?</li>
<li>How profitable is bitcoin trading?</li>
<li>How to avoid bitcoin frauds and scams?</li>
</ol><p>Let&rsquo;s have a closer look at each of these.</p><h2 id="before-you-buy-bitcoin-#1:-what-is-bitcoin-and-what-does-it-mean?">Before you buy bitcoin #1: What is Bitcoin and what does it mean?</h2><p>First of all, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-cryptocurrency.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrencies</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> are nothing like traditional finance. In fact, they were created in response to traditional banking failure during the 2008 global financial crisis.</p><p>The creator of Bitcoin, a mysterious group or individual <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satoshi Nakamoto</a></b> strictly believed in personal freedom to transact with whomever you want, individual privacy (which is why he remained anonymous), and fragility of centralized traditional finance (evident in the corruption and abuse of its power, which also leads to detrimental events like financial crisis).</p><p>Modern money system relies on inflating people&rsquo;s hard-earned cash by design to discourage saving and encourage spending. Precisely for this reason, Bitcoin was made to be <b>deflationary</b> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but not in a way you think</a>).</p><p>Digital cash systems (like DigiCash or E-Gold) were already conceived in the &rsquo;90s but failed in their implementation. According to Satoshi Nakamoto, it was their centralized nature that led to their failure. That&rsquo;s why the individual or group of people behind the Satoshi&rsquo;s pseudonym designed bitcoin to be <b>a completely decentralized system</b> with <b>no central authority</b> or <b>central point of failure</b> (like central and commercial banks) to control it, freeze your account if they don&rsquo;t like you, censor your transactions or simply confiscate your money without your permission. Decentralization is a security feature, too &#8211; there&rsquo;s no central institution or data center to be hacked, which is why Bitcoin is the most secure financial system ever made.</p><p>Essentially, the Bitcoin Network is an open-source P2P project much like <b>Wikipedia</b> or <b>Linux-based</b> operational systems. Anyone is free to run a bitcoin node, develop applications on top of its protocol, or fork it, which makes Bitcoin the ultimate people&rsquo;s money and free speech tool &#8211; something that our civilization has never had before.</p><h2 id="before-you-buy-bitcoin-#2:-there-are-no-guaranteed-profits-in-bitcoin">Before you buy bitcoin #2: There are no guaranteed profits in bitcoin</h2><p>The internet is full of pieces of advice <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about buying bitcoins</a>, but you need to keep in mind that not everything applies to every instance. Your mileage may vary, as they say.</p><p>Many people looking to buy bitcoin still treat it as a get-rich-quick scheme. That is not entirely wrong &#8211; bitcoin has made a lot of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/this-20-y-o-crypto-millionaire-has-a-message-for-you-3871.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early adopters filthy rich</a>. Just look at this incredible performance during the first ten years of bitcoins existence &#8211; it&rsquo;s definitely something to behold.</p><figure class="center"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="bitcoin price history before you buy btc" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5ce/3ab1e5f5f0.jpg 1458w">

</figure><p>Despite a successful decade, there are no guaranteed returns in bitcoin. In fact, bitcoin is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/will-bitcoin-ever-be-stable.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very volatile</a>, and many people have lost their hard-earned money, too. A golden rule to follow here is that you should never buy bitcoin for more than you can afford to lose. Keep in mind that despite the security of a decentralized network, Bitcoin is still a social experiment in its infancy. It may succeed, or it may fail, and no one knows for sure which one it will be.</p><p>The situation is best illustrated in the following tweet by Bitcoin developer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/jameson-lopp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jameson Lopp</a>.</p><figure class="center" style="max-width: 698px;"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 698px, 100vw" alt="before you buy bitcoin jameson lopp" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5ce/3aed2691f7.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5ce/3aed2691f7.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5ce/3aed2691f7.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5ce/3aed2691f7.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5ce/3aed2691f7.jpg 900w">

So, if an exchange mismanages its operations, they can lose your funds, too, and it has happened many times before (ever head of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/mt-gox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mt. Gox</a>?).</p><p>Whether it is out of sheer ignorance or convenience, many people still keep their bitcoins in a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-it-is-risky-to-leave-your-cryptocurrency-in-exchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency exchange wallet</a>. This makes exchanges an ideal target for a hacking attack. It&rsquo;s like a honeypot with minimal risk and maximum reward. That&rsquo;s why hackers develop extremely elaborate schemes on how to rob cryptocurrency exchanges. Unfortunately, some of them are successful. Ultimately, there&rsquo;s no point to rely on centralized services if you want to use a decentralized system like bitcoin. It just goes against the entire idea.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

Here are our top ten Bitcoin security tips to follow.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="1.-store-private-keys-offline">1. Store Private Keys Offline</h3><p>It should go without saying that your private key is your absolute crypto lifeline and should not be known to anyone you deem untrustworthy. To keep them safe, you can store them on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin-cold-storage.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Bitcoin cold storage</a>, such as a computer with no internet connection. It will help you to not fall prey to malware or hacker attacks. Also, private keys can be safely stored on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-make-a-paper-bitcoin-wallet.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a piece of paper</a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special hardware</a> (also a cold wallet), similar to a USB key.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="2.-use-dedicated-hardware">2. Use Dedicated Hardware</h3><p>You can make use of a dedicated USB key in moving data from your online computer to your offline computer. This is to minimize its exposure to potential viruses or hackers. Some people even take a step further and dedicate an entire offline computer to use as an offline wallet.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="3.-make-use-of-hardware-wallet">3. Make Use of Hardware Wallet</h3><figure class="center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="Bitcoin security hardware wallet" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cb/6ecb35f8d1.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cb/6ecb35f8d1.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cb/6ecb35f8d1.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cb/6ecb35f8d1.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cb/6ecb35f8d1.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cb/6ecb35f8d1.jpg 6000w"></a><figcaption>Bitcoin hardware wallet by Ledger. Source: Pexels. </figcaption></figure><p>You may already know this, but using <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-store-cryptocurrency-safely.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hardware wallet</a> is perhaps the safest way to store your Bitcoin. This wallet effectively makes use of an encrypted USB key that comes with an onboard computer running in its own special operating system dedicated to operating <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin-wallets-for-beginners.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Bitcoin wallet</a>.</p><p>The most popular Bitcoin hardware wallets are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ledger</a></li><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Trezor</a></li><li>KeepKey</li><li>BitLox</li></ul><h3 data-param="2" id="4.-secure-your-pc">4. Secure Your PC</h3><p>Always be aware of whether your antivirus software is up to date, as well as your other security options. It only takes just one security vulnerability to have your computer hacked &#8211; you must remain vigilant at all times, avoid malicious websites, and learn as much as about cybersecurity as you can. </p><h3 data-param="2" id="5.-use-linux">5. Use Linux</h3><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="bitcoin security use linux" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cb/6ed494ed25.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cb/6ed494ed25.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cb/6ed494ed25.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cb/6ed494ed25.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cb/6ed494ed25.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cb/6ed494ed25.jpg 1280w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It may sound like what hackers in a bad movie would say, but it is true: using the Linux operating system is a secure choice. Linux has the best record of resisting any USB based attacks so if you can, use it for transferring Bitcoin-related transactions from online to offline computers.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="6.-make-backups">6. Make Backups</h3><p>There&rsquo;s a saying that goes, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.&rdquo; It applies to keeping your Bitcoin safe and sound, too. Kept in a secure place, a backup of your cryptocurrency wallet may save you from hardware failures, unforeseen accidents, and human errors. It will also allow you to restore your wallet in case your PC or phone gets stolen.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="7.-protect-your-identity">7. Protect Your Identity</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/attacks-on-bitcoin-holders-are-on-the-rise-how-to-protect-yo-1466.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violent attacks on bitcoin holders at gunpoint</a> are increasing, so you would be smart to keep low-profile on your investment activities and holdings. In one of the recent cases, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-community-talk-guns-after-another-brutal-robbery-3428.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 38-year-old Dutchman was tortured with a drill</a> in an attempt to steal his crypto holdings. Therefore, privacy and anonymity are good not only for your crypto holdings but for your safety and wellbeing, too.</p><p>Do not divulge any personal details which can be used to access your personal information &#8211; PINs, phone numbers, email addresses, passwords, etc. Not even your mother&rsquo;s maiden name or the name of your first pet, as these are common backup questions. Avoid suspicious transactions that involve the exchange of personal details &#8211; if you do not have a good feeling about a deal, do not be afraid to pull the plug.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="8.-use-an-escrow-service">8. Use an Escrow Service</h3><p>When you need to buy or sell something and you aren&rsquo;t sure who is on the other side, you can use an &ldquo;escrow service.&rdquo; </p><p>In these cases, the person who needs to make the payment sends their Bitcoins to the escrow service while they wait to receive the item they are buying. Meanwhile, the seller knows their money is safe with the escrow service and sends the agreed item. When the buyer receives the merchandise, they notify the escrow service to finalize the payment. That way, both the buyer and seller remain safe.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="9.-use-two-factor-authentication-(2fa)">9. Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3><p>An additional layer of security is necessary for crypto security. Although it may be tiring to go through the authentication process all the time, it is way better off than losing your coins. </p><p>2FA includes a second layer of protection wherein after entering passwords or transaction details the system sends in a verification code on your trusted device so it becomes too difficult for hackers to intervene and steal your funds.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="bitcoin security tips 2fa two-factor authentication" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cb/6ef6cb361b.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cb/6ef6cb361b.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cb/6ef6cb361b.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cb/6ef6cb361b.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cb/6ef6cb361b.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cb/6ef6cb361b.jpg 1200w"><figcaption>Source: Wikipedia Commons.</figcaption></figure><h3 data-param="2" id="10.-use-multisig">10. Use MultiSig</h3><p>This is an additional step created mainly for corporate users, but anyone can use it.

Keep your mouth closed about your digital wealth.</b> That means no bragging about how much you have made on your last trade on crypto trading Facebook groups (at least not under your real name), no telling people in bars after a few drinks that you bought bitcoin &ldquo;years ago&rdquo;, and no pictures of your bitcoin wallet to show off your wealth. There are zero benefits to bragging about your crypto holdings, only drawbacks. </p><p>Otherwise, you may risk potential violent attempts to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-robberies-at-gunpoint-increasing-in-frequency-1238.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steal your wealth and ruin your health, or even life</a>.</p><p><b>2. You should not post any of your wallet addresses online.</b> When you do so, criminals can see how much cryptocurrency you own and make you a target. Should you need to post a wallet address online for whatever reason, make sure not to keep a lot of wealth in it and only use it for the sole purpose only (such as collecting donation or receiving small payments).</p><p><b>3. Remember that transactions from your wallets into other wallets of yours can be viewed publicly (on most blockchains).</b> Hence, if you are moving large amounts from wallets linked to your name, you may want to consider using <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-privacy-coins-features-and-differences-2725.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an anonymous cryptocurrency</a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/coin-mixers-how-do-they-work-and-should-you-use-them-2070.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a coin mixer</a> to make the transactions impossible to trace for criminals. Ideally, however, you do not want to be posting any wallet addresses publicly online (although that&rsquo;s not always possible or convenient).</p><p><b>4. If you consider yourself a target</b>, it may be wise to have <b>a decoy wallet</b> at hand that contains a comparatively small amount of your overall crypto wealth. That way, should it ever come to an armed robbery,  you can use the funds in that wallet to send to the assailants in hopes that they will take that money and leave.</p><p>Continue learning more about crypto security by checking our article about <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-it-is-risky-to-leave-your-cryptocurrency-in-exchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why you shouldn&rsquo;t keep your crypto funds on cryptocurrency exchanges.</a></p>

They offer the lowest fees, have 24/7 customer support, offer the highest purchase limits, and are generally easy to find. Besides, CoinFlip Bitcoin ATMs are extremely fast, so you will receive your bitcoin right after completing the transaction. You can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.coinflip.tech/bitcoin-atm">click here</a> to find the closest Bitcoin ATM near you.</p><p>A typical process of buying bitcoin with cash via a Bitcoin ATM goes like this:</p><ol><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm"><strong>Get a Bitcoin wallet.</strong></a> Any Bitcoin wallet will do, but having a mobile wallet like <strong>Samourai</strong>, <strong>Blockchain.info</strong>, <strong>Jaxx</strong>, <strong>Mycellium</strong> or even <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-make-a-paper-bitcoin-wallet.htm">a paper wallet</a> is the most convenient way. If you want to be sure of your crypto assets security, a hardware wallet like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor"><strong>Trezor </strong></a>or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger"><strong>Ledger</strong></a> will do.</li><li><strong>Find the nearest Bitcoin ATM</strong> using a service like CointATMradar or any similar Bitcoin ATM map.</li><li><strong>Place an order.</strong> Approach the machine and follow its instructions. Select Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency of your choice and confirm your order. Mind that some ATM&rsquo;s may ask you to verify your ID or phone number.</li><li><strong>Scan the QR code and complete the purchase.</strong> Access your BTC wallet and scan your public key using the ATM&rsquo;s camera. Insert cash into the machine and pay for the order.</li><li><strong>Receive bitcoins to your wallet.</strong> Once your transaction is confirmed, you will receive BTC to your wallet. That&rsquo;s it! You&rsquo;ve just bought your bitcoins with cash.</li></ol><p>Also, be aware of the hefty Bitcoin ATM transaction fees. In some cases, the transaction fees can reach up to 7-15% or even more. At the moment, CoinFlip charges 6.99% of the transaction amount for purchases and 3.99% for sales.</p><p>If you do not live in the United States of can&rsquo;t find a CoinFlip Bitcoin ATM near you, you can look for the closest one using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://coinatmradar.com/"><strong>CoinATMradar.com</strong></a> or a similar online map.</p><h3>3. Buy bitcoin with cash in person</h3><p>If you don&rsquo;t want to rely on any third-party services, then the best way is to find a person to deal with yourself. Place advertisements on local advertisement boards, websites, social media or forums or simply check with your friends.</p><p>Alternatively, you can attend your local Bitcoin meetups (check sites like meetup.com) and find like-minded people there. Maybe some of them will want to buy or sell bitcoin with cash.</p><p>However, remember that <strong>safety comes first</strong>. Never reveal your actual name or where you live in those advertisements because being known for holding bitcoin is getting <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-community-talk-guns-after-another-brutal-robbery-3428.htm">increasingly more dangerous</a>.</p><p>Maintain low-profile, and always agree to meet with another person in a safe public space, such as a local bank, coffee shop, mall, or other places with many people.</p><h3>4. Buy BTC with cash using cash deposit service</h3><p>Some Bitcoin trading platforms offer an option to deposit cash right into seller&rsquo;s or service&rsquo;s bank account. Such services include:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/localbitcoins"><strong>LocalBitcoins</strong></a></li><li><strong>Wall of Coins</strong></li><li><strong>Paxful</strong></li><li><strong>BitQuick</strong></li></ul><p>All in all, buying Bitcoins with cash offers more privacy and anonymity compared with centralized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a>, but you should also be more cautious of bad actors and scams. Before meeting a seller, always analyze their reviews and feedback from previous customers.</p><p>Check our other guide if you want to learn more about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoins.htm">different ways to purchase bitcoin.</a></p>

Is Bitcoin mining profitable, though? It depends on how much effort is being put into mining across the network. Bitcoin mining profitability is on the decline, in total, as mining is getting more expensive. </p><p>Understanding how to mine Bitcoin starts with knowing that it is not free money. You also have to know how to choose hardware for Bitcoin mining, and what kind of Bitcoin mining software you need. You need to do your research and base your choices on what works best for you. You can figure out how much you can gain by using a Bitcoin mining calculator; many are available online.</p><p>Since it&rsquo;s almost impossible to mine Bitcoin with your home computer, you will probably need specialized hardware called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/these-miners-might-be-dangerous-but-avoiding-them-is-complic-1714.htm">ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits)</a>. Originally, Bitcoin&rsquo;s creator Satoshi Nakamoto intended for Bitcoin to be mined on CPUs (your laptop or desktop computer). However, Bitcoin miners discovered they could get more power from graphic cards. Graphic cards were then surpassed by ASICs.</p><p>ASICs can get very expensive, however. If you&rsquo;d rather not buy them or not mine Bitcoin by yourself for any reason, read our guide on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-mine-bitcoins.htm">mining Bitcoin</a>. It will answer questions such as what is a Bitcoin mining pool or what is cloud Bitcoin mining.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In traditional fiat money systems, governments simply print more money when they need to. But in bitcoin, money isn&rsquo;t printed at all &ndash; it is discovered. Computers around the world &lsquo;mine&rsquo; for coins by competing with each other.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/b0e9c0c70b.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/b0e9c0c70b.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cc/b0e9c0c70b.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cc/b0e9c0c70b.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cc/b0e9c0c70b.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cc/b0e9c0c70b.jpg 2484w" alt="how does bitcoin mining work" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In traditional fiscal system, governments and banks can (and do) issue more money whenever they want to. However, no one can do that in Bitcoin, since the money issuance process revolves around mining &#8211; an extremely clever process of confirming Bitcoin transactions and recording them on a decentralized ledger at the same time.</p><p>But how does Bitcoin mining work? In this guide, we dive into the fundamentals of Bitcoin mining and the key processes behind it.</p><h2 id="what-is-bitcoin-mining?">What is Bitcoin mining?</h2><p>Bitcoin mining can be defined as a process of &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; bitcoins. Much like gold, bitcoins are artificially limited, and there can never be more than 21 million BTC. Also, like gold, you need to allocate resources and hard work to extract it. However, unlike mining gold, bitcoins are designed to be minted using the computational power of millions of competing computers from all over the world.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="how does bitcoin mining work" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/d89a6679f9.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/d89a6679f9.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cc/d89a6679f9.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cc/d89a6679f9.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cc/d89a6679f9.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cc/d89a6679f9.jpg 1248w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It may be tricky to wrap your head around it at first, but in fact, it is quite genius. Everyone is free to run a Bitcoin node and try their luck at mining, but no one is guaranteed to be profitable at it. However, these millions of computers ensure one thing &#8211; the functionality and security of the network. </p><p>If you want to dive deeper into the topic of &ldquo;what is bitcoin mining,&rdquo; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-bitcoin-mining-works.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see our namesake guide</a>.</p><p>For now, all you need to know is that Bitcoin mining serves multiple purposes:</p><ol type="1"><li>Secures the Bitcoin network.</li><li>Incentivizes the miners to allocate their resources to the Bitcoin network.</li><li>Confirms Bitcoin transactions.</li><li>Ensures the decentralization of Bitcoin (which makes it free global peer-to-peer (P2P) money).</li><li>Makes bitcoins scarce and hard to get. </li><li>Penalizes bad actors in the network by making it unprofitable to go against the system. </li></ol><h2 id="how-does-mining-work?">How does mining work?</h2><p>People can send bitcoins (or any other digital assets) all the time, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean much unless someone keeps tabs on all of them. This is especially true with digital assets which are super easy to copy. So to have a fully functioning digital cash you need to keep a record on who paid what and to whom, and that&rsquo;s essentially what banks do for us. </p><p>But how do we know that person A has sent bitcoins to person B if there are no organizations to oversee it? How do we prevent double-spending where person A sends the same bitcoins to person C?</p><p>The answer is Bitcoin mining.</p><p>The Bitcoin network replaces banks and other intermediaries by processing all the network transactions, putting them into a list, and locking them up into immutable blocks. Eventually, it&rsquo;s the miners who do all the work &#8211; allocate their hashing power to confirm those transactions and record them into a distributed public ledger.</p><p>Bitcoin mining requires a computer and special Bitcoin program (client). When you install Bitcoin client on your computer, you become a miner and can compete with rival miners in solving complex math puzzles. Every ten minutes, all computers try to solve a block with the latest transaction data in it using cryptographic hash functions.</p><h2 id="what-are-bitcoin-hashes?">What are bitcoin hashes?</h2><p>Every solved block is added to the public ledger. Essentially, the distributed public ledger consists of a long list of blocks which make up the Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a>.</p><p>The Bitcoin distributed ledger aka blockchain is a public record of all the transactions that took place on the network. Since the file is public, it can be explored by anyone using any bitcoin block explorer. A new block is added to the ledger approximately every 10 minutes. Therefore, the blockchain size is continuously increasing. An updated copy on a new block is shared between miners, so everyone always knows what&rsquo;s going on.</p><p>Now, what purpose does that serve? </p><p>In traditional systems, a ledger must be trusted, meaning that there has to be a trusted person or entity which oversees it and guarantees no one tampers with it. In the Bitcoin network, that role is played by the miners.</p><p>When a block of transactions is ready, the miners need to process it. They apply the SHA-256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm to turn into a seemingly random sequence of numbers and letters known as a hash. The hash is stored together with the block at the end of the blockchain at that particular point in time, which serves as a proof of work and validation. </p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="bitcoin mining" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/d8a881f04e.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/d8a881f04e.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cc/d8a881f04e.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cc/d8a881f04e.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cc/d8a881f04e.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cc/d8a881f04e.jpg 1200w"><figcaption>Bitcoin mining \&#8221;farm.\&#8221; Source: Wikipedia Commons.</figcaption></figure><p>But how are these hashes so reliable? </p><p>Well, it&rsquo;s easy to make a hash out of data included in the Bitcoin block. However, it is practically impossible to decrypt the data just by looking at the hash because it is entirely random and each hash is unique. If you change even one symbol in the original input, you will get an entirely different hash. Therefore, it is completely impossible to predict the output and the only way to match it is by blind guessing, which is what miners do.</p><p>Nevertheless, the miners don&rsquo;t merely wrap the transactions into hashes but use some other pieces of data, too. One of these pieces is the hash of the last block.</p><p>Since each block&rsquo;s hash contains the hash of the previous block, it works as like a digital a wax seal. It guarantees that the produced block, as well as every block before it, is legitimate. If the block is falsified, other miners can see it and reject it.</p><p>In other words, a fake transaction would change a block along with its original hash. Since each block&rsquo;s hash is used to create the next block&rsquo;s hash, that would affect all blocks on the chain. So if someone checked it, they would immediately notice the difference between correct and false blocks since they don&rsquo;t match the ones already verified on the blockchain.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how miners &ldquo;seal off&rdquo; a block. Now let&rsquo;s have a look at the competition part.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="bitcoin miner" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/d8b087bbdb.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/d8b087bbdb.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cc/d8b087bbdb.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cc/d8b087bbdb.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cc/d8b087bbdb.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cc/d8b087bbdb.jpg 2070w"><figcaption>Bitcoin \&#8221;mining.\&#8221; Source: Freepik.com</figcaption></figure><h2 id="competing-for-coins">Competing for coins</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve already established that the only way to seal off a block is to guess the output of the hash correctly, and the most efficient way to do so is random guessing done by computers. </p><p>All miners compete with each other who can guess it faster using the mining software. The miner who is first to do this mines the block (which takes billions of random computer-generated guesses from all over the world) and reaps the block reward which is currently set at 12.5 BTC per block and decreases by half every 210,000 blocks. At the current rate, it means the block reward will fall to 6.25 BTC per block sometime in 2021.</p><p>Essentially, it serves as an incentive to keep on mining to keep the system working. Since the block rewards are continually decreasing, it is expected BTC price will continue to appreciate. However, block rewards aren&rsquo;t the only incentive mechanism for the miners, as they also share the collective Bitcoin transaction fees.</p><p>Check out this guide to learn more about the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value of bitcoins</a>.</p>

Source: Pixabay.</p><h3>1.Set up a software Bitcoin wallet</h3><p>The easiest way to get a Bitcoin wallet is to download and install a free software wallet app or client. A software wallet is a program that stores private and public keys and interacts with blockchain to enable users to send and receive digital currency and monitor their balance. There are two types of software wallets &#8211; mobile and desktop.</p><p><strong>Mobile software wallets</strong> are lightweight Bitcoin clients that enable you to carry your bitcoins everywhere. It can be extremely convenient at times. To set it up, you have to download a Bitcoin wallet of choice. There are many of those in the app store, but here are a few you can trust:</p><ul><li><strong>Mycellium</strong></li><li><strong>Bread (BRD) wallet</strong></li><li><strong>Bitcoin wallet</strong></li><li><strong>Electrum</strong></li><li><strong>Samourai</strong></li></ul><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="how to set up a mobile bitcoin wallet" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cd/e9c0c528a0.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cd/e9c0c528a0.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cd/e9c0c528a0.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cd/e9c0c528a0.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cd/e9c0c528a0.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cd/e9c0c528a0.jpg 1280w"></figure><p>Mobile bitcoin wallet.

Web-based wallets store your private keys online on a server controlled by an admin group. Some bitcoin web wallets, like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase">Coinbase</a>, conveniently link between your mobile and software wallets. You can access this wallet anywhere where you have an internet connection, which makes it a popular and convenient choice.</p><p>However, be aware the website is in charge of your private keys and can take your bitcoin out of your control at any time, which is why web wallets are good for storing only limited amounts of bitcoin.

These wallets can be carried with you and don&rsquo;t rely on keeping funds in a third party&#8217;s hands. However, you need to buy them. They start from $50, so in most cases, it only makes sense to buy one if you plan on storing $1000 or more in bitcoin.</p><p>The most recommended Bitcoin hardware wallets include:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger"><strong>Ledger</strong></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor"><strong>Trezor</strong></a></li><li><strong>BitLox</strong></li><li><strong>KeepKey</strong></li></ul><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/602/d649fde329.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/602/d649fde329.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/602/d649fde329.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/602/d649fde329.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/602/d649fde329.png 900w"></figure><p>Setting them up means following the instructions provided by the manufacturer, as, again, each wallet is different.

The difference of Bitcoin from&#8230;</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c8/a7c3f5c902.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c8/a7c3f5c902.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c8/a7c3f5c902.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c8/a7c3f5c902.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c8/a7c3f5c902.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c8/a7c3f5c902.jpg 1280w" alt="Difference Between Bitcoin and Traditional Currencies" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The relationship between Bitcoin and traditional currencies is a complex one. Bitcoin seeks to undermine the traditional way of dealing with money, so Bitcoin versus traditional money is a natural opposition. This article outlines the main differences between the two.</p><h2 id="traits-of-money">Traits of money</h2><p>Over the history of humanity, money took many forms. There was barter, physical objects like rocks or shells, precious metals, bank notes, paper bills, digital money, and finally decentralized digital currencies like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. </p><p>Over time, people noticed the most desirable traits that money should have. For the currency to be useful and convenient, it should be:</p><ul><li><b>Divisible</b> &mdash; can be turned into smaller pieces for certain uses like paying a specific amount or micro-payments.</li><li><b>Non-consumable</b> &mdash; cannot be consumed for purposes other than an exchange of value.</li><li><b>Portable</b> &mdash; can be easily carried around. </li><li><b>Durable</b> &mdash; does not wear away or depreciate through time or in certain conditions. </li><li><b>Secure</b> &mdash; cannot be counterfeited. </li><li><b>Easily transferable.</b> </li><li><b>Scarce</b> &mdash; cannot be replicated without end. </li><li><b>Fungible</b> &mdash; each piece has the same value as its equivalent.</li><li><b>Recognizable</b> &mdash; it is recognized and accepted as a means of transaction.</li></ul><p>Here is how gold, fiat currencies, and Bitcoin compare in the context of these traits.</p><figure class="center" style="max-width: 652px"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 652px, 100vw" alt="difference between bitcoin and traditional currencies" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c8/f4ab7110d7.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c8/f4ab7110d7.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c8/f4ab7110d7.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c8/f4ab7110d7.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c8/f4ab7110d7.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c8/f4ab7110d7.png 652w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The main difference of Bitcoin from traditional currencies lies in the fact that no one controls Bitcoin as it is <b>decentralized</b>. It allows Bitcoin to be an independent peer-to-peer money system that can function regardless of anyone&#8217;s wishes. It relies on the combined computing power of the network participants, each of which is equal among themselves &mdash; nobody is more or less important than the others. Additionally, it helps bring down the cost of using the system by ideally eliminating fees and transaction times, both of which banks need to stay in business.</p><p>No one can have an influence over your money and transactions you send or receive. </p><p>In contrast, fiat currencies rely on centralized entities like central banks, commercial banks, governments, payment processors like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/visa-ceo-bitcoin-is-not-a-payment-system-1041.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VISA</a> or <b>Mastercard</b>, and other intermediaries. Any of those organizations have an authority to decide whether to approve your transaction, whether you can send money to certain people or organizations, or if the money you&rsquo;re using is legal or not. These processes also include in-depth surveillance and data-sharing on everything you do with your money. </p><p>Other significant difference is that unlike fiat, Bitcoin is not <b>sovereign</b>. There is nothing backing Bitcoin, which means it&rsquo;s value is not attached to any political or economic situation, and it can exist independently outside of the traditional system.  </p><p>Last but not least, Bitcoin introduces a new dimension of <b>programmability</b>. It means that in the future, Bitcoin transactions can be attached to smart contracts or other programs that execute only after certain conditions are met. Such a feature would allow building additional solutions on top of bitcoin, such as reputation management systems, insurance contracts, or similar. Such contracts would not require any third-party intervention to execute. Essentially, it introduces a new dimension to the concept of traditional cash. </p><h2 id="but-bitcoin-isnt-backed-by-anything?">But Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t backed by anything?</h2><p>When asking how Bitcoin is different from the dollar, most people will tell you that it is because Bitcoin is not backed by anything. This is not entirely true: while Bitcoin indeed has nothing physical to back it, neither does the dollar. Historically speaking, up until 1971, most currencies were backed by a commodity, usually gold or silver. This is not the case anymore. Also, there is plenty of room for the argument that every Bitcoin is covered by the amount of electricity used while mining it. </p><p>All in all, unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin:</p><ul><li>Has no central authority which claims it backs money. </li><li>Is a subject to deflation due to artificial scarcity, while central banks can print more money anytime.</li><li>Has every transaction forever recorded on an immutable public ledger.</li><li>Requires transaction fees to be paid to miners, which serves like paying taxes to the government, except that taxes can be evaded while it is impossible to complete a transfer without paying fees on the blockchain. </li><li>Transactions are done over the internet and include public addresses, while cash transactions are anonymous and leave no trail behind.</li></ul><p>Many people call Bitcoin the next step in the evolution of money. Since we have never had money like Bitcoin before, it is normal to question the concept and compare it with traditional currencies. </p><p>Hopefully, now you know the key differences between Bitcoin and conventional money. </p><p>If you liked this article, don&rsquo;t forget to share it with your friends.</p>
