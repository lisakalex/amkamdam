It is best known as the technology that underpins Bitcoin, but it has many other use cases. It is also often followed by myths and misconceptions. In this guide, we will give a detailed explanation of everything you wanted to know about blockchain. </p><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;what-is-blockchain?&lt;/b&gt;"><b>What is Blockchain?</b></h2><p>A blockchain is a type of database, or a collection of information, stored in so-called blocks connected through complex cryptographic protocols. These make it almost impossible to compromise the data stored on the blockchain. This is because any changes to one block immediately corrupt the data in other blocks, so it&rsquo;s obvious that someone has tried to change something. This makes blockchain tamper-evident. Previously recorded data can be updated but not retroactively changed. This means that all information can be traced thanks to a timestamp, checked again at any point, and can serve as a sort of digital fingerprint.</p><p>Blockchain has some other specifics that set it apart from other, more traditional databases. These are often considered the three pillars of blockchain.</p><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;the-pillars-of-blockchain&lt;/b&gt;"><b>The Pillars of Blockchain</b></h2><p>Blockchain has three main characteristics:</p><ol type="1"><li>Immutability</li><li>Decentralization</li><li>Transparency</li></ol><p>These are the foundations of blockchain itself, but also the things that guarantee cryptocurrencies built with blockchains are safe. It is safe to say that you can&rsquo;t really understand blockchain technology without understanding these principles. Let&rsquo;s take a look at each of them.</p><h2 id="1.-immutability">1. Immutability</h2><p>Immutability means that something cannot be changed once it has been created. This is the property of a block added to the blockchain: once it is part of the system, it cannot be modified further.</p><p>Immutability in the blockchain is achieved through a process called hashing. Hashing takes some data and gives a certain output called a checksum. Every time you hash the same data using the same algorithm, you will get the same result, which serves as a digital signature. The biggest advantage of hashing is that it cannot be reverse-engineered: you can&rsquo;t take a hash and get the information used to produce that hash.</p><p>In a blockchain, the hash is produced using both the information from the block currently in use and the previous block in the chain. This links them together: if someone tries to change the data in one block, all the hashes change, making data in all other blocks unusable. Since the hashes aren&rsquo;t valid anymore, the blockchain rejects the attempted change.</p><p>In other words, this guarantees data integrity. You can always refer to information stored on the blockchain because you know it wasn&rsquo;t changed in the meantime. Of course, information can be updated, but this is added to a new block. This ensures that you can trace its history reliably and serves as fraud prevention. Additionally, it can serve as proof of fraud: it can prove who did what and when it can serve as an impartial source of information. Of course, just because some information is on the blockchain doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s true&mdash;but in this case, someone who made a mistake can&rsquo;t cover their tracks.</p><p>But can the owner of the blockchain cover their tracks if they want? Well, no. This brings us to the next important aspect of blockchain.</p><h2 id="2.-decentralization">2. Decentralization</h2><p>Decentralization is the transfer of authority and responsibility from a single, central authority to all participants. In a blockchain, this means that nobody can act as the boss of anyone else. Every participant is on equal footing with others.</p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/609/52cb29aee5.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/609/52cb29aee5.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/609/52cb29aee5.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/609/52cb29aee5.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/609/52cb29aee5.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/609/52cb29aee5.jpg 1200w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this is not so easily implemented in the real world. There are important considerations, such as the ability of people to create several identities to increase their decision-making abilities. This is actually a well-known manipulation tactic called a Sybil attack. To evade such possibilities, as well as let people maintain their privacy to a certain degree, the amount of power you wield in a blockchain network depends on other factors. These vary by consensus algorithm: in Bitcoin, it depends on your computational power, but on others like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardano</a> or Ethereum 2.0, it depends on the number of coins you hold.</p><p>There are several benefits to decentralization:</p><ul><li><b>Peer-to-peer communication:</b> there are no intermediaries in a decentralized system. If you want to send someone money through the Bitcoin network, you do so directly, instead of through a third party like in the case of banks and other centralized financial services.</li><li><b>Security:</b> since the data isn&rsquo;t stored in a single spot but is instead shared among all participants, you can&rsquo;t really hack a blockchain. </li><li><b>Data reconciliation:</b> with all the data in one place and distributed among participants, any incorrect data (either through an honest mistake or as a malicious attempt) can be quickly recognized and corrected.</li><li><b>Efficiency:</b> if one node, or participant, has to update their system, or their power has gone out, the network can still go on as usual. This is because it does not depend on one person or even a group of people. </li><li><b>Trustlessness:</b> thanks to all the previous factors, as well as blockchain&rsquo;s immutability, you don&rsquo;t have to know anyone else in the network to know it will function well.</li></ul><p>These benefits fit into each other and create blockchain&rsquo;s famous environment that strives for fairness and equality.</p><h2 id="3.-transparency">3. Transparency</h2><p>The fact that everything is stored on the blockchain as it is and cannot be tampered with would not mean a lot of that data was not visible to everyone. This is why transparency is the third pillar of the technology: anyone can see every transaction and all related information through so-called block explorers. </p><p>However, this does not mean that this information can be easily traced back to the individual or company responsible for it. You are not obligated to share your personal information with anyone when you use Bitcoin, for example (cryptocurrency exchanges are a different beast). You get assigned a wallet with its own address, and that address is the information stored in the block when you transfer funds to and from the wallet.</p><p>But &ldquo;hard to trace&rdquo; does not mean impossible. Many companies that use blockchain, for example, exchanges, keep their wallet addresses public so you can see their transactions. This is an important aspect, as it adds a level of accountability that was almost unheard of before blockchain. </p><p>Something similar is true for individuals as well. If you&rsquo;ve gone through the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process to register at an exchange, your wallet address at the exchange will be tied to your name and other information. This information will still not be visible on the blockchain itself. Still, it may be obtainable from the exchange, either as part of a regulatory process (for example, if you&rsquo;re suspected of malicious acts) or through hacks and other breaches.</p><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;how-does-blockchain-work?&lt;/b&gt;"><b>How Does Blockchain Work?</b></h2><p>Understanding the pillars of blockchain helps understand how the technology works. We&rsquo;ve already established that it is a transparent, immutable, and decentralized database. All participants have access to it, which makes it distributed. So when you want to make a change, for example, send some BTC to a friend, the following happens:</p><ul><li><b>You create a transaction.</b> You add all the relevant information like who receives the BTC and how much.</li><li><b>You pay the network fee.</b> This is part of the miners&#8217; reward for including your transaction in the next block.</li><li><b>Your transaction is added to a block.</b> This block is created by the participant who won the right to do so, depending on the consensus algorithm (miners, validators, etc.). The bigger your network fee, the more likely you are to be included before others, so your transaction might go through faster.</li><li><b>The block is added to the blockchain.</b> It goes through the aforementioned hashing process first. Once the block is added, you can&rsquo;t change it anymore (which also means you can&rsquo;t reverse your transaction unless the recipient decides to send you your funds back). </li></ul><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="Source: Wikimedia Commons" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/609/52bad1dae9.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/609/52bad1dae9.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/609/52bad1dae9.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/609/52bad1dae9.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/609/52bad1dae9.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/609/52bad1dae9.jpg 1200w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The process of adding a block to the blockchain depends on another factor called a consensus algorithm. They are used to decide which participant gets to add the next block (and receive the rewards). There are several different consensus algorithms, but two of the most common ones are:</p><ul><li><b>Proof of Work (PoW):</b> used by Bitcoin, it involves solving a puzzle (also known as &ldquo;mining&rdquo;), and the first participant or miner to solve the puzzle and let everyone else know is the one who adds the block and receives the reward.</li><li><b>Proof of Stake (PoS):</b> used by the upcoming version of Ethereum, the participants who get to make decisions are known as validators and chosen by the number of coins they hold. Validators must stake a portion of the coins they own to be chosen to add a block and receive the reward, and if they try to act maliciously, they forfeit their stake.</li></ul><p>A participant in the network is also called a node. There are three main types of nodes:</p><ul><li><b>Light Clients </b>keep only a shallow copy of the blockchain, which includes only the basic information that they might need, as the blockchain itself tends to get very big;</li><li><b>Full Nodes</b> are those that keep a full copy of the blockchain and thus have access to all the information stored on it, regardless of size; and</li><li><b>Miners or Validators</b> are nodes that can get the right to verify transactions, depending on the network&rsquo;s consensus mechanism.</li></ul><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;who-invented-blockchain&lt;/b&gt;"><b>Who Invented Blockchain</b></h2><p>But where did blockchain come from?</p><p>The first blockchain launched in 2009 as the technology underpinning Bitcoin, made by a person or group of people under Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s name. However, it was first outlined almost two decades earlier by researchers Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in 1991. During the next 18 years, other technological innovations (such as the theory of cryptographically secured chains by Stefan Konst from 2000) made it possible for blockchain to get its first real-world implementation.</p><p>It is considered that blockchain separated from Bitcoin in 2014, and from then on, the technology is sometimes referred to as blockchain 2.0. This means that it is used for purposes other than Bitcoin from that time on, first starting with other cryptocurrencies and then moving on to other use cases.</p><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;public-vs-private-blockchains&lt;/b&gt;"><b>Public vs Private Blockchains</b></h2><p>All the properties we covered throughout this guide are specific to so-called public blockchains. These blockchains are also permissionless, meaning that anyone can become any node they want without fear of censorship, as there is simply no authority to forbid this. </p><p>However, with the ascent of blockchain 2.0, some enterprises needed to use the technology for their own purposes. In most cases, there is no reason why the data stored on the company&rsquo;s blockchain should be publicly visible. This is where so-called private blockchains come from.</p><p>As their name implies, private blockchains are not available to everyone. They are usually reserved for the company and its partners. For example, in the supply chain industry, only people who are somehow tied to the cargo being tracked will access the blockchain. There is simply no need for the general public to access that blockchain and the information stored within, especially as it can be sensitive and should be protected.</p><p>Most private blockchains are also permissioned. In other words, an authority (usually the boss of the company) can set who can make changes to the blockchain and who can only read the recorded data. Very often, these blockchains are not decentralized simply because they don&rsquo;t need to be.</p><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;how-to-invest-in-blockchain-technology&lt;/b&gt;"><b>How to Invest in Blockchain Technology</b></h2><p>There are two main ways to invest in blockchain technology:</p><ol type="1"><li><b>Through cryptocurrencies:</b> buying cryptocurrencies means participating in the blockchain. When the blockchain network introduces a new concept, improvement, or other significant change, its coin price often follows. Not only can you generate an income this way, but owning decent amounts of certain cryptocurrencies also gives you voting rights in the blockchain. This is not dissimilar to owning stocks.</li><li><b>Through stocks:</b> speaking of which, you can also invest in stocks of established companies that have blockchain solutions as part of their offer. These are often lower-risk options. You can also invest in blockchain startups that have gone public.</li></ol><p>Other ways to invest in blockchain include participating in crowdfunding (ICOs and IEOs), blockchain penny stocks, and venture funds. The type you choose will depend on your own openness to risk and the number of funds you&rsquo;re willing to part with.</p><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;how-to-use-blockchain&lt;/b&gt;"><b>How to Use Blockchain</b></h2><p>When it comes to using blockchain for cryptocurrencies, the process is pretty straightforward. All you need to do is get the address you&rsquo;re sending your funds to, enter it into your wallet&rsquo;s Send option, set the network fee you want to pay, and wait for confirmation. Receiving funds is even easier, as you don&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p><p>To use blockchain to trace information stored on it, you will need access to the blockchain&rsquo;s block explorer. The most widely used block explorer for Bitcoin is Blockstream.info, while for Ethereum, people go with Etherscan.io. The latter is also used for all coins built upon the Ethereum network, making it a one-stop-shop for all things Ethereum.</p><p>Using blockchain to become a decision-making participant will depend on the type of blockchain. For PoW-based blockchains, you will need to own mining hardware and be willing to cover high electricity costs. In PoS networks, you will have to own a decent amount of the network&rsquo;s native token and be willing to stake at least a part of it. For more in-depth information, check the network&rsquo;s documentation, as this tends to explain everything you need to know in detail.</p><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;blockchain-use-cases&lt;/b&gt;"><b>Blockchain Use Cases</b></h2><p>Blockchain is nowadays used across many industries. The main similarity they share is that they all benefit from blockchain&rsquo;s properties like immutability and transparency. Here is how blockchain improves businesses in certain industries:</p><ul><li><b>Supply chain:</b> suffering from long and heavy paper trails, the supply chain industry benefits from blockchain in that it removes the need for all participants to have their own copies of everything. With a single, immutable source of information, data reconciliation becomes much faster and removes the need for any unnecessary third parties.</li><li><b>Insurance:</b> another case in which data reconciliation is important, blockchain allows all participants to see what was done by whom. This prevents insurance fraud and speeds up all processes.</li><li><b>Banking:</b> blockchain allows for faster and more efficient cross-border payments but also adds a new layer of transparency and accountability to traditional finance. This is why many banks are looking into their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</li><li><b>Healthcare:</b> the coronavirus pandemic has proven a need for accessible healthcare information. Using blockchain, users can decide who to share their information with, which includes vaccination status, whether or not they&rsquo;ve had Covid, and if they are at risk&mdash;all information that can help them lead a more normal life, like go to concerts and events, if they&rsquo;re healthy.</li><li><b>Pharmacy:</b> pharmaceuticals are often counterfeit and/or sold on black markets, which can be extremely dangerous. Being able to track an item from its production to the time it reaches the end-user can help prevent that, along with checking whether it is expired.</li><li><b>Government:</b> voter fraud is a globally widespread issue that blockchain can help combat. This is why many countries are looking into implementing a blockchain-based voter system that cannot be manipulated in favor of any party to facilitate a truly democratic process.</li><li><b>Art:</b> perhaps the best-known example are NFTs. To own an NFT is to be able to prove you own an original digital item&mdash;something like the difference between owning an original painting and only having a print of it.</li><li><b>Gaming:</b> similar to art, NFTs take ownership to a completely new level, so collecting games are thriving thanks to the technology.</li></ul><p>This is not an exhaustive list of potential benefits, but it is a good starting point towards understanding what blockchain is good at. </p><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;common-myths-about-blockchain&lt;/b&gt;"><b>Common Myths About Blockchain</b></h2><p>Blockchain is followed by some pervasive myths perpetrated by a lack of understanding. Here, we will take a look at them and explain the truth.</p><ul><li><b>Bitcoin = blockchain.</b> One of the most common myths assumes that Bitcoin and blockchain are one of the same. As we&rsquo;ve already covered, the two originated together, but blockchain has since found many other use cases.</li><li><b>Blockchain uses a lot of electricity. </b>This is only true of PoW consensus algorithms; blockchains that use other consensus mechanisms do not spend more electricity than many other technologies.</li><li><b>Blockchain is slow.</b> While Bitcoin transactions are much slower than other fiat payment processors, this is due to its set block time. Many other blockchains are much faster, even able to process thousands of transactions per second.</li><li><b>Blockchain isn&rsquo;t mature enough for the mainstream.</b> Many enterprises are already using blockchain&mdash;Forbes has an annual Blockchain 50 list, where businesses with a revenue of more than USD 1 billion per year are shown.</li><li><b>All my transactions are publicly visible!</b> While this is true, this does not mean it can be easily traced back to you if you take some basic privacy measures.</li></ul><h2 id="&lt;b&gt;conclusion&lt;/b&gt;"><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p>Although blockchain has many relatively complex features, it does not have to be difficult to understand. The complexity of the technology is its biggest strength, as it guarantees security, transparency, and accessibility without sacrificing democracy and equality.</p><p>Do you have suggestions about this guide?

With the advent of blockchain 2.0 (which is when blockchain gained its first use case aside from Bitcoin in 2014), smart contracts have been an invaluable addition to the technology. While highly technical in nature, they do not have to be difficult to understand.</p><p>In this guide, we will take you through the basics of smart contracts. You will learn what they are, how they work, where they&rsquo;re applicable, and even the basics of writing one.</p><h2><strong>What Is a Smart Contract</strong></h2><p>In the simplest sense, smart contracts are just a programmed version of your usual contract. Its purpose is to automatically trigger a previously settled-upon contract when all the preconditions have been met. Since every condition has to be manually programmed to execute, this can significantly reduce the amount of fine print designed to favor one party, even at the expense of the other.</p><p>Although smart contracts, as we refer to them now, rose to prominence with programmable blockchain implementations, they are much older than that. Computer scientist, lawyer, and cryptographer Nick Szabo first proposed smart contracts as a concept in the 90s. He described them as &ldquo;a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.&rdquo; Outside of their current implementations, smart contracts are present elsewhere: vending machines are considered a rudimentary version of the technology, as they follow the general principle that with the right input, a certain output is guaranteed.</p><p>Despite their name, smart contracts are not necessarily a valid, binding agreement in the eyes of the law, the way traditional contracts tend to be. However, in blockchain implementation, they don&rsquo;t need to be. The interpretation by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology defines them as a &ldquo;collection of code and data (sometimes referred to as functions and state) that is deployed using cryptographically signed transactions on the blockchain network.&rdquo; This is also the definition by which Ethereum and similar blockchains operate.</p><p>For those who understand <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">what blockchain is</a>, it can seem obvious how smart contracts fit into the architecture of a blockchain. In a completely decentralized space, where nobody holds significant amounts of power, there is no place for intermediaries and third parties that handle compliance and consensus. As our aforementioned guide explains, consensus is reached through preset mechanisms that do not rely on human intervention. The same is true for compliance and execution of programs: smart contracts are programmed implementations of these concepts that remove the need for people to hold that kind of power.</p><h2><strong>How Does a Smart Contract Work</strong></h2><p>However, knowing what a smart contract is doesn&rsquo;t necessarily explain how it works.</p><p>Most simply, smart contracts are made up of different functions that are defined on them. Users interact with them by sending a transaction that triggers a certain function. Each of these functions is defined in detail, so users can understand exactly what it is that they&rsquo;re about to do.</p><p>The users of the network define smart contracts. Anyone who can code in the smart contract language can write their own, as long as they have enough native coins to deploy. The cost itself depends on the network you&rsquo;re deploying on and its stipulations.</p><p>A real-world example would be a trade agreement. Once both parties have hashed out the details (what each is getting in return, the stipulations, any factors that might make them renegotiate the deal), they would usually find a neutral third party to ensure everything is done by the letter. However, neutral third parties cost money&mdash;and they can&rsquo;t always be trusted to remain neutral or simply not to try to gain their own advantage from the situation. The most simple solution would be removing this third party completely. But who will act as a mediator then?</p><p>This is why people have always preferred the neutrality that only machines can achieve. The current technological advances still don&#8217;t see machines having their own preferences and interests, so they&#8217;re often believed the best solution to these problems. In other words, programming a smart contract lets all parties involved hash out the details of the trade publicly and transparently (as smart contracts are unable to do something that was not explicitly coded in), thus preventing potential malfeasance. This also reduces overall costs, as deploying and later triggering a smart contract is relatively low compared to lawyer costs.</p><p>Smart contracts guarantee that everything will be done in the exact way that it was coded. As they&rsquo;re not very complex programs, these codes can often be read and understood with some basic programming knowledge. This is important for keeping everything above ground and facilitating a good working relationship with other participants in the network.</p><h2><strong>What Can Smart Contracts Be Used For</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest advantages of smart contracts is that they can be used for virtually anything, as long as they can be programmed. Of course, some use cases are more common than others. Some of the best examples include:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital identity:</strong> in a time of dubious privacy on the internet, there is a concern about what data you&rsquo;re sharing with companies whose websites you&rsquo;re accessing. This can be easily digitized through smart contracts, where it could share your preferences for content curation purposes without actually disclosing your personal information.</li><li><strong>Securities:</strong> the financial sector as a whole suffers from a lot of friction between different parties, especially when it comes to holding and trading securities. By automating everything through smart contracts, intermediaries could be removed completely. The program would then take over, paying out dividends and/or other automatic payments, managing liability, and streamlining the workflow.</li><li><strong>Loans and mortgages:</strong> these things are often the source of frustration for many. Implementing smart contract payments would mean bringing down the overall cost that usually goes to the third party, maintaining a beneficial interest rate, and ensuring there is no fine print that can be taken advantage of. Additionally, setting up automatic monthly payments can further simplify the whole ordeal for all participants.</li><li><strong>Supply chain:</strong> as one of the best-known use cases for blockchain, smart contracts are also invaluable when it comes to supply chain management. From inventory tracking to automatic updates to all concerned parties, implementing smart contracts can improve transparency and significantly reduce room for potential fraud.</li><li><strong>Escrow:</strong> as with other activities that require third-party involvement, escrow is also one of those that would benefit from automatization. With smart contracts, funds are held in a safe location until all conditions for their release have been met. This can almost eliminate the risk of theft and fraud while simultaneously keeping everything fully transparent and, perhaps most of all, affordable.</li><li><strong>Health systems:</strong> medical data is highly sensitive, and most jurisdictions have laws that protect it from unauthorized access. Using smart contracts can not only protect that data but also lets individuals decide who can get access to it. Ultimately, people could provide medical researchers with access to their data for a fee, eliminating a significant amount of ethical concerns for all parties involved.</li><li><strong>Salaries:</strong> businesses keeping salaried employees could save significant money by paying them out on an automatic basis. Even if they have to take days off into account, these changes can be tweaked quickly and easily. The concept could work on hourly employees as well.</li></ul><p>The list of smart contract use cases is far from exhaustive. However, it serves only to showcase the wide range of applications beyond what many people think of when they hear about the technology. With the right infrastructure, smart contracts could go far beyond the use cases outlined here.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of Smart Contracts</strong></h2><p>Many of the benefits smart contracts offer to the way you do your business can be deduced from what we&rsquo;ve shown by now. On the other hand, some go beyond what may be obvious at first. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at them.</p><ul><li><strong>Trust:</strong> or, perhaps more accurately, trustlessness means that you do not need to implicitly trust anyone that the conditions you&rsquo;ve set will be executed. As a smart contract has no autonomy of its own, you can rest assured that everything will happen exactly as it is written.</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong> cryptography, the concept upon which blockchain (and smart contracts, by extension) is built, keeps everything vastly more secure than many other technological solutions.</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> using smart contracts is a significant step up from manually handling everything that can be automated. Especially in the case of intermediaries, which can take their time depending on their own practices, moving everything to smart contracts can be just the timesaver your business needed.</li><li><strong>Savings:</strong> going by the same logic as with the aspect of speed, removing third party interference also saves you the money you would pay for their services.</li><li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> not relying on intermediaries gives you more power to decide, by yourself or with another interested party, exactly what your smart contract should do. Additionally, the chance of someone erring (or even manipulating) is significantly reduced with fewer participants.</li><li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> unless a mistake is preprogrammed into the smart contract, it is physically incapable of doing anything other than what is written in its code.</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> not only will you be able to read the smart contract and see if it has been written in accordance with what you wanted or needed, but the fact that it is stored on the blockchain means that all the relevant data will also be visible for posterity. For businesses, this can speed up auditing processes.</li><li><strong>Ease of understanding (and use):</strong> it&rsquo;s true that code can be written in incredibly confusing ways. However, high-quality code will be easy to understand and use, which means it will be far easier than poring over long, dense legal documents.</li></ul><p>Other benefits of using smart contracts will depend on your personal use case. Most importantly, all of them have one thing in common: they make everything easier.</p><h2><strong>Potential Drawbacks</strong></h2><p>Of course, no technology is a panacea. This is especially true for blockchain and smart contracts. As they&rsquo;re still relatively new and address long-standing problems across many industries, they&rsquo;re often expected to be able to do much more than they realistically can. Here are some issues smart contracts may face:</p><ul><li><strong>Not legally binding:</strong> in spite of their name, smart contracts are not necessarily actual contracts. They may not hold up in a court of law, but this may change on a case-by-case basis.</li><li><strong>Regulatory uncertainty:</strong> in the same vein, as the technology is so new, there are often no government regulations in place. Depending on the type of transaction, they might not be necessary&mdash;but they might also be critical, so navigating these legal issues can be a chore.</li><li><strong>Taxation:</strong> similarly, how do you tax-smart contract transactions? While some may have their precedent in traditional finance, the ascent of cryptocurrencies has brought some new factors into play.</li><li><strong>Addressing bugs:</strong> no code is perfect, and bugs happen, even to the best coders. Some of them may not be noticed until it&rsquo;s too late, and transactions on the blockchain are irreversible. In other words, mistakes can be costly.</li><li><strong>Rescinding contracts:</strong> as smart contracts are quite literal, there is often no way to rescind them the way you would with a traditional contract, i.e., in court.</li><li><strong>Not everyone can read code:</strong> simply put, not everyone knows the basics of coding. While theoretically, smart contracts should be more straightforward than documents on paper, as they don&rsquo;t permit fine print. However, if you can&rsquo;t read the code, anyone can write anything they want with you none the wiser.</li><li><strong>They can&rsquo;t get real-world information:</strong> smart contracts can&rsquo;t access information from outside the blockchain because that might jeopardize consensus. So-called oracles are used to overcome this obstacle.</li></ul><p>The importance of each of these drawbacks, just like the benefits we listed, depends on what you&rsquo;re actually using smart contracts for. Still, being aware of these pros and cons helps make an informed decision if you&rsquo;re looking into using smart contracts.</p><h2><strong>What Is An Oracle?</strong></h2><p>While talking about blockchain and smart contracts, we stated several times that the goal of both, among other things, is to eliminate reliance on third parties. However, there are some situations in which this cannot be avoided. One of those situations is when you need real-world information to feed into smart contracts without constantly looking for it manually.</p><p>Blockchain oracles are such third parties. They act as the link between on-chain data, which is the blockchain, and off-chain, or what we call the real world. This helps broaden the scope of smart contracts. Without oracles, smart contracts would only be able to operate with the information they can get from the blockchain itself, which isn&rsquo;t a lot.</p><p>To keep the data from being manipulated, oracles are also often decentralized. This means that they&rsquo;re all sending the same data, and the data that the majority sent is taken as correct. If an oracle is found to be very inconsistent with the rest too often, it can be presumed malicious and punished. There are many different kinds of oracles, and the type that is implemented will depend on what the network and its users need.</p><h2><strong>How to Write a Smart Contract</strong></h2><p>To write a smart contract, you will need to be familiar with at least one programming language used for this purpose. On the Ethereum blockchain, you have the choice of two developer-friendly languages: Solidity and Vyper. You will also need gas: the more complex a transaction in the smart contract, the more gas it will need. Each transaction specifies the amount of gas it is willing to pay to run some code, so the total fee paid comes up to the total gas used times the gas price.</p><p>How to write a smart contract will depend mostly on what you want it to do. The simpler it is, the quicker you can do it, even if your programming knowledge is pretty basic. There are myriads of tutorials online to help you get started.</p><p>The contract will have to be compiled before it&rsquo;s deployed on the blockchain. Compiling will also help figure out if you&rsquo;ve written everything correctly and if it&rsquo;s working the way it should.</p><p>To learn more, you can refer to the Ethereum website, which holds many step-by-step explanations of how their smart contracts work!</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>As this guide shows, smart contracts are a way to automate things that would otherwise have to be done manually, with all the security, transparency, and immutability always offered by blockchain technology. While they have some drawbacks, smart contracts still solve genuine issues, which means knowing how to use one (and even write one yourself!) can be an invaluable skill. For starters, however, simply understanding how they work is an excellent starting point for the rest.</p><p><i>Have we missed something you wanted to know?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/guide/78250/191168/adobestock-281009312.jpg"><figcaption>Source: Adobe / artinspiring</figcaption></figure><p><strong>KYC </strong>stands for <i>Know Your Customer</i>. KYC is a verification process used during transactions to confirm a customer&#8217;s identity. This process is done mostly for security and regulatory purposes.</p><p>KYC is not exclusive to cryptocurrency transactions. You&rsquo;ve encountered it if you&rsquo;ve opened a bank account, signed a cellphone contract, or opened a credit card in the US.</p><p>The process has been in place since the implementation of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act"><i>The Patriot Act of 2001</i></a>. As a byproduct of the 2001 act, it was intended to better national security. It works like this.</p><p>Financial institutions work with governmental agencies using data provided by the customer. The data provided is then put into a database that runs the potential risks of doing business with that customer. The databases hold information that would flag customers with negative marks. This process is in place to prevent money laundering, terrorism funding, and other nefarious activities. KYC also helps to address the financial risk of doing business with a customer.&nbsp;</p><h2>What&rsquo;s the difference between AML and KYC?</h2><p>KYC is like the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) process. AML is a regulatory standardization that has been around a little longer than KYC. AML and KYC are very similar. The distinct difference is that KYC verifications aim to identify the risk of doing business with that customer.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UJ9gZ3KWCHah48usFpHwMZXyApT6Nj5GgPp4wJGm-sbG6R7KxShWtntFUXi5p0BNOCT6IX-cU8BgmJe_78eDIvUHYq1fWiA_HomJSJvHim8hvviPga5LSchnR7B_avsMbAgajbp0yyXSnU-4_A" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://plaid.com/resources/banking/what-is-kyc/#whats-the-difference-between-aml-and-kyc">Plaid.com</a></figcaption></figure><h2>What You Need To Complete KYC Verification</h2><p>Generally speaking, KYC is a requirement that you share a photo of an official government-issued ID, Passport, or Driver&#8217;s License. Submission of a photo of yourself is also necessary. The photo is then compared to the ID submitted.</p><p>Sometimes part of the verification process is submitting a photo of yourself holding an ID. Some verifications even ask for a photo of the customer holding a piece of paper with a short phrase that is handwritten. The verifier will give you the phrase that is to be written. This phrase will often include your name and the date. This technique helps verify that the person submitting the KYC is not falsifying documents or photos.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Again this is a generalization since every website/app can be different. The videos below are from the crypto exchanges;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://support.celsius.network/hc/en-us/articles/360006768517-What-information-do-you-need-in-order-to-complete-my-KYC-verification-"> <u>Celcius</u></a> and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://support.kucoin.plus/hc/en-us/articles/900005745406-How-to-Complete-KYC-Verification-"> <u>KuCoin&#8217;s support</u></a> websites. These are generally what you can expect a KYC verification process to look like on a typical exchange.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://youtu.be/Oj8tU5i3sPQ"></oembed></figure><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://youtu.be/uoni3CYRkAc"><strong><u>Tutorial &#8211; Individual KYC Verification On KuCoin</u></strong></a></p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://youtu.be/uoni3CYRkAc"></oembed></figure><h3>Who Regulates KYC?</h3><p>KYC, AML, and similar regulatory systems are of national and international origin. This means that there are several bodies to standardize and regulate KYC verifications globally. Every country has its own regulatory body that handles the verification and regulation of AML, KYC, or whatever system they have in place. Some places have multiple governmental bodies or use privatized organizations to handle verifications.</p><p>For example, SWIFT is a large organization involved in handling international financial transactions. On its<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process"> <u>website</u></a><u>,</u> SWIFT provides a list of who sets standards, handles the verifications, and regulates KYC.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/www.state.gov">US Department of State sanctions lists</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/sdn-list">Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons Lists (SDN)</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/">Financial Action Task Force lists (FATF)</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi">Transparency Index lists from Transparency International</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.state.gov/terrorist-designations-and-state-sponsors-of-terrorism/">State Sponsors of Terrorism list</a>&#8220;</li></ul><h2>How crypto companies are adapting to KYC</h2><p>Cryptocurrency&rsquo;s credibility has been a point of contention from the beginning. There are many arguments for and against the security, education, and widespread adoption of crypto. These go for crypto companies, customers, and government agencies alike. Recent media coverage and its global adoption have propelled the growth of crypto, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, there are lingering issues of security and credibility that hinder the industry&rsquo;s growth. Investors, consumers, traditional financial institutions, and government agencies alike agree on at least one issue- crypto needs more clarity in regulation.</p><p>Crypto companies and organizations are making multiple solutions to the issue of clarity. For example,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.shyft.network/"> <u>Shyft Network</u></a> is a blockchain-based protocol that is working towards crypto compliance. They are building the infrastructure for all crypto customers to get KYC verification.</p><p>Shyft addresses this dilemma below:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;As the popularity of Defi grows, the threat of regulation will always linger, and facing it head on is the best way to deal with it.&nbsp; Our goal is to create a massively-adopted, compliant, and scalable DeFi ecosystem with comparable market depths across centralized and decentralized markets.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>In order to establish standards, it will take work from lawmakers and crypto companies together. Bridging traditional financial regulations with new and fundamentally different technology is a Herculean task. Shyft addresses this problem with possible solutions on their website. Here they explain why this could be a difficult process.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Large Liquidity Providers (LPs) often cannot interact with the Defi space because of regulatory constraints and lack of clarity. Similarly, platforms within the Defi space can&#8217;t explore funding potentials because of the small opportunity space relative to the total potential addressable market assuming regulatory compatibility. Having seen no guidance from the Defi ecosystem, regulators must comprehend the sector through the lens of potentially obsolete and irrelevant past environments to which regulations were applied.,&#8221; </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.shyft.network/about"><i>states Shyft&#8217;s website</i></a><i>.</i></p></blockquote><p>ISO (International Organization for Standardization) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/news/magazine/ISOfocus%20(2013-NOW)/en/2020/ISOfocus_138/ISOfocus_138_en.pdf">provides</a> a visual roadmap of compliance standards. These standards might optimize the adoption of digital assets by regulated institutions ISO also aims to protect the consumer as well as institutions from potential threats. There is a larger focus on International transactions &#8211; this is due to advancements in technology that lead to international business growth.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F-jrWz8XC0kXxT0Zypnp7nNWcQjl_RuqR6fIhwwIOJvrMDZZJ08saRrVrnpkkHzr7tCf2X46S38MvUZjUiXuxMk0v1c5tsLqHmZx35Ifxd7v4rONIK8gGTw-ecJBR2DcPvpJ7Hwe0HlaOInn4Q" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source: ISO Focus January-February 2020 Edition.</figcaption></figure><h2>Criticisms of KYC</h2><p>The major issue with the KYC process and crypto is that crypto, by design, is supposed to be decentralized. The nature of KYC, standardization, and regulation, is the exact opposite of decentralization. Yet, it is understood by major trading platforms, such as<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/%E2%80%8Bwhat-is-kyc-or-identity-verification-and-how-is-it-increasingly-important-for-crypto-421499824684902130"> <u>Binance</u></a>, that KYC is necessary for the growth of the crypto industry. Even if it does go against the decentralization aspect. It is crucial, at this stage of the &lsquo;gray area&rsquo; in crypto, for centralized exchanges such as themselves to comply.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&#8220;For users concerned with the ethos of anonymity via decentralized blockchain, losing anonymity is a high price to pay especially when they submit their KYC details to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. While cryptocurrency exchanges promise to treat users&#8217; private information with care, many people who prefer to maintain anonymity don&#8217;t want to take that chance. These fears are not unfounded since many exchanges still do not have robust KYC systems to secure consumer information,&rdquo; </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/%E2%80%8Bwhat-is-kyc-or-identity-verification-and-how-is-it-increasingly-important-for-crypto-421499824684902130"><i>writes Binance</i></a><i> on the importance of KYC in crypto.</i></p></blockquote><h2>Important Concepts to Take from KYC</h2><p>There are potential risks and benefits that come with the regulation of the crypto space. As much as people enjoy their privacy, it is understood that what crypto needs is regulatory clarity and standardization. It is often considered to be the largest issue hindering its growth. KYC may help to reduce some of the uncertainty in the market. This is because KYC is a step in the direction of standardization and security. Companies would have more room for growth. They could operate free from the fear of pushing legal boundaries. This same comfort is felt by the consumer &#8211; knowing that any capital put into crypto is deemed legitimate makes crypto feel more secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The same argument could be used against KYC regulation in the crypto space. People against the standardization and regulation of crypto would argue that KYC threatens its decentralization, privacy, security, and censorship resistance aspects. This would move crypto in the opposite direction of the core principles that birthed it. The privacy and anonymity of crypto remain appealing attributes for a large part of the community. People are drawn to the ideology of regaining control of their assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of your preference, the most important thing to remember is to always protect your personal information. It is your responsibility to be diligent in researching the legitimacy of a space where you are prompted to enter personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

In short, a DAO is a set of organizational rules that is triggered automatically and removes the need for intermediaries. In this guide, we will give a more detailed explanation of what they are, how they are created, and everything else you need to know about DAOs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What Is a DAO?</h3><p>A Decentralized Autonomous Organization is, as its name implies, an organization that is decentralized in that it has no central government, and autonomous. Instead of being governed by a small team of executives, a DAO&rsquo;s rules are set in code and enforced by the network of computers that run this software; this means that the rules are the same for everyone, no matter who they are, and unchangeable&mdash;so there is no finding loopholes to get out of your obligations or restrictions. As the code is law, there&nbsp; is no need for intermediaries who will ensure that the rules are followed.</p><p>A DAO&rsquo;s decentralization usually means that it is democratized instead of being hierarchical. For example, any changes that should be implemented are voted upon by all participants instead of a single group of decision-makers. All the votes are automatically tallied and carried out by the software instead of relying on human intervention. This removes the possibility of vote counts being mismanaged or tampered with, leading to transparency and full visibility.</p><p>Thanks to the removal of the need to trust other participants in the DAO, this means that it can consist of many people who don&rsquo;t know each other and would otherwise not be able to coordinate their common goals. In other words, they can transcend any physical limitations and be sure that all parties are working towards the good of the project itself.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="4200" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27012/1.jpeg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27012/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_4200_3324.jpeg 4200w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27012/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_1200_949.jpeg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27012/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_900_712.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27012/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_720_569.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27012/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_600_474.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27012/responsive-images/1___media_library_original_300_237.jpeg 300w"><figcaption><i>Image source: Adobe Stock</i></figcaption></figure><h3>How to Create a DAO</h3><p>Many projects in the crypto space have a DAO behind them, as this tends to be one of the best ways to keep the governance of the project fair, transparent, and accessible to all who want to participate. However, like any organization, a DAO still needs to be set up and funded before it reaches the wider audience it is aimed at. Here are the three key phases in creating a DAO:<br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>The first step is always figuring out what the smart contract underpinning the DAO needs to do&mdash;and then creating it.</strong> These sets of rules are often very extensive and cover a myriad of things; forgetting to set something up during the first developmental phase means that it can later be changed through voting alone, which can be a long and laborious process, especially if the forgotten rule is important to the health of the network itself. This code also needs to be tested and retested so that nothing slips away.</li><li><strong>The next phase is securing funding for the launch of the DAO, but also for its ongoing functioning.</strong> This is often achieved through token sales, which also handle the governance side of the process&mdash;most of the time, the amount of tokens you own correlates to your voting power within the organization. This is not unlike a shareholder type of relationship, which is why DAOs translate so very well into the decentralized finance (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) world.</li><li><strong>Finally, the DAO itself needs to be launched.</strong> Once its deployed on the blockchain, there are no changes that the founding team can make without the input of the other participants, or token holders. This is when all rules go into effect, including the DAO&rsquo;s governance. In other words, the DAO is then truly created.</li></ol><p>After this, the DAO runs as predicted and any changes are voted upon by the whole network.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1200" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27013/2r.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27013/responsive-images/2r___media_library_original_1200_675.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27013/responsive-images/2r___media_library_original_900_506.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27013/responsive-images/2r___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27013/responsive-images/2r___media_library_original_600_337.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27013/responsive-images/2r___media_library_original_300_168.jpg 300w"><figcaption><i>Image source: Adobe Stock</i></figcaption></figure><h3>What Was &ldquo;The DAO&rdquo;?</h3><p>When talking about decentralized autonomous organizations as a whole, the minds of many still go to &ldquo;The DAO&rdquo; that marked a turning point in the history of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>. The DAO was the name of a decentralized autonomous organization that launched in 2016 with the idea of being a decentralized form of a venture fund. People could own The DAO tokens and earn dividends from them or just profit off the price appreciation, if they wanted. The DAO was one of the largest crowdfunding attempts of its time, raising around USD 150m in ETH.&nbsp;</p><p>Just before the attack that would mark The DAO&rsquo;s end, around 14% of all ETH in circulation was invested in the project. Then, a hacker found and exploited a bug in the code that allowed them to siphon off USD 60m away. The sheer amount of ETH already tied to The DAO caused a rift in the Ethereum community on what should be done. Those who believed there should be a fork that would blacklist the attacker&rsquo;s address, preventing him from moving the funds and rolling the blockchain back to a time before the hack, were led by Ethereum&rsquo;s founder Vitalik Buterin and that version of the blockchain is still the official one for Ethereum. On the other hand, people who opposed this decision forked off the main Ethereum blockchain and created what is now known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum-classic/">Ethereum Classic (ETC)</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1200" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27014/3r.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27014/responsive-images/3r___media_library_original_1200_764.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27014/responsive-images/3r___media_library_original_900_573.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27014/responsive-images/3r___media_library_original_720_458.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27014/responsive-images/3r___media_library_original_600_382.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/60827/27014/responsive-images/3r___media_library_original_300_191.jpg 300w"><figcaption><i>Image source: Adobe Stock</i></figcaption></figure><h3>Potential Downsides of DAOs</h3><p>While DAOs aim to be improvements of existing hierarchical structures, they are far from perfect themselves. One of the most often cited issues is that many institutions from traditional finance believe that masses should not be trusted with major financial decisions.</p><p>Additionally, DAOs are mostly unregulated and tend to spread out over many jurisdictions, which makes solving potential legal issues extremely complicated at best, or even completely impossible.</p><p>Finally, as the example of The DAO proved, once a DAO is up and running (deployed on the blockchain, in other words), changing even life-threatening bugs in the code can be a slow and costly process that gives malicious actors plenty of time to act. Even the most trivial bug that would otherwise be solved in a matter of hours has to undergo the same voting process.</p><p><i>See also:&nbsp;</i></p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-dao-projects.htm"><i>8 Best Crypto DAO Projects to Invest In</i></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm"><i>What Is a Smart Contract?</i></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

Proof-of-Stake protocols have been in development for years now, and they have amassed a legion of future developers, investors and fans who all want to see them succeed.</p><p>Whether Proof-of-Stake will become the dominant consensus mechanism of the future or not, it has its own benefits and drawbacks. Let&#8217;s see what they are.</p><h3>Brief History of Proof-of-Stake</h3><p>Proof-of-Stake&rsquo;s roots are humble. This PoS idea on July 2011 brought out in a bitcointalk <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=27787.0">thread by QuantumMechanic</a> is now saved as an artifact of cryptocurrency history. The poster details PoS mechanics but attempts to make this a solution to Bitcoin&rsquo;s problems. The answer to this question by casascius is ominous. The first reply sees the future of this applied to other kinds of applications and not to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, which seems to remain the case.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="proof of work original post" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60f/81109a87f2.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60f/81109a87f2.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60f/81109a87f2.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60f/81109a87f2.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60f/81109a87f2.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60f/81109a87f2.png 1455w"></figure><p>Source: BitcoinTalk.org</p><p>In 2012, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/peercoin/">Peercoin</a> was developed which used a combination of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake protocols. In 2014, the whitepaper Consensus without Mining was released as well as a solution by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a> to the &lsquo;Nothing at Stake&rsquo; problem of Proof-of-Stake. Cardano and Polkadot as well as other projects that utilize Proof-of-Stake were starting out as projects. In 2019, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cosmos-2/">Cosmos </a>mainnet was launched and Ethereum 2.0&rsquo;s details were ironed out.</p><p>Fast forward to 2021 and the cryptocurrency world experienced unprecedented interest with Cardano and Polkadot leading the charge as the biggest already active Proof-of-Stake blockchains. With projects like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/neo/">Neo</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/algo-algorand/">Algorand</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">Binance coin</a> and others all adopting Proof-of-Stake, time will tell if Proof-of-Stake will become the dominant consensus mechanism amongst cryptocurrency projects.</p><h3>What is Proof-of-Stake?</h3><p>Bitcoin and some other crypto networks operate on what is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-work.htm">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism. In cryptocurrency, <strong>consensus mechanisms</strong> are what allows an entire system to function with individual computers, or nodes. They use consensus algorithms in order to work out the current agreed state of the network. It&rsquo;s vital that every single node has to have the exact same copy of the blockchain and validate the same rules to be &lsquo;in consensus.&rsquo;</p><p>One of the main factors of decentralization is to not be subject to any central authority, as the laws that govern any blockchain project adhere to math and code. An alternative to that is a centralized authority that dictates how a project runs, can make changes to the consensus, and censor or discriminate system participants.</p><p>Blockchain technology works as a digital ledger that everyone can see. What&rsquo;s to stop other users from tampering this digital ledger? In legacy networks, this is what Proof-of-Work does. Using hashes, long data strings of a set length, Proof-of-Work makes sure that the blockchain is unalterable. Each block, or data set, has been validated through vast computational work.</p><p>In contrast, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a variety of a consensus mechanism that uses validator nodes based on staked tokens. Instead of computational power that creates blocks in Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake creates blocks by relying on validators, who are users who stake tokens. Each validator is given a random chance to reap a block reward.</p><p>However, although having undergone good development, the PoS concept is still new and only time will tell whether Proof-of-Stake will be the prevailing consensus mechanism of the new age.</p><h3>How Proof-of-Stake Works</h3><p>Mining in Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency protocols use computational power to validate blocks. This is to verify the network and make sure that the transactions are legitimate. It eliminates the problem of &lsquo;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp#:~:text=Double%2Dspending%20is%20the%20risk,power%20necessary%20to%20manipulate%20it.">double-spending</a>&rsquo; in which the same token can be used in another transaction. Since it requires vast computational work in order to validate a single block, this ultimately secures the network. If something takes intense computational power to obtain the algorithm, then trying to reverse that code is an enormous task.</p><p>Proof-of-Stake attempts to replicate these Proof-of-Work ideas in mind but executes them differently. In Proof-of-Stake protocols, it uses an algorithm that gives a selection for a node to be a validator for a block. These are processed in either <strong>&lsquo;Coin Age Selection&rsquo;</strong> or <strong>&lsquo;Randomized Block Selection&rsquo;.</strong></p><p><strong>1. Coin Age Selection</strong></p><p>This one is a bit easier to grasp than Randomized Block Selection. Coin Age Selection was used by the aforementioned <strong>Peercoin</strong>, one of the first cryptocurrencies to use Proof-of-Stake. It is a mechanism that validates blocks based on the duration of tokens. With Peercoin, a minimum of 30 days for unspent tokens must be held in order for a block to be forged and it is used to sign a block. A maximum amount of block minting probability is reached after 90 days to prevent older stakes from having too much power.</p><p>Although this is used in the early ideas of Proof-of-Stake, newer protocols are now using Randomized Block Selection for their consensus mechanism.</p><p><strong>2. Randomized Block Selection</strong></p><p>To get a better picture of what validators are in Randomized Block Selection, in <strong>Ethereum 2.0</strong>, a validator node is someone who has staked 32 ETH and has a computer running in order to &lsquo;mint&rsquo; or &lsquo;forge&rsquo; blocks. &lsquo;Minting&rsquo; is what &lsquo;mining&rsquo; is in Proof-of-Work.</p><p>When a miner in Proof-of-Work systems validates a block, that miner or mining pool is given a reward in the form of cryptocurrency tokens like BTC, LTC, ETH, and so on. In Proof-of-Stake, a validator validates a block through a &lsquo;random&rsquo; selection. In the case of Ethereum 2.0, the validator that is running that 32 staked ETH has a random chance to validate a block. This chance is similar to other validator nodes in the network. Having more ETH doesn&rsquo;t affect this chance, unlike having more hash power in Proof-of-Work system like Bitcoin gives a better chance to obtain the block reward. So an organization can have multiple nodes to increase the likelihood of minting a block but each node has the same random chance as any other node.</p><p>Although each protocol might differ in execution, these are the fundamental components of Randomized Block Selection Proof-of-Stake protocols.</p><h3>Proof-of-Stake&rsquo;s Potential Improvements to Proof-of-Work</h3><p>PoS consensus mechanisms are notable in that they attempt to solve the scalability and usability issues of Proof-of-Work consensus mechanisms. For one, Proof-of-Stake will save an immense amount of electrical energy that would have been used to mine blocks. Although the electrical drainage is often overblown by media in Proof-of-Work, it still costs tremendous energy in order to mint a new block into existence and thus secure the network. Proof-of-Stake only requires validators to have their own computers up and running or for users to have tokens to stake in a pool.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-stake-coins.htm">Proof-of-Stake coins</a> are intended to be more scalable, since they have a &lsquo;lighter&rsquo; architecture not needing as much of the computational power that Proof-of-Work cryptos need. This means that more of the power can be allocated to things like the transaction speed for there to be more action in the network without it being clogged. This would make blockchain projects more scalable since the network would be faster to support more projects on the ecosystem.</p><p>On the other hand, PoS systems arise major concerns about supply centralization, conflict resolution in case of a fork, and other security trade-offs. Regardless of the hype, we are yet to witness a fully-functioning Proof-of-Stake system implemented on a large scale and high capital protocol.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Although promising to take blockchain technology to another level, Proof-of-Stake is in its infancy. There have not been many examples of widespread decentralized applications or cryptocurrencies that are totally dedicated to the use of Proof-of-Stake. Once years of testing and practical implementation have come to pass, we may look at Proof-of-Stake and suggest possible improvements to each projects&rsquo; architecture. As of right now, PoS carries the hopes of an army of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who see it as a beacon of hope for the future of blockchain technology.</p>

As institutions continue to invest in Bitcoin and as decentralized applications continue to make their way into public hands, an increasing amount of people want to know how these new technologies function. Eventually, if a curious crypto user comes across mining, it is likely the user will encounter the term Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look into how this consensus mechanism first came about in order to get an overall better picture of cryptocurrency.</p><h2>A Brief History of Proof-of-Work</h2><p>Proof-of-Work has its roots in email technology. Spam messaging was common in the early 1990s, and a paper by two academics, Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor, was released during this time on how to halt this spam messaging. In 1992, cryptography was already used for chains of blocks in documents. However, only in 2004, seminal work was done through developed tokens that allowed users to consistently validate each token in a legitimate server.</p><p>Spurred by the financial crash of 2008, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, the anonymous Bitcoin founder, used several technologies to create the consensus mechanism we now know in crypto as Proof-of-Work. Today, Proof-of-Work has been implemented on networks like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/litecoin/">Litecoin</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>. It is still considered to be the most secure and time-tested consensus algorithm today, despite the fact that newer protocols for decentralized applications are experimenting with alternative consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS), and other experimental algorithms that use a fusion of both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.</p><h3>What is Proof-of-Work?</h3><p>Bitcoin and other networks operate on what is called Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Consensus mechanisms are what allows an entire system to agree on the current state of the network and requires participation from both miners who act as transaction validators, as well as individual nodes that enforce the consensus rules. It&rsquo;s vital that every single node has the exact same copy of the ledger and enforces the same consensus rules in order to be &lsquo;in consensus.&rsquo;</p><p>If one computer node has one version of Bitcoin protocol while another is running a slightly different version of Bitcoin, then the network isn&rsquo;t compatible . Since Bitcoin and other blockchain protocols function to have every transaction permanently recorded on a digital ledger, having a different &lsquo;consensus&rsquo; as to how the digital ledger functions would make the functionality moot. Simply put, each computer has to be &lsquo;in consensus&rsquo; for the blockchain to be valid.</p><p>One of the main factors of decentralization is to not be subject to a central authority, for the laws that govern any blockchain project to adhere to math and code. The alternative is a centralized authority that dictates how a protocol runs. The drawbacks, of course, are entities that can abuse their power over a system. As such, consensus algorithms are one of the key elements to achieve a functionally viable yet trust-minimized system.</p><p>As a mechanism of security, PoW also uses energy and computation to protect the network against attacks. Using cryptography, hashes, and complicated puzzles, PoW works to ensure that the digital ledger remains unalterable for good. To alter the blockchain, one would have to have vast computational power and hardware that can solve algorithms of otherworldly difficulty. This is what makes Proof-of-Work blockchain networks so secure.</p><h3>Mining and Proof-of-Work</h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="genesis mining" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60f/7eba7e55fd.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/60f/7eba7e55fd.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/60f/7eba7e55fd.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/60f/7eba7e55fd.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/60f/7eba7e55fd.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/60f/7eba7e55fd.jpg 1024w"></figure><p>Genesis Mining center. Source: Marco Krohn / Wikimedia Commons.</p><p>In crypto-speak, mining and Proof-of-Work have become synonymous. It is easy to see why: PoW refers to the proving work that was done via spending energy. In turn, miners share a Bitcoin block reward, which is often referred to as &ldquo;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin-mining.htm">mining bitcoin</a>.&rdquo;</p><p>In the early days, it was a lot easier to mine coins because there weren&rsquo;t a lot of people mining Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc. It wasn&rsquo;t as competitive because not as many blocks were created. Blocks are where the transaction data is permanently recorded on the blockchain. Mining a block refers to finding a solution to the math problem, and miners reap block rewards and transaction fees for mining. Every 2,016 blocks, Bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts either to the upside or downside, based on the number of available miners. As such, each block&rsquo;s average time is always approximately 10 minutes.</p><p>Back in the days, you could run just any old PC to mine Bitcoin. Over the years, the mining difficulty increased to where you needed GPUs or specialized machines called ASICs to mine. Now you have a situation in which entire mining farms are built just to be competitive in mining Bitcoin. Unless you have vast resources and cheap energy, mining Bitcoin is not necessarily profitable.</p><p>Long story short, mining works like this. Let&rsquo;s say that I want you to guess between a number 1-20. Easy, right? We all played this game as children. But let&rsquo;s say I want you to guess a number between 1 &#8211; 1 billion. A bit harder. Now, I want you to guess a 64 digit string of 16 symbols, from 1-10 and letters A-G. You might need to have 3000 IQ or an immensely powerful machine to guess that I was thinking of the data string 1eF32a0a026bb49&hellip; and so on.</p><p>If you guessed right with your ultra giga-brain, congrats. You&rsquo;ve &lsquo;proven the work&rsquo;. This is why Proof-of-Work was reliable for so long and still has valid proof to support it. You would need vast computational power in order to even remotely control or hack the network because of all the cryptographic work done on it. The task would need herculean effort.</p><h3>Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake</h3><p>Although the electrical output needed to generate Proof-of-Work is overblown by mainstream media, Bitcoin mining still requires significant amounts of energy. Bitcoin uses up 0.5% of the world&rsquo;s energy output, as much as one megacity like Las Vegas, although its proponents claim that much of the hashrate comes from renewable energy sources or stranded energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Another popular criticism of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-work-coins.htm">Proof-of-Work coins</a> states that the consensus algorithm favors miners who have more resources since those with a bunch of cash can buy whole buildings filled with mining tools and mine cryptos. In contrast, Proof-of-Stake, the protocol chance to validate blocks is proportional to the amount of currency you owe. So there is a baseline level of resources you need, which is how much crypto you need to &lsquo;stake&rsquo; to &lsquo;prove&rsquo; or validate the network, plus the hardware requirements. Instead of mining, Proof-of-Stake functions on validator nodes, which are run by users who validate the network.</p><p>However, Proof-of-Stake lends to other issues like a blockchain being overtaken. In PoS, if suddenly a bunch of people come together to take over 51% of the network, or even a single powerful individual buys more than half the protocol&rsquo;s stake, then the network is compromised. In theory, this might be possible, but in practice it has been impractical to execute. Still, because of this and other issues, some protocols in the future might opt to use a mix of Proof-of-Work ideas alongside Proof-of-Stake.</p><h4>Closing thoughts</h4><p>Proof-of-Work, although originally having its roots in the early internet, has become a word associated with cryptocurrency, which may be the idea&rsquo;s biggest, most lasting legacy. Though controversial, PoW&rsquo;s environmental impact is still highly questionable, unlike the unparalleled security it provides to the Bitcoin network.</p>
