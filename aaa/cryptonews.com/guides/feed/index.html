										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our Bizzo Casino review highlights plenty of attractive selling points &#8211; their large number of games, enticing bonuses and the number of payment options available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bizzo is a crypto casino that opened its doors to players in 2021. It’s quickly grown in popularity but how does it truly compare to other Bitcoin casinos?</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is Bizzo Casino?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bizzo/en">Bizzo</a> is an online casino for both casual fiat gamers and crypto gamblers. Though relatively new in the space, they’ve grown quite popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The casino is notable for its large number of excellent games (including live casino games). The overall design of the website and the UI of the games help to create an enjoyable and smooth experience. In total, more than 70 top-tier software providers are represented, although the casino does not offer any sports betting options at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">TechSolutions Group, the company behind Bizzo Casino, has two different licenses: one from the government of Curacao and one from the Kahnawake Gaming Commission. This also helped establish the casino’s credibility.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Bizzo Casino Bonuses &amp; Promos </strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bizzo/en">Bizzo Casino</a> has multiple bonus deals offering both free spins and additional funds, but there are certain conditions that have to be met first. Let’s take a closer look.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bizzo Casino Welcome Bonus Offers</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bizzo Casino welcome bonus is actually a package of benefits a new player can get because it includes both free spins and extra funds. The casino will match any initial deposit of up to €100 and provide 100 free spins for Dig Dig Digger or Mechanical Clover slots.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-153567" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609118-bizzo-casinos-first-deposit-bonus-300x111.jpg" alt="Bizzo Casino First Deposit Bonus" width="1000" height="369" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609118-bizzo-casinos-first-deposit-bonus-300x111.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609118-bizzo-casinos-first-deposit-bonus-1024x378.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609118-bizzo-casinos-first-deposit-bonus-768x283.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609118-bizzo-casinos-first-deposit-bonus-1536x567.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609118-bizzo-casinos-first-deposit-bonus-2048x756.jpg 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609118-bizzo-casinos-first-deposit-bonus-150x55.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s worth noting that your free spins will be split into two batches &#8211; the first half arrives immediately, while the other comes 24 hours after the deposit is made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To claim this bonus, you only need to create an account and make a deposit. However, the bonus does have a x40 wagering requirement, and the maximum bet is capped at €5 (this only applies if the bonus is active).</span></p>
<h3><strong>Existing Customer Promos</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Existing players also have something to look forward to because every deposit made on a Monday will be accompanied by some free spins. 20 free spins are awarded for the minimum deposit (€20), 50 spins for a deposit of €50 or more, and 100 spins for a €100 deposit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Thursdays, players can get a reload bonus of 50% (up to €200) usable in Magic Cauldron &#8211; The Enchanted Brew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bizzo Casino&#8217;s welcome offer also extends to a bonus for a player’s second deposit. In this case, they will receive 50% of the funds deposited, up to €300, and 50 free spins, but only for Johnny Cash or Elvis Frog in Vegas. The same wagering conditions as for the welcome bonus apply.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bizzo Casino Loyalty Program</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Bizzo Casino VIP program consists of 30 levels that players can scale the more they play on the casino’s website. The first five levels award an increasing number of free spins, whereas from level 6 this changes to cash prizes, starting with €5. Level 30 awards a whopping €150,000.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-153566" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-300x141.jpg" alt="Bizzo Casino VIP Program" width="1000" height="471" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-300x141.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-1024x482.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-768x362.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-1536x723.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-2048x964.jpg 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609115-bizzo-casino-vip-program-150x71.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The idea is simple: for every €15 bet on any of the games, players receive one comp point. As the number of comp points grows, so will the player’s VIP level, which means better prizes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rewards won this way have to be turned over three times before they can be withdrawn.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bizzo Casino Bonus Promo Codes</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">In order to activate Bizzo&#8217;s existing customer promos, you must input a specific code when making a deposit. If the conditions are met, the code will activate the bonus. However, there is no Bizzo Casino bonus code needed for the welcome bonus &#8211; this is triggered automatically.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bizzo Casino bonus codes:</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>CASH</strong> &#8211; to activate the second deposit bonus</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>SPIN</strong> &#8211; for Monday free spins</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>THU</strong> &#8211; Thursday reload bonus</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bizzo Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bizzo Casino doesn’t currently offer a no deposit bonus.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Bizzo Casino?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">There are more than 3000 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bizzo/en">Bizzo Casino</a> games available, and pretty much all of them run extremely smoothly. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Slots</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slots are this casino’s bread and butter as they form the majority of the games (about two-thirds of the titles are slots). In fact, this casino is right up there with the </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-slots-sites.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400">best Bitcoin slots sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. There are plenty of different types of slots to choose from, be that classic slots or jackpot slots, and a range of fun themes including adventure, horror, science fiction, etc.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-153568" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609121-bizzo-casinos-games-library-300x124.jpg" alt="Bizzo Casinos Games Library" width="1000" height="412" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609121-bizzo-casinos-games-library-300x124.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609121-bizzo-casinos-games-library-1024x422.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609121-bizzo-casinos-games-library-768x316.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609121-bizzo-casinos-games-library-1536x633.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609121-bizzo-casinos-games-library-2048x844.jpg 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609121-bizzo-casinos-games-library-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s important to note that only slots contribute to meeting the turnover requirement for the bonuses players receive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it comes to some particular titles that caught our eye here, games like Wolf Gold by Pragmatic Play and Felix Gaming’s Book of Annuaki certainly deserve to be mentioned. Then there’s also Johnny Cash, Four Lucky Diamonds, the latter of which offers multiple play areas. After certain conditions are met, you can unlock additional reel sets &#8211; which provide more chances to win big.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Roulette</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">there are plenty of roulette titles at Bizzo to keep players happy. All the main types of roulette are represented, including American, European, French, and fun variations like Bonus roulette. Bizzo Casino partners with game developers that employ random number generators to come up with the outcome for every round. Therefore, players can rest assured every game is 100% fair.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Blackjack</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blackjack is another big group of Bizzo Casino games, and it covers all the most popular sub-genres: Classic, European, American, Atlantic City, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some top-quality providers are represented in this category, from Pragmatic Play to Evolution Gaming and Playtech, so the quality of games is perfect. Great graphics and technical perfection create an excellent blackjack experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the titles we recommend here are Blackjack Classic 1-72 and Lightning Blackjack by Evolution and Blackjack Lobby by Playtech, but there are many other options, so a little bit of digging will go a long way.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Poker</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only part of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bizzo/en">Bizzo Casino’s</a> library we have some criticism of is its poker lobby. Sure, there are several different types of poker one can play here, such as Caribbean Stud, Texas Hold ‘Em, and Three Card Poker, but it is clear that the focus was on other types of games.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Live dealer</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After slots, live dealer games are the best part of Bizzo Casino’s library. About 15 different developers such as Evolution Gaming and Pragmatic Play deliver more than 200 different titles, so the fans of this type of games can really enjoy themselves. Poker, blackjack, roulette, and baccarat are all covered, while game shows such as Deal or No Deal, Monopoly Live, Dream Catcher, and many others are available, too.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-153564" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609108-bizzo-casino-live-games-300x158.jpg" alt="Bizzo Casino Live Games" width="1000" height="527" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609108-bizzo-casino-live-games-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609108-bizzo-casino-live-games-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609108-bizzo-casino-live-games-768x405.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609108-bizzo-casino-live-games-1536x809.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609108-bizzo-casino-live-games-2048x1079.jpg 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609108-bizzo-casino-live-games-150x79.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dealers are very very professional and excel in ensuring you have a fun experience, never crossing the line but always doing their best to keep players engaged and happy. They are certainly one of the main reasons why this part of the website is so popular. The interfaces for each game &#8211; like Treasure Island, Crazy Pachinko and Lightning Roulette &#8211; we played were well-designed, which made for a fantastic overall experience.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Other games</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from all these games, there are a few other genres one can enjoy here. The most prominent example of that is Bizzo Casino’s fast games, which are sometimes referred to as arcade games by other casinos. These include the likes of Plinko, Minesweeper, Aviator, Limbo Cat and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are also various dice and bingo games available.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bizzo Casino Sports Betting</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Bizzo Casino does not offer sports betting options at the time of writing this review. For alternative options, check out our guide to the </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400">best Bitcoin sports betting sites</span></a><b>.</b></p>
<h2><strong>What Software Does Bizzo Casino Use?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">There are over 70 game developers represented at Bizzo Casino, including Pragmatic Play, Evolution Gaming, Microgaming, and Betsoft &#8211; all represented by titles as popular as Buffalo King Megaways, Bonanza, Thunderstruck II and Gypsy Rose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The games run perfectly and look fantastic. Players will be able to quickly immerse themselves in the experience &#8211; great graphics, beautiful visual effects, and the accompanying sound effects all combine for instant enjoyment. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Bizzo Casino Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">One of this casino’s greatest strengths is the amount of deposit and withdrawal options available. It is possible to use both fiat and cryptocurrencies, with the minimum deposit being set to €10 (although a new player has to deposit double that amount if they want to get the welcome bonus).</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-153565" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609112-bizzo-casino-payment-options-300x87.jpg" alt="Bizzo Casino Payment Options" width="1000" height="291" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609112-bizzo-casino-payment-options-300x87.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609112-bizzo-casino-payment-options-1024x298.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609112-bizzo-casino-payment-options-768x224.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609112-bizzo-casino-payment-options-1536x447.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609112-bizzo-casino-payment-options-2048x596.jpg 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705609112-bizzo-casino-payment-options-150x44.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bizzo Casino deposit options allow players to choose between using their bank cards (Visa or MasterCard), one of the numerous wallets such as AstroPay, Skrill, ecoPayz, eZeeWallets, etc., or a cryptocurrency (</span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Tether, Ripple, Cardano). Even bank transfers are available!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same goes for the withdrawal methods: the are are plenty to choose from, and the minimum requirement is once again €10, except for bank transfers (€35). However, there are daily, weekly, and monthly caps in this case (€4,000, €16,000, and €50,000, respectively). Bizzo Casino does not charge any fees, but this may not be the case with every payment method provider, so it may be wise to check that before initiating any transfers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All requests are usually processed in a couple of hours, although the time it takes for the money to reach its final destination will depend on the payment method used. Still, the maximum waiting time is five days.</span></p>
<p>The casino also has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-kyc-know-your-customer-process-explained.htm">account verification and KYC procedures in place to prevent money laundering</a>. Completing these processes will allow players to fully utilize the speed with which the casino processes withdrawal requests. Otherwise, getting a request approved may take a while.</p>

<h2><strong>Bizzo Casino Interface &amp; User Experience</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Using this website is very easy and intuitive. The screen is never cluttered, but it’s never barren either &#8211; there’s always the right amount of items there to show the richness of the casino’s offer without it ever being overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finding the right game is also very simple because it is possible to search for a particular product using a search bar, but the games can also be filtered according to software providers or a particular type of game (slots, roulette, blackjack, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The customer service is also commendable, especially since one can reach the team via live chat. This makes getting any answer very quick and easy. If the live chat is not available, there is a contact form and the casino’s email address on the website. The reply usually comes the following day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, other Bizzo Casino reviews pointed out problems. Casanova.org noted that certain important information, like terms and conditions or bonus conditions, is hard to find, and Casino Guru found that certain sections of Bizzo’s terms and conditions seemed unfair to players. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">We recommend familiarising yourself with every aspect of any casino site you visit, and Bizzo is no exception. We found their customer support team to be keen and knowledgeable, ensuring a safe and comfortable experience.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Does Bizzo Casino Have a Mobile App?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bizzo/en">Bizzo Casino</a> does not have a special app players can download and use to play the games that way but this is because there is absolutely no need for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The website works flawlessly on all mobile devices, so accessing it via a browser is smooth and effortless. In fact, the experience is just as good as on a desktop computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only difference is that the main menu is at the bottom of the screen, not in a drop-down form in one of the upper corners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Any player can access the website in a few taps and not lose absolutely anything when it comes to the gaming experience here.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bizzo Casino Security</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">As mentioned at the start of our Bizzo casino review, this casino (owned by TechSolutions Group) has two different licenses: a Curacao Gaming Control Board license </span><span style="font-weight: 400">(number 8048/JAZ2017-067) and a Kahnawake Gaming Commission (number 00867). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the Curacao license is a standard in this industry, it is very commendable that the casino went ahead and acquired another license. This isn’t something seen very often, and it speaks volumes about the casino’s reliability that it was able to fulfill the criteria for multiple licenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, this website has a valid SSL certificate, meaning all of the data on it is encrypted for maximum protection. All of the payment methods are reliable and work flawlessly and it’s possible to activate 2FA in a profile for an additional layer of security.</span></p>

<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">As this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bizzo/en">Bizzo Casino</a> review has shown, there are plenty of very good reasons why the website has managed to maintain and even grow its presence since 2021. It is a reliable, fun casino where every player can find something appealing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the games are slots, but there’s also a great live casino to enjoy. Games like craps, bingo, and blackjack wrap up the selection nicely, and it’s worth pointing out that the providers available are some of the best in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the most impressive features are the number of available payment methods and the fact that the casino has not one but two licenses. These two factors combined show how much Bizzo Casino cares about its players’ security because all of the methods are perfectly reliable, and the licenses come from trusted and well-known sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In conclusion, this is exactly the kind of online casino a player should be on the lookout for if they’re looking for a place where they can simply relax and enjoy. It is a reliable, fun website with plenty of great games, an intuitive interface, and excellent support. In short, a casino we can wholeheartedly recommend.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cold wallets, also known as hardware wallets, are one of the safest storage solutions for your cryptocurrencies. That’s because they store your wallet’s seed phrase offline while being encrypted. In other words, if a hacker compromises your computer, they won’t be able to see the seed phrase and steal your funds.</p>
<p>What’s more, hardware wallets require that you authorize each transaction by pressing physical buttons. So unless someone holds your hardware wallet and knows your PIN number to unlock it, they can never transfer funds out of your cold wallet. Given that over <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/crypto-heists-surge-2023-stolen/" rel="sponsored"><u>$1.75 billion worth of crypto was stolen in hacks last year</u></a>, having a cold storage wallet could have saved you from being in such a statistic.</p>
<p>To find the best cold wallets this year, we compared multiple options in terms of features and ease of use. Read more to find our top picks.</p>

<h2><strong>The Best Cold Crypto Wallets Reviewed</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore the most popular cold storage wallets that crypto investors are using right now to secure their altcoin holdings. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Ledger Nano S Plus — Overall Best Cold Crypto Wallet, Supported By Live App</strong></h3>
<p>This is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/" rel="sponsored"><u>Ledger’s</u></a> entry-level wallet. But don’t let this fool you. Ledger Nano S Plus offers the same functionality as the more expensive Ledger Nano X. The main difference between the two is that the Ledger Nano X has Bluetooth and it feels like it’s made with higher-quality materials.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334939/ledger-nano-s-plus.jpg" alt="Ledger Nano S Plus" width="900" /></figure>
<p><br />The app that all Ledger devices use is called Ledger Live. This is both a mobile app and a desktop app. You can use it to buy coins with a credit card, swap them using decentralized exchanges like 1Inch and others, or stake your coins.</p>
<p>Ledger Nano S Plus supports over 5,500 coins, which is the same as the more expensive Nano X version, and you can also hold NFTs in your wallet.</p>
<p>Since it doesn’t support Bluetooth connectivity, you can connect your Ledger cold wallet via a USB-C cable with your smartphone or computer. This shouldn’t be a big deal if you mostly use your Ledger wallet for storing coins. If you plan to actively transfer coins or trade, the Ledger Nano X could be the better option due to its Bluetooth support.</p>
<p>Ledger’s support is top-notch. If something happens to your device, say it breaks or malfunctions, Ledger will send you a replacement free of charge. All this makes Ledger Nano S Plus the best cold wallet in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger Live mobile and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports staking, swapping and buying with a card</li>
<li>Over 5,500 coins and tokens supported</li>
<li>Multiple accessories to customize your Ledger</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Bluetooth</li>
<li>No wallet seed phrase backup recovery yet</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2. Trezor Safe 3 — Obscure Transactions &amp; Restore Your Seed Phrase if Lost</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/" rel="sponsored"><u>Trezor Safe 3</u></a> is the best offering from Trezor because it offers the same functionality as the most expensive cold wallet but at an affordable price. Trezor Safe 3 comes with a monochromatic OLED screen where you can see the transaction information, and USB-C connectivity since it doesn’t have Bluetooth.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be a dealbreaker, though, as cold wallets are designed for long-term storage and not active trading.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334943/trezor-safe-3.jpg" alt="Trezor Safe 3" width="900" /></figure>
<p>Some of the safety features of this Trezor cold wallet include the Secure Element (EAL6+) and the passphrase to unlock your device, which makes it hard for hackers to steal your assets. Another feature of Trezor cold wallets is the Shamir Backup, which splits your seed phrase into up to 16 pieces to help you recover your seed phrase if you lose it, meaning if you lose one piece or it gets stolen, you can still recover your assets.</p>
<p>As a companion to this Trezor cold wallet is the Trezor Suite app available on mobile, desktop and browser. Via the app, you can send, receive and trade over 8,000 cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>Unlike most cold wallets, Trezor has open-source software, which can be examined by anyone to ensure it&#8217;s safe. Another interesting feature is that you can go incognito with Coinjoin, which lumps multiple transactions into one, thus obscuring your transactions, and you can protect your identity with Tor.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trezor Suite mobile, browser and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports sending, receiving and trading via the app</li>
<li>Affordable price</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Bluetooth</li>

<h3><strong>3. Ledger Stax — Store Over 5,000 Cryptocurrencies, Wireless Charging &amp; Bluetooth Connectivity</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/" rel="sponsored"><u>Ledger Stax</u></a> is one of the most innovative cold wallets you can find. It looks like a small ebook reader because of its curved E Ink touchscreen. Because of that, it is mostly designed for storing your NFT collections because you can put your favorite NFT on the screen like an ebook cover.</p>
<p>Aside from its interesting design, it supports wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and it’s highly customizable. This means you can connect your Stax with your Ledger Live mobile app and sign transactions without using cables.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334944/ledger-stax.jpg" alt="Ledger Stax" width="900" /></figure>
<p>As the name suggests, you can “stack” multiple Stax wallets one on top of the other, if you have multiple wallets. For example, one Stax could hold your Ethereum NFTs, a second one could store your Solana NFTs, and a third could store your coins.</p>
<p>Of course, one Stax is enough to hold all of the above. But if you want to have multiple Stax’s, say one for yourself, another for a family member, all with different screen images, you can easily do so.</p>
<p>Similar to the other two Ledgers, Stax uses the Ledger Live mobile and desktop app to swap coins, stake coins or buy them with a card. Also, the Ledger Live app is used to update your cold wallet’s firmware.</p>
<p>With all these features and functionality, Stax comes with an eye-watering price of around $279, which is on the higher end compared to other cold wallets. Despite that, if you are an NFT enthusiast and you can afford it, Stax is one of the best cold wallets you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger Live mobile and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports staking, swapping and buying with a card</li>
<li>Bluetooth and wireless charging</li>
<li>E Ink touchscreen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More expensive than other cold wallets</li>

<h3><strong>4. Trezor Model T — Color Touchscreen Buttons &amp; Added Protection Via MicroSD Card Encrypted PIN</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/" rel="sponsored"><u>Trezor Model T</u></a> is Trezor’s premium model that comes with a color LCD touchscreen instead of physical buttons and a micro SD card slot. The first is mostly a design feature, while the second is a premium protection feature. The way it works is, if you enable it, <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/press/thoughtleadership/sd-memory-cards-secure-store-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-offline/" rel="sponsored"><i><u>a randomly generated secret is stored on the SD card that you can insert into your Trezor Model T for extra protection</u></i></a>.</p>
<p>Everything else is the same as with the other Trezor models. For example, you get access to a mobile, desktop and browser app called Trezor Suite. This comes with coin swapping and trading, as well as sending and receiving coins.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334945/trezor-model-t.jpg" alt="Trezor Model T" width="900" /></figure>
<p>If you want to obscure some of your transactions, you can do so with Coinjoin, which, as the name suggests, “joins” multiple transactions into one to make it hard for outsiders to tell which transaction was yours. This feature is available to the other Trezor models as well.</p>
<p>Some of its safety features include the Secure Element (EAL6+) and the passphrase to unlock your device, which makes it hard for hackers to steal your assets. Another safety feature of Trezor cold wallets is the Shamir Backup. This splits your seed phrase into multiple pieces and even if one piece gets lost or is stolen, you can still recover your assets with the remaining pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trezor Suite mobile, browser and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports sending, receiving and trading via the app</li>
<li>LCD Touchscreen</li>
<li>Micro SD card protection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<li>No Bluetooth</li>

<h2><strong>What is a Cryptocurrency Cold Wallet?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A crypto cold storage wallet, also known as a hardware wallet, is a device with specifically designed hardware to encrypt and store your wallet’s seed phrase offline and in a safe environment. Hot wallets, on the other hand, store your seed phrase online. If a hacker has access to your computer, they can see your seed phrase and use it to steal your funds.</p>
<p>Cold wallets typically have physical buttons, or touchscreen buttons depending on the device, which are used for signing transactions on the blockchain. This makes it hard for scammers and hackers to steal your funds unless they physically hold the device. What’s more, each cold wallet is locked with a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA. The fraudsters will also need to know that to unlock your wallet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334952/ledger.jpg" alt="Ledged crypto app" width="900" /><br />Using a companion app, these wallets can store crypto assets including cryptocurrencies and NFTs. You can also trade, swap, stake and more with these apps, giving cold wallets the same functionality as hot wallets but with added security.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can connect your cold wallet to a hot wallet like MetaMask or Phantom, which makes connecting to DeFi applications seamless. For every transaction you make, you will have to sign it with the buttons on your device.</p>
<h2>Our Methodology  &#8211; How We Rated the Best Crypto Cold Storage</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In order to present our list of the best crypto cold wallets, we developed a methodology that involved looking at several key features. The best cold storage wallet solutions are the ones that tick the most boxes on this list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Features &#8211; </strong>Naturally, this was our highest priority. We checked that the wallets use strong encryption methods to protect your private keys, allow you to set a secure PIN or password to access the device and the information contained within, and have reliable backup and recovery options.</li>
<li><strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies &#8211; </strong>Not all wallets support the same range of digital assets, so we wanted to make sure that the cold wallets we chose supported the widest range of cryptos possible. </li>
<li><strong>User-Friendly Interface &#8211; </strong>This list features wallets that as a whole, have intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, suitable for people who are new to the world of crypto, as well as long-time holders.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency &#8211; </strong>Between open-source and closed-source wallets, we will always favor open-source wallets that let the community review and audit the code for security, enhancing transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Community Reputation, </strong><strong>Reviews, and Ratings &#8211; </strong>We researched and read reviews from other users, giving priority to wallets that had positive feedback and a solid reputation in crypto circles.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturer History and Reputation &#8211;</strong> We researched the manufacturer&#8217;s history to make sure that our top picks come from established and reputable companies. </li>
<li><strong>Security Audits &#8211; </strong>Our highest-ranked wallets have undergone third-party security audits, have multi-sig functionality, and can operate in an air-gapped (offline) environment, to reduce the risk of online attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Price &#8211; </strong>Last but not least, we considered the cost of the wallet. Security is vital, but you don&#8217;t want to break the bank buying a wallet &#8211; otherwise, you&#8217;ll have nothing to store there. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How do Cold Wallets Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>All cold storage crypto wallets have a seed phrase, consisting of 12 or 24 words, which you can use to restore your wallet and access your crypto funds in case something happens to your computer or smartphone. That’s because your crypto wallet and assets are stored on the blockchain. Using the seed phrase you actually prove that you own the cold wallet crypto.</p>
<h3><strong>Cold Wallets Store Your Seed Phrase Offline</strong></h3>
<p>Cold wallets generate and store the user’s private keys on the physical device. This means the seed phrase is never exposed on your computer screen while you’re connected to the Internet. This way, hackers can never see your seed phrase via your computer even if your computer is compromised.</p>
<p>If the user needs to restore a private key, they enter the seed phrase directly on the device itself, which is encrypted and offline.</p>
<h3><strong>You Need to Press a Button to Sign Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>Aside from keeping your seed phrase safe, cold wallets have another safety feature. You have to physically press buttons on the cold wallet to authorize transactions. This way, no one can authorize the transaction except the person who holds the cold wallet device.</p>
<p>To increase security, cold wallets use a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA to unlock the device. If someone manages to steal your hardware wallet, they would need to know your access codes to unlock it.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>Why Is The Seed Phrase Important?</strong></h3>
<p>The crypto wallet seed phrase, often made of 12 to 24 randomly generated words, is the backup key to your wallet. This sequence of words is linked to the private keys and acts as a mnemonic representation to retrieve access to the assets within the wallet.</p>
<p>For example, you create a crypto wallet and you don’t save the seed phrase. If you need to reinstall your operating system, someone steals your computer or your cold wallet breaks and you don’t know your wallet’s seed phrase, you won’t be able to access your digital wallet and your funds will be trapped.</p>
<p>To protect your seed phrase, you need to write it down on a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe. The best bitcoin cold wallet makers, like Ledger, sell metal seed phrase protectors that can withstand fire and damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Advantages of Cold Crypto Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The main advantage of a cold wallet is enhanced security. Since you need to physically press buttons on the wallet, you are safe from remote access hacks. </p>
<h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>
<p>The main advantage of cold crypto wallets is their superior protection against online vulnerabilities. Cold wallets aren’t connected to the internet, making them immune to cyber attacks.</p>
<p>This includes protection from hacking attempts, phishing schemes, malware infections and other malicious activities. By storing private keys offline, cold wallets ensure that access to your funds is protected. </p>
<h3><strong>Unauthorized Access Protection</strong></h3>
<p>Cold wallets require that you physically press a button to sign a transaction. In the unfortunate event that a malicious actor has gained access to your computer accounts and companion cold wallet app, they can’t move your funds without you pressing the buttons.</p>
<p>This acts as a physical barrier against unauthorized access and theft, giving you peace of mind that your funds are protected even when you sleep.</p>
<h3><strong>Long-Term Safekeeping</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto cold wallets are designed for the long-term storing of your crypto assets. That’s because the safety feature of pressing buttons to authorize transactions can become a nuisance if you plan to use your cold wallet device for active trading. What’s more, active trading requires that you connect to multiple decentralized apps, which could potentially pose a threat if they’re hacked.</p>
<p>Unlike hot wallets, which are designed for frequent transactions and daily use, cold wallets are better suited for &#8220;hodling&#8221;, which is for keeping your assets safe long-term.</p>
<h3><strong>Immune to Platform Failures</strong></h3>
<p>Online platforms and exchanges are known to experience downtimes, glitches and even hacks. For example, <a href="https://decrypt.co/150669/defi-exchange-curve-finance-confirms-various-ethereum-pools-hacked" rel="sponsored"><u>DeFi exchange Curve Finance had various Ethereum pools hacked</u></a> where $52 million were stolen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/13/north-korean-attackers-linked-to-54m-coinex-hack-blockchain-data-suggests/" rel="sponsored"><u>CoinEx lost $54 million in a hack</u></a>. If you had funds in these two platforms or any other where the assets were compromised, you could have lost all your funds.</p>
<p>Cold wallets eliminate this risk because you have full control over your assets and how they move.</p>
<h2><strong>Cold Wallets vs Hot Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Both cold wallets and hot wallets are designed to store your digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But there are some differences between the two.</p>
<h3><strong>Assets Safety</strong></h3>
<p>One of the main differences between cold wallets and hot wallets is safety. Hot wallets provide you with a seed phrase visible on your computer screen or smartphone when you open a new wallet. Cold wallets, on the other hand, provide you with a seed phrase directly on the screen of the hardware wallet, which isn’t connected to the internet.</p>
<p>This means that unless someone looks directly at your hardware wallet’s screen when you read and write the 12 to 24 words, there is no way that they can know your seed phrase to steal your funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Transaction Execution</strong></h3>
<p>Another difference between these two types of wallets is how transactions are executed. You can sign transactions with one click using hot wallets, which makes it an excellent choice for frequent trading or using decentralized apps.</p>
<p>Cold wallets, however, have buttons that you have to physically press to sign the transaction. What’s more, you need to unlock your crypto cold wallet device with a PIN, a passphrase or 2FA. This makes signing transactions more complex but also safer.</p>
<h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Due to being safer, the best cold wallets are designed for long-term safekeeping. This means that once you buy your crypto assets, you send them to your cold wallet and you leave them there until you decide to sell.</p>
<p>Hot wallets are designed to be exploited daily. Connect your hot wallets to decentralized exchanges, yield farming protocols or NFT marketplaces and feel free to continuously sign transactions. You can always move your profits into your cold wallets for safekeeping.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose a Cold Cryptocurrency Wallet</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Choosing the best cold wallet is a decision that requires weighing in several factors, including security features, supported cryptocurrencies, mobile app experience as well as pricing.</p>
<h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>This is the main reason to get a cold wallet. But there are nuances that you have to consider as not all cold wallets are created equal. For example, some users prefer Bluetooth connectivity so they can easily sign transactions on their smartphones without using cables.</p>
<p>Other users may consider Bluetooth as a liability and prefer to have air-gapped devices, meaning they have no wireless contact of any kind that could compromise security.</p>
<p>Also, look for wallets that have a proven track record of security, like Ledger and Trezor, which employ strong encryption methods. Additionally, consider the wallet&#8217;s recovery options. In case the wallet is lost or damaged you will have to use your seed phrase to access your wallet.</p>
<p>But sometimes you could lose your seed phrase as well. Every Trezor cold wallet has a solution for this via something called Shamir Backup where you split your seed phrase into several pieces. If one piece is lost or stolen, you can still recover your wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334956/ledger-recover.jpg" alt="Ledger Recover" width="900" /></figure>
<p>Ledger has recently employed a similar <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/24/crypto-wallet-maker-ledger-officially-rolls-out-recover-unleashing-fresh-round-of-snark/" rel="sponsored"><u>wallet recovery feature called Ledger Recover</u></a>. This is a paid feature where you have to submit valid ID documents and a selfie recording. Once approved, your device will encrypt your seed phrase and split it into three fragments, which will be used to recover your seed phrase. Because your seed phrase is locked to your ID, you can be the only one who can request the recovery fragments.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>What is Shamir Backup?</strong></h3>
<p>Shamir Backup is a security standard that aims to protect your seed phrase. The way it works is your seed phrase is split up into pieces, called recovery shares, and you can store them at various places. If one of the pieces is lost or damaged, you can still recover your assets.</p>
<p>Recovery shares are sequences of 20 or 33 words that carry part of the cryptographic secret. When you combine the number of shares you create a master seed, which you can use to recover your wallet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3>
<p>Most crypto cold wallets support the most popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, but they also support thousands of other coins and tokens. However, some wallets, like Blockstream Jade, support only Bitcoin and no other coin.</p>
<p>That is why you have to consider what you really need before buying a cold wallet. If you only want to hold Bitcoin and sell it in 10 years, then Blockstream Jade could be a perfect wallet; it’s cheaper, it’s reliable and it’s safe. But if you want to store multiple coins and do multi-chain swaps, then Trezor or Ledger wallets are typically the way to go.</p>
<h3><strong>Companion Mobile App</strong></h3>
<p>Even though cold wallets are designed to be offline storage devices, most of them come with companion mobile apps that allow you to monitor your portfolio, to initiate transactions, to stake your idle coins, to use decentralized apps like Uniswap and 1inch exchange, and more.</p>
<p>That is why it’s important to consider cold storage wallets that meet your requirements. Ledger’s Ledger Live app is one of the best companion apps, where you can stake your idle coins. This feature isn’t available in most other cold wallet apps.</p>
<p>Another valuable app is the Trezor Suite, which has similar functionalities to Ledger Live, but it can also help obscure your transactions with Coinjoin.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334958/trezor-suite.jpg" alt="Trezor Suite" width="900" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Device Cost</strong></h3>
<p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/21/mark-cuban-lost-nearly-900000-dollars-to-crypto-hackers.html" rel="sponsored"><u>Mark Cuban lost nearly $900,000 to crypto hackers</u></a> by installing a fake MetaMask app. If this happened to him it could happen to everyone. That’s why it’s important to own a cold wallet and never share your seed phrase regardless of the device’s cost.</p>
<p>However, if two or more devices share a similar price point while offering the same functionality, you could spend the extra money investing in crypto. Compare the wallets you are willing to get and see whether paying a premium is worth it.</p>
<h2><strong>Limitations of Cold Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While cold wallets offer security advantages, there are some limitations to consider. Before opting for a cold wallet, weigh the benefits against the potential inconveniences associated with cold storage.</p>
<p>Susceptible to physical attacks. Someone could steal your hardware wallet or it could be damaged or lost. If you don’t have your seed phrase ready, you won’t be able to recover your assets.</p>
<p>Regular transactions. Cold wallets are designed for storage, which makes them inconvenient for everyday transaction signing. That’s because you have to physically press a button every time you wish to make a transaction. If you’re making hundreds of transactions each day, it could be tedious to approve them every time on your hardware wallet.</p>
<p>Cost. While hot wallets are free to use, cold wallets come with a purchase price. Of course, this is a small price to pay for the safety of your crypto assets. But you still have to weigh in whether you really need a cold wallet or not for your intended use cases.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The 10 best cold wallets for 2024 stand out not only for their robust security features but also for their user-friendly companion apps, a wide range of coin support and innovative functionalities. Whether you’re a beginner in the crypto space or a seasoned investor, buying a cold wallet is probably one of the most prudent investments you can make.</p>
<p>Consider one of the three Ledger devices to hold your crypto assets. These are some of the best cold storage wallet solutions on the market, with strong safety features and a mobile app that lets you stake your coins or trade them whenever you want.</p>
<p>Ledger S Plus supports over 5,500 coins for an affordable price. But if you’re looking for Bluetooth connectivity, Ledger Nano X could be a better option.</p>

</p>
<h2>Bitcasino Security</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
This Bitcasino review will be incomplete if we don&#8217;t talk about the security features of this casino. The casino is licensed by the government of Curacao, under the gaming license 1668/JAZ.&nbsp; The Curacao Gaming Control Board recently <a href="https://gbo-licensing.com/curacao-gambling-laws/" rel="sponsored">updated its regulations to increase player safety</a>.</p>
<p>The casino offers both two-factor authentication and SSL encryption, which is the highest safety standard in the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>Although two-factor authentication is used widely in the crypto industry to protect users from every form of crypto scam, SSL encryption is used to secure the personal information and financial details of their users.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Casino uses a random number generator to ensure that all their games are provably fair.&nbsp; Some of the payment methods available at the casino are handled by their wholly owned subsidiary &ldquo;mProcessing Solutions Ltd&rdquo; in Cyprus (Menandrou 4, 1066, Nicosia Cyprus).

<h2><strong>What is Bovada Casino?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Bovada is an online gambling site that was launched in 2011. It&#8217;s based in Costa Rica, meaning it&#8217;s an offshore casino. This enables <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bovada/en" rel="sponsored">Bovada</a> to accept players from the US, with the exception of Delaware, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York. Bovada is also available in other countries.</p>
<p>Bovada offers a wide range of casino games. This includes table games like roulette, blackjack, and baccarat. There&#8217;s also an extensive selection of slots, video poker games, and live dealer tables. Bovada is also a popular sportsbook. It covers pre-match and in-play odds on dozens of sports, including football, tennis, basketball, and baseball.</p>

<h2><strong>Bovada Casino Bonuses &amp; Promos</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
This section reveals each bonus and promotion currently available to Bovada players.
</p>
<h3><strong>Bovada Casino Welcome Bonus Offers</strong></h3>
<p>
Bovada offers welcome bonuses across its three main gambling categories; casino, sportsbook, and poker. Let&#8217;s break down each bonus type in more detail.
</p>
<h4><strong>Casino Bonus</strong></h4>
<p>
New players at Bovada will receive three casino deposit bonuses. However, the bonus amount depends on the deposit currency.</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking to deposit USD, you&#8217;ll get a 100% matched deposit bonus of up to $1,000. This can be claimed three times, valuing the bonus at $3,000.</li>
<li>If you deposit with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, you&#8217;ll get a larger welcome bonus. Each cryptocurrency deposit will be matched by 125% up to $1,250. This values the welcome bonus at $3,750.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Irrespective of whether you&#8217;re depositing USD or cryptocurrencies, you&#8217;ll need to enter a promo code. You&#8217;ll find these further down in this Bovada casino review.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-151735" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377015-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-49-52.jpg" alt="Bovada Casino Welcome Bonus Offers" width="900" height="408" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377015-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-49-52.jpg 1712w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377015-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-49-52-300x136.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377015-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-49-52-1024x465.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377015-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-49-52-768x349.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377015-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-49-52-1536x697.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377015-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-49-52-150x68.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Now for the important terms and conditions.</p>
<p>First and foremost, if you&#8217;re depositing USD, you&#8217;ll need to meet wagering requirements of 25x. This is based on the deposit <em>and</em> bonus amounts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose your first deposit is $500</li>
<li>Bovada matches it by 100%, so you&#8217;ll receive an extra $500</li>
<li>Your deposit and bonus amounts total $1,000</li>
<li>At 25x, this means you&#8217;ll need to wager at least $25,000 before you can withdraw the bonus funds</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you&#8217;re depositing cryptocurrencies, the wagering terms are slightly different. The&nbsp;first matched deposit comes with wagering requirements of 25x. Similar to the USD terms, this is based on the deposit <em>and</em> bonus amounts.</p>
<p>However, the second and third deposits need to be wagered at 50x.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose your second cryptocurrency deposit is valued at $500</li>
<li>Bovada matches it by 125%, so you&#8217;ll receive an extra $625</li>
<li>Your deposit and bonus amounts total $1,125</li>
<li>At 50x, this means you&#8217;ll need to wager at least $56,250 before you can withdraw the bonus funds</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, while the cryptocurrency bonus is larger, the wagering requirements are less favorable. Another thing to note is that craps and live dealer games do not count toward the wagering target. What&#8217;s more, while slots contribute 100%, other games contribute less. Bovada doesn&#8217;t provide a bonus time limit within its terms and conditions.
</p>
<h4><strong>Sportsbook Bonus</strong></h4>
<p>
Bovada also offers a generous sportsbook bonus. Similar to the casino bonus, the amount you receive depends on the deposit currency.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re depositing USD, you&#8217;ll get a 50% sportsbook bonus of up to $250.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re depositing cryptocurrencies, you&#8217;ll get a 75% sportsbook bonus up to $750.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The key terms and conditions are similar across both bonuses. The wagering requirements are 5x when betting on sports or horse racing. However, this is based on the deposit <em>and</em> bonus amounts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose you deposit $200 into the Bovada sportsbook</li>
<li>You use USD, so Bovada matches it by 50%</li>
<li>This gets you an extra $100</li>
<li>Your sportsbook balance is now $300</li>
<li>At 5x, you&#8217;d need to wager $1,500 before you can make a withdrawal</li>
</ul>
<p>
The sportsbook wagering terms are a lot more favorable than the casino bonus. What&#8217;s more, the terms state that &#8220;<em>You may use your bonus on any sport, wager type, and odds</em>.&#8221; This means you can bet on sports markets with low odds, giving yourself a greater chance of meeting the wagering requirements.
</p>
<h4><strong>Poker Bonus</strong></h4>
<p>
Bovada also offers a welcome package for first-time poker players. Unlike the casino and sportsbook bonuses, only USD payments qualify for the bonus.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ll get a 100% matched deposit bonus of up to $500</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll need to download the Bovada poker software to activate the bonus</li>
<li>To convert the bonus funds to withdrawable cash, you&#8217;ll need to earn Reward Points</li>
<li>$5 is released for 150 Reward Points earned</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll earn Rewards Points every time you place a bet</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are no wagering requirements on released bonus funds.
</p>
<h3><strong>Existing Customer Promos</strong></h3>
<p>
Although Bovada offers generous welcome bonuses for new players, there&#8217;s a limited number of promotions for existing accounts.</p>
<p>This includes the Free Spin Bonanza bonus, which offers 500,000 weekly free spins. The maximum prize per player is just 20 free spins. However, there will be 25,000 winners every week. To enter, simply deposit at least $10. In the same week, you&#8217;ll also need to wager at least $20 on any casino game.</p>

<p>The only other bonus available to existing players is the Parlay Booster. Put simply, this gives you enhanced odds on selected parlay bets. You&#8217;ll also earn Reward Points, which get you access to the weekly Parlay Booster draw. However, the draw only allows you to earn additional Reward Points.
</p>
<h3><strong>Bovada Casino Loyalty Program</strong></h3>
<p>
Bovada offers a popular loyalty program that centers on Reward Points. You&#8217;ll earn Reward Points every time you place bets. However, the specific Reward Points earned per $1 depends on the gambling product. For example, you&#8217;ll get 40 Reward Points per $1 wagered on horse racing.</p>
<p>This increases to 60 Reward Points when betting on exotics and multiples. However, you&#8217;ll earn just 1 Reward Point when playing table games like roulette and blackjack. Slots are slightly better, with 3 Reward Points earned for every $1 wagered. You can also earn up to 15 Reward Points per $1 when playing live poker.
</p>
<ul>
<li>As you accumulate more Reward Points, you&#8217;ll move up the loyalty ladder.</li>
<li>There are six tiers, ranging from Starter to Hall of Fame. Some tiers have three levels.</li>
<li>As you increase your tier, you&#8217;ll get more USD for your Reward Points.</li>
<li>For example, the Starter tier requires 2,500 Reward Points for every $1 paid in cashback.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll only need 1,000 to earn $1 when you reach the Hall of Fame tier.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ultimately, if you&#8217;re a seasoned player who gambles regularly, it makes sense to join the Bovada VIP program.</p>

<h2><strong>Bovada Casino No Deposit Bonus</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Bovada doesn&#8217;t offer any no deposit bonuses. All of the bonuses discussed above require a deposit.
</p>
<h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Bovada Casino?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Now that we&#8217;ve covered bonuses, this part of our Bovada Casino review will explore what games are supported.
</p>
<h3><strong>Slots</strong></h3>
<p>
Bovada lists hundreds of slot games. The slots department is split between progressives, bonus buys, and &#8216;Hot Drop&#8217; jackpots.</p>
<p>If you like playing slots with huge payouts, Bovada has plenty of options. This includes 10 Times Vegas, currently paying $82,000. There&#8217;s also Deluxe 777, which has a jackpot of $29,000. That said, the Shopping Spree slot game is currently offering the largest jackpot at over $2.16 million.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-151725" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705371088-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-09-11-03.jpg" alt="Bovada Casino slots " width="900" height="499" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705371088-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-09-11-03.jpg 1323w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705371088-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-09-11-03-300x166.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705371088-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-09-11-03-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705371088-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-09-11-03-768x426.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705371088-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-09-11-03-150x83.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>However, we found that the Bovada slots department could be improved. For a start, it doesn&#8217;t enable players to filter slot games by the software provider. This is a feature offered by most online casinos. In addition, there isn&#8217;t a search bar. This means you need to manually browse each slot to find your preferred title.
</p>
<h3><strong>Roulette</strong></h3>
<p>
Bovada offers just five software-based roulette variations. This includes American, European, and Zoom roulette.
</p>
<h3><strong>Blackjack</strong></h3>
<p>
Bovada offers 10 software-based blackjack games. This includes Classic, European, Single Deck, Double Deck, and Perfect Pairs.
</p>
<h3><strong>Video Poker</strong></h3>
<p>
We found 10 video poker games when reviewing Bovada. This includes popular versions like Jacks or Better, Joker Poker 10, Aces and Faces, and Deuces Wild.
</p>
<h3><strong>Live Dealers</strong></h3>
<p>
Bovada also offers dozens of live casino tables. This enables you to play popular table games with human dealers. This includes 34 blackjack tables. Casual players can play from just $5 per hand. High rollers will find maximum table limits of $50,000 per hand.</p>

<p>There are also five roulette tables, covering both the American and European versions. We&#8217;d suggest opting for the European version, as the house edge is lower. In addition, Bovada offers two Baccarat tables and two Super 6 games.
</p>
<h3><strong>Other Games</strong></h3>
<p>
Other Bovada casino games include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Craps</li>
<li>Specialty Games</li>
<li>Scratchcards</li>
<li>Keno</li>
<li>Bingo</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Bovada Sports Betting</strong></h2>

</p>
<h3><strong>Available Sports</strong></h3>

<p>We found that Bovada also offers esports betting markets. Supported games include Rainbow Six, Call of Duty, Valorant, and King of Glory.
</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-151737" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377137-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-08.png" alt="Bovada Sportsbook review " width="900" height="467" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377137-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-08.png 2496w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377137-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-08-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377137-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-08-1024x532.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377137-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-08-768x399.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377137-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-08-1536x798.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377137-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-08-2048x1063.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377137-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-08-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>

</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Bovada is also a popular option for online poker players. Consider downloading the Bovada poker suite for desktops. This offers the best gaming experience. The desktop software is available for Windows and Mac. Bovada also offers a native mobile app for iOS and Android. This can only be used to play poker and not casino games or sports betting.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-151738" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377190-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-48.jpg" alt="Is Bovada good for poker?" width="900" height="455" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377190-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-48.jpg 1579w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377190-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-48-300x152.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377190-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-48-1024x518.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377190-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-48-768x389.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377190-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-48-1536x777.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377190-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-52-48-150x76.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>We found that Bovada supports the three most popular poker models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash Tables</li>
<li>Tournaments</li>
<li>Sit-and-Go</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<h2><strong>What Software Does Bovada Casino Use?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
We found that most Bovada casino games are supplied by Rival Gaming. Launched in 2005, <a href="https://www.rivalpowered.com/games/" rel="sponsored">Rival Gaming provides casino games</a> to gambling sites from around the world. This includes table games like roulette and blackjack, video poker, and slots.</p>

</p>
<h2><strong>Bovada Casino Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Understanding how payments work is crucial before signing up with Bovada. Not only in terms of deposit and withdrawal methods but limits and payout speeds.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the deposit process.
</p>
<h3><strong>Bovada Casino Deposit Options</strong></h3>
<p>
The most popular deposit method accepted by Bovada is debit/credit cards. Visa and MasterCard are supported but not American Express or Discover. The minimum and maximum deposit amounts when using debit/credit cards are $20 and $1,500, respectively.</p>
<p>You can also make a direct bank transfer in USD. The minimum is just $50. However, bank transfers are capped at $450. If you want higher limits, Bovada also accepts some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-to-buy/" rel="sponsored">best cryptocurrencies to buy</a>. This includes Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Tether. The maximum deposit limit on these cryptocurrencies is $5,000.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-151739" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377236-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-53-47.png" alt="Bovada deposit options " width="900" height="725" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377236-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-53-47.png 1392w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377236-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-53-47-300x242.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377236-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-53-47-1024x825.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377236-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-53-47-768x619.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377236-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-53-47-150x121.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>In terms of deposit speeds, debit/credit cards are usually processed instantly. Cryptocurrency deposits take up to 15 minutes to appear. Bank wires can take several days.</p>
<p>Our Bovada Casino review found that deposit fees can also apply. Although the first deposit/credit card payment is free, you&#8217;ll be charged at least 15.9%. In contrast, Bovada doesn&#8217;t charge deposit fees when funding the account with cryptocurrencies. This further strengthens Bovada&#8217;s position as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoin-casino-sites.htm">best altcoin casino sites</a>.
</p>
<h3><strong>Bovada Casino Withdrawal Options</strong></h3>
<p>
Not all deposit methods can be used to make withdrawals from Bovada. For example, while you can deposit funds with a debit/credit card, you&#8217;ll need to withdraw funds to another payment type.</p>
<p>This includes bank wires, check by courier, and cryptocurrencies. Bovada also stipulates withdrawal terms, including minimums and maximums.
</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the minimum bank wire withdrawal is $1,500. The maximum is $9,500 every 30 days. Bank wire withdrawals take 10-15 days on average.</li>
<li>Cryptocurrencies come with a minimum withdrawal of just $10. Although the maximum withdrawal is $9,500, you can make another withdrawal 15 minutes later.</li>
<li>The maximum weekly withdrawal limit for cryptocurrencies is $180,000 using Litecoin. This is reduced to $90,000 when withdrawing Bitcoin. Some cryptocurrencies are capped at just $2,500 per week.</li>

<h4><strong>What are Player Transfers on Bovada?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Another payment option available on Bovada is &#8216;Player Transfers&#8217;.</li>
<li>Put simply, you can withdraw your casino balance by transferring it to another player.</li>
<li>In turn, the player will transfer the same amount via your agreed payment method.</li>
<li>This option is only suitable when dealing with players you know. Otherwise, there&#8217;s the chance that you&#8217;ll be scammed.</li>

<h2><strong>Bovada Casino Interface &amp; User Experience</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
In general, Bovada offers a great user experience. The sign-up process is fast and straightforward. Simply enter some personal information and contact details to process. Depositing funds is also seamless. We like that the Bovada website is split between the main gambling categories; Sports, Casimo, Live Dealer, Poker, and Horses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-151740" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377292-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-54-33.jpg" alt="Bovada Casino review " width="900" height="576" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377292-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-54-33.jpg 1365w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377292-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-54-33-300x192.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377292-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-54-33-1024x655.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377292-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-54-33-768x491.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705377292-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-54-33-150x96.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>After clicking on your preferred category, you&#8217;ll have access to a user-friendly dashboard with additional filters. For example, clicking on &#8216;Casino&#8217; allows you to choose from slots, blackjack, and roulette. The sportsbook also offers a great user experience. You can find betting markets by choosing your preferred sport or franchise.</p>
<p>You can also click on the &#8216;Live&#8217; button to see which sporting events are currently being played. That said, the drawback is that Bovada doesn&#8217;t offer a search box. This makes it slightly cumbersome to find specific games. For instance, you can&#8217;t search for a slot title.
</p>
<h2><strong>Does Bovada Casino Have a Mobile App?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Bovada offers a native mobile app for iOS and Android. However, the app can only be used for playing poker. You can also play poker via desktop software for Windows and Mac.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-151734" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705375435-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-23-46.png" alt="Bovada mobile casino" width="435" height="612" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705375435-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-23-46.png 816w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705375435-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-23-46-213x300.png 213w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705375435-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-23-46-728x1024.png 728w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705375435-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-23-46-768x1080.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705375435-screenshot-2024-01-16-at-10-23-46-150x211.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p>If you want to play casino games or bet on sports, you can still use your cell phone. Simply visit the Bovada website from a mobile browser and log into your account. The user experience is still solid, as Bovada has optimized its website for smartphones.</p>
<p><div class="su-note"  style="border-color:#e0d5e5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#faefff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">

<h2><strong>Bovada Casino Security</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Considered one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-offshore-casinos.htm">best offshore casinos</a> for US players, Bovada is an established gambling site that was founded in 2011. Although Bovada is based in Costa Rica, it&#8217;s regulated by the <a href="https://www.kabinetvandegouverneur.org/en/" rel="sponsored">Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao</a>. Licensing is secured by Bovada&#8217;s parent company, Harp Media B.V.</p>
<p>With over a decade in the online gambling space, Bovada has a solid reputation with players. That said, we found that some players complain about slow withdrawal times when using a bank wire. However, Bovada is clear about withdrawal times, which average 10-15 days. The solution is to withdraw cryptocurrencies, which takes between 1 and 24 hours.</p>
<p>Bovada also offers secure payments. Its website is secured by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, meaning that your payment details are encrypted. Bovada also complies with <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/aml" rel="sponsored">anti-money laundering regulations</a>. This means players must upload KYC verification documents before withdrawals are permitted.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth visiting the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bovada/" rel="sponsored">/Bovada Reddit group</a>, which is home to over 14,000 members. This will give you insight into Bovada Casino reviews from other players.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if a crypto exchange could provide many of the financial services we&rsquo;re accustomed to from banks? That&rsquo;s Nexo, a European-based crypto exchange that offers trading as well as lending and borrowing and even an innovative Mastercard that works as a credit or debit card.</p>
<p>In our Nexo review, we&rsquo;ll explore the pros and cons of Nexo as well as the exchange&rsquo;s features that set it apart from other platforms.
</p>
<h2>Our Take on Nexo</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
By some measures, <a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/ext/nexo/en" rel="sponsored">Nexo</a> might be better described as a crypto lending platform than an exchange, but the addition of the Nexo Pro advanced trading platform makes Nexo competitive with well-known exchanges like Coinbase for crypto trading. Where the platform falls short is in its comparatively small selection of 65 cryptocurrencies. By contrast, Coinbase offers more than 250 tradable cryptos.</p>
<p>Nexo remains a popular choice for traders who want to earn a yield on their crypto holdings and fans of the Nexo card, which can act as a rewards credit card or as a crypto debit card.</p>

<h2>Nexo&rsquo;s Strengths</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Considering the popularity of cryptocurrencies in 2024 there are thousands of crypto exchanges fighting to become household names. In this section we&#8217;ll examine the features that set Nexo apart from the competition.</p>
<p><strong>Easy-to-use platform:</strong></p>
<p>New and experienced users should feel at home on Nexo. The platform is well-designed and intuitive to use. Nexo Pro offers a low-cost trading solution for advanced traders, which brings an uncluttered interface and clear charts with over 100 available indicators.</p>
<p><strong>Nexo card:</strong> The Nexo card offers the best combination of benefits compared to other crypto cards from providers like Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Gemini. Other cards work as credit or debit cards, with no possibility of switching modes. Nexo provides a two-in-one solution that lets you easily switch between credit and debit modes. Credit mode uses your crypto as collateral to borrow while earning up to 2% cashback. Debit mode lets you spend BTC and other crypto assets like cash, automatically converting your crypto to cash as needed. In debit mode, you also earn up to 14% interest, paid in crypto.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto lending:</strong> While the Nexo card offers an easy way to access the value of your crypto, Nexo also offers crypto loans funded with cryptocurrency you can deploy on other protocols or on Nexo itself. Borrowers can repay according to their own schedule with instant approval. Lenders can earn up to 16%, with interest paid daily.

<li><strong>People who want to hold their crypto. </strong>Rather than needing to sell your crypto to raise capital, Nexo lets you borrow against your crypto. Use your funds for any purpose.</li>
<li><strong>People who want to earn a yield.</strong> Crypto yields for lending reach 14% or boost your yields by choosing interest paid in NEXO tokens. Stablecoins pegged to a fiat currency earn the highest yields, so you don&rsquo;t have to risk volatility to earn a return.</li>
<li><strong>Traders outside the US and UK. </strong>Nexo is withdrawing from specific markets due to regulatory concerns.</li>

<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Nexo&rsquo;s selection of 65 cryptocurrencies lags behind competitors like Kraken, with about 240 cryptocurrencies, and Coinbase, with over 250 cryptocurrencies. However, the platform supports the most popular cryptocurrencies and a number of perhaps surprising altcoins.

</ul>
<p>
Although the selection on Nexo is smaller than other platforms, the exchange still offers several in-demand altcoins.
</p>
<h3>Altcoin Selection on Nexo</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chainlink (LINK)</li>
<li>Uniswap (UNI)</li>

<h2>Trading Fees on Nexo</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Nexo offers two trading platforms, each with its own fee structure. Basic &ldquo;swaps&rdquo; come with no fees and include a cashback bonus of up to 0.5%. However, Nexo also uses a variable spread, which adds to the cost of swaps.</p>
<p>Swaps support trigger prices, so you can continue earning while waiting for a price you choose. You can also stack multiple swap orders to average out of a position or dollar-cost average when buying.
</p>
<h4>What Is Dollar-Cost Averaging in Crypto?</h4>
<p>
Identifying market lows for buying and highs for selling can be tricky business. Dollar-cost averaging offers an easy way to optimize your trades without needing to be a trading guru.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying: When buying, dollar cost averaging works by buying a fixed dollar amount at a fixed interval, such as buying $100 worth of bitcoin on the first of every month.</li>
<li>Selling: Some investors also use reverse dollar-cost averaging to exit a position, selling a fixed amount at a fixed interval to avoid the perils of timing the market incorrectly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nexo Pro, Nexo&rsquo;s advanced trading platform, does not add a spread to trades. Nexo&rsquo;s fee structure positions the exchange lower than Coinbase but higher than Kraken and Binance at base tiers. For example, Coinbase Advanced charges 0.6% maker fees and 0.8% taker fees at the base volume tier. By comparison, Nexo Pro charges just 0.3% and 0.4% maker and taker fees, respectively.
</p>
<h4>Maker Fees vs. Taker Fees</h4>
<p>
Many advanced trading platforms like Nexo Pro base trading fees on a maker/taker model.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maker orders</strong> &ldquo;make&rdquo; a market by providing liquidity in the form of fixed-price (limit) orders. Without limit orders, we&rsquo;d have nothing to trade against. Imagine a training world with no prices.</li>
<li><strong>Taker orders</strong> &ldquo;take&rdquo; liquidity off the market by buying or selling against existing orders. These are often called market orders because you&rsquo;re trading at market prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Trading fees on the Pro platform vary by 30-day trading volume.

<h3>Nexo Futures Trading Fees</h3>
<p>
Trading fees for perpetual trades are fixed at 0.06% for opening or closing a position.</p>
<p>Similar to other perpetual futures platforms, Nexo uses a <a href="https://support.nexo.com/s/article/nexo-exchange-futures-trading?language=en_US#futures-trading-nexo-app" rel="sponsored">variable funding fee</a>, which helps the contract price track market prices. Funding fees can add to the cost of trades or may reduce overall trading costs.
</p>
<h2>Nexo Review: The Nexo Trading Experience</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Few crypto platforms offer an interface as clean as you&rsquo;ll find on <a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/ext/nexo/en" rel="sponsored">Nexo</a>. It&rsquo;s as beginner-friendly as it gets.</p>
<p>Simple swaps, in which you exchange one crypto for another, work as smooth as butter. In a few clicks, you&rsquo;ve rebalanced your portfolio. And swaps support triggers, a way to buy or sell at a price you set &ndash; and you can set multiple triggers, easing in or out of a position. That convenience comes with a cost, however: spreads.</p>
<p>Generally, a spread refers to the difference between the highest-priced selling order and the lowest-priced buying order in an order book. But it can also refer to a markup that allows an exchange to lock in a price on volatile assets. The latter is what Nexo uses for its no-fee swaps, and it can be costly in some cases. Some users report spreads of up to 2% or higher. Spreads vary based on market conditions, so check the numbers before confirming a trade to be sure the swap makes sense for you.
</p>
<h3>Boosters</h3>
<p>
Swaps also support &ldquo;boosters,&rdquo; which refers to borrowing against your crypto to trade larger amounts. This process can be completed manually using Nexo&rsquo;s Instant Crypto Credit Lines, followed by a swap. But the booster option on the convert tab simplifies the process and lets you use up to 3x leverage with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover Instant Credit Lines in just a bit. Loan balances accrue interest but don&rsquo;t have a fixed payment schedule.
</p>
<h3>Nexo Pro</h3>
<p>
To avoid the spread fees discussed earlier, you can instead use Nexo Pro, an advanced trading platform that&rsquo;s easier to use than many competing platforms.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149871" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen-1024x500.png" alt="nexo pro trading dashboard" width="900" height="440" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen-1024x500.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen-768x375.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen-150x73.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917706-nexo-pro-trading-screen.png 1506w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Nexo Pro starts out simple but offers more functionality with a few clicks. Notably, the advanced trading platform provides charts with over 100 indicators. Add MACD (moving average convergence/divergence), shown above, or any of 100+ other indicators instantly.</p>
<p>Advanced trading platforms can be notoriously tricky to use. Nexo bucks the trend, making Nexo Pro simple enough that newer traders can trade successfully. As a caveat, Nexo Pro doesn&rsquo;t offer many of the features available on other platforms, such as automated trading bots or options trading. Less clutter translates to fewer trading tools.
</p>
<h2>Nexo Futures (Nexo Pro)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Perpetual futures let you bet on the future price of BTC and other cryptocurrencies without buying the crypto asset. Instead, you buy a contract that bases your profit or loss on the difference between the price when you open the contract and the price when you close your position.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149875" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917862-nexo-futures-banner-1024x412.png" alt="nexo futures banner" width="900" height="362" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917862-nexo-futures-banner-1024x412.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917862-nexo-futures-banner-300x121.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917862-nexo-futures-banner-768x309.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917862-nexo-futures-banner-150x60.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704917862-nexo-futures-banner.png 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Choose to go long (a bet the price will increase) or short (a bet the price will decrease) and amplify your earnings with leverage of up to 50x on 70+ crypto assets. Leverage trades use your crypto as collateral, with the highest leverage available for USDT collateral, which has the least volatility.</p>
<p>Due to the higher risk associated with leveraged perpetual futures, Nexo requires users to pass a quiz before they become eligible to trade futures. Availability also varies by region, with US and UK users restricted.
</p>
<h3>Nexo Web3 Wallet</h3>
<p>
Recently, Nexo added a Web3 wallet as a way to interact with decentralized applications to swap cryptocurrencies and earn yields. The wallet supports external wallets, like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet, but can be used as a standalone app as well. Thus far, Nexo&rsquo;s wallet is not supported on its mobile app, however.
</p>
<h4>What Is Web3?</h4>
<p>
Web3 refers to the crypto ecosystems that use your wallet address as your identity. In web 2.0, we use usernames and passwords. Web3 aims to return ownership of your identity to users, allowing you to transact or interact with relative privacy compared to web 2.0.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149880" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918055-nexo-wallet-supported-networks-1024x404.png" alt="nexo wallet supported networks" width="900" height="355" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918055-nexo-wallet-supported-networks-1024x404.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918055-nexo-wallet-supported-networks-300x118.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918055-nexo-wallet-supported-networks-768x303.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918055-nexo-wallet-supported-networks-150x59.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918055-nexo-wallet-supported-networks.png 1512w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Currently, the Nexo Wallet supports five networks.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum</li>
<li>Polygon</li>
<li>Avalanche</li>
<li>BNB Smart Chain</li>
<li>Fantom</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notably, Abitrum, which is the largest Ethereum Layer 2 network, is not yet supported.</p>
<p>Nexo Wallet offers several features that simplify web3 usage, operating much like a portal to the decentralized crypto world &ndash; but with guard rails to help users avoid deep ravines.</p>
<p>Nexo also adds some features not found with many other wallets.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batching:</strong> Execute multiple transactions at once to save on fees.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible gas payments:</strong> Crypto networks use cryptocurrencies to pay for transactions and computing power on the network. Nexo Wallet lets you use stablecoins or other supported tokens to pay for transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized transactions:</strong> Nexo uses &ldquo;smart transactions&rdquo; to optimize and save money on transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated liquidity:</strong> Make swaps on decentralized apps without leaving your wallet. Nexo searches for the best value when making swaps, spreading your swap across multiple decentralized exchanges if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated wallets:</strong> See all your wallet balances and NFTs in one place (supported networks only).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although a decentralized wallet, users from specific regions, including the US, cannot use the Nexo Wallet app.</p>
<p>Nexo labels its wallet as &ldquo;beta,&rdquo; suggesting that more features are on the way, including a &ldquo;DeFi card,&rdquo; about which no details have yet been provided. Our curiosity is piqued.
</p>
<h2>Nexo&rsquo;s Mobile App</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Like its desktop counterpart, the Nexo mobile app is well-designed, smooth-running, and easy to use.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149892 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918526-nexo-mobile-app.png" alt="nexo mobile app" width="390" height="801" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918526-nexo-mobile-app.png 390w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918526-nexo-mobile-app-146x300.png 146w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704918526-nexo-mobile-app-150x308.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /></p>
<p>Expect a scaled-down experience, however. Nexo Pro (including futures trading) was conspicuously absent from the mobile app, as was the Nexo Web3 Wallet.</p>
<p>Supported features center on swaps through Nexo Exchange, lending and borrowing, and the Nexo Card, which we&rsquo;ll cover in more detail shortly. Swaps were not available in certain regions.</p>
<p>Nexo&rsquo;s mobile app serves as a simple way to manage lending and borrowing on the go, with the ability to perform simple swaps from anywhere.
</p>
<h3>Nexo Loyalty Levels</h3>
<p>
Many of Nexo&rsquo;s perks vary depending on your &ldquo;loyalty level,&rdquo; ranging from Base to Platinum. Loyalty tiers are determined by the amount of NEXO tokens held relative to the total account balance.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base:</strong> No NEXO tokens are needed. This level includes accounts with less than 1% of the portfolio value in NEXO tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Silver:</strong> At least 1% (up to 5%) of your total portfolio value in NEXO tokens qualifies for Silver Level.</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> If your account has 5% up to 10% of its portfolio value in NEXO tokens, your account qualifies for Gold Level benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> Accounts with 10% or more of the portfolio value in NEXO tokens qualify for Platinum Level benefits, including the highest interest rates for lending and the lowest rates for borrowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Loyalty levels drive interest rates on Nexo, with higher tiers earning higher interest rates.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149908" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704919813-nexo-interest-rates-by-loyalty-level-1024x407.png" alt="nexo interest rates by loyalty level" width="900" height="358" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704919813-nexo-interest-rates-by-loyalty-level-1024x407.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704919813-nexo-interest-rates-by-loyalty-level-300x119.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704919813-nexo-interest-rates-by-loyalty-level-768x306.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704919813-nexo-interest-rates-by-loyalty-level-1536x611.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704919813-nexo-interest-rates-by-loyalty-level-150x60.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704919813-nexo-interest-rates-by-loyalty-level.png 1566w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" />

<p>
</div></p>
<p>Minimum amounts apply, however. For example, you&rsquo;ll need at least 0.001 BTC to earn interest on your BTC deposits.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC minimum:</strong> 0.001 BTC</li>
<li><strong>ETH minimum:</strong> 0.01 ETH</li>
<li><strong>NETH minimum:</strong> 0.005 NETH</li>
<li><strong>NEXO minimum:</strong> 1 NEXO</li>
<li><strong>USDT minimum:</strong> 1 USDT</li>
<li><strong>USDC minimum:</strong> 1 BTC</li>
</ul>
<p>
Stablecoins like USDT have the lowest minimum deposit requirements and pay the highest interest rates in lending.
</p>
<h3>Staking Opportunities on Nexo (Smart Staking)</h3>
<p>
Nexo scaled down its staking support recently, now focusing on NETH, an Ethereum staking token that lets you earn staking rewards with as little as $1. Nexo calls it Smart Staking.</p>
<p>When staking ETH on Nexo, your staked ETH is converted to NETH, which earns rewards and can be used as collateral for loans.</p>
<p>Nexo Staked Ethereum (NETH) earns from staking rewards <a href="https://support.nexo.com/s/article/eth-smart-staking-neth-explained?language=en_GB" rel="sponsored">in addition to MEV</a> (Maximum Extractible Value). MEV is a process in which transactions can be front-run, changing the order of transactions to earn extra yields. Nexo runs its own validators, making this possible.</p>
<p>The combination of mechanisms used by Nexo Smart Staking often results in higher overall yields for stakers.</p>
<p>Ethereum staking earns 4% to 8% annually, depending on loyalty tier.<br />
Nexo Smart Staking earns 3.5% to 12% annually based on loyalty tier.</p>
<p>Nexo&rsquo;s Web3 Wallet also supports several decentralized staking and yield protocols.
</p>
<h3>Nexo Lending and Borrowing</h3>
<p>
The Nexo platform remains better known as a lending and borrowing platform than as an exchange.
</p>
<h4>Lending on Nexo</h4>
<p>
Users can earn strong yields by buying or transferring assets to the platform. Increase your earnings by locking your funds for three months.</p>
<p>Nexo pays interest automatically. For example, if you buy or deposit USDT, you&rsquo;ll earn 9% at current rates on the Base tier. Lock your funds for three months to earn an additional 3%. Higher tiers earn higher rates, boosted by a bonus yield paid in NEXO tokens.
</p>
<h4>Borrowing on Nexo</h4>
<p>
Nexo also lets you borrow against your crypto. No credit checks, no paperwork, and no required monthly payments.</p>

<p>Because borrowing on Nexo uses your crypto as collateral, loan-to-value (LTV) drives the transaction. With a low LTV of under 20% and Platinum level, you can borrow with 0% interest. As LTV increases, interest rates increase as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.nexo.com/s/article/zero-cost-credit-lines-explained?language=en_US#borrowing-at-0-2.9-apr" rel="sponsored">LTVs under 20% earn the best interest rates</a> for borrowing when combined with Platinum and Gold levels.</p>

<p>Borrow as little as $50 using stablecoins like USDT or $500 in fiat, with a maximum of $2 million daily.</p>
<p>Generally, loans are instant but can take up to 1 day if Nexo needs additional information for Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.
</p>
<h3>Nexo Card</h3>
<p>
The innovative Nexo Card (Mastercard) is one of Nexo&rsquo;s top features.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend your crypto like cash in debit mode.</li>
<li>Borrow against your crypto in credit mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Switch between the modes easily and on the go using the Nexo mobile app.</p>
<p>In credit card mode, your Nexo card taps into your instant lines of credit, borrowing against your crypto. Interest rates vary based on your loyalty tier, but unlike a traditional credit card, there are no fixed monthly payments.</p>
<p>Credit mode also earns <a href="https://support.nexo.com/s/article/what-crypto-rewards-will-i-get-with-my-nexo-card?language=en_US" rel="sponsored">cashback rewards</a> paid in NEXO tokens or BTC.</p>

<p>Nexo reviews on Trustpilot earn the platform one of the highest TrustScore rating we&rsquo;ve seen for crypto trading platforms. Nexo scores a <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/nexo.com" rel="sponsored">4.7 out of 5</a>, which is higher than eToro (<a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.etoro.com" rel="sponsored">4.3 out of 5</a>) and miles ahead of exchanges like Coinbase (<a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/coinbase.com" rel="sponsored">1.5 out of 5</a>) and Kraken (<a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kraken.com" rel="sponsored">2.0 out of 5</a>).</p>
<p>Rare negative reviews of Nexo on Trustpilot receive a response from Nexo within 24 hours on Trustpilot.
</p>
<h2>Nexo&rsquo;s Security and Licensing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Nexo holds several licenses and registrations with major regulators, although tightening regulations have led the exchange to pull out of markets such as the US and UK.
</p>
<h3>Nexo Registration and Licenses</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US registrations and licenses:</strong> In the US, Nexo is <a href="https://support.nexo.com/s/article/security-and-insurance?language=en_GB" rel="sponsored">registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</a> (FinCEN) and has also obtained a BitLicense through the New York Department of Financial Services. Nexo is also licensed with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. However, the company is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-lender-nexo-quit-united-states-2022-12-05/" rel="sponsored">phasing out operations in the US</a> and already blocks access to many features, depending on location.</li>
<li><strong>Outside the US:</strong> Nexo is also registered with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), FINTRAC in Canada, Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (OAM) in Italy, and licensed with the Financial Services Authority (Seychelles).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proof of Reserves and Security Ratings</h3>
<p>
As a lending platform, it&rsquo;s essential to demonstrate that the platform has enough assets to cover its liabilities. The 2022 collapse of several crypto platforms, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-14/crypto-lender-celsius-files-for-bankruptcy-in-cash-crunch" rel="sponsored">Celsius</a>, which shared a similar lending/borrowing business model, makes transparency essential.</p>
<p>As far back as 2021, <a href="https://nexo.com/blog/what-is-next-for-proof-of-reserves-auditing-crypto-in-the-long-run" rel="sponsored">Nexo provided proof of reserves</a> to show assets exceed liabilities in real-time rather than using a snapshot. However, since then, fewer auditing firms have focused on crypto. Nexo replaced its auditing firm with TrustReserve, which briefly offered a proof-of-reserves attestation for Nexo but which is now gone.</p>
<p>CER, a leading cybersecurity certification platform, <a href="https://cer.live/exchange/nexo" rel="sponsored">notes Nexo as having proof of reserves</a>. However, we were unable to find an active link. Overall, CER currently gives Nexo a &ldquo;D&rdquo; rating and lists Nexo as &ldquo;uncertified,&rdquo; which could suggest incomplete data.</p>
<p>CER&rsquo;s <a href="https://cer.live/methodology/cryptoexchanges" rel="sponsored">methodology</a> considers the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Server security</li>
<li>User security</li>
<li>Penetration test</li>
<li>Bug Bounty</li>
<li>ISO 27001 certification</li>
<li>Funds insurance</li>
</ul>
<p>
In a Reddit post from 2023, NexoJosh indicated that Nexo had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexo/comments/152tlhl/comment/jsfmtt6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="sponsored">discontinued the arrangement</a> they had with their auditing partner and is pursuing alternative ways to assure the community regarding reserves.</p>
<p>Reserves aside, Nexo implements several <a href="https://nexo.com/security" rel="sponsored">security measures</a> to harden accounts, including two-factor authentication and biometric authentication with its mobile application. The platform also supports whitelisting, a method of restricting withdrawals only to addresses you approve.
</p>
<h3>Insurance</h3>
<p>
Crypto custody partners Bakkt and Ledger Vault provide secure storage while also offering limited insurance for crypto assets.
</p>
<h2>What Could Nexo Do Better?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document proof of reserves. </strong>Following the collapse of well-known crypto exchanges like FTX and crypto lending platforms like Celcius, it&rsquo;s imperative to show users that the exchange has the assets it says it has and that it can cover its liabilities. Nexo offered proof of reserves in the past, but we were unable to find current proof of reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Offer a less complicated tier system.</strong> Nexo&rsquo;s tier system uses loyalty levels to drive interest rates, staking rewards, and more on the platform. All these moving parts center on holding a token of little real-world value elsewhere, which&nbsp;has fallen in price dramatically from its highs. As the price of NEXO tokens falls relative to the broad market, users are forced to buy or earn more to qualify for the top loyalty levels.</li>
<li><strong>Provide limited services in regulated markets.</strong> Nexo recently pulled out of the US and is reducing services in other key markets like the UK. Many other platforms have found ways to offer some services based on location rather than blocking users from accessing the site. Nexo swaps, its web3 wallet, and Nexo Pro parallel services offered by competing platforms without significant restriction. However, these services are unavailable in the US and may be restricted in other markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Review Methodology</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Cryptonews.com is committed to unbiased reviews of products and services to help readers make better-informed buying and investing decisions. We evaluate exchanges based on a wide range of factors, performing real-world transactions where possible and comparing advertising claims against real-world results.</p>
<p>We review exchanges using a point system that considers usability, fees, available trading types, tradable cryptocurrencies, and additional weighting factors. In addition, we examine regulatory oversight and licenses, where applicable, as well as security measures taken by the exchange to protect users.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Nexo&rsquo;s strengths come from its lending and borrowing platform rather than from its exchange offerings. With only 65 tradable cryptos, investment options center on top assets.</p>
<p>However, as a lending and borrowing platform, Nexo excels. With the ability to earn up to 16% yields in just a few clicks, Nexo becomes an attractive option for investors who want to put their crypto to work. Borrowing rates as low as 0% make Nexo a viable alternative for crypto-backed loans. As a caveat, we&rsquo;d like to see better transparency regarding reserves, assuring depositors that their crypto is safe on the platform.

<h2>A Closer Look at the Top Micro Market Cap Crypto Coins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
When selecting the best micro-cap crypto to buy, investors need to look at factors other than just the market capitalization. This includes the use case of the crypto token, what market it operates in, and the upside potential of the project.</p>
<p>Below, we analyze the best micro-cap cryptocurrencies to invest in today.<b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Overall Best Micro Cap Crypto to Buy on Presale</b></h3>
<p>At the top of our list for the best micro cap cryptocurrency is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX). This revolutionary cryptocurrency leverages blockchain technology to decentralize the cloud mining space. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-154495" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix presale" width="900" height="445" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1024x507.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-768x380.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1536x760.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-2048x1013.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705910573-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-150x74.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" />Cloud mining is a process where individuals can rent mining power from centralized businesses. However, this space is plagued with fraudulent activities and scams. To solve this problem, Bitcoin Minetrix is tokenizing cloud mining. $BTCMTX, the native token, can be staked on the Ethereum-based smart contract.</p>
<p>As your tokens are staked, you can start generating tokenized cloud mining credits. These credits can be burned to acquire rented mining times, to earn a portion of Bitcoin mining revenues. Furthermore, staking $BTCMTX leads to APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) as high as 73%. From a total supply of 4 billion &#8211; 70% has been allocated to the ongoing presale. This micro-cap crypto has raised more than $9 million since the presale launched a few months ago. <img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/331592/btcscreenshot-2023-09-26-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Stake-to-Mine Mechanics" />At press time, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.013 on presale. The price will increase to $0.0148 by the final presale round.

Using the stake-to-bridge mechanism, Sponge will connect V1 token holders with the new V2 token. Existing V1 token holders can stake their tokens on the newly launched V2 smart contract.

So far, more than 5.2 million tokens have been staked through the new smart contract. Sponge will also launch a new play-to-earn racer game &#8211; where players compete to climb up an online leaderboard.

<h3><b>4. Scotty the AI &#8211; New Presale Crypto Boasts Advanced AI Capabilities</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/ext/scottytheai/en">Scotty the AI</a> ($SCOTTY) is a new cryptocurrency centered around artificial intelligence. The platform leverages advanced AI algorithms to bring more security in the crypto space. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705906485-screenshot-2024-01-22-at-12-22-3.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-154425 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705906485-screenshot-2024-01-22-at-12-22-3.png" alt="Scotty the AI presale" width="900" height="454" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705906485-screenshot-2024-01-22-at-12-22-3.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705906485-screenshot-2024-01-22-at-12-22-3-300x151.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705906485-screenshot-2024-01-22-at-12-22-3-768x387.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705906485-screenshot-2024-01-22-at-12-22-3-150x76.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a>Scotty the AI can analyze complex blockchain codes, mitigate risks, and track suspicious activities on the blockchain.

<h3>5. Tamadoge &#8211; Earn TAMA Tokens in the Metaverse by Minting an NFT Pet <strong>   </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/robotera/en" rel="sponsored">Tamadoge</a></p>
<p>(TAMA) is also one of the best micro-cap cryptos to buy today. This project has a broad ecosystem that covers a wide range of web3 products. But at its core, Tamadoge is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-to-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn game</a> that requires players to mint a virtual pet NFT. Tamadoge pets are randomly generated from Ethereum smart contracts. As such, each pet is unique and has its own traits.</p>
<p>Players can then train their pets to improve their strengths. Moreover, players can feed their Tamadoge pets and even enter battles with other users. There will be a leaderboard that rewards successful players with TAMA tokens. Tamadoge is also building a metaverse. Called the &#8216;Tamaverse&#8217;, this will offer play-to-earn games in an immersive environment.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/94180/253084/tama-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="" width="2090" /></figure>
<p>The Tamadoge whitepaper also states that augmented reality will be incorporated into its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-games.htm">NFT games</a>. Tamadoge completed its presale in late 2022 and is now listed on many exchanges, including OKX, Gate.io, and Uniswap. Tamadoge has a market capitalization of just $12 million. As such, this is one of the best micro-cap tokens for long-term upside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. SushiSwap &#8211; Decentralized Exchange With Borrowing and Lending</h3>
<p>SushiSwap (SUSHI) is one of the best micro-cap cryptos for investing in decentralized finance. Its proprietary exchange supports a range of services. This includes token swaps generated by an automated market maker (AMM) protocol. In simple terms, this allows a trader to buy a cryptocurrency without a seller.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/108422/263243/screenshot-2023-03-23-at-.jpg" alt="" width="1510" /></figure>
<p>This is because the AMM uses liquidity pools. Investors can provide liquidity to a pool to earn interest. SushiSwap offers attractive APYs and investors can withdraw their tokens at any time. SushiSwap also supports decentralized loans. SushiSwap has its own native token, SUSHI. Previously trading with a market cap of nearly $3 billion, SUSHI is now worth just $300 million.</p>
<div class="raw-html-embed"></div>
<h3>7. Gala &#8211; Blockchain Guild Hosting Play-to-Earn Games</h3>
<p>While play-to-earn gaming projects generally create their own titles, Gala (GALA) does things differently. Put simply, Gala operates a gaming guild on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It enables developers to create and run their games on Gala, all of which offer play-to-earn rewards. Moreover, rewards are paid in the project&#8217;s native token, GALA.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/108422/263244/screenshot-2023-03-23-at-.jpg" alt="" width="1540" /></figure>
<p>Across 28 games, Gala has distributed more than $2.2 billion worth of rewards. All Gala games also come with in-game ownership, backed by an Ethereum NFT. Gala has also entered the world of decentralized music and film. This allows artists to sell their creations and dictate their own terms. GALA is currently trading with a market cap of just $290 million.</p>
<div class="raw-html-embed"></div>
<h3>8. inSure DeFi &#8211; Web3 Insurance for Crypto Wallet Scams<strong>  </strong></h3>
<p>Launched in 2020, inSure DeFi (SURE) is looking to bridge the gap between insurance and crypto investments. In a nutshell, the project insures crypto wallets against the threat of a scam. For example, if the crypto wallet is hacked and the tokens are stolen, the user can make a claim. In terms of the specifics, users will first need to buy SURE tokens.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/108422/263247/screenshot-2023-03-23-at-.jpg" alt="" width="1912" /></figure>
<p>This is the utility token backing the project and the insurance kicks in seven days after making the purchase. Moreover, the SURE tokens need to be stored in a private wallet and not an exchange. After investigating and approving the claim, inSure DeFi will cover the loss, payable in SURE tokens. As of writing, inSure DeFi has a market capitalization of just $115 million.</p>
<h3>9. Ribbon Finance &#8211; Yields Generated Through Automated Derivative Strategies<strong>  </strong></h3>
<p>Ribbon Finance (RBN) is also one of the best micro-cap cryptocurrencies to consider today. It has built an innovative system that generates yields from crypto derivatives, such as options and futures. Some of its core strategies include covered calls, put-selling, and principal protections. Yields depend on the strategy and the token being traded.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/108422/263248/screenshot-2023-03-23-at-.jpg" alt="" width="1902" /></figure>
<p>For example, covered calls on Ethereum are currently yielding an APY of 70%. From the perspective of investors, the process is passive. Investors simply need to choose their preferred strategy and deposit some crypto. Ribbon Finance has some serious backers, including Coinbase Ventures and Paradigm. Its native token RBN has a market cap of just $125 million.</p>
<h3>10. Prom &#8211; NFT Marketplace for In-Game Assets</h3>
<p>While many blockchain games enable users to earn and buy in-game items, not all projects have an in-built marketplace. Prom (PROM) has solved this issue by creating a decentralized marketplace that allows users to sell their gaming NFTs. 27 games are supported with more being added in the coming months.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/108422/263253/screenshot-2023-03-23-at-.jpg" alt="" width="1890" /></figure>
<p>This includes MetaSoccer, Elips Battle, Cryptoblades, and Tiny World. Users can set their own price when listing an in-game NFT and multiple digital currencies are supported. Moreover, Prom also enables users to rent NFTs, allowing the owner to earn passive income. Its utility token PROM, has a market capitalization of just over $91 million.</p>
<h3>11. Band Protocol &#8211; Cross-Chain Data Oracles for Smart Contract</h3>
<p>Another project that caught our eye when searching for the best micro-cap cryptocurrencies is Band Protocol (BAND). Launched in 2019, Band Protocol specializes in data oracles for smart contracts. This means that it provides real-world data to the blockchain. Not only that, but Band Protocol has cross-chain functionality.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/108422/263254/screenshot-2023-03-23-at-.jpg" alt="" width="1894" /></figure>
<p>This means that it can provide real-world data to multiple network standards without requiring a third party. While its protocol receives an average of 33,000 requests per day, it is able to facilitate data blocks in just six seconds. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/band-protocol/" rel="sponsored">According to CoinMarketCap</a>, Band Protocol had a market cap of just $50 million at the start of 2023. It has since increased to $200 million.</p>
<h3>12. JUST &#8211; DeFi Tools for the TRON Network</h3>
<p>Although TRON has one of the most efficient blockchains for speed, fees, and scalability, it lacks a comprehensive range of DeFi tools. That was until JUST (JST) entered the market with its decentralized suite of lending and earning services. The platform specializes in TRC-20 tokens and popular liquidity pools cover TRX, BTT, USDT, and TUSD.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/108422/263255/screenshot-2023-03-23-at-.jpg" alt="" width="1908" /></figure>
<p>JST is the project&#8217;s native governance token, enabling holders to cast votes on how JUST is run. Users can also mine JST for additional rewards. When JUST was launched in 2020, it was trading at just $0.0084. As of writing, JUST is worth $0.026 per token &#8211; representing growth of 200%. This translates into a market capitalization of $228 million.</p>
<h2>What is Micro-Cap Crypto?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Micro-cap cryptocurrencies refer to projects with a small market capitalization. This is often a valuation of under $300 million, <a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins/investor-3" rel="sponsored">similar to micro-cap stocks</a>. While micro-cap cryptocurrencies can be ultra-volatile, they also offer an attractive upside.</p>
<p>This is because micro-cap cryptocurrencies have the potential to generate sizable gains. After all, it doesn&#8217;t take as much buying pressure to quickly increase the value of a micro-cap cryptocurrency. This is because there is less liquidity and depth in the market.</p>
<p>For example, if an investor buys $100,000 worth of a cryptocurrency with a market cap of just $5 million, this could increase the price by double-digit percentages. This isn&#8217;t the case with multi-billion dollar projects like Bitcoin. In fact, a $100,000 buy order would barely move the market at all.</p>
<h2>How to Find Micro Market Cap Cryptocurrencies?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Read on to discover what methods seasoned investors use when researching the best micro-cap cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3>Use CoinMarketCap to Source Micro-Caps</h3>
<p>CoinMarketCap is a great starting point when searching for the best micro-cap cryptos. By default, the data aggregator website lists cryptocurrencies in descending order by market capitalization.</p>
<p>This means that investors simply need to get down to $300 million and this will display thousands of micro-cap coins.</p>
<p>Investors can then research their chosen projects by reading the whitepaper, assessing the token&#8217;s use cases, and more.</p>
<h3>Invest in Presales for the Best Entry Price</h3>
<p>The vast majority of crypto presales will offer access to a newly launched micro-cap token. This is because presales are fundraising campaigns that help fund a new project.</p>
<p>The project will sell its native token at a huge discount to early investors. After the presale sells out, the token is then listed on an exchange.</p>
<p>Not only do presales allow micro-cap investors to secure an attractive entry price, but there is often an immediate upside on offer.</p>
<h3>Look for Concepts That Could Become Global</h3>
<p>Another strategy to consider when searching for the best micro-cap tokens is to focus on innovative concepts.</p>
<p>Think along the lines of investing in social media in the early 2000s or EVs in the 2010s. In doing so, investors can gain exposure to new markets before they have had the chance to blossom.</p>
<h2>Are Micro-Cap Crypto Gems a Good Investment?</h2>

Whether or not micro-cap cryptocurrencies are worth buying will depend on the goals and risk tolerance of the investor.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what to consider before proceeding:</p>
<h3>Consider the Enhances Risk</h3>
<p>All cryptocurrencies are considered risky investment products. However, those with a micro-cap valuation come with an even greater level of risk.</p>
<p>After all, if a whale sells a huge chunk of tokens via a single trade, this could wipe a sizable amount of value from the project.</p>
<p>Moreover, many micro-cap cryptocurrencies are backed by up-and-coming projects. Many of which never meet the expectations of their investors.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Upside Can be Huge</h3>
<p>While riskier than large-cap projects, micro-cap cryptocurrencies invariably offer a much higher upside. This is especially the case in the long run, as newly launched projects have time to grow organically.</p>
<p>Moreover, many micro-cap projects are at the start of their development phase. This means that it can take several years for the concept to reach the masses. But nonetheless, the upside potential of a token with a micro-cap valuation can be significant.</p>
<p>For instance, when Shiba Inu was launched in mid-2020, it was worth just a few million dollars. In just over a year, Shiba Inu went on to reach a market cap of over $40 billion. This translates into gains of over 10,000x.</p>
<h3>Micro-Caps are Ideal for Small Investments</h3>
<p>Those on a budget are constantly on the lookout for the best micro-cap cryptocurrencies. The reason for this is that even with a small investment, if a micro-cap &#8216;moons&#8217; the returns can be sizable.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, when BNB launched in 2017, it had a market capitalization of just over $10 million.</li>
<li>Today, BNB is worth over $50 billion.</li>
<li>This amounts to growth of over 500,000%.</li>
<li>Therefore, investing just $100 in BNB in 2017 would now be worth $500,000.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finding the next 100x gem is often a case of focusing on quality micro-cap cryptocurrencies. This is because micro-caps have considerable room for growth, especially if they are behind innovative concepts.</p>
<p>The top micro cap crypto on our list is Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX). This cryptocurrency decentralizes the cloud mining space by offering tokenized credits. Investors can stake $BTCMTX and earn high APYs and mining revenues.</p>

<h2>Donbet Interface &amp; User Experience</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Donbet has a cartoonish set of characters that serve as mascots for the gambling site and give it a unique character. While it doesn’t impact the play experience much, the gangster-looking characters give the platform a unique look that we appreciated during our Donbet review.</p>
<p>There were other aspects of the Donbet user interface that we liked even more. First, it’s incredibly easy to create a casino account. Players can submit all their information in a single form and clear the KYC check in minutes. It’s easy to make a deposit and activate bonuses on the player account page.</p>
<p>At the casino, Donbet lets players save their favorite games to a “favorites” list—a great feature that we wish more of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">top Bitcoin casinos</a> would incorporate. There’s also an excellent search function to help players find games and the ability to filter games by software provider.</p>
<p>Another nice touch is that the live casino is separate from the rest of the casino. This is helpful since not all Donbet bonuses work for live casino games.</p>
<p>Donbet’s sportsbook is also very easy to navigate, offering a list of all sports markets on one side of the site and the bet slip on the other. Players can easily navigate to live matches to bet on games that are already underway. It’s also straightforward to click on any upcoming match and see all of the available prop bets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149422 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704842465-donbet-esports-betting.png" alt="Donbet Esports Betting" width="1000" height="552" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704842465-donbet-esports-betting.png 1000w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704842465-donbet-esports-betting-300x166.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704842465-donbet-esports-betting-768x424.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704842465-donbet-esports-betting-150x83.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The sportsbook supports decimal, American, and fractional odds, and players can easily toggle between these depending on their preference. Another nice touch is that Donbet offers time filters, enabling players to sort through available bets based on the time that a match is expected to start.</p>
<h2>Does Donbet Have a Mobile App?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Donbet doesn’t have a mobile app, but its online platform is responsive and mobile-friendly. This is the approach many modern online gambling platforms have taken, since players don’t need to download a dedicated app. Donbet’s mobile site offers all the same betting options, payment methods, and account controls that players would get when playing on a computer.</p>
<h2>Donbet Security</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Donbet is owned and operated by Santeda International B.V., which also operates the online casinos Velobet, Rolletto, Mystake and Goldenbet. All of Santeda’s online casinos, including Donbet, are licensed by Gaming Curacao.</p>
<p>Gaming Cuarao <a href="https://directpaynet.com/curacao-gaming-license-regulation-changes/">updated its regulations</a> in 2023 to adapt to the changing online gambling landscape and ensure players’ safety. So, holding a license from this regulator is a promising sign for a relatively new casino.</p>
<p>Donbet secures players’ accounts with SSL encryption and uses BitGo to process crypto payments. While the casino is still new, we were impressed by the steps it has taken to safeguard players’ accounts and funds.</p>
<h2>Donbet Casino Pros &amp; Cons</h2>

<h2><strong>Crypto Wallets Explained </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing a suitable crypto wallet is crucial. Investors will need to select a wallet that offers adequate security controls, a user-friendly interface, and convenient accessibility. In addition, investors will need to consider what features they seek from a wallet, such as being able to trade or stake tokens. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto wallets come with many different functions, but they are primarily used to store digital currencies. For example, consider an investor who buys Bitcoin from a crypto exchange in South Africa. Instead of trusting the exchange to keep the tokens safe, many investors will withdraw the funds to a private wallet. </p>
<p>In doing so, the investor can retain full control of their cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto wallets allow investors to send and receive funds. Transactions are conducted on a wallet-to-wallet basis and do not go through a centralized entity, such as a bank or e-wallet provider. Instead, wallet transactions are private and decentralized. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/bitcoin-3089728-1280.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Icon " /></figure>
<p>When sending funds to another person, the user will need the receiver&#8217;s wallet address. No two wallet addresses are the same. After confirming the transaction, it will be executed by the underlying network. </p>
<p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa come with additional features, allowing users to fully engage with the blockchain ecosystem. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, wallet providers like Best Wallet and Binance support trading. This means that users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies without leaving their wallet. </li>
<li>Providers like Trust Wallet and OKX come with staking tools, enabling users to earn passive income on their idle tokens. </li>
</ul>
<p>As we explain in more detail later, there are many different types of crypto wallets. For instance, non-custodial wallets provide users with their private keys. This means the user has full control of their crypto tokens. </p>
<p>Custodial wallets, on the other hand, remove the need to secure private keys. This is because the custodian will keep the crypto tokens safe on behalf of investors. Investors also need to consider their preferred device type, such as a mobile or desktop wallet. </p>
<h2><strong>Do You Need a Crypto Wallet? Key Reasons Explained </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are various reasons why a crypto wallet is crucial when investing in digital currencies. This is the case for both short and long-term traders. </p>
<p>Discussed below are the key benefits provided by the best crypto wallets in South Africa. </p>
<h3><strong>Safely Store Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are highly sought after by cybercriminals, due to their anonymous characteristics. Put otherwise, if an investor has their crypto tokens stolen remotely, the likelihood is that the funds will never be recovered. This is why wallets are so important, as they keep cryptocurrencies safe. </p>
<p>The level of security offered by a wallet will vary greatly. </p>
<p>For example, &#8216;cold&#8217; wallets are always offline, so offer the greatest security controls. &#8216;Hot&#8217; wallets are less secure as they are always connected to live servers. But hot wallets can still be protected by two-factor authentication and other security tools. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, crypto wallets allow South Africans to store wealth away from banks and other financial institutions. </p>
<h3><strong>Send and Receive Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>
<p>Wallets also allow users to transact, often without a centralized intermediary. Transactions are processed on a wallet-to-wallet basis via public addresses. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, suppose an investor wants to transfer some Bitcoin tokens to a family member. </li>
<li>After providing the receiver&#8217;s wallet address, the Bitcoin transaction should be confirmed by the blockchain in about 10 minutes. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the investor wishes to receive Bitcoin from another person, they would need to provide their unique wallet address. </p>
<h3><strong>Additional Features</strong></h3>
<p>The best crypto wallets for South African traders come with additional functionality. This removes the need to use third parties when engaging with the blockchain ecosystem. </p>
<ul>
<li>Some wallets allow users to swap tokens instantly. For example, swapping Bitcoin for Dogecoin without needing to use an exchange. </li>
<li>Earning passive income is also possible when using a top-rated wallet. The most common methods include staking and yield farming. </li>
<li>Many wallets are able to connect to Web3 applications. This includes decentralized exchange and lending platforms, offering a world of possibilities for South African investors. </li>
</ul>
<p>While security should be the main priority when choosing a wallet, investors should also explore what features are available. </p>
<h2><strong>Top Crypto Wallets in South Africa: Full Reviews  </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are many metrics that should be considered when choosing the best crypto wallet for South African traders. This includes everything from fees and security to accessibility, user-friendliness, and core features. </p>
<p>Below, we rank and review the best crypto wallets in South Africa for 2024. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Best Wallet &#8211; The Overall Best Crypto Wallet for South African Traders and Investors</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" rel="sponsored">Best Wallet</a> is our top pick for the best crypto wallet in South Africa for 2024. This wallet offers multi-chain support, meaning you can hold tokens on the Ethereum, Polygon and BNB blockchains, and you can swap them between chains. The team plans to add Bitcoin blockchain in the future, which will make it the ultimate crypto wallet for storing your coins.</p>
<p>This solves one major issue for crypto investors. Instead of having multiple crypto wallets for each blockchain, you can store all your coins in one wallet. What&#8217;s more, the team will add NFT support, meaning you can hold your digital collectibles in your wallet or you can exchange them directly from your wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333531/best-wallet2.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Introduction" /></figure>
<p>Another useful feature is the Best DEX integration. This is a decentralized exchange that swaps your tokens. In addition, anyone with a crypto wallet can use the Best DEX as you don&#8217;t have to sign up. All it takes is to connect your wallet and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<p>Best Wallet and Best DEX users are eligible for the $BEST token drop, which is planned for Phase 6 of the wallet&#8217;s development.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333537/best-wallet-airdrop.jpg" alt="BEST Token Airdrop" /></figure>
<p>The $BEST token will be the ecosystem&#8217;s utility and governance token, meaning you can use it to vote in the Best Wallet governance or you can stake it to get benefits like feeless swaps.</p>
<p>You can now download the Best Wallet on your iOS and Android devices and use some of its features while new features are being built. In the future, the wallet will integrate market analysis, which comes with advanced price charts for the tokens you wish to trade. There will also be token analysis, where you can find trending tokens to buy or track investor sentiment for select tokens.</p>
<p>To put your mind at ease, Best Wallet comes with advanced security features such as two-factor authentication and PIN or biometrics unlocking, depending on your smartphone. So even if someone steals your phone, they won&#8217;t be able to access your crypto wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333538/bestwallet2.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Roadmap" /></figure>
<p>Overall, this is more than just a crypto wallet. It&#8217;s designed to be the ultimate Web3 hub where you can swap coins between chains, trade NFTs and monitor the crypto market all within a single mobile app.</p>

<p>The Zengo mobile wallet is protected by multi-party computation (MPC) cryptography, for which Zengo maintains the largest open source library. This wallet has also done away with the antiquated seed phrase, replacing it with a novel three factor authentication—which uses a 3D face scan, email address, and recovery file—that is used to recreate the user’s wallet on a new device. For the security conscious there is also a Pro version for $69.99 per year, which gives users multiple high-quality security features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Web3 Firewall &#8211; </b>Alerts about Web3 hacks and hack prevention</li>
<li><b>Theft Protection &#8211; </b>2-factor authentication for transactions above a user designated threshold</li>
<li><b>Legacy Transfer &#8211; </b>Automatically transfer assets to another address after user-defined period of inactivity</li>
<li><b>Priority Support &#8211; </b>Guaranteed responses with 1 hour (typically within 5 minutes)</li>

<h3><strong>4. Ledger &#8211; Hardware Wallet for High Security and Flexibility Supporting 5500+ Cryptos</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/" rel="sponsored"><u>Ledger</u></a> stands out as a promising option for those prioritizing the highest level of security in crypto storage. </p>
<p>Started in 2014, it offers a range of hardware wallets designed to keep digital assets in cold storage, thus safeguarding them from online threats.</p>
<p>One of Ledger&#8217;s key strengths is its cold storage approach, which keeps your assets offline during transactions. </p>
<p>To initiate an outgoing transaction, you must confirm it on the Ledger device by entering a user-created PIN. A unique feature is the 24-word passphrase, which is your private key. Ledger also allows adding a 25th word, up to 100 characters, increasing security measures. </p>
<p>Even if someone gains access to your 24-word passphrase, they still can&#8217;t access your wallet without the 25th word. Moreover, the wallet can be remotely recovered if stolen.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118605/316025/screenshot-2023-07-04-at-.jpg" alt="Ledger Hardware Wallet Webpage" /></figure>
<p>Ledger Live, the proprietary mobile and desktop app, improves user experience by providing an interface to monitor your crypto portfolio. </p>
<p>This application isn&#8217;t just a monitoring tool; it allows users to connect to third-party services like 1inch DEX, MoonPay, and Lido staking, among others, for better utility.</p>
<p>The Ledger wallet can connect to mobile and desktop devices via USB cable or Bluetooth. This is particularly significant in the case of the Ledger Nano X model, which offers Bluetooth connectivity, enabling transactions on smartphones without the need for cables.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118630/334493/screen-shot-2023-10-20-at.jpg" alt="Ledger Hardware Wallet Shop" /></figure>
<p>Ledger offers three primary products: Ledger Stax, Ledger Nano X, and Ledger Nano S Plus. Each product caters to different security needs and budget constraints. The Ledger Nano S Plus is the most affordable at $79.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has wide-ranging support for over 5,500 cryptos, covering networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, Monero, XRP, and Stellar.</p>
<p>Ledger also offers an extensive library of educational content, including tutorials and guides on staking coins, cloud mining, and more, making it a comprehensive platform for beginners and experienced crypto enthusiasts.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Trezor &#8211; Cold Wallet Device Aimed at Long-Term Crypto Investors   </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://trezor.io/" rel="sponsored">Trezor</a> is one of the best crypto wallets in South Africa for long-term investors. This is a cold wallet device that does not expose private keys to the internet. And hence, investors can rest assured that their cryptocurrencies cannot be hacked remotely. What&#8217;s more, even if the Trezor device is lost, damaged, or stolen &#8211; the funds can be recovered via the backup passphrase. </p>
<p>This is provided when the wallet is set up for the first time and should be written down and kept somewhere safe. Another safeguard is that cryptocurrencies can only leave the Trezor wallet when the PIN is entered on the device. Not only that but unlike its main competitor Ledger, the Trezor wallet is open source. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312863/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" alt="Compare Trezor Hardware Wallet Models" /></figure>
<p>This ensures that any potential vulnerabilities are made available to the crypto community. We also like that Trezor supports more than 1,200 cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchain standards. This includes everything from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Cardano to BNB. Trezor also allows investors to add custom tokens, as long as the underlying network is supported. </p>
<p>In terms of pricing, <a href="https://trezor.io/compare" rel="sponsored">there are two Trezor models to choose from</a>. The Trezor Model One costs $69 (about 1,300 ZAR), while the Model T retails for $219 (about 4,100 ZAR). The latter comes with additional features, such as an in-built staking tool and a more convenient touchscreen LCD pad. That said, the $69 model offers the same level of robust security as the premium version.       </p>

<h3><strong>6. Trust Wallet &#8211; Popular Non-Custodial Crypto Wallet Used by Over 60 Million People </strong></h3>
<p>Trust Wallet is popular with South Africans that prefer non-custodial storage. This means that only the wallet owner has access to the private keys. And hence, users can store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies without going through an intermediary. <a href="https://trustwallet.com/" rel="sponsored">Trust Wallet &#8211; which is used by over 60 million people</a>, is completely free to use. </p>

<h3><strong>7. Binance &#8211; User-Friendly Web Wallet Aimed at Active Crypto Traders    </strong> </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/en" rel="sponsored">Binance</a> offers one of the best crypto wallets for South African traders. It is a leading crypto exchange that doubles up as a user-friendly web wallet. The Binance wallet is custodial, so users are not provided with their private keys. The wallet comes with a variety of security controls, including IP and device whitelisting. It also comes with two-factor authentication. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes,<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/how-and-why-assets-move-between-binance-wallets-4835275628753556476" rel="sponsored"> Binance operates both hot and cold wallets</a>.

<p>There is no requirement to transfer funds from the wallet to access the Binance exchange. Thousands of trading markets are supported, with South African traders paying a commission of just 0.1%.

<h3><strong>8. MetaMask &#8211; Top Decentralized Wallet for Storing ERC20 Tokens   </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://metamask.io/" rel="sponsored">MetaMask</a> is an established crypto wallet used by over 30 million people globally. This is a decentralized wallet that will appeal to investors wanting to take custodianship over their cryptocurrencies. MetaMask does not ask for personal information, and it does not have access to the user&#8217;s password or private keys.</p>
<p>This allows South Africans to store their wealth away from centralized bodies. Although MetaMask does not support Bitcoin, it&#8217;s one of the best crypto wallets for storing ERC20 tokens. Any ERC20 token can be added to MetaMask via its unique contract address. MetaMask also supports <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/" rel="sponsored">layer 2 blockchains</a>, including Polygon, Arbitrum, and Avalanche. </p>

The wallet is decentralized and does not connect to the primary OKX wallet. There is no requirement to open an account, and only the wallet user has access to their private keys. The OKX wallet supports more than 50 blockchain standards. </p>
<p>This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. It also allows users to add custom tokens via the project&#8217;s contract address. In terms of security, users can activate <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/what-is-mpc/" rel="sponsored">MPC (Multi-Party Computation) security</a> via the OKX app. This means that there is no single point of failure, a major safeguard when keeping private keys secure.  </p>

<p>Instead, the private keys are split into smaller segments and secured in multiple, unknown locations. This ensures that the OKX wallet remains safe against remote hacking attempts. The wallet is also secured with a backup passphrase. This will be needed if the user forgets their wallet PIN or the device is lost or stolen. </p>
<p>One of the best features of the OKX wallet is its bridge aggregator. This allows users to instantly swap tokens without leaving the wallet. It also allows users to earn income on idle tokens via staking and yield farming. These tools are integrated with over 200 decentralized exchanges, allowing OKX users to get the most competitive rates. </p>

<h3><strong>10. Coinbase &#8211; Global Crypto Exchange With a Secure Custodial Wallet     </strong> </h3>
<p><a href="https://coinbase.com/" rel="sponsored">Coinbase</a> &#8211; one of the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/" rel="sponsored">largest crypto exchanges for trading volume</a>, also offers a secure custodial wallet. This wallet provider is popular with beginners that want a simple but regulated place to buy and store cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/licenses" rel="sponsored">Coinbase holds many licenses</a> in the US and several international markets. It also offers premium security features. </p>
<p>For example, Coinbase accounts are protected by cold storage, two-factor authentication, and device whitelisting. Coinbase also has an internal security team, and all accounts must go through a <a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process" rel="sponsored">KYC process</a>.

<p>The Coinbase wallet supports web browsers and smartphones. The latter comes as an app for iOS and Android. Coinbase is also popular with South Africans that want to trade crypto against ZAR.

<h2><strong>Tips for Selecting the Best South Africa Bitcoin Wallet </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Investors should do lots of independent research when researching the best Bitcoin wallets in South Africa. This means assessing security, usability, supported coins, fees, and other important factors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still undecided on the best South Africa Bitcoin wallets? Read on for assistance on how to select the most suitable wallet in 2024. </p>
<h3><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>South African investors should consider the type of crypto wallet that is most preferable for their needs. </p>
<p>This begins with a choice between custodial or non-custodial storage. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custodial wallets</strong>: Investors have no access to their private keys. The <i>custodian</i> is responsible for keeping the crypto wallet safe.</li>
<li><strong>Non-custodial wallets</strong>: Private keys are provided when setting up the wallet. The <i>investor</i> is responsible for keeping the crypto wallet safe.  </li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s more, South Africans need to choose the device type to store their crypto wallet. </p>
<p>Mobile apps offer a great level of security and convenience. Another option is desktop or browser-based wallets. When opting for a software wallet, make sure the respective operating system is supported. </p>
<p>Those holding a large amount of cryptocurrencies might be more suited for a hardware or paper wallet. </p>
<h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3>
<p>Next, South Africans need to ensure their chosen cryptocurrencies are supported by the wallet. For example, while MetaMask is one of the best crypto wallets in South Africa &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t support Bitcoin, Cardano, or Solana. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to choose a wallet that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and network standards. In doing so, investors can store their cryptocurrencies in the same place. </p>
<h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Most software wallets are free to use. This means there are no fees to store or receive cryptocurrencies. While GAS fees apply on outgoing transactions, the best crypto wallets in South Africa do not charge any markups. </p>
<p>Hardware wallets are not free. They must be purchased from the manufacturer, and prices will vary considerably. Investors should ensure that the cost price is justified, based on the value of their crypto portfolio. </p>
<p>For example, those investing very small amounts likely won&#8217;t want to buy the Trezor Model T &#8211; which retails for approximately 4,100 ZAR. </p>
<h3><strong>Extra Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa offer extra functionality, such as being able to trade tokens. This removes the need to use a third party when buying and selling cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>For example, the Best Wallet allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with a credit card, and they support multi-chain tokens. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333540/best-wallet.jpg" alt="Best Wallet App Download" /></figure>
<p>The Binance wallet is also great for additional features. It supports staking, savings accounts, yield farming, and leveraged trading. The latter includes futures and options. </p>
<p>We also like the OKX wallet, which bridges to over 200 exchanges. OKX users subsequently get the best interest rates when earning yields on idle tokens. </p>
<h3><strong>Security Controls</strong></h3>
<p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa offer a breakdown of what security controls are provided. </p>
<p>This might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP/Device Whitelisting</strong>: Additional security steps are needed when logging into the wallet from a new IP address or device. </li>
<li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication</strong>: The user will need to enter a unique code when logging in. This is either sent to the user via email or SMS. </li>
<li><strong>Cold Storage</strong>: Keeping cryptocurrencies in cold storage means the private keys remain away from live internet servers. This makes them practically impossible to hack remotely. </li>
<li><strong>Multi-Sig Permissions</strong>: Some crypto wallets offer multi-sig permissions. The user will need to verify outgoing transactions on multiple devices. </li>
<li><strong>MPC</strong>: MPC technology is offered by the OKX wallet. It splits the private key into multiple segments and stores each part in a unique location.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation</strong>: The best crypto wallets in South Africa are regulated.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How do Crypto Wallets Work? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking for some guidance on how crypto wallets <i>actually</i> work?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what South African investors need to know before getting started. </p>
<h3><strong>Wallet Addresses</strong></h3>
<p>Once a suitable wallet has been chosen, the investor will need to set it up. This will generate a new, unique wallet address. The wallet address allows the investor to receive cryptocurrencies from another location. </p>
<p>Think of it like an electronic funds transfer (EFT), which requires the sender to specify the receiver&#8217;s personal account number. The wallet address is safe to share with other people, as it simply allows the user to receive tokens via the blockchain. </p>
<p>Each blockchain network has its own wallet address standard. For example, <a href="https://ethereum.org/fi/guides/how-to-use-a-wallet/" rel="sponsored">Ethereum wallets always start with 0x</a>. Nevertheless, if the wrong wallet address is provided, the tokens will be sent to an incorrect location. This means the tokens will be unrecoverable. </p>
<h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3>
<p>If the investor opts for a non-custodial wallet, they will be provided with unique private keys when getting started. This is usually provided as a 12-word passphrase, but some wallets use a much longer combination. </p>
<p>Either way, private keys must never be shared with another person. Nor should they be kept on a device that connects to the internet. </p>
<p>If they end up in the wrong hands, the private keys will allow an unauthorized person to access the wallet. This is one of the most common reasons for crypto wallets being hacked remotely. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Custodial wallets do not provide users with their private keys. This is because the custodian is responsible for keeping the cryptocurrencies safe. Custodial wallets are popular with beginners, but investors should ensure the provider is regulated. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Wallet Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Software wallets are usually free to use. There are no fees to store or receive cryptocurrencies. But fees are charged when sending cryptocurrencies to another wallet. </p>
<p>The best crypto wallets in South Africa do not charge a markup on network fees. Instead, fees go directly to blockchain miners. </p>
<p>Fees are quoted in real-time and rise and fall based on network demand. </p>
<p>Crypto hardware wallets, however, are not free. Prices vary depending on the provider and model type. For example, Trezor charges $69 and $219 for its basic and advanced models. </p>
<h2><strong>What are the Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Once South African investors have chosen between a custodial or non-custodial wallet, the preferred device type should be considered. Wallets come as mobile apps, desktop software, browser extensions, and hardware devices. Investors should also consider whether they prefer a hot or cold wallet. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now discuss the main types of crypto wallets that are available to South Africans in 2024. </p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Some of the most popular crypto wallets in South Africa come as software. This includes desktop software for Windows, Max, and Linux. The software is installed on the desktop device and allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies via a laptop or PC. </p>
<p>Another option for desktop users is wallets that come as a browser extension. Some providers offer support for Chrome, Firefox, and other popular web browsers. </p>
<p>An even more convenient option is mobile wallet apps. This allows users to store cryptocurrencies on their smartphones. As such, this makes sending, receiving, and trading cryptocurrencies a breeze. </p>
<h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>A more secure option is to buy a Bitcoin hardware wallet. As noted above, prices will vary, with Trezor charging $69 for its basic device.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets come with the added benefit of cold storage. In simple terms, this means the cryptocurrencies and private keys are never exposed to live internet servers. </p>
<p>Safeguards are also in place to protect investors from physical theft. This is because cryptocurrencies can only leave the hardware wallet if the PIN is entered on the device itself.  </p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>We also found that paper wallets are increasingly becoming popular with South African investors. After generating a public address and private key, the user will print the credentials. </p>
<p>This keeps the wallet offline at all times. It is imperative that the paper wallet is kept somewhere safe. It is also important to ensure the paper wallet provider is legitimate and that private keys are encrypted when initially shown to the user. </p>
<p>Both paper and hardware wallets offer excellent security, but do make it cumbersome to send and trade cryptocurrencies.  </p>
<h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Get and Use a Bitcoin Wallet in South Africa</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We mentioned earlier that Best Wallet is the overall best crypto wallet in South Africa. In this section, we explain how to get started with this wallet in under five minutes. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Download the Best Wallet app</strong></h3>
<p>South African investors will first need to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" rel="sponsored">download the Best Wallet app</a> on the App Store or Google Play. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/bw7.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Application" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Open the Best Wallet App</strong></h3>
<p>First, you need to verify your email address. Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to secure your account with a two-factor authentication. If you want to, you can skip this step and activate this feature later.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/bw4.jpg" alt="Best Wallet 2FA Setup" /></figure>
<p>Whether you activate 2FA or not, you&#8217;ll be asked to set up a four-digit password. You can also enable biometrics to unlock your wallet if your smartphone supports this feature.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Now that we have secured the app, go ahead and create your first wallet. This will be your main wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. At this stage you can create multiple wallets and name them, for example, &#8220;Meme coin wallet&#8221; or &#8220;Storage&#8221; or whatever you want.</p>
<p>Choose a background color for each wallet. This will help you identify each wallet fast. </p>
<p>Tap &#8220;Continue&#8221; when ready.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333561/bw3.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Account Identifier" style="max-width:50%" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Your next step is to use the wallet to buy coins with a card or to send and receive tokens. You can swap the tokens you have as well. The more you use the wallet during this stage, the greater the odds of getting the $BEST token airdrop in Phase 6.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/bw1.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Main Account" /></figure>
<h2><strong>How Safe are Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While varying levels of security are offered, crypto wallets are never 100% secure from hackers and scams. Moreover, investors need to take steps to protect their wallet credentials. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, custodial wallets remove the need for investors to secure their private keys. </li>
<li>But this isn&#8217;t to say that the wallet is immune to fraud. </li>
<li>On the contrary, investors should make use of two-factor authentication and any other safeguards offered by the custodian. </li>
<li>Coinbase, for instance, allows users to set up IP and device whitelisting. </li>
<li>This means an extra security step kicks in if the user attempts to access the wallet from a new IP address or device. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Security procedures will differ when opting for a non-custodial wallet. This is because there is no custodian to protect the investor&#8217;s cryptocurrencies. Instead, only the user has access to their private keys, meaning they must take full responsibility for keeping them safe. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-custodial wallets do not come with two-factor authentication or whitelisting. This is because there is no custodian sitting between the investor and their cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>That said, we like that the OKX wallet comes with MPC technology. This means that only a small segment of the private key is stored on the user&#8217;s device. The remaining segments are stored across multiple locations. </p>
<p>Some non-custodial wallets come with multi-sig permissions. This is a security tool that requires outgoing transfers to be confirmed on at least two devices. Just like MPC technology, this removes a single point of failure &#8211; making it challenging for remote hacks to succeed. </p>
<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Wallets ensure that South Africans can invest in the crypto market safely. While there are many crypto wallets in the market, we particularly like Best Wallet. </p>
<p>The Best Wallet can hold coins from various blockchains, it can seamlessly swap them, and you can store your NFTs in a single mobile app. Upcoming features include market insights and token analysis, which will make Best Wallet the ultimate Web3 crypto hub for your tokens. </p>

</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4. Trezor &#8211; Emerging for UAE Investors With Large Exposure to Crypto &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Trezor is the Bitcoin hardware wallet for security. There is a wide range of safeguards that ensure the stored cryptocurrencies do not get into the wrong hands. First and foremost, Trezor is a cold wallet, so it&#8217;s never connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Rest assured, this removes the risk of the wallet being hacked remotely. Second, cryptocurrencies cannot leave the Trezor device unless the user&#8217;s PIN is entered. Third, Trezor transactions are authorized without needing to connect to a server. Instead, USB type A or C cables are used, <a href="https://trezor.io/compare" rel="sponsored">depending on the Trezor model purchased</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312863/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" alt="Trezor Hardware Wallet Comparison"></figure><p>The Trezor Model T costs $219 (about 800 AED) and comes with a digital touchscreen for confirming transactions. The Trezor Model One costs $69 (about 250 AED) and uses a more clunky two-pad button. That said, the Model One is just as secure as the advanced version. Moreover, both the Model One and T support over 1,000 coins, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><figure class="table">

</div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>5. MetaMask &#8211; Popular Wallet for UAE Investors That Prefer Non-Custodial Storage &nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Another option to consider is <a href="https://metamask.io/" rel="sponsored">MetaMask</a>, which is the best crypto wallet in the UAE for non-custodial storage. This means that users do not need to trust a third party when storing their cryptocurrency investments. MetaMask provides users with their private keys via a 12-word passphrase. The wallet provider cannot see the keys, as the information is encrypted.&nbsp;</p><p>But do remember that if the password and backup passphrase are misplaced, MetaMask cannot help recover the wallet. Moreover, MetaMask comes with limited security features. Nonetheless, we like that MetaMask is available as a browser extension or mobile app for Android and iOS. It is free to download and use, and no fees are charged when storing and receiving cryptocurrencies.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" alt="Metamask Wallet Homepage">&nbsp;</p><p>We also like that MetaMask doesn&#8217;t charge any additional fees for outgoing transfers. Instead, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/" rel="sponsored">GAS fees</a> are forwarded directed to the blockchain in real-time. In terms of supported cryptocurrencies, MetaMask comes pre-installed with an Ethereum wallet address. This accepts all ERC20 tokens, including Tether, USD Coin, and DAI.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Bitcoin is not supported, several other networks can be added to the MetaMask wallet manually. This includes Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Optimism. MetaMask also supports the best Arbitrum network tokens. Although MetaMask is free to use, it comes with several paid-for features. This includes token swaps, Ethereum 2.0 staking, and AED deposits. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><figure class="table">

Binance &#8211; Hybrid Wallet and Exchange With Licensing From the FSRA &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" rel="sponsored">Binance</a> is a crypto wallet and exchange that is popular with short-term UAE traders. It holds a license with the <a href="https://www.adgm.com/financial-services-regulatory-authority" rel="sponsored">FSRA in Abu Dhabi</a> and directly accepts AED payments. The Binance wallet can be accessed by logging in with a username and password. Two-factor authentication and other security features are offered.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/looking-back-at-binances-2022-endofyear-report-1820343945198453383" rel="sponsored">Binance reports</a> that its Safe Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) is now valued at over $1 billion. This is used as an insurance fund in the event Binance is hacked. Moreover, the Binance wallet also comes with IP whitelisting. Should a user login from an unrecognized IP address, an additional two-factor authentication process is undertaken. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313184/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" alt="Binance Signup Page"></figure><p>But the main attraction of the Binance wallet is having access to its exchange. The <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/" rel="sponsored">Binance exchange is the largest by trading volume,</a> and it supports hundreds of cryptocurrencies. UAE investors will pay just 0.1% when trading. Moreover, the Binance wallet also supports staking, yield farming, and savings accounts. APYs are very competitive, too.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, some staking pools are currently yielding almost 20%. While Binance savings accounts are offering APYs of over 30%. We also like that Binance offers advanced trading tools and complex crypto derivatives. The latter includes Bitcoin futures, options, and perpetual contracts. Binance also offers great customer support via live chat, 24/7.&nbsp;</p><figure class="table">

</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Crypto Wallets Explained&nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>When investing in crypto in the UAE, the first step is to choose a suitable exchange to complete the purchase. The next step is to choose a wallet to store the purchased crypto assets. This is where things can get confusing, considering the sheer number of crypto wallets in the market.</p><p>To help clear the mist, a good starting point is to understand how crypto wallets actually work.&nbsp;</p><p>In basic terms, crypto wallets store digital currencies. Wallets usually come as software. For instance, desktop software for Windows and Mac or a mobile app for iOS and Android. That said, some wallets come as hardware devices, such as Trezor.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118498/315837/bitcoin-3089728-1280.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Icon"></figure><p>All wallets come with a unique address for each supported cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin will have its own wallet address, and this is required when <i>receiving</i> tokens. When <i>sending</i> tokens to another wallet, the receiver&#8217;s address will be needed. If using a mobile wallet, the sender can scan the receiver&#8217;s address via a QR code. If not, the wallet address can be pasted in.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>Unlike traditional bank wires, crypto transactions are sent on a wallet-to-wallet basis. This means they do not go through a third party. Instead, wallet-to-wallet transactions are processed by the blockchain network.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><p>While storing, sending, and receiving tokens are the main functions of a crypto wallet, other features are often available.</p><h2><strong>How do Crypto Wallets Work?&nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Now let&#8217;s take a much more detailed look at how crypto wallets work.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with custodianship:</p><h3><strong>Wallet Custodianship</strong></h3><p>In order to choose the best crypto wallet in the UAE, investors must understand how custodianship works. This is important, as it determines <i>who</i> is responsible for looking after the cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple analogy is to think about how traditional money is stored.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>When using a <i>custodial</i> storage option, the money would be deposited into a bank. The bank is then responsible for keeping the money secure. To access the money, permission needs to be granted by the bank.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Those who do not trust banks would need to consider a non-custodial option, such as keeping the money at home in a safe. This gives full control of the money, as no permission is needed to access it. But equally, this increases the risks of theft.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The same concept is true for crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, custodial wallets like Binance are responsible for keeping client cryptocurrencies safe. They do not provide users with their private keys as a safety precaution. As licensed custodians, these wallet providers have institutional-grade security practices in place.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, non-custodial wallets like Best Wallet give users their private keys when getting started. The wallet provider cannot access the private keys. Only the user can.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118852/333643/best-wallet.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Download"></figure><blockquote>
<p>Choosing between a custodial or non-custodial wallet is ultimately down to the investor&#8217;s experience. While beginners will likely prefer a regulated custodian, experienced investors might feel more comfortable safeguarding their own wallets.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><h3><strong>Wallet Addresses</strong></h3><p>In order to send and receive cryptocurrencies via the blockchain, wallet addresses are needed. Each blockchain will have its own wallet address format.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, this is what a Bitcoin wallet address looks like:</p><p><strong>1F34duy2eeMz5mSrvFepVzy7Y1rBsnAyWC</strong></p><p>And here&#8217;s an example of an Ethereum wallet address:</p><p><strong>0x868daB0b8E21EC0a48b726A1ccf25826c78C6d7F</strong></p><p>Both are equally long and complex. But crucially, no two wallet addresses can be the same. This is similar to a bank account number.&nbsp;</p><p>So, sending funds to another person requires the destination wallet address. And vice versa when receiving cryptocurrencies into the wallet.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>Providing a wallet address to another person is not a security threat. Just like giving someone a bank account number, wallet addresses only allow people to send funds.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><p>But do note that wallet addresses are <i>public</i>. This means anyone can view the wallet balance if they have the address. Data analytic websites like <a href="https://blockchain.com/" rel="sponsored">Blockchain.com</a> and <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/" rel="sponsored">BitInfoCharts</a> provide this information. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wallet Private Keys</strong></h3><p>Crypto wallets also come with a unique set of private keys. Similar to wallet addresses, they are complex in nature. Private keys provide access to wallets and the cryptocurrencies stored within them. This means that private keys should be protected at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, instance, private keys should never be stored on a device that can connect to the internet. If they are, they are at risk of being hacked remotely. The hacker would then be able to access the wallet and drain the cryptocurrencies stored.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>The best practice for securing private keys is to write them on a sheet of paper.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For added security, the private keys could be split and written down on multiple sheets.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This way, if someone comes across the sheet of paper, they would only have part of the private key &#8211; which wouldn&#8217;t provide them access to the wallet.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>But ultimately, safeguarding private keys can be intimidating for beginners. This is why custodial wallets are often the better option. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do You Need a Crypto Wallet? What to Consider &nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>According to a <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022" rel="sponsored">Crypto.com study</a>, there are 219 million Bitcoin holders globally. However, the number of people that use Bitcoin for transactions is very small. For example, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-activeaddresses.html" rel="sponsored">BitInfoCharts data</a> shows that in the prior 24 hours, there were just over 880,000 active Bitcoin addresses.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that the vast majority of people that own Bitcoin do not transact. Instead, Bitcoin is purchased as an investment. In practice, this means that UAE residents do not actually need a crypto wallet to invest in this space.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, UAE investors wanting to send and receive cryptocurrencies will need a wallet. This will provide them with a unique wallet address and the ability to transfer funds without going through a third party. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What are the Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>We have covered custodianship, public addresses, and private keys in great detail. The next step for UAE investors is to learn about the different types of crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with the most common type &#8211; software wallets. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3><p>Software wallets allow investors to send and receive funds remotely. There are generally four options to choose from in this regard:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Web Wallet</strong>: Web wallets are offered by custodians like Binance. No software is actually required, as investors can access their web wallets by logging into their accounts. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Wallet</strong>: Mobile wallets like Best Wallet come as an app. They allow users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies no matter where they are located. This option is suitable for active traders that want full control of their cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Wallet</strong>: Another option is to download a desktop wallet. Usually supported for Windows and Mac, this offers a more user-friendly experience when transacting. But desktop wallets are less convenient, and transactions can only be verified when the user has access to their device.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Browser-Based Wallet</strong>: Some of the best crypto wallets in the UAE come as a browser extension. The wallet is installed in a browser like Chrome or Firefox. This makes it simple to trade cryptocurrencies online &#8211; especially on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/" rel="sponsored">decentralized exchanges</a>. &nbsp;</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Hardware wallets do not allow investors to transact with the blockchain remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, they come as a hardware device, and the private keys are never exposed to the internet. To transact, a PIN needs to be entered on the hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>We found that one of the best crypto hardware wallets for UAE investors is the Trezor Model One. This retails for just $69 or about 250 AED. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>The less common option is a paper wallet. This is a cost-effective version of a hardware wallet, as the private keys are never connected to live servers. This is because the private keys are printed and kept somewhere secure and private &#8211; like in a safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Paper wallets will not appeal to UAE investors who want to regularly send, receive, or trade cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tips for Selecting the Best UAE Bitcoin Wallet</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are many variables to consider when researching the best UAE Bitcoin wallets. Not only in terms of the wallet type and custodianship, but security, supporting coins, and core features.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s what to consider when choosing a UAE crypto wallet:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Custodianship</strong>: First, do some research on the pros and cons of both custodial and non-custodial wallets. As noted earlier, a great analogy is to consider how money is stored. Those that prefer to keep money in a bank can opt for a regulated custodial wallet. Those who prefer keeping money at home in a safe can opt for a non-custodial wallet.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Device Type</strong>: The most popular wallets are available on multiple devices. For example, wallets come as mobile apps, browser extensions, and desktop software. Hardware wallets are another option.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Supported Coins</strong>: The best crypto wallets in the UAE support many different coins and network standards. Best Wallet supports coins from various blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon and BNB, with Bitcoin blockchain planned for a future update.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fees</strong>: Hardware wallets must be purchased, so consider the costs before proceeding. Software wallets are free to download. Storing and receiving cryptocurrencies should also be free. Some wallets charge markups when sending cryptocurrencies. These wallets should be avoided. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Security features will vary depending on the wallet type. Non-custodial hot wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask come with limited security features. Cold wallets like Trezor are super-secure. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>User-Friendliness</strong>: UAE investors should also choose a crypto wallet that is suitable for their experience. The best user-friendly wallet is offered by Binance. On the other hand, OKX comes with many features, but it&#8217;s more suitable for experienced investors. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: We like crypto wallets that come with extra features. For example, being able to buy crypto with AED or swap tokens without leaving the wallet. Staking and yield farming tools are handy for earning passive income.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Get and Use a Bitcoin Wallet in UAE</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>This section provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to set up the Best Wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>We found that Best Wallet offers the best crypto wallet app for UAE investors. Not only is it non-custodial, meaning you have full control over your funds, but the app allows users to send and receive funds via multiple blockchains.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download the Best Wallet app</strong></h3><p>UAE investors must <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" rel="sponsored">download the Best Wallet app</a> from the App Store or Google Play, depending on the device.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333559/bw7.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Application Overview"></figure><h3><strong>Step 2: Open the Best Wallet App</strong></h3><p>When you open the app, you&#8217;ll be asked to verify your email address. The next step is to activate a two-factor authentication to improve the app&#8217;s security. However, you can skip this step and activate 2FA later on if you want to.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333560/bw4.jpg" alt="2FA Setup On Best Wallet"></figure><p>Whether or not you activate 2FA, you&#8217;ll have to set up a four-digit password next. There&#8217;s an option to enable biometrics such as fingerprint or face ID if your device supports any of those features.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Wallet</strong></h3><p>Your first wallet is on the Ethereum blockchain. You can now create multiple wallets, give them names, such as &#8220;Trading wallet&#8221; or &#8220;NFT storage&#8221; and select a background color. This is designed so that you can quickly identify each wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Tap &#8220;Continue&#8221; when ready.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333561/bw3.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Account Name"></figure><h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3><p>Now you can buy crypto with a card, receive coins from exchanges or other wallets and swap them. Active Best Wallet users may get $BEST tokens airdropped in Phase 6 of the development of this wallet.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/118509/333562/bw1.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Main Account"></figure><h2><strong>How Safe Are Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Each wallet type will come with its own level of security. Not only in terms of the device type, but whether it&#8217;s a custodial or non-custodial wallet. UAE investors should also consider whether the wallet offers hot or cold storage.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s break down the most important factors;</p><ul>
<li><strong>Cold Wallets</strong>: Cold wallets offer the highest level of security. They are never connected to a live internet server, so this removes a major risk &#8211; remote hacking attempts. Hot wallets are usually non-custodial, such as Trezor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Hot Wallets</strong>: In contrast, hot wallets offer a much lower level of security, because they are always connected to a live internet server. Hot wallets come as both custodial and non-custodial options. For example, the Binance web wallet is custodial. While the Exodus wallet is non-custodial, as users are provided with their private keys.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>When deciding between a custodial or non-custodial wallet, assessing the security features is paramount.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, non-custodial wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask come with limited safety features. These wallets are only protected by a password. If the device that the wallet is stored on is compromised, the private keys would be hacked.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>Custodial wallets offer many safety features &#8211; from two-factor authentication, regulation, and analytic behavior machine learning. On the flip side, investors are trusting a third party to look after their cryptocurrencies. This is much the same as trusting a bank to store money.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are many considerations to make when choosing the best crypto wallet for UAE investors. But overall, we found that the Best Wallet offers the ideal balance between safety, convenience, and features.&nbsp;</p><p>The Best Wallet can hold coins from multiple blockchains, it can swap them, and you can safely store your NFTs. With upcoming updates, you&#8217;ll get market insights and token analytics. Active Best Wallet users can get $BEST tokens airdropped in the future. &nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed">

<h2>How We Select the Best Tether Casinos</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The sections below discuss some of the factors to consider when determining the best Tether Casinos.</p>
<h3>Secure Crypto Payments</h3>
<p>Security is one of the most factors to look at when determining the top Tether casinos. All the top Tether Casinos in the list provide secure cryptocurrency payment options and allow investors to safely access Tether and other digital assets on their platforms.</p>
<h3>Fast Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</h3>
<p>Fast deposits and withdrawals are one of the most crucial factors new Tether casino users look at before choosing their preferred USDT gambling sites. Some of the best Tether Casino sites such as BC.Game and Cloudbet support quick withdrawals and instant deposits.</p>
<p>USDT will be withdrawn in five minutes from Lucky Block.</p>
<h3>Crypto Bonuses &amp; Promos</h3>
<p>The sections above have mentioned the individual sign-up bonuses for each of the 13 Tether gambling sites. For instance, BC.Game offers between 180% &#8211; 240% matched deposit bonuses spread across the first four deposits.</p>
<p>Other sites like Punt Casino offer 500 free spins through their promotional schemes, while Lucky Block has 15% cashback on losses for the first seven days.</p>
<h3>Low Crypto Banking Fees</h3>
<p>Many of the top Casino sites on our list do not charge additional fees. Most of the fees depend on the costs generated from the particular cryptocurrency’s network.</p>
<p>Lucky Block does not charge any fees on deposits or withdrawals.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Minetrix will tokenize cloud mining by leveraging the $BTCMTX token. All one has to do is purchase $BTCMTX on the presale and stake their holdings. Bitcoin Minetrix has a 4 billion token supply, and has allocated 2.8 billion tokens across 39 presale rounds.</p>
<p>Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0132 per token &#8211; this price will rise with each successive stage.</p>
<p>The current staking APY (Annual Percentage Yield) on $BTCMTX is 66%, which will eventually reduce as more tokens are staked on the Ethereum-powered smart contract. Staked token holders will earn passive income in the form of cloud mining credits.</p>
<p>While these credits cannot be traded, investors can burn them on the ecosystem to earn Bitcoin cloud mining power. This allows one to get allocated mining time and a share of mining revenues. This is a cost-efficient solution to other cloud mining services due to the high costs of operations and the prevalent third-party scams.</p>

<p>By tokenizing the tokens, investors can join a decentralized platform that is secure to use. The presale requires investors to make just a $10 investment to get started &#8211; over $10 million has been raised in eight weeks since it launched.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Sponge V2 &#8211; Emerging Altcoin With A P2E Game And A Stake-to-Bridge For High APYs</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/sponge/en" rel="sponsored">Sponge V2</a> is a trending new upgrade building on the remarkable success of the original $SPONGE. The first version caught the market&#8217;s attention, rising to a $100 million market cap and producing a staggering 100x return to early investors.</p>
<p>With over 11,500 holders and a stable $16 million market cap, Sponge V2 is set to take this legacy forward with innovative features and a strong community focus.</p>
<p><b>Key Developments in Sponge V2:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Stake-to-Bridge Model</b>: Sponge V2 offers a Stake-to-Bridge model, allowing users to transition from V1 to V2 by staking their original tokens. This model ensures a smooth upgrade and solidifies long-term community commitment by locking V1 tokens for four years and offering V2 tokens as rewards.</li>
<li><b>Play-to-Earn Gaming</b>: To improve utility and user engagement strategically, Sponge V2 integrates a Play-to-Earn game. This game is a fun addition and a practical way to earn $SPONGEV2 tokens.</li>
<li><b>Exchange Listing Plans</b>: The team behind Sponge V2 is potentially looking at listings on major exchanges like Binance and OKX. Such a move could mirror the success of other recently listed meme coins, potentially exploding SPONGEV2&#8217;s value.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702978661-screenshot-2023-12-19-at-11-28-3.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-143364 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702978661-screenshot-2023-12-19-at-11-28-3.png" alt="SPONGEV2" width="900" height="483" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702978661-screenshot-2023-12-19-at-11-28-3.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702978661-screenshot-2023-12-19-at-11-28-3-300x161.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702978661-screenshot-2023-12-19-at-11-28-3-768x412.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702978661-screenshot-2023-12-19-at-11-28-3-150x81.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>The total supply of $SPONGEV2 is capped at 150 billion, with a significant portion allocated for staking rewards and the P2E gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p>This allocation strategy emphasizes rewarding active participants and enhancing the token&#8217;s utility.</p>

<h3><strong>4. eTukTuk &#8211; Reduce Carbon Emissions in the Developing World</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/" rel="sponsored"><u>eTukTuk</u></a>, a new eco-friendly initiative based on the BSC blockchain, prepares for launch in Sri Lanka with a twofold mission &#8211; environmental protection and financial inclusion.</p>
<p>This project aims to replace traditional fossil fuel-reliant TukTuks with their electric counterparts, mitigating carbon emissions while offering economic advantages. The presale has already raised more than $725k with buyers able to earn 303% staking APY.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315137/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk EV crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Electric TukTuks bring significant cost reductions in operation and maintenance, potentially boosting driver income by an impressive 400%. Sri Lanka, home to a vast fleet of millions of TukTuks, can provide a solid base for eTukTuk’s journey to kick off.</p>
<p>With the strong backing of The Capital Maharaja Group, a significant conglomerate in Sri Lanka, eTukTuk&#8217;s goal of affordable and accessible electric vehicles and charging stations have become more feasible.</p>
<p>Incorporating blockchain tech, eTukTuk promotes financial inclusion by assigning digital identities, narrowing the economic divide. As per the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf?" rel="sponsored"><u>eTukTuk whitepaper</u></a>, It doubles as a socio-economic tool, aiming to make a mark beyond transportation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315136/etuktuk-staking.jpg" alt="eTukTuk power staking mechanics" /></figure>
<p>Token holders can support charging station operations by staking their tokens, earning annual yields in return. This unique staking method sets eTukTuk apart, further showing its innovative approach.</p>
<p>eTukTuk seeks to create a future where transportation and economic growth harmoniously coexist without affecting the planet&#8217;s health. You can join the <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk" rel="sponsored"><u>eTukTuk Telegram group</u></a> for the latest information.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Green Bitcoin &#8211; Crypto Presale Project That Rewards Accurate Bitcoin Price Predictions  </strong></h3>
<p>Although many cryptocurrency projects are developing innovative financial solutions, some projects are focused on rewarding users in a gamified way. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin</a> is such project where you buy $GBTC tokens, stake them and give Bitcoin price predictions. Depending on your prediction and staking duration, you&#8217;ll be rewarded.</p>
<p>The project is in its infancy, however. This means you can only buy $GBTC tokens now at a discounted price while you wait for the price prediction system to go live. This shouldn&#8217;t be bad, though, especially if you believe the project has a future. $GBTC sells at a lower price during the presale than what it could potentially trade post-presale. Moreover, you get to stake and earn rewards during the presale, giving you a chance to stack up before you start predicting Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-139682 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-768x434.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852292-green-bitcoin-token-presale-page-150x85.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>To participate in the presale, you need ETH, USDT or a card, and an Ethereum-based wallet to complete the transaction. Token withdrawal will be enabled once the presale ends. While you wait, you can earn more $GBTC tokens.</p>
<p>The staking system is live and there&#8217;s a 700% APR at the moment of writing. This will change as more tokens get staked. With 67.5% of the total token supply dedicated to the presale and the staking rewards, according to <a href="https://www.greenbitcoin.xyz/whitepaper.pdf" rel="sponsored">Green Bitcoin&#8217;s whitepaper</a>, the majority of the tokens are likely to get distributed among early adopters.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="651" class="alignnone wp-image-139687 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking.jpg" alt="Green Bitcoin token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-768x556.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1701852959-green-bitcoin-token-staking-150x109.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The token presale is the first phase in the project&#8217;s roadmap. After it ends, the token is going to be listed on A-tier exchanges. The gamified Bitcoin price prediction system comes next.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Scorpion Token (SCORP) &#8211; Earn Up To $10,000 in Daily Passive Staking</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN" rel="sponsored"><u>Scorpion Casino</u></a> is the future leading eGambling platform that lets users earn up to $10,000 USDT in daily passive staking, depending on the casino’s performance. The project is on a mission to build the number-one online social gambling platform that seeks to provide a fun and seamless gambling experience while simultaneously allowing everybody to earn.</p>
<p>Licensed and regulated by the Curacao EGaming licensing entity, Scorpion Casino can boast over 210 casino games, with an additional 160 live games. The platform hosts all the popular games you would expect from a major casino, including blackjack, roulette, poker, and slots. In addition, the games are highly polished as the casino is connected with all the major gaming providers, including Evolution, NetEnt, EGT, and AMATIC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/276950/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="scorpion casino presale" /></figure>
<p>In addition to the traditional table games, Scorpion Casino also hosts a sports betting section, allowing users to bet on the outcome of their favorite sports games. The sports section has all the major leagues integrated for popular sports such as soccer, tennis, golf, basketball, horse racing, boxing, and MMA.</p>
<p>The passive staking earnings are provided through a redistribution tax that’s baked into the smart contract for the token. A 2% tax is leveraged on all transactions, which is re-distributed to all SCORP holders. As a result, holders will see their token balance increase when holding the token as the casino gains more adoption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the token is actually deflationary due to the 1% burn tax that is levied on each transaction. Over time, the total supply for SCORP will continue to decrease, making the remaining tokens more scarce and valuable.</p>
<p>The project is currently hosting a presale for its native token, SCORP. The native token will be the exclusive payment method for the entire ecosystem and will be the default betting currency across the casino and sports gaming products. However, the casino also accepts major cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH, and BNB.</p>
<p>Investors who purchase more than $1,000 SCORP in the presale are automatically enrolled in the Elite Scorpion Members Club, which provides multiple benefits, including;</p>
<ul>
<li>A VIP service</li>
<li>Cashback on the casino</li>
<li>Extra staking rewards</li>
<li>Addition SCORP tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, those that use the exclusive bonus code Scorpion20 when making their purchase can get an extra 20% tokens on their investment &#8211; $3.5 million has now been raised in the presale.</p>
<p>The project has announced that it has already secured a top-tier centralized exchange listing for when the presale ends, which will be announced close to the conclusion of the presale.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Ethereum &#8211; Largest Altcoin and Originator of Smart Contracts</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) is the king of altcoins. It&#8217;s the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, beaten only by Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ethereum fathered the ERC standard used by many of today&#8217;s best altcoins to watch. But <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">is Ethereum a good investment</a> right now?</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311549/ethereum-foundation.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Many investors consider Ethereum to be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy now</a> and for good reason. The project has consistently proven itself able to weather any bear market while still providing the same great service to its users.</p>
<p>A large portion of the most popular altcoins utilize the ERC standard and with the upcoming Ethereum update expected to improve throughput, this is unlikely to change anytime soon. It&#8217;s also considered to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-vr-crypto.htm">best VR cryptos</a> as it powers many of the new projects on the market.</p>
<p>With the amount of value the project offers, Ethereum is one of the best altcoins to buy and a worthy addition to any well-diversified portfolio.</p>

<p>Chainlink (LINK) is packed full of intrinsic value and is one of the most popular altcoins currently available.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s core value proposition is the ability to implement off-chain data sources into on-chain applications, something that has drastically increased the functionality of Web3 projects as well as other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311550/chainlink.jpg" alt="Chainlink web3 services platform" /></figure>
<p>Few of even the best altcoins to watch can compete with Chainlink in terms of industry partnerships. Due to the nature of the project, it&#8217;s in the interest of other cryptocurrencies to join Chainlink in order to improve their own offerings. This has resulted in Chainlink&#8217;s technology being incorporated in a range of high-profile projects like Aave.</p>
<p>Overall, Chainlink is one of the best altcoins to buy right now. Even during the current market downturn, it has remained strong and as it uses the ERC standard, the upcoming Ethereum merge will likely award LINK a slight boost in value.</p>
<h3><strong>10. XRP &#8211; Transactional Cryptocurrency Touted as being the Future of Currency Exchanges</strong></h3>
<p>XRP is a transactional cryptocurrency that many investors believe could be the future of banking. The token was created by David Shwartz as a more cost and energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin with Ripple Labs being created soon thereafter in order to create use cases for XRP.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311551/xrp-1505.jpg" alt="XRP offering utility for global economy" /></figure>
<p>While Ripple and XRP are currently in the midst of a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the unlicensed selling of securities, many speculate that XRP could explode following the suit&#8217;s conclusion. Like Chainlink, XRP has a huge number of partnerships with financial institutions and banks including the Bank of America, MoneyGram, and American Express.</p>
<p>Being launched in 2012, XRP cannot be counted alongside new altcoins but it remains one of the best altcoins to buy. With its partial win over the SEC in a long standing court trial, it can also be regarded as born anew.</p>
<p>The price certainly reflects this, trading at $0.71 at the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/xrp-surges-after-judge-delivers-a-huge-win-to-ripple-in-its-case-against-the-sec.html" rel="sponsored">rising sharply after the SEC court victory.</a></p>
<h3><strong>11. BNB &#8211; Cryptocurrency Powering the Binance Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>BNB sometimes referred to as Build and Build, is the propriety token of the world&#8217;s largest exchange (by volume), Binance.</p>
<p>Despite originally launching as a rather basic blockchain designed primarily to reduce fees on the Binance exchange, BNB has since expanded into the smart contract sector and is commonly used to power new altcoins like Battle Infinity.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311552/bnb-coin.jpg" alt="Binance trading fees" /></figure>
<p>The value of BNB absolutely exploded in early 2021 as investors everywhere were looking for the next project to rival Ethereum and with the BEP standard based on ERC, it was a clear contender. The release of the Binance Smart Chain also created immense demand for BNB as it&#8217;s used to fuel all transactions on the network. The majority of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-price-prediction.htm">BNB price predictions</a> suggest that this utility token could reach an ATH of $2,000 by the end of 2030.</p>
<p>All in all, BNB is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">best crypto to buy Reddit</a> and still offers massive upside potential. The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem is only growing as a result of its low costs and similarities with the ERC standard, making it one of the top new altcoins to invest in this year.</p>
<h2><strong>What is an Altcoin?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><strong>Altcoins are made up of a brought spectrum of projects and are not limited by category, consensus mechanism, or intended use. </strong></i></p></blockquote>
<p>Altcoin simply means alternative coin. As such, any alternative (to Bitcoin) can be considered an altcoin. In practice, this means that every cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin is classed as an altcoin.</p>
<h2><strong>Can Altcoins Make for a Good Investment?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With Altcoins being made up of such a large variety of projects, some will make for good investments while others will slowly fade into obscurity. Below, we&#8217;ve shared a few reasons why altcoins can make an excellent addition to a well-balanced portfolio.</p>
<h3><strong>Technology</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p><i><strong>One of the most interesting aspects of altcoins is the technology they possess. With cryptocurrency already being an emerging technology, altcoins can provide access to subsectors like decentralized finance, the Metaverse, and P2E gaming. </strong></i></p></blockquote>
<p>The best altcoins to buy will typically feature new and exciting features, making them an excellent way to get to the forefront of technology.</p>
<p>Among those listed here, XRP20 uses staking technology to enhance a regular &#8220;dumb&#8221; token into something that rewards users.</p>
<p>All these projects utilize blockchain technology in different ways to provide utility and a solution to a real-world issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Diversification</strong></h3>
<p>As we mentioned, there is a massive variety of different altcoins available and as such, they can make for an excellent diversification tool. With altcoins spanning every sector within cryptocurrency, regardless of how a portfolio is composed, there will be an altcoin able to reduce an investor&#8217;s exposure to a specific sector, effectively reducing risk.</p>
<h3><strong>Room for Growth</strong></h3>
<p>While Bitcoin is regarded as being a safer, blue-chip crypto, its larger size means it&#8217;s more difficult for the price to move substantially in either direction. However, altcoins will have lower market caps, meaning that less demand is required for them to be pushed upward or downward.</p>
<p>Meme coins can often show explosive growth, but investors have to be careful about which projects they choose. Not only do some meme coins have a very short shelf life, but many are also outright scams.</p>
<p>As such, altcoins can make for excellent growth vehicles, provided the proper due diligence is done prior to investing.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Altcoins to Buy</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With there being so many different altcoins on the market, an investor needs to narrow down their search criteria to find worthwhile projects. Sometimes you need more than just the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">best crypto signals</a> to know which crypto project is worth investing in. We&#8217;ll be sharing a few quick tips to help find the best altcoins to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Whitepaper &#8211; </strong>One of the most effective techniques to weed out lackluster projects is thoroughly reviewing a project&#8217;s whitepaper. The best altcoins to buy will always feature a well-written whitepaper that clearly explains exactly what the project does as well well as its plans for the future. If a cryptocurrency makes a lot of promises without explaining how they will be achieved, it&#8217;s best avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media &#8211; </strong>Taking a look at social media can be a great way to determine how investors feel about a project and whether it has a strong community. While stats like followers can be easily purchased online, it&#8217;s much harder to fake an active community consistently commenting and sharing so these are both factors to look out for when trying to find the best altcoins for 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Utility &#8211; </strong>While it&#8217;s possible for some projects to perform well and offer great returns through hype alone, it&#8217;ll never be conducive to long-term growth. Instead, it&#8217;s better to look out for utility-focused projects that provide a useful service or product. These altcoins will always have a demand regardless of hype or the market, making them far safer long-term investments.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Buy the Best Altcoin &#8211; Bitcoin Minetrix</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure that no investor is left unable to buy the best altcoin, we&#8217;ve detailed exactly how to buy $BTCMTX tokens below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create Crypto Wallet &#8211; </strong>Before accessing the $BTCMTX presale, investors can download a cryptocurrency wallet such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect.</li>
<li><strong>Buy ETH or USDT &#8211; </strong>An ERC-20 token, $BTCMTX, can be swapped with similar assets such as ETH or USDT. Purchase Ethereum or USDT from a suitable crypto exchange and transfer the assets to the crypto wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Connect Wallet and Buy $BTCMTX &#8211; </strong>Visit the Bitcoin Minetrix website and click on ‘Connect Wallet’. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. Enter the amount to swap and confirm the purchase. Once your tokens are purchased, they will automatically be locked on the smart contract.</li>

<h2>The Best Crypto Hardware Wallets Reviews</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Here&rsquo;s how our top picks for best hardware wallets compare.
</p>
<h3>1. Ledger Nano X &#8211; Bluetooth-Enabled Hardware Wallet With Open-Source Software</h3>
<p>
Building on the success of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/en" rel="sponsored">Ledger</a> Nano S and S Plus, the Ledger Nano X updates the iconic design of Ledger wallets and brings Bluetooth connectivity for crypto management without wires. Connect to your phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop to do your crypto thing at home or on the go. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015216913-Frequently-asked-questions" rel="sponsored">Bluetooth connectivity for desktops is in the works</a> and should become available with a future firmware update.</p>
<p>Ledger was the first hardware wallet maker to include a Secure Element chip in its devices. Designed to protect against known attacks and make the device tamper-resistant, this chip safely stores sensitive data. Ledger hardware wallets use the Secure Element to generate and store the private keys that control the assets in your wallet.</p>
<p>About the size and shape of a USB thumb drive, the Ledger Nano X is easy to carry. And with battery power and Bluetooth, it&rsquo;s designed to go anywhere your crypto journey takes you. The wallet pairs with the Ledger Live mobile or desktop application. Send and receive crypto to your hardware wallet using the Ledger Live App.</p>
<p>Where the Ledger Nano X and most other mobile-friendly wallets disappoint is in their ability to connect to third-party wallet apps. If you want to connect to MetaMask&rsquo;s mobile app, for example, there&rsquo;s currently no way to do so. The companies are working together to build support for <a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-metamask-strengthen-partnership-ledger-nano-x-soon-compatible-with-metamask-mobile-app" rel="sponsored">Ledger Bluetooth-enabled devices paired with MetaMask</a>. In the interim, Ledger Live provides access to an assortment of built-in dApps, and MetaMask offers Ledger wallet support for its desktop browser extension.</p>

<p>Upmarket from the Ledger Nano X is the still-in-production Ledger Stax, which raises the bar higher with its innovative E-Ink touchscreen, Bluetooth, and roomy user interface. At press time, the Stax is available for preorder.</p>
<p>Ledger&rsquo;s Nano X remains the flagship model for now and a top choice for the company&rsquo;s over 5 million customers.

<h3>2. Trezor Model T &#8211; Touchscreen Bitcoin Hardware Wallet With Support for Multiple Blockchains</h3>
<div>In 2014, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en" rel="sponsored">Trezor</a> made the world&rsquo;s first hardware crypto wallet. Since that innovation, dozens of competing wallets have emerged. Yet, Trezor remains one of the most trusted wallets available today. Much of that trust centers around transparency. Trezor makes the entire device code open-source. Anyone can read the source code for both the firmware that powers the device itself as well as the software suite used to set up the device and explore the ecosystem.</div>
<div></div>
<div><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="466" class="aligncenter wp-image-121244" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-1024x466.png" alt="trezor model t crypto wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-1024x466.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-300x136.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-768x349.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t-1536x699.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339276-trezor-model-t.png 1565w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>The Trezor Model T is the company&rsquo;s flagship product, boasting a 240&#215;240 touchscreen display combined with a slim, portable design. The device measures just under 2.5 inches tall and slightly over 1 inch wide. While the Model T and its slightly smaller Model One, which we&rsquo;ll cover in just a bit, are easy to travel with, they aren&rsquo;t designed to connect with mobile devices. This Trezor hardware wallet connects to a laptop or desktop.</p>
<p>With support for 1470+ tokens and coins, the Trezor Model T won&rsquo;t recognize as many tokens natively as Ledger devices. However, you can still store ERC-20 tokens that aren&rsquo;t specifically listed as supported. With new tokens launching daily, this issue is common to most wallets. As a workaround, you can view your Ethereum and Layer 2 portfolio using a frequently updated portfolio app, such as Debank, Zapper, or Zerion.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trezor.io/6-features-that-make-trezor-the-1-hardware-wallet-5e3bcbdb2c31" rel="sponsored">Trezor reports support for over 8,000 coins and tokens</a> using the Trezor Suite and (unnamed) third-party tools.</p>
<p>One standout feature of Trezor wallets is easy access to hidden wallets. You can build a standard wallet, keeping a small amount of crypto available while also keeping a hidden stash protected by a password. Build your hidden wallet using Trezor Suite, the open-source app that accompanies Trezor devices, allowing easy updates or even installation of custom firmware.</p>

<h3>3. Ledger Nano S Plus &#8211; Budget-Friendly Hardware Wallet With a Secure Element Chip</h3>
<p>
As a lower-cost alternative to the Ledger Nano X, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/en" rel="sponsored">Ledger Nano S Plus</a> combines much of the same functionality and a familiar design language with a budget-friendly price tag. At $79, the Nano S Plus comes in $70 lower than the Nano X.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing versus the Nano X:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth connectivity</li>
<li>Battery-powered portability</li>
<li>Slightly larger screen on the Nano X</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Nano S Plus gets its power from a supplied USB-A to USB-C cable. Optionally, you can connect with a USB-C to USB-C cable, allowing you to use your Nano S with USB-C-enabled mobile devices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="560" height="689" class="aligncenter wp-image-121249" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus.png" alt="ledger nano s plus" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus.png 560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698339849-ledger-nano-s-plus-244x300.png 244w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p>Like the slightly larger X, the S Plus supports up to 100 installed applications as well as 5,000 coins and tokens. Both devices share a similar design, diverging mainly on screen size and button placement. While the Nano X is sleeker in appearance, the Nano S Plus borrows from the legacy of the legendary Nano S, giving you a sturdy yet powerful device that can survive many of life&rsquo;s mishaps.</p>
<p>While more affordable, the Nano S Plus doesn&rsquo;t feel like a budget device. When compared to other popular lower-cost devices like the Trezor Model One, the S Plus is a smidgen heavier, but by no means heavy, and doesn&rsquo;t exhibit any unexpected creaks or rattles.</p>
<p>The Nano S Plus also features the Secure Element chip found in all of Ledger&rsquo;s lineup. The chip offers a tamper-resistant storage solution for your wallet&rsquo;s private keys.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t need Bluetooth connectivity or battery-powered portability, the Nano S Plus provides a no-compromise solution with a lower price tag than the upmarket X.

<h3>4. Trezor Model One &#8211; Low-Cost Open-Source Hardware Wallet With a Proven History</h3>
<p>
No hardware wallet is more iconic than the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en" rel="sponsored">Trezor</a> Model One. Dating back to 2014, the Model One was the first crypto hardware wallet ever made, and it&rsquo;s still a leading choice as a Bitcoin hardware wallet or multi-chain hardware crypto wallet for many in the crypto community.</p>
<p>There are no finicky touchscreens or wireless Bluetooth connection options. Instead, you get a battle-tested two-button hardware wallet that&rsquo;s reliable and affordable.</p>
<p>As evidence of the Model One&rsquo;s heritage, the device connects via a Micro USB cable. This legacy cable type is prone to wear, but you can use any data-enabled Micro USB cable with the wallet. Two pleasantly clicky buttons under a smallish but clear display allow you to navigate through transactions easily.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="493" class="aligncenter wp-image-121256" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-1024x493.png" alt="trezor model one" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-1024x493.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-768x370.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698341149-trezor-model-one.png 1226w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Like the Model T, everything about the Model One is transparent. The device is powered by open-source firmware, which you can wipe, which resets the device, or replace entirely. The device pairs with the open-source Trezor Suite, which enables setup and offers simple exchange or peer-to-peer trading.</p>
<p>Token support on the Model One is about a third lower than you&rsquo;ll find on the Model T. Of note, Ripple (XRP) is not supported, but Model T devices with firmware version 2.08 or higher support the in-demand cryptocurrency. Similarly, Cardano (ADA) is not supported on the Model One but is supported on the Model T and the new Trezor Safe 3.</p>
<p>However, you&rsquo;ll find support for widely traded cryptos like BTC and ETH, as well as ERC-20 tokens and NFTs
</p>
<h4>What Are ERC-20 Tokens?</h4>
<p>
The crypto economy is made up of both coins and tokens.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Coins are the cryptocurrency specific to their own block chain. For example, Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin blockchain.</li>
<li>Tokens are crypto assets used on other blockchains. For example, WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin used on the Ethereum blockchain as well as several other blockchains. But there is no Wrapped Bitcoin blockchain. WBTC only exists on other blockchains.</li>
</ul>
<p>
ERC-20 refers to a way to standardize tokens used on the Ethereum blockchain and other compatible blockchains. Many of the crypto assets you see traded on exchanges are actually tokens rather than coins, and many of these follow the ERC-20 token standard. In practical application, the ERC-20 standard means that each ERC-20 of the same type is the same as the next, much like each Bitcoin is the same as the next or each dollar is the same as the next dollar.</p>
<p>Expect a lengthy initial setup process on any Trezor device. However, each step leaves newer users with a better understanding of how crypto wallets work and how Trezor&rsquo;s features help keep your crypto secure.

<h3>5. Tangem &#8211; Slim, Credit-Card-Sized Hardware Wallet With NFC Support for Mobile Devices</h3>
<p>
If you can make room in your wallet for one more credit-card-sized item, you can carry a secure crypto hardware wallet with you wherever you go. That&rsquo;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tangem/en" rel="sponsored">Tangem</a>, a card-like crypto wallet powered by (near-field communication) NFC technology and designed to work with mobile devices.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used tap to pay, you&rsquo;ve used NFC.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" class="aligncenter wp-image-121277" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-1024x678.png" alt="tangem hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-1024x678.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-300x199.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet-768x509.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342000-tangem-hardware-wallet.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Tangem, a Swiss-based company, launched the Tangem wallet in 2018 with the goal of making affordable, secure crypto storage available to everyone. The simple setup process takes just a few minutes, and the wallet costs less than $55 for a 2-card set.</p>
<p>Most crypto wallets use a seed phrase, a human-readable version of the wallet&rsquo;s private key that lets you send or spend your crypto. Typically, these seed phrases are 12 or 24 words long and often difficult to remember. Tangem sidesteps this newbie-unfriendly aspect of crypto storage by doing away with the seed phrase. Instead, you can back up your wallet to a second Tangem wallet card, which is then protected by an access code.</p>
<p>While Tangem wallets are designed to be used without a seed phrase, the <a href="https://tangem.com/en/blog/post/new-tangem-wallet/" rel="sponsored">newest (version 2.0) cards support a seed-phrase option</a> using the companion mobile app.</p>
<p>The wallet really does resemble a credit card and uses an embedded NFC chip to communicate with a partner app installed on your NFC-enabled smartphone. Not all smartphones support NFC, so double-check compatibility before you make a purchase.</p>
<p>The brains of the operation are found in a 1 x 1 mm Samsung chip held inside the card itself. No batteries are needed, and the wallet is resistant to dust, water, X-rays, and even electromagnetic pulses.

<h3>6. Ellipal Titan &#8211; Air-Gapped Crypto Hardware Wallet With a Large Touchscreen</h3>
<p>
If credit-card-sized wallets are a bit too small for your tastes, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ellipal/en" rel="sponsored">Ellipal Titan</a> may be a better fit. As the name suggests, it&rsquo;s big, nearly 6 inches tall and over 4 inches wide. The Titan&rsquo;s larger dimensions translate to more real estate for the device&rsquo;s responsive touchscreen display.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="493" class="aligncenter wp-image-121279" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-1024x493.png" alt="ellipal titan crypto wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-1024x493.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-768x370.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342348-ellipal-titan.png 1138w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Ellipal&rsquo;s Titan supports over 10,000 cryptocurrencies and is completely air-gapped. There&rsquo;s no Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC, USB, or any other way for the wallet&rsquo;s private keys to come anywhere near the internet. Instead, the Ellipal Titan uses QR codes to share information with the Ellipal mobile app. The wallet itself also has a camera to scan QR codes from the mobile app.</p>
<p>You can also send crypto to your Ellipal cryptocurrency hardware wallet from a crypto exchange like Coinbase. Using the Coinbase app, snap a pic of the QR code for your crypto wallet address shown on the Ellipal device. Coinbase and similar apps convert the QR code to an address, ensuring the crypto goes to the right address without the risk of typos.

<h3>7. NGRAVE ZERO &#8211; Air-Gapped Crypto Hardware Wallet With Military-Grade Construction</h3>
<p>
Similar to the Ellipal Titan, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ngrave/en" rel="sponsored">NGRAVE ZERO</a> is a completely air-gapped wallet. That means the wallet cannot connect to the internet at all. There&rsquo;s no WiFi, NFC, USB, or Bluetooth support. Also like the Ellipal, the NGRAVE communicates via QR codes and cameras. The device uses these QR codes to communicate with the LIQUID companion app.</p>
<p>The internet-enabled mobile app is where you can view your balances. The ZERO device itself is used for signing transactions using its 480&#215;800 pixel touchscreen display.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="693" class="aligncenter wp-image-121285" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-1024x693.png" alt="ngrave zero hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-1024x693.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-300x203.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero-768x519.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698342903-ngrave-zero.png 1075w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Security is job one with the NGRAVE. The ZERO comes with an EAL7 security-certified OS, the highest security certification available, and a first within the crypto hardware wallet space. The hardware wallet also features a fingerprint reader to help ensure secure access.
</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>What Are EAL Certifications?</h4>
<p>Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) ratings offer a way to compare the security of a product and use a scale from EAL1 to EAL7.</p>
<p>Crypto wallet hardware devices with a Secure Element chip often earn an EAL5 rating or higher. EAL ratings can also apply to operating systems as well, as shown with the NGRAVE ZERO&rsquo;s EAL7-certified operating system.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Private key generation on the NGRAVE uses a clever combination of techniques to aid randomness. A combination of a random number algorithm, your fingerprint, and the ambient light in the room all play a role when the ZERO creates your unique private key. These variable elements make reverse engineering of the private key improbable.</p>
<p>Although the ZERO is a pricier option at nearly $400, the investment may be worthwhile for those with more to protect.
</p>
<div>
<h4>NGRAVE ZERO Pros and Cons</h4>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Randomized private key</li>

<h3>8. Safepal S1 Pro &#8211; Budget-Friendly Air-Gapped Hardware Wallet With a Secure Element Chip</h3>
<p>
You could spend hundreds on an air-gapped crypto hardware wallet, but <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/safepal/en" rel="sponsored">Safepal</a> delivers air-gapped security for under $100 with two models: the S1 and the S1 Pro. The Pro offers longer battery life combined with a more durable housing made with aluminum alloy and tempered glass. If you&rsquo;re making an investment in your long-term crypto security, the $90 S1 Pro may be a better value compared to the $50 Safepal S1.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="410" class="aligncenter wp-image-121288" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-1024x410.png" alt="safepal s1 cold wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-1024x410.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1-768x307.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343516-safepal-s1.png 1094w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Otherwise, the devices deliver the same specs. Both come with a 1.3-inch color screen paired with a d-pad for navigation. Both devices are also air-gapped, meaning they can&rsquo;t connect to the internet, and come with EAL5+ certified Secure Element chips.</p>
<p>Choose your level of security on demand with a choice of 12, 18, or 24 mnemonic seed phrases for your private key. Longer phrases are more secure. Shorter phrases may be easier to memorize. Then, secure your device with a PIN.</p>
<p>Like other air-gapped wallets, the Safepal communicates with a mobile app via QR codes.

<h3>9. KeepKey &#8211; Affordable Hardware Wallet With Support for 7,000+ Cryptos and ShapeShift Integration</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/keepkey/en" rel="sponsored">KeepKey</a> app and wallet experience is reminiscent of using a Ledger wallet with the Ledger Live app. Both offer polished user experiences and high-quality devices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="414" class="aligncenter wp-image-121291" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-1024x414.png" alt="keepkey wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-1024x414.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-300x121.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet-768x311.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698343931-keepkey-wallet.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There are two key differences, however. KeepKey does not support Bluetooth, a leading feature of the Ledger Nano X. Additionally, the KeepKey app features <a href="https://shapeshift.com/" rel="sponsored">ShapeShift</a>, a leading multichain trading platform. <a href="https://www.keepkey.com/faqs" rel="sponsored">KeepKey is currently owned by former ShapeShift team members</a> and contributes to the ShapeShift DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). You can also connect your KeepKey directly to the ShapeShift app.</p>
<p>KeepKey crypto wallets make setup easy, although the app itself is packed with features, including dApp integration. This lets you explore the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) from a trusted starting point.</p>
<p>Like Trezor devices, covered earlier, KeepKey uses open-source firmware. This brings the advantage of numbers. More people can view the code, making it possible to catch possible security concerns.

<h2>What is a Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
A crypto hardware wallet, also called a cold wallet, is a device that generates and stores the private keys for a crypto wallet offline. Some hardware wallets resemble a USB thumb drive, while others might be a touch screen device similar to a cell phone. A third type of wallet looks like a bank card and even contains an NFC chip that allows the wallet to communicate with a mobile app on an NFC-enabled smartphone.
</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>How Crypto Wallets Work</h4>
<p>A crypto wallet is a convenient way to describe what&rsquo;s going on under the hood. We think of a wallet as a place to store money. That&rsquo;s almost accurate. Instead, a wallet secures the assets held at an address, a digital location on the blockchain that can hold crypto assets. With the right key, anyone can control the assets at that address. That&rsquo;s where a crypto wallet comes into the picture. The wallet holds the private keys that can control the crypto at that address or sign transactions related to that address.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin private key:</strong> L28FTDMPFVNrykyaWXDjRRH5u8eaTACKq63ApsZ6XWZB3g2m8AFE</li>
</ul>
<p>The private key above was generated using an online app. Hence, this Bitcoin wallet should be considered insecure. Does the online app store all the keys it generates? Are the browser and its extensions secure? Is the computer itself compromised?</p>
<p>If someone else has the same keys, you can both control the assets, a situation that could lead to the irrevocable loss of your crypto assets.</p>
<p>When you use an exchange to hold your crypto, the exchange controls the keys. Many exchanges provide you with a public address so you can send crypto to your account. However, you don&rsquo;t have access to the private keys at all. You just have the exchange login credentials in most cases. The collapse of the FTX exchange is just one recent example of the risks involved with trusting someone else with your keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>
We&rsquo;ll discuss the importance of protecting private keys in more detail shortly, but a hardware wallet creates an additional layer of security by authorizing transactions on a device that you physically control. This reduces the risk of loss due to compromised private keys &mdash; or the seed phrase used to generate those keys. More on that in a bit.
</p>
<h2>How do Hardware Wallets Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Hardware wallets can be used to authorize crypto transactions by approving or declining the transaction from an offline device. The process works similarly to two-factor authentication (2FA), in which you use a device you control to authenticate a login to a bank account, for example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re using MetaMask as your Ethereum wallet. MetaMask generates a seed phrase, a people-friendly way of encoding the private keys. Typically, seed phrases are 12-24 words long. MetaMask, however, is a hot wallet. The private keys are generated on an online device and stored on that same device used for online activities.</p>
<p>The keys from hot wallets can become compromised in a number of ways, ranging from software exploits to keyloggers that record your keystrokes. The wallet addresses generated by MetaMask are less secure compared to hardware wallet addresses because the private keys can be more easily compromised with hot wallets.</p>
<p>But MetaMask also supports popular hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. You can generate private keys offline using your hardware wallet and then import the public addresses from your hardware wallet to MetaMask. This lets you use MetaMask to see your assets and connect to decentralized applications (dApps) like Uniswap.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" class="aligncenter wp-image-121294" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-1024x531.png" alt="metamask connect to hardware wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698344662-metamask-connect-to-hardware-wallet.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>However, if you need to authorize a transaction for the hard wallet addresses, you&rsquo;ll need to connect your hardware wallet to accept or decline. MetaMask asks the device for authorization but never has access to the private keys in your hardware wallet.</p>
<p>If there is no input from the hardware wallet, the transaction can&rsquo;t be authorized, and your crypto remains in your wallet.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of security, much like when your bank sends you an email or text to be sure it&rsquo;s really you logging into your account.
</p>
<h3>Wired or Wireless Connections</h3>
<p>
Many hardware wallets use a USB connection to connect to your computer and accept or decline transactions. Newer models may use Bluetooth, which allows support for mobile use, or even an NFC chip that can connect to an NFC-enabled mobile device.</p>
<p>Regardless of which connection type a hardware wallet uses, there&rsquo;s still an additional layer that requires input from a separate device you physically hold.
</p>
<h2>Advantages of Hardware Crypto Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
The advantages of hardware wallets compared to software wallets or exchange wallets center on security. You may have to sacrifice some convenience, but the goal is to protect your crypto. By keeping some or all of your crypto in a hardware wallet, you greatly reduce the risk of losses.</p>
<p>Hot wallets like MetaMask, Electrum, or Trust Wallet make crypto transactions more convenient. However, all hot wallets bring similar risks because the private keys are generated and stored on a device connected to the internet. Someone on the other side of the world can drain the wallet if they gain access to private keys (or the seed phrase).</p>
<p>By contrast, a hardware wallet forces the transaction to be approved or declined on a device you hold.</p>
<p>Hardware crypto wallets also allow you to split your stack for safety. Similar to traveling with pocket money while the rest of your money is safe in the bank, you can keep some crypto available in a convenient hot wallet while using your hardware wallet to safeguard the bulk of your holdings.
</p>
<h3>Using a Hardware Wallet to Move Your Crypto Off Exchanges</h3>
<p>
You don&rsquo;t need to be active in the crypto ecosystem to benefit from a hardware wallet. One of the most common reasons to choose a hardware wallet is for the secure storage of cryptocurrencies you&#8217;re holding as an investment.</p>
<p>As a beginning investor, you might choose to keep your crypto on the exchange where you trade. Exchange wallets are called custodial wallets because the exchange has custody of your crypto. It&rsquo;s convenient. And when your balances on the exchange are lower, your financial exposure is also lower.</p>
<p>As your balances grow, however, you&rsquo;re at risk of losing much more. Using a self-custody crypto hardware wallet can protect you against exchange-related risks.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your exchange login can be compromised.</strong> About a third of us use password managers that offer a way to create unique passwords for each website. Others may be re-using passwords or using insecure passwords. However, even a password manager can create risk, as the app itself or an online vault can be a target for exploits. LastPass, a popular password manager, has suffered <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/" rel="sponsored">more than one breach</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The exchange might freeze withdrawals.</strong> The collapse of crypto platforms like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bankrupt-crypto-lender-voyager-digital-predicts-35-customer-payout-2023-05-17/" rel="sponsored">Voyager</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/crypto-lender-celsius-sends-bankruptcy-plan-creditor-vote-2023-08-14/" rel="sponsored">Celsius</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/business/ftx-bankruptcy.html" rel="sponsored">FTX</a> &mdash; all of which declared bankruptcy &mdash; are examples of why it may be wiser to move your crypto off exchanges. Once you move some or all of your crypto to a hardware wallet, any insolvency issues pose less risk to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you need to keep a certain amount of crypto on the exchange for trading purposes, consider moving the rest to a hardware crypto wallet for safekeeping.
</p>
<h2>Hardware Wallets vs Software Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Moving your crypto to a wallet you control is often the best move, but is a software wallet just as good a choice? Probably not.</p>
<p>A software wallet like MetaMask (Ethereum) or Electrum (Bitcoin) generates and stores the private keys on an internet-connected device. The private keys used to authorize transactions are on your device at all times. If multinational companies like Microsoft and Oracle have <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-215a" rel="sponsored">security vulnerabilities</a> in their applications, hot wallets developed by smaller teams may be at risk as well.</p>
<p>Conversely, hardware wallets store your private keys on a separate device not connected to the internet. Even when temporarily connected to a computer or mobile device, the hardware wallet&rsquo;s firmware limits interaction with your wallet to accepting or declining a transaction by clicking a button or taking a similar action on the device in your possession.</p>
<p>Both types of wallets share some similar risks, however. Specifically, safeguarding the wallet&rsquo;s seed phrase or private key is tantamount, but sometimes, they get out into the wild.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="478" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-121297" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase.png" alt="metamask recovery phrase" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase.png 478w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345515-metamask-recovery-phrase-221x300.png 221w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone else has this seed phrase, also called a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase, they can create a duplicate of your wallet (and its keys) and send your crypto to another wallet you can&rsquo;t access. Any compatible software wallet can be used to access a crypto wallet created by a hardware device if someone has the seed phase.</p>
<p>The seed phrase and private key look different, but either can be used to make a carbon copy of your wallet. They&rsquo;re really just two ways of expressing the same value.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="434" height="592" class="aligncenter wp-image-121298" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key.png" alt="metamask private key" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key.png 434w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698345667-metamask-private-key-220x300.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /></p>
<p>This concern applies to both hot and cold wallets because they both use seed phrases and private keys. Choose a secure way to store your seed phrase so you can recreate your wallet if needed while preventing someone else from making a copy of your wallet elsewhere.</p>
<p>Generally, avoid storing your seed phrase in cloud storage or leaving it somewhere where others can find it.
</p>
<h2>How to Choose a Hardware Cryptocurrency Wallet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Which cryptocurrency hardware wallet is right for your needs depends on your risk profile and how you think you&rsquo;ll use your wallet. Cost, transparency, security features, and even mobile support can all play a role in your purchase decision.
</p>
<h3>Security Features</h3>
<p>
Consider how you&rsquo;ll use the wallet and which security features are most important to you.</p>
<p>Often, there&rsquo;s a trade-off between security and convenience. The most secure wallets are air-gapped, meaning they can&rsquo;t connect to the internet in any way. Instead, they typically use QR codes. You scan the QR code in an app or on the device itself and then approve or deny the transaction on the device. This may require more steps to complete transactions compared to a device that connects via Bluetooth or USB.</p>
<p>Also, consider security features like a Secure Element chip. But weigh the benefits against the trade-offs for this as well. For example, Ledger states it <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/11132311094813-Ledger-s-open-source-roadmap" rel="sponsored">can&rsquo;t fully open-source its firmware due to the Secure Element chip</a>. Trezor, by contrast, does not use a Secure Element chip on the Model T or Model One and provides full transparency with open-source firmware for these devices.
</p>
<h3>Supported Coins and Blockchains</h3>
<p>
Many popular wallets support multiple blockchains. However, some wallets only support one blockchain, most commonly seen with Bitcoin-only wallets. Choose the best crypto hardware wallet for your overall needs while weighing which assets you think you&rsquo;ll need to store. For example, if you&rsquo;re considering a Trezor but need to store XRP, you&rsquo;ll need to jump up to a Model T. Trezor&rsquo;s Model One doesn&rsquo;t support XRP.</p>
<p>Most multi-chain wallets support the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks at a minimum. Ethereum Layer 2 support may be limited, however. You may not see assets you hold on the Abitrum Layer 2 blockchain, for example, even though they are in your wallet. If needed, you can use a portfolio app like Debank or a blockchain explorer like <a href="https://etherscan.io/" rel="sponsored">Etherscan</a> (for Ethereum) or <a href="https://arbiscan.io/" rel="sponsored">Arbiscan</a> (for Arbitrum) to verify transactions or tokens that don&rsquo;t show in your hardware or software wallet.
</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>
Software wallets are typically free to use. By comparison, you can expect to pay $50 to well over $200 for a hardware wallet, depending on which model you choose.</p>
<p>Cost is a consideration, but paying a lot doesn&rsquo;t always translate to more secure storage. Plenty of people store large amounts of crypto on inexpensive yet reliable and well-supported devices like the Trezor Model One.</p>
<p>Also, it might not make sense to spend hundreds of dollars to protect a smaller amount of crypto. If you choose a less expensive device to start, you can always upgrade when you have more to protect.
</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>
The top hardware wallets generally don&rsquo;t charge an additional fee to use the wallet after you&rsquo;ve purchased it. However, many wallets enable crypto swaps or purchases from within the wallet&rsquo;s software app. In this case, you may encounter fees or other costs.</p>
<p>There are several ways to trade crypto, ranging from centralized crypto exchanges to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">decentralized exchanges</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm">peer-to-peer exchanges</a>. Ledger Live, for example, offers ways to buy crypto from within Ledger&rsquo;s wallet software suite. Transaction fees vary depending on the provider you choose within the app.</p>
<p>In most cases, buying on an exchange will be less expensive compared to using your wallet&rsquo;s app. But you may prefer to buy through your wallet app. If so, compare buying fees before choosing the best crypto hardware wallet for your use case.
</p>
<h3>Mobile Experience</h3>
<p>
Not too long ago, mobile and hardware wallets didn&rsquo;t belong in the same sentence. Most cold wallets worked via a USB cable plugged into a computer. However, with Bluetooth connectivity available on some hardware wallets or even NFC support, as seen with the Tangem, crypto hardware wallets can go wherever you go.</p>
<p>Some models, like Ledger wallets, can connect to Android phones via an optional OTG cable that uses the USB-C port on your phone.</p>
<p>If you think you might need to use your hardware wallet on the go, consider models that work with a cell phone or tablet. Check the App Store or Play Store reviews for the mobile app that accompanies the wallet you&rsquo;re considering. Ledger Live scores well here with a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ledger.live&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1" rel="sponsored">4.8 out of 5-star rating</a> on Google Play Store.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may also be able to use the mobile wallet app as an on-the-go portfolio to track your investments.
</p>
<h3>Open-Source or Closed-Source Software and Firmware</h3>
<p>
Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was open-source, meaning the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" rel="sponsored">Bitcoin Core code was and is available online</a>. The alternative would be closed source, in which we don&rsquo;t know what the software really does, what security flaws it may have, or if it phones home with sensitive transaction details. Many in the crypto community insist on open-source software for crypto wallets.</p>
<p>Crypto hardware wallets use two sets of code:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wallet firmware:</strong> You can think of firmware as software that lives on the hardware wallet device itself. Trezor, for example, makes the <a href="https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware" rel="sponsored">Trezor firmware available to view</a>. If so inclined, you could even modify the firmware and run a customized device. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/11132311094813-Ledger-s-open-source-roadmap" rel="sponsored">Ledger is taking steps to open-source its firmware</a> following a crypto-community kerfuffle over <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/24/ledgers-pr-struggle-reveals-uncomfortable-trade-offs-for-crypto-storage/" rel="sponsored">Ledger&rsquo;s planned private key backup service</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Wallet software:</strong> The software suite is an important tool to interact with the wallet device, particularly during device setup and updates. The wallet software talks to the wallet&rsquo;s firmware but often also brings other features, like charting, swaps, or the ability to connect with other apps. Both <a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live" rel="sponsored">Ledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite" rel="sponsored">Trezor</a> open-source their software suites.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The big advantage of open-source software and firmware is transparency, but security can also benefit from open-source code. An army of coders around the world poring over the code may be more likely to identify a potential issue than a smaller development team.</p>
<p>Lastly, open-source code for firmware gives the community a way to keep older devices active even after the manufacturer ends support. If Trezor ends firmware support for the tried-and-true Model One at some point in the future, the community can fork the code and make updates as needed.
</p>
<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
<p>
Top hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor balance security with ease of use. Both wallets offer beginner-friendly software suites that make maintenance like firmware updates a breeze. By comparison, Ellipal requires you to update the device using an SD card (not included).
</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>
The Ledger Nano series of crypto wallets were tough to break. The same is true of the Trezor Model One. Newer devices with large touch screens, like the Ellipal Titan or Ledger Stax, are akin to a small smartphone and may not survive accidental drops on a tile floor well. Consider your use case and where you&rsquo;ll use your device before making a choice.
</p>
<h3>Your Risk Profile</h3>
<p>
The best crypto hardware wallets can help protect any amount of crypto, large or small, but for smaller amounts of crypto, it may be more prudent to let your balance grow before buying the latest crypto wallet gizmo. For some, a hardware wallet is a must-have piece of gear. Others may be well-served with a software wallet as a starting point.
</p>
<h2>Limitations of Hardware Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Using a hardware wallet is an important security measure, but it creates some extra steps, and there are still some risks. Using software wallets alone is much easier, and you aren&rsquo;t tied to a physical device that&rsquo;s probably safely stored at home. However, software wallets are also less secure.</p>
<p>Pairing a software wallet with a hardware wallet makes sense in many situations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to weigh some considerations before making a choice.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Form factor: Roughly the size of a thumb drive, Ledger Nano wallets are easily pocketable. Credit-card-sized Tangem wallets might be even easier to carry around. But devices like Ellipal or Ledger Stax might have a touchscreen as large as 4 inches, making them portable &ndash; but not always convenient to carry.</li>
<li>Wear and breakage: The internal batteries in hard wallet devices can fail, just like those in your phone or tablet. These batteries may not be replaceable. Simpler devices like the Trezor Model One don&rsquo;t use a battery, instead powering on when connected via USB. But that&rsquo;s also a consideration. The connector (micro USB in the case of the Model One) could fail. Or, the buttons might stop working. The screen could break. In short, there&rsquo;s a useful lifetime for hardware wallets, after which you&rsquo;ll likely have to replace the device. Software wallets don&rsquo;t suffer the same issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even the best crypto hardware wallets won&rsquo;t make you 100% secure. You&rsquo;ll still need to take steps on your own to secure the seed phrase. It&rsquo;s also wise to conceal the hardware wallet itself. You may not want visitors or the occasional home repair worker to see your Bitcoin hardware wallet lying around.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
The field of options continues to grow, making choosing the best crypto hardware wallets a bit more challenging. For most crypto investors and traders, well-established brands may still make the best choices. Wallet makers like Ledger and Trezor led the market and still make some of the most compelling products. We were particularly impressed with the Ledger Nano X due to its sturdy construction, convenient size, security features, and wireless connectivity option. As a lower-cost alternative, the Ledger Nano S Plus offers many of the same features, less Bluetooth support. Ledger offers a well-built and well-priced solution for most common uses.

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3>What is a hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>
A hardware wallet is a type of crypto wallet that generates and stores the wallet&rsquo;s private keys on a device that&rsquo;s not connected to the internet.
</p>
<h3>Are hardware crypto wallets safe?</h3>
<p>
Hardware crypto wallets offer a safer alternative to software wallets because they store the wallet&rsquo;s private keys offline. Many hardware wallets also use a Secure Element chip, a specialized chip designed to be tamper-resistant and safely store sensitive information.
</p>
<h3>What is the most secure crypto hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>
Air-gapped wallets that cannot connect to the internet in any way &mdash; instead using QR codes to communicate with an external app &mdash; offer the most security.
</p>
<h3>Should I put my crypto in a hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>
Storing your crypto in a hardware wallet is the safest option to protect against compromised exchange logins, exchange hacks, or exchange insolvency.
</p>
<h3>Does my crypto still grow in a hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>
The value of the crypto in your wallet tracks the value of the same cryptocurrency traded on exchanges.
</p>
<h3>Are hardware wallets worth it?</h3>
<p>
Software wallets may offer enough security for smaller balances, but as your balances grow, a hardware wallet becomes a worthwhile investment due to its increased security.
</p>
<h3>Can you put any crypto on a hardware wallet?</h3>
<p>
Many of the best crypto hardware wallets support up to 10,000 cryptocurrencies, but you need to be sure your wallet supports the cryptocurrency you want to store and choose the correct wallet address before transferring crypto to your wallet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you on the fence about giving Ignition Casino a shot? Are you wondering if this up-and-coming casino meets your requirements? This is where our Ignition Casino review comes in.</p>
<p>Here, we cover everything from welcome bonuses, promo codes and interesting offers, to the game types and payment methods. Read on to find out if this is your new gambling home.</p>
<h2><b>What Is Ignition Casino?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ignition/en">Ignition Casino</a> has been around since 2016. It is a crypto-oriented casino that does accept fiat as well, but offers more perks for crypto users. Although it offers all major casino game types, as well as virtual sports betting, its focus is on poker.</p>
<p>If you’re a poker fan with a preference for ether (ETH) as a payment method (which is also accepted at Ignition Casino), here are some more <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ethereum-poker-sites.htm">best Ethereum poker sites this year</a>.</p>
<p>For their users, Ignition Casino offers both a welcome bonus which is higher for crypto deposits, and ongoing promotions to reward their loyalty. There are also constant poker tournaments and special events. The sportsbook only offers virtual sports, which may be disappointing for sports fans.</p>
<p>Deposits and withdrawals are fast and do not incur fees. The casino is also quite easy to use. Read more about the casino’s details in the rest of our review.</p>

<h2><b>Ignition Casino Bonuses &amp; Promos</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ignition Casino offers several different types of bonuses. Some of them, like the Ignition Casino welcome bonus, can only be claimed by users who are new to the casino. Others are available to everyone. Let’s take a closer look at them.</p>
<h3><b>Ignition Casino Welcome Bonus Offers</b></h3>
<p>The total amount that you can get at Ignition Casino varies depending on your payment method.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the fiat option, worth up to $2,000.</p>
<p>This welcome bonus is divided into a casino bonus worth up to $1,000 that is credited immediately, and another $1,000 poker bonus that is unlocked by playing poker over the course of a month. Both of them match your first deposit 100%, starting at a $20 minimum.</p>
<p>The Ignition Casino welcome offer for crypto deposits is more generous. Your first deposit is matched 150% for up to $1,500 on each available bonus, for a total of $3,000.</p>
<p>For all of these, the wagering requirement is 25x, which is relatively low compared to the industry standard.</p>

<h3><b>Ignition Casino Shitcodes</b></h3>
<p>The term “shitcode” refers to codes that a casino posts on various social media in a sort of hunt for their users. At the time of writing this Ignition Casino review, we weren’t able to find any special codes.</p>
<p>However, Ignition Casino does have an active X (formerly Twitter) account, where it hosts giveaways. Keep checking back there to see if they post any shitcodes. Who knows when you  might get lucky?</p>
<h3><b>Existing Customer Promos</b></h3>
<p>Ignition Casino offers several types of promotions for existing customers. One of them is a weekly boost, where you can get multiple offers on a weekly basis. Those include free spins, reload bonuses, tournament tickets and more.</p>
<p>To find out which reward you’re getting, you need to check your own Rewards Store. This is where you will also find all your Ignition Casino bonus codes that you can claim. You are not eligible for the boost if you haven’t made a deposit in 90 days or more.</p>
<p>You can also get a referral bonus worth 200% of your friend’s first deposit, up to $100. An extra $25 is added if your friend deposits using cryptocurrency.</p>
<h3><b>Ignition Casino Loyalty Program</b></h3>
<p>The loyalty program at this casino – or the Ignition Casino VIP program, if you prefer – is simply based upon your playing activity. The more you play, the more so-called “miles” you collect.</p>
<p>All miles are redeemable for real money. However, the system also calculates how many miles you’ve collected in total, called Lifetime Miles (LM), and the redemption rate is more in your favor as your Lifetime Miles increase.</p>
<p>For example, when you’ve just started playing, you will have to collect 2,500 Miles to get $1 in return. This decreases in increments of 250 LM until the highest-ranked players, with 2,500,000 LM only have to collect 1,000 Miles to exchange for $1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148122" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704554179-ignition-casino-loyalty-program.png" alt="Ignition Casino loyalty program" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704554179-ignition-casino-loyalty-program.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704554179-ignition-casino-loyalty-program-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704554179-ignition-casino-loyalty-program-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704554179-ignition-casino-loyalty-program-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, the more you level up, the more perks you get. Chrome players (which is the second stage, right above your starting level, Steel) are eligible for $2,500 poker freeroll tournaments. Platinum players and above, with at least 500,000 LM, get birthday bonuses from the casino.</p>
<p>All in all, the loyalty program at Ignition Casino seems to pay off quite well.</p>
<h2><b>Ignition Casino Bonus Promo Codes</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some casinos tie their promotions to bonus or promo codes. However, at the time of writing, we weren’t able to find a promotion that was redeemable using an Ignition Casino bonus code.</p>
<p>Still, you should always check your own Rewards Store, as the bonuses change often and depend upon your own activity levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/ext/ignition/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Ignition Casino</a></p>
<h3><b>Ignition Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes</b></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Ignition Casino does not seem to offer any no deposit bonuses, with codes or without. This means that you will have to make a deposit before you can claim any of their current bonuses and promotions. In fact, if you don’t deposit long enough, you may be barred from claiming any additional bonuses.</p>
<h2><b>What Games Can You Play at Ignition Casino?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Our Ignition Casino review found that this platform offers a very similar array of games as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">most of the other best crypto &amp; bitcoin gambling sites this year</a>. Let’s take a deeper look at the platform to see if they hold up.</p>
<h3><b>Slots</b></h3>
<p>Slots tend to form the very basis of any casino, online or not. Ignition Casino’s slots are found under the Casino tab at the top of the screen. You will find that the casino offers more than 400 slot titles – which is relatively low for any online casino.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148115" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553629-ignition-casino-slots.png" alt="Ignition Casino available slot games" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553629-ignition-casino-slots.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553629-ignition-casino-slots-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553629-ignition-casino-slots-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553629-ignition-casino-slots-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Still, if you filter the games by Most Popular, you will find all the well-known titles here. You can also filter by game type, like three reels, five reels, progressives, or pays anywhere. This makes the chances of finding a game to your liking pretty high.</p>
<p>In other words, the number of Ignition Casino casino games, or at least slots, may be lower than what we’re used to, but it’s still good enough that most players will be able to find something for themselves here.</p>
<h3><b>Roulette</b></h3>
<p>Roulette is another casino must-have. However, it doesn’t seem as important to Ignition Casino as it may be at some other casinos. Still, this doesn’t mean there are no roulette games.</p>
<p>You will find a total of five when you click on the Casino tab, then the Table Games tab, and then filter to only show roulette games. Again, this is a relatively low number; but with both European and American roulette and two game options each, plus Dragon Roulette, you’re likely set if you’re looking for simplicity.</p>
<p>An extra five games (three American, two European roulette types) are available with live dealers.</p>
<h3><b>Blackjack</b></h3>
<p>Among Ignition Casino games, blackjack gets a whole separate tab – but also only eight games. If that’s too low for you, there are quite a few other <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-blackjack-sites.htm">best crypto blackjack casinos available this year</a>.</p>
<p>If you agree that less is more, you will find that Ignition Casino offers an okay selection of blackjack types. You’ll find European, single deck, double deck, and classic blackjack, plus Perfect Pairs in this section.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148116" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553658-ignition-casino-live-dealer.png" alt="Ignition Casino live dealer blackjack" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553658-ignition-casino-live-dealer.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553658-ignition-casino-live-dealer-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553658-ignition-casino-live-dealer-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553658-ignition-casino-live-dealer-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>However, the Blackjack Live Dealer is where it’s at. There are a total of 34 games, where you can either choose a table limit or pick a table based on a preset limit. Some of them don’t even have a limit on the number of players that can participate at any given moment.</p>
<h3><b>Poker</b></h3>
<p>This Ignition Casino casino review is actually saving the best for last by introducing you to poker at this casino relatively late in the game.</p>
<p>Ignition Casino is a heavily poker-focused casino. All their tournaments are based on poker, as are most of their ongoing promotions. The tournaments are available for both live poker and video poker.</p>
<p>The total number of poker games, however, is equally limited as the other games, with a total of seven titles. Still, the ongoing tournaments, the promotions and the prize pools more than make up for this. This makes Ignition Casino a poker player’s dream come true.</p>
<h3><b>Live Dealer</b></h3>
<p>Aside from the aforementioned blackjack and roulette live dealers, the casino also offers baccarat and Super 6 in their live dealer section.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, our Ignition Casino reviews found it had a low, but select offering of games.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148117" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553687-ignition-casino-specialty-games.png" alt="Ignition Casino specialty games" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553687-ignition-casino-specialty-games.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553687-ignition-casino-specialty-games-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553687-ignition-casino-specialty-games-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553687-ignition-casino-specialty-games-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<h3><b>Other Games</b></h3>
<p>You can find games other than the aforementioned ones under the Specialty tab in the Casino, for example. Here, you’ll find bingo, scratch cards, Plinko, dice, and Rummy. Although, again, there aren’t that many games, the variety is actually pretty decent. You’re likely to find something to snag your attention.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/ext/ignition/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Ignition Casino</a></p>
<h2><b>Ignition Casino Sports Betting</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ignition Casino does offer some form of sports betting, but only on virtual sports. This means you can’t count on real world sports events to be represented among Ignition Casino games.</p>
<p>However, if you miss sports betting but don’t want to choose one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-bitcoin-soccer-betting-sites.htm">best bitcoin soccer betting sites this year</a>, see if virtual sports betting scratches the itch.</p>
<h3><b>Available Sports &amp; Markets</b></h3>
<p>Among the virtual sports on Ignition Casino, you will find soccer with national teams (with an extra category for the so-called England League, which seems to correspond to the English Premier League), basketball, horses, greyhounds, supercars, and camel racing, as well as color-color games.</p>
<p>You can also choose between scheduled games or push to play type games. Our Ignition Casino review found fewer game options in push to play (notably, there’s no basketball), but otherwise, they look quite similar. In this regard, it depends on your personal preference.</p>
<h3><b>Ignition Casino Odds</b></h3>
<p>When it comes to virtual sports, it’s hard to determine whether the odds offered are competitive or not. Most casinos will offer their own virtual sports, so they’re not necessarily mutually comparable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148118" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553708-ignition-casino-virtual-sports.png" alt="Ignition Casino virtual sports" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553708-ignition-casino-virtual-sports.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553708-ignition-casino-virtual-sports-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553708-ignition-casino-virtual-sports-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553708-ignition-casino-virtual-sports-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Another thing to note is that Ignition Casino uses American odds, also known as moneyline odds, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be an option to change to any other odds format. There is no difference in payout compared to British (fractional) or European (decimal) odds – it’s just a quirk that takes some getting used to, but is as logical as the other variants.</p>
<h2><b>What Software does Ignition Casino Use?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Our Ignition Casino review has already extensively covered the games, and therefore the number of games that the casino offers. The relatively low number of games also means a relatively low number of software providers behind those games.</p>
<p>This does not necessarily have to be considered a bad thing. In fact, this helps our quality assessments simply by reducing the number of providers.</p>
<p>In the case of Ignition Casino, the software providers they use include well-known names such as Rival, BGaming, and Spinomenal. These providers are held in high regard in the industry, which helps the image of Ignition Casino as well.</p>
<h2><b>Ignition Casino Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although Ignition Casino deposit options include both fiat and crypto, the casino makes no secret of the fact that it prefers crypto. We’ve already mentioned that crypto deposits get up to $1,000 more in their welcome bonus. There are also exclusive bonuses and promotions for crypto deposits on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148119" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553731-ignition-casino-depositing.png" alt="Ignition Casino depositing options" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553731-ignition-casino-depositing.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553731-ignition-casino-depositing-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553731-ignition-casino-depositing-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553731-ignition-casino-depositing-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>When depositing, it only takes a few minutes before your funds show up in your Ignition Casino account.</p>
<p>Before withdrawing, all the deposited funds must be wagered. The casino does not charge withdrawal fees, but your wallet provider might. Also, you will need to generate a new wallet address for each withdrawal request, but that is very intuitive and takes seconds.</p>

<h2><b>Ignition Casino Interface &amp; User Experience</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One of the most important things to note about Ignition Casino is that they don’t offer service quite anywhere in the world. At this moment, they’ve only rolled out to a select few countries. If you’re visiting from a country that’s not on their list, you will get geo-blocked.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ignition/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Sign up to Ignition Casino</a><br />
You can access all your bonuses from the Rewards Store, and find the games and tournaments under their respective tab names.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Ignition Casino is quite easy to use once you get the hang of it. Its light color scheme is easy on the eyes, even if it differs from the industry standard of dark, muted colors.</p>
<p>Help is also easily available with a Help Center at the bottom of every screen, a myriad of common questions already answered, and a way to contact a human being to guide you through any issues you may have. The website is only available in English, however.</p>
<h2><b>Does Ignition Casino Have a Mobile App?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At the time of writing this Ignition Casino casino review, there was no dedicated mobile app. Still, if you have an account, you can just as easily sign in from your mobile phone’s browser. There don’t seem to be any indications that the team is working on a separate app for mobile devices.</p>
<h2><b>Ignition Casino Security</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Security is one of the most important aspects of any casino. Luckily, Ignition Casino is licensed by the Government of Curaçao, which means they are cleared to operate within certain jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The license also means that they have gone through certain audits which proves, among other things, that the Random Number Generators (RNGs) that they use are truly random and therefore not rigged in anyone’s favor.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148121" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553783-ignition-casino-poker.png" alt="Ignition Casino poker" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553783-ignition-casino-poker.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553783-ignition-casino-poker-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553783-ignition-casino-poker-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704553783-ignition-casino-poker-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Moving on to the more basic security factors, it’s important to note that Ignition Casino’s website is using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL), marked by the “https” in the web address. This ensures that your private information is encrypted and not shared with anyone.</p>

<h2><b>The Verdict</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ignition Casino is a relatively small and pretty exclusive casino compared to many of its competitors. Its welcome bonus is modest, but its ongoing crypto promotions can help make up for it. Its selection of games is also pretty limited, but many people may not need anything more than that. In short, it caters to a specific niche, which is quite respectable.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you live in one of the supported countries, you like poker, and want to have a small, but dedicated space for your gambling enjoyment, be sure to check out Ignition Casino.</p>

<h3><strong>3. MetaMask &#8211; Popular Decentralized Wallet for Storing ERC-20 Tokens and NFTs</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-wallet-review.htm">MetaMask</a></p>
<p> is one of the best DeFi crypto wallets for storing Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens. Used by <a href="https://metamask.io/" rel="sponsored">over 30 million people</a>, MetaMask is free to download. Users</p>
<p>can choose from the mobile app for iOS and Android or a web browser extension. The latter includes Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox.</p>
<p>MetaMask provides users with a 12-word backup passphrase when creating a wallet. Only the user has access to the passphrase, ensuring that MetaMask remains decentralized at all times. The wallet is secured by a password, which needs to be entered when opening it.</p>
<p>While MetaMask supports a range of other networks, by default, it only connects to Ethereum. Other networks can be added manually. This includes Polygon, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. However, there is a lack of support for many notable blockchains. In addition to Bitcoin, this includes some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> &#8211; such as Cardano, Solana, and XRP.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-xrp-wallets.htm">popular XRP wallet</a> comes with an in-built staking tool that connects to Rocket Pool and Lido. Currently, these staking pools offer APYs of 3.8% and 4.3% on Ethereum deposits, respectively. For more options, MetaMask can be connected to decentralized applications. This can be done within the wallet interface or externally.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311615/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="MetaMask swap"></figure>
<p>MetaMask also offers an in-built token-swapping tool. This enables users to trade tokens without going through a centralized exchange. All supported network standards are compatible. However, once again, better rates are often available when connecting to dApps like UniSwap or PancakeSwap.</p>
<p>MetaMask has also partnered with various third parties to process debit/credit card and e-wallet payments. This includes Sardine, MoonPey, PayPal, and Transak. Users are redirected to a supported payment provider based on their location and required cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h3><strong>5. OKX &#8211; Decentralized Wallet App With Aggregator Tool to Maximize Yields &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>
OKX is also one of the best decentralized crypto wallets to consider today. Backed by one of the world&#8217;s leading exchanges, OKX is compatible with iOS and Android devices. It is free to download and comes packed with features. At the forefront of this is its exchange aggregator tool.</p>
<p>In simple terms, OKX scrapes data from over 200 <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/" rel="sponsored">DeFi exchanges</a>. This allows investors to find the highest APYs when earning interest via staking, yield farming, and crypto savings accounts. Best of all, there is no requirement to visit external DeFi exchanges.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="539" class="alignnone wp-image-125638 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet.jpg" alt="OKX crypto wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909266-okx-wallet-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Instead, the OKX aggregator tool allows users to complete their investments via the wallet interface. Moreover, the OKX wallet also supports in-built token swaps. Users will almost always secure the best exchange rates, considering the aggregator tool checks over 200 platforms.</p>
<p>In terms of fees, OKX adds a markup when swapping tokens or earning interest. While there is no fixed commission, fees are clearly displayed before confirming orders. Finally, OKX supports dozens of blockchain networks &#8211; including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. However, there is no support for Bitcoin.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Trezor &#8211; Self-Custody Hardware Wallet Aimed at Long-Term Crypto Investors &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/en" rel="sponsored">Trezor</a></p>
<p> is one of the best decentralized crypto wallets for security. Retailing from $69, the Trezor device allows investors to keep their cryptocurrencies in cold storage. In simple terms, this means that Trezor is never connected to live servers.</p>
<p>As such, the cryptocurrencies stored are kept away from remote hackers at all times. That said, Trezor will not appeal to those that actively trade or move cryptocurrencies. This is because to transfer tokens out of Trezor, users need access to the device.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="527" class="alignnone wp-image-125640 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3.jpg" alt="Trezor Safe 3" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909758-trezor-safe-3-768x450.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Only after entering the PIN on the Trezor device is the transaction authorized. Nonetheless, Trezor connects to its native app for iOS and Android. This allows users to view their cryptocurrency balances, with real-time valuations.</p>
<p>The Trezor app also allows users to buy cryptocurrencies with a debit/credit card and other fiat payment methods. However, watch out for fees, as fiat payments are processed by third parties. Finally, Trezor supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. This includes Bitcoin and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">best utility tokens</a>, such as Ethereum, Polygon, and XRP.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Coinbase Wallet &#8211; User-Friendly DeFi Wallet for iOS and Android Devices &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>
Coinbase Wallet is a decentralized wallet app for iOS and Android. This wallet is completely separate from the main Coinbase exchange &#8211; which is centralized. As such, Coinbase Wallet users have full control of their cryptocurrencies and private keys.</p>
<p>The wallet is free to download and ideal for beginners exploring <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-non-custodial-wallets.htm">non-custodial storage</a> for the first time. In fact, setting up the wallet takes seconds. Users simply need to choose a strong password and write down their backup passphrase.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311618/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Coinbase Wallet app"></figure>
<p>The Coinbase Wallet states that it supports hundreds of thousands of coins. This includes large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Tether, Dogecoin, Polygon, and Solana. Coinbase Wallet also supports the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks.</p>
<p>As such, all ERC20 and BSC tokens are supported. Coinbase Wallet allows users to explore the decentralized web and connect to dApps like Uniswap and Compound. While in-built token swaps are not supported, this can be achieved by connecting to a dApp.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Electrum &#8211; Best Crypto DeFi Wallet for Storing Bitcoin on a Desktop Device &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>
Those looking to store Bitcoin on a laptop or PC might consider Electrum the best decentralized wallet. It&#8217;s compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac and completely free to use. Electrum is one of the most established Bitcoin wallets, first launching in 2011.</p>
<p>While it comes with limited features, it&#8217;s packed with security tools. For example, Electrum enables users to keep their private keys in cold storage. This means the private keys remain offline until the user wants to make a transfer.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311619/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Electrum Bitcoin wallet"></figure>
<p>Another security tool offered by Electrum is multi-signature permissions. This requires users to authorize outgoing transfers across two or more wallets. Like most decentralized wallets, Electrum is protected by a password.</p>
<p>If this is forgotten or the device is lost, damaged, or stolen &#8211; the wallet can be recovered with the backup passphrase. Finally, Electrum also offers a mobile app for Android smartphones. Unfortunately for Apple users, there are no plans to release an iOS version.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Crypto.com &#8211; Feature-Rich DeFi Wallet Supporting Interest Accounts &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>
Crypto.com is a leading crypto exchange that also offers a decentralized wallet. This is a non-custodial wallet app for iOS and Android. There is also a browser extension and desktop software for those that prefer using a laptop device.</p>
<p>Crypto.com supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies across 30+ network standards. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, and its own network &#8211; Crypto.org Chain. The wallet is protected by a password and backup passphrase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222672/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-07-57-06.jpg" alt=""> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="658" class="alignnone wp-image-125642 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet.jpg" alt="Crypto.com wallet app" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698909902-crypto-wallet-768x561.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The latter &#8211; which consists of a 12, 18, or 24-word passphrase, is displayed when setting up the wallet. Crypto.com enables users to set their own <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/learn/defi/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees" rel="sponsored">GAS fees</a> when transferring funds. This supports efficient transactions based on real-time GAS prices.</p>
<p>That said, one of the best features of the Crypto.com wallet is its in-built support for interest accounts. This supports over 25 cryptocurrencies, including Cronos, Cosmos, and Dai. Alternatively, the Crypto.com wallet can also connect to dApps like MM Finance and VVS Finance.</p>

<h3><strong>10. BitAddress &#8211; Open-Sourced Paper Wallet Provider for Free Cold Storage &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>
BitAddress is the best decentralized crypto wallet for cost-effective cold storage. Unlike Trezor and Ledger Nano, BitAddress is completely free to use. This is because BitAddress is a &#8216;paper&#8217; wallet solution. Here&#8217;s how it works. First, users visit the BitAddress website to create a new wallet address.</p>
<p>Within seconds, BitAddress will display two unique barcodes. One represents the wallet address. The other is the wallet&#8217;s private keys. The user can then transfer Bitcoin to the wallet address and finally &#8211; print the two bar codes onto a sheet of paper and keep it somewhere safe.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311620/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Bitaddress.org Bitcoin wallet"></figure>
<p>In doing so, the Bitcoin tokens remain offline at all times. If the user wants to transfer the tokens to another wallet, they can scan the private key QR code. This imports the wallet credentials to the next wallet location.</p>
<p>In terms of safety, BitAddress is an <a href="https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org" rel="sponsored">open-sourced provider</a> that merely creates Bitcoin wallet addresses and private keys. This means it is the user&#8217;s responsibility to keep their credentials safe. Finally, BitAddress only supports Bitcoin &#8211; so this option won&#8217;t be suitable for diversified portfolios.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a Decentralized Wallet?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Decentralized wallets give users full control of their crypto investments. Unlike centralized wallets, only the user has access to their private keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>
In a nutshell, decentralized wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrency tokens safely. This is because users control their private keys.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to centralized wallets, which are often provided by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> or brokers. This is because centralized wallets do not provide users with their private keys. This means users need to trust the centralized provider will keep their funds safe.</p>
<p>Importantly, when setting up a decentralized wallet, private keys are usually provided in a simplified form. This is often a 12-word passphrase that needs to be entered in the correct order. Nonetheless, the decentralized wallet provider will never have access to the private keys.</p>
<p>This means users are responsible for safeguarding their wallets. If the wallet is compromised or the private keys are misplaced &#8211; the provider cannot help recover the funds.
</p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Using a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the core benefits provided by decentralized wallets include sole custody of the private keys, access to dApps, and faster transaction times.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Still not sure if a decentralized wallet is the best option?</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of using a decentralized wallet for storing cryptocurrencies.
</p>
<h3><strong>Full Control of Crypto Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>
The main attraction of decentralized wallets is that users control their funds. This is because only the user has access to their private keys.</p>
<p>As such, only the user can authorize outgoing transactions. Moreover, entities &#8211; whether that&#8217;s the wallet provider or the government, cannot access the crypto funds.</p>
<p>This allows users to store wealth outside of the conventional financial system. In other words, users do not need to trust decentralized wallet providers as they do with centralized exchanges.
</p>
<h3><strong>Faster Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>
The best decentralized crypto wallets offer much faster transaction times when compared to centralized options.</p>
<p>This is because there is no requirement to have the transaction authorized by a third party.
</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, consider the process involved when storing crypto tokens on a centralized exchange</li>
<li>First, the user would need to request a withdrawal from the exchange</li>
<li>The user would need to wait for the exchange to approve the transfer</li>
<li>This could take minutes, hours, or days &#8211; this can vary widely depending on the centralized exchange</li>
<li>Once approved, only then will the crypto tokens be transferred to the recipient</li>
</ul>
<p>
In comparison, there is no third-party approval process with decentralized wallets. As such, the transaction will be executed on the blockchain as soon as it is verified by the wallet owner.
</p>
<h3><strong>Store a Great Number of Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>
When using a centralized wallet, the number of supported tokens will often be limited. This is because users can only store tokens that are supported by the exchange.</p>
<p>In comparison, the best DeFi wallets support thousands, sometimes <i>millions,</i> of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Take Trust Wallet as a prime example. We found that Trust Wallet is compatible with over 70 blockchain networks and 4.5 million cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This enables investors to store all of their digital assets in one safe place.
</p>
<h3><strong>Access Web 3.0 dApps&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>
The best decentralized crypto wallets provide seamless access to Web 3.0 dApps.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311842/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="DApps list"></figure>
<p>Some of the most commonly supported dApps include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>UniSwap</li>
<li>SushiSwap</li>
<li>PancakeSwap</li>
<li>OpenSea</li>
<li>Compound</li>
<li>Yearn.finance</li>
</ul>
<p>
But there are hundreds more. Crucially, these dApps offer access to decentralized finance tools, such as token swaps, staking, yield farming, and dual investments.
</p>
<h3><strong>Anonymity &nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>
Another popular feature of decentralized crypto wallets is they offer complete anonymity. This means users can create a wallet without providing any personal information or contact details.</p>
<p>All users need to access their wallet is the respective password or private keys.
</p>
<h2><strong>Centralized vs Decentralized Wallets</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The responsibility of &#8216;custodianship&#8217; is how DeFi and centralized wallets are differentiated. Centralized wallet providers are tasked with keeping the user&#8217;s cryptocurrencies safe. While DeFi wallets give users full control &#8211; meaning they are responsible for looking after their private keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>
DeFi and centralized wallets both enable users to store their cryptocurrency tokens. The key difference is in who takes responsibility for safeguarding the wallet&#8217;s private keys.</p>
<p>In the case of centralized wallets, private keys are secured by the provider. This is often a crypto exchange or broker. As such, users do not have access to their private keys. In turn, if the custodian is hacked or goes bankrupt (like FTX), the user&#8217;s crypto funds are at risk.</p>
<p>DeFi crypto wallets, on the other hand, give users full control of their funds and private keys. This means that there is no reliance on a third-party custodian. Users can send and receive funds at any time without needing approval from another person or entity.</p>
<p>However, there is nowhere to turn if the DeFi wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys. Therefore, while DeFi wallets give users control of their wealth &#8211; appropriate security practices should be taken.</p>
<p>This means keeping the private keys offline at all times &#8211; preferably written down on a sheet of paper. In doing so, the user can recover their wallet if they forget their password or the device is lost or stolen.
</p>
<h2><strong>Different Types of DeFi Wallets</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Now that we have established the difference between centralized and DeFi wallets, we can explore the different types available.
</p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>
Most crypto investors opt for a software-based decentralized wallet. Software wallets are often referred to as &#8216;hot storage&#8217;. This is because the funds remain online at all times, increasing both convenience and risk.</p>
<p>Software wallets come in many forms, but mobile apps are particularly popular. Decentralized wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet both offer an app for iOS and Android. This enables users to secure their crypto funds with a PIN or fingerprint ID.</p>
<p>Mobile wallets are very convenient for actively managing crypto portfolios. At the click of a button, users can send, receive, and trade crypto right from their smartphones.</p>
<p>Software wallets also come as a browser extension. For example, MetaMask offers an extension for Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox browsers. This enables users to access the crypto markets whenever they are on their laptops.</p>
<p>Some decentralized wallets come as desktop software, but this is less common. One of the most popular desktop wallets is Electrum, which safely stores Bitcoin on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
</p>
<h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>
Hardware wallets allow users to store their cryptocurrencies on a device. The private keys are held on the device and kept offline at all times.</p>
<p>To transfer crypto to another wallet, users must enter a PIN on the hardware device. This offers an ultra-secure way to store large amounts of crypto.</p>
<p>Equally, hardware wallets are far from convenient for active crypto traders. This is because making last-minute trades is cumbersome, considering access to the hardware device is needed.</p>
<p>The leading hardware wallet providers are Trezor and Ledger Nano. Both are decentralized, as neither provider has access to the device&#8217;s private keys.</p>
<p>However, do remember that users will need to provide some personal and financial information when buying a hardware wallet online.
</p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>
Paper wallets also offer a decentralized way to store crypto tokens. As we mentioned earlier, BitAddress allows users to instantly create a Bitcoin wallet address and private keys.</p>
<p>Both are represented by a QR code, which the user can print onto a sheet of paper. As long as the paper is kept somewhere safe and private, the crypto funds remain unhackable.
</p>
<h2><strong>How Secure Are Decentralized Crypto Wallets?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
First and foremost, there is no requirement to trust a third party when using a decentralized wallet. After all, decentralized wallets merely provide a bridge between crypto transactions and the blockchain.</p>
<p>However, decentralized wallets will always be at risk from remote hacking attempts and theft. As such, users must ensure that they follow sensible security practices to keep their crypto funds safe.</p>
<p>For example, those using a mobile wallet should ensure that a suitable PIN is used. This should be in addition to a lock-screen password for the smartphone. If someone is able to bypass these security measures, they will have access to the wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311841/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet data"></figure>
<p>This is also the case for desktop and browser extension wallets. Another way for hackers to access a decentralized wallet is through &#8216;links&#8217;. For example, a scammer might impersonate the wallet&#8217;s support team and send a link for the user to click.</p>
<p>Unwittingly, the link might install a virus or keylogger, enabling the scammer to access the wallet remotely. The safeguard here is to never click links from unknown sources &#8211; whether that&#8217;s on social media or emails.</p>
<p>The safest option is to keep the crypto wallet offline at all times. For example, consider installing the wallet on a cheap smartphone that is never connected to the internet. Similarly, users might also consider a paper wallet that is stored away from the risk of theft or damage,</p>
<p>Ultimately, decentralized wallets <i>are</i> safe, but users must also take responsibility too. Users also need to consider that increased convenience often leads to reduced security.</p>
<p>For example, while software wallets are convenient for actively trading and investing crypto, the private keys will always be vulnerable to hackers. As such, users should only keep small amounts of crypto in a software wallet.
</p>
<h2><strong>How to Select the Best Decentralized Crypto Wallet?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Choosing a suitable wallet is a crucial part of the crypto investing process.</p>
<p>Therefore, this section highlights the most important factors to look for when choosing the best decentralized crypto wallet.
</p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p>
Decentralized wallets provide users with their private keys, ensuring that wealth is built and maintained without third parties.</p>
<p>However, decentralized wallets are still vulnerable to hackers. As such, choosing the best decentralized wallet requires users to consider what security features are included.</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask are secured by a PIN</li>
<li>Desktop and browser-based wallets are secured by a password</li>
<li>Hardware wallets are secured via cold storage. Plus, users need to enter a PIN on the device to transfer funds</li>
</ul>
<p>
In comparison, centralized wallets offer additional security features. This can include device whitelisting, two-factor authentication, and even insurance.
</p>
<h3><strong>Supported Networks</strong></h3>
<p>
The number and type of blockchain networks supported by decentralized wallets will vary wildly. For example, Trust Wallet supports over 70 networks. This includes Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> &#8211; like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311840/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrencies list"></figure>
<p>In contrast, Electrum only supports one cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin. Crucially, users should check which networks and cryptocurrencies are supported by choosing a decentralized wallet.
</p>
<h3><strong>Device Type</strong></h3>
<p>
Consider the most convenient and secure device type to store the decentralized crypto wallet. Options include desktop software, browser extensions, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>For offline storage, consider a hardware or paper wallet.
</p>
<h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3>
<p>
Another factor to consider is user-friendliness.</p>
<p>For instance, beginners should explore whether the chosen decentralized wallet is suitable for their skill set. Sending and receiving crypto should be simple, as should setting up and securing the wallet.</p>
<p>More experienced crypto investors might seek a crypto wallet with more advanced features. For example, Electrum offers multi-signature permissions. While this adds a great level of security to the wallet, this feature is not suitable for newbies.
</p>
<h3><strong>Investment and Trading Features</strong></h3>
<p>
The best decentralized wallets enable users to maximize their crypto investments. For example, OKX has an in-built aggregator tool that connects to over 200 dApps.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311839/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-.jpg" alt="Trending crypto coins"></figure>
<p>Users can search for the crypto they currently hold in the OKX wallet and locate the highest APYs available. OKX also comes with an in-built token-swapping tool, not to mention a fully-fledged NFT marketplace.</p>
<p>In contrast, the likes of BitAddress and Electrum do not offer any such features.
</p>
<h2><strong>Tutorial on How to Use a Decentralized Crypto Wallet</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Below, we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up an account and use our top decentralized wallet, Best Wallet, which should only take five minutes.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Download Best Wallet App</strong></h3>
<p>
First, find the Best Wallet app, which is available on mobile for Android and iOS in the App Store and the Play Store and download it.</p>
<p>A desktop browser extension is currently in development and will be released soon.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333733/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" alt="Best Wallet mobile app"></figure>
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Create an Account</strong></h3>
<p>
As a leading self-custody, decentralized wallet, all that&#8217;s needed to create an account is an active email address.</p>
<p>There is no KYC requirements to fill in, allowing for anonymous storage and transfers.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Choose Security Settings</strong></h3>
<p>
Next, choose the level of security you wish to attach to the account.</p>
<p>All accounts will require a four-digit passcode to be input and confirmed, while there is the option to add two-factor authentication and/or fingerprint ID.</p>
<p>Once that step is complete, an account will have been created, but users should head to the settings tab and note down their private key.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Use Best Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>
An account has now been created and users will be redirected to Best Wallet dashboard, where they will be able to purchase or store crypto an trade on the built-in DEX.</p>
<p>As outlined above, some features are not yet live at the time of writing but will be launched in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/116288/333734/best-wallet-homescreen.jpg" alt="Best Wallet main wallet"></figure>
</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
In summary, decentralized wallets offer many benefits for crypto investors. This includes having full control of the wallet&#8217;s private keys, enabling investors to become their own bank.</p>
<p>Decentralized wallets are also ideal for connecting to Web3 applications, as well as remaining anonymous. That said, do remember that decentralized wallets also invite risk. If the wallet is hacked or the user loses their private keys &#8211; the crypto funds will likely be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to choose wisely when selecting a decentralized wallet, with Best Wallet our top pick and an excellent choice. The self-custody wallet allows for accounts to be created in less than five minutes with no KYC verification needed, with users able to securely store crypto and trade tokens via built-in DEX.</p>
<p>It stands out ahead of its rivals because it is more than just a crypto wallet &#8211; its native token $BEST can be staked to earn rewards and holding it also grants other benefits such as early access to new projects and NFTS and reduced fees, while the platform will also offer unique insights and data on trending tokens.</p>
<p>$BEST is not yet live but will be airdropped to active users of the wallet in the near future.

This provider offers the best crypto wallet for UK traders that wish to actively buy and sell tokens. The platform is home to more than 600 crypto assets across 1,000 markets. Moreover, trading commissions are super-low.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, buying and selling crypto on Binance will cost just 0.1% in commission. This amounts to &pound;1 for every &pound;1,000 traded. Binance also supports GBP deposits via debit/credit cards at a reasonable fee of 1.8%. GBP payments are also supported via bank transfers at a flat fee of &pound;1. After buying crypto on Binance, the tokens are stored in the user&#8217;s web wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>The web wallet is protected by a variety of safeguards, which is inclusive of two-factor authentication. Logging into the Binance wallet from a new device or IP address will trigger an additional security check. Binance has also implemented a safe asset fund for users (SAFU), which is designed to compensate investors in the event the exchange is hacked.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88127/221411/screenshot-2022-09-20-at-15-08-22.jpg" alt="Binance Crypto Exchange"></figure><p>The Binance wallet can also be downloaded as a mobile app for iOS and Android smartphones.

Trust Wallet &#8211; Decentralized Crypto Wallet App With Plenty of Tools and Products&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Trust Wallet is perhaps the best crypto wallet in the UK for those seeking a non-custodial storage option. This means that by using Trust Wallet, investors in the UK will retain full control over their private keys. This is a big deal for some crypto traders, as it ensures that there is full ownership of the underlying tokens at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, Trust Wallet does not have access to the private keys. On the flip side, if the investor forgets their password and is unable to locate the private keys for the wallet, Trust Wallet will not be able to help regain access.

Trust Wallet claims to support more than 4.5+million digital assets across 65 blockchains. Therefore, for all intents and purposes, traders in the UK can use Trust Wallet to store their entire crypto portfolio. Trust Wallet also supports DeFi services from within the wallet app, which is inclusive of staking.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that Trust Wallet is the best crypto wallet for UK investors that wish to earn interest on their idle tokens. Another benefit of Trust Wallet is that it offers access to decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap.

</figure><h2><strong>What is a Crypto Wallet?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>After buying crypto assets such as Bitcoin and BNB, the tokens need to be stored in a wallet. This ensures that the tokens remain safe at all times. This is not too dissimilar to how traditional money is stored in a regulated bank account.&nbsp;</p><p>At a minimum, crypto wallets enable investors to send and receive tokens. This is conducted on a wallet-to-wallet basis via a public address. A non-custodial crypto wallet is protected by private keys, which provide access to the digital assets remotely &#8211; often via a 12-word backup phrase.&nbsp;</p><p>However, custodial wallets &#8211; which are typically offered by crypto exchanges and brokers, do not enable users to access their private keys. Instead, the private keys will be safeguarded by the respective provider.</p><h2><strong>Why Crypto Investors Need a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Crypto investors are advised to obtain a secure wallet with the view of keeping their digital assets safe and away from the wrong hands. Once again, this follows the same concept as depositing traditional money in a bank account for safekeeping and easy access to the funds.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of a crypto wallet, access to the funds is often protected by a range of safeguards. For example, custodial wallet providers will keep the vast majority of client digital assets offline in cold storage. This ensures that the tokens cannot be accessed by a remote hacker.</p><p>Other security features include two/three-factor authentication, biometric and facial logins, and IP address whitelisting. Top crypto wallets in the UK will also make the process of sending and receiving funds seamless and convenient.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The underlying mechanics of Bitcoin and crypto wallets will vary slightly depending on the chosen device type.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, there are a lot of similarities that most crypto wallets possess.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul>
<li>Each crypto wallet will have its own public address. This is similar to an account number and sort code associated with UK banks.&nbsp;</li>
<li>As such, investors can receive funds by supplying the public address for their crypto wallet.</li>
<li>Similarly, when sending funds out of the wallet to another person, the public address will need to be entered&nbsp;</li>
<li>Once the transaction is confirmed, the person sending the funds will pay a blockchain &nbsp;fee, which can vary depending on the network and broader market conditions</li>
</ul><p>Here&#8217;s an example of what a Bitcoin wallet address looks like:</p><p><strong>3FZbgi29cpjq2GjdwV8eyHuJJnkLtktZc5</strong></p><p>Although it is safe to give a crypto wallet address to other people, it is important to remember that digital assets operate on the blockchain ledger.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that by knowing somebody else&#8217;s public address, it is possible to see how much the wallet is storing, in addition to any previous transactions that have been conducted. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3><p>All crypto wallets are backed and secured by private keys. This is similar to a password associated with an online banking account. In other words, those with access to the private key can log into the wallet and authorize transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it is crucial that wallet private keys are never shared with anyone. With that said, whether or not the user has access to the private keys will depend on the wallet type.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul>
<li>Custodial wallets are controlled by third parties, such as crypto exchanges. This means that the user will not have access to the wallet&#8217;s private keys. However, if the user forgets their password, they can ask the third party for help regaining access to the wallet.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Non-custodial wallets, such as Best Wallet, provide users will full control over their digital assets and private keys. No third party can access the wallet without knowing the private keys. However, if the non-custodial wallet device is lost and the user cannot access their private keys, the digital assets will be unrecoverable.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Choosing the best crypto wallet in the UK is often a decision that needs to focus on the <i>type</i> of storage option.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we cover the main types of crypto wallets available to UK investors.</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Software wallets enable investors to access their crypto funds remotely. This is typically a choice between a mobile app, desktop software, a browser extension, or a centralized web wallet.</p><p>Either way, software wallets make it a convenient process when it comes to sending and receiving funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, some software providers support multiple device types that each connect to one another.</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Hardware wallets come in the form of physical devices. Leaders in this space include Trezor and Ledger Nano &#8211; both of which we reviewed earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Hardware wallets offer the highest level of security, but transferring funds can be cumbersome.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for this is that the user must enter the wallet PIN on the hardware device itself in order to authorize the transfer.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>Paper wallets offer a cost-effective way to store crypto assets offline and away from the threats of a remote hacking attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>The user will usually print the wallet&#8217;s private keys onto a sheet of paper via a QR code. Then, the paper will be stored somewhere safe.&nbsp;</p><p>If the user needs to send crypto out of the paper wallet, they can do this remotely from a mobile device by scanning the QR code.&nbsp;</p><p>This option, while cost-effective and safe, makes it extremely cumbersome to transfer funds. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Choose the Best UK Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In this section, we explore some of the most important considerations to make when selecting the best Bitcoin wallet in the UK.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>At a minimum, the best Bitcoin wallets in the UK offer solid security features that are tasked with keeping the crypto assets safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of top-rated security tools to look for include:</p><ul>
<li>Two or three-factor authentication</li>
<li>Fingerprint ID</li>
<li>Cold storage on custodial wallets</li>
<li>IP address whitelisting</li>
<li>Device whitelisting</li>
<li>Notifications on outgoing transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>The best Bitcoin wallets in the UK support multiple blockchain networks. This ensures that investors can keep their entire crypto portfolio in a single wallet.</p><h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3><p>The best crypto wallets in the UK are free to use. The only fee that should be payable is when it comes to sending tokens to another wallet address.&nbsp;</p><p>There should be no markup on this, meaning that users simply pay the network fee charged by the underlying blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, fees will also be charged if the wallet provider supports GBP deposits and crypto trading services.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>User Experience</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The chosen crypto wallet should offer a suitable user experience that aligns with the objectives of the trader.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a Bitcoin hardware wallet will likely offer superb security, sending and receiving funds can be cumbersome.</p><h2><strong>How to Get a Cryptocurrency Wallet in the UK</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Overall, we found that Best Wallet offers the best Bitcoin wallet in the UK for investors of all skill sets and trading goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, in this section, we will explain how to get and set up the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" rel="sponsored">Best Wallet</a> mobile app in less than five minutes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download App&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Best Wallet is available through a dedicated mobile app on both Android and iOS &#8211; visit the Play Store or App Store and download the correct app, which should only take 30 seconds to complete.</p><p>A desktop browser extension is also in development and will be launched in the coming months.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" alt="Best Wallet Crypto Application"></figure><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" rel="sponsored"><strong>Visit Best Wallet Now</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Step 2: Create Account and Choose Security Settings</strong></h3><p>After downloading the app it is time to create an account, this can simply be done with an email address.&nbsp;</p><p>Then it is time to add security settings to your account.

<h2><strong>Best ERC20 Wallets: Full Reviews</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With an increasing number of ERC20 wallets in the market, knowing which option to go with can be difficult. </p>
<p>To help clear the mist, we will now review the 7 best ERC20 wallets for 2024. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Best Wallet &#8211; Overall Best Wallet for Storing and Managing ERC20 Tokens  </strong></h3>
<p>We rank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet" rel="sponsored">Best Wallet</a> as the overall best ERC20 wallet as it has a built-in decentralized exchange that supports trading for all <a href="https://bitpay.com/blog/erc-20-tokens-what-they-are-and-how-they-are-used/" rel="sponsored">450,000+ ERC20 tokens</a> plus those on other chains such as the Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<p>The decentralized, non-custodial, multi-chain wallet also has features that other wallets don&#8217;t have, making it more than just a destination to trade and store tokens.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="514" class="alignnone wp-image-125679 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698913413-best-wallet2.jpg" alt="Best Wallet mobile app" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698913413-best-wallet2.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698913413-best-wallet2-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698913413-best-wallet2-768x439.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>As well as the built-in DEX it has other DeFi features, made possible through holding native ERC20 token $BEST &#8211; which is launching soon. The token offers staking rewards and also entitles holders to get reduced fees when trading other tokens.</p>
<p>Best Wallet also features unique insights into trending crypto projects, airdrops and NFT collections and offers early access into new token ICOs and presales.</p>
<p>Moreover, we like that Best Wallet comes packed with security tools &#8211; this includes biometrics and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-multifactor-authentication-e5e39437-121c-be60-d123-eda06bddf661" rel="sponsored">multi-factor authentication</a>. </p>
<p>Best Wallet users can swap ERC20 tokens instantly without leaving the wallet. Users can also stake tokens to earn passive rewards. While Best Wallet also supports fiat payments, users should be aware that a 4% fee will apply. Nonetheless, payments are processed by a <a href="https://wert.io/fiat-onramp" rel="sponsored">regulated entity</a>, Wert &#8211; licensed in the US and EU.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="452" class="alignnone wp-image-125682 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698913533-best-dex.jpg" alt="Best DEX" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698913533-best-dex.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698913533-best-dex-300x151.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698913533-best-dex-768x386.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Best Wallet also supports Bitcoin, Dash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and many other leading cryptocurrencies. This is a decentralized wallet, so users can store, send, and receive ERC20 tokens anonymously. Only the user has access to their private keys, which gives full control of the cryptocurrencies stored. </p>
<p>The wallet has only just launched and not all features are live at the time of writing. However, $BEST tokens will be airdropped to active users in the near future, with 10% of the max supply to be distributed.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Ledger &#8211; Hardware Wallet for Storing ERC20 Tokens Offline   </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/" rel="sponsored">Ledger</a> is one of the best ERC20 wallets for security. Unlike the other providers discussed so far, this is a hardware wallet. It comes as a physical device that encrypts the private keys internally. The key safeguard is that Ledger is never connected to the internet. Instead, ERC20 transactions are broadcasted to the network via Bluetooth or a USB cable, depending on the model. </p>
<p>All Ledger models require outgoing transactions to be authorized on the device. This requires the user to enter their PIN. If the PIN is forgotten, the wallet can be recovered with the backup passphrase. This is provided by Ledger when installing the wallet and should be kept on a sheet of paper. The backup passphrase is also required if the Ledger device is lost or stolen. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313167/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" alt="Ledger hardware wallet" /></figure>
<p>Although Ledger offers one of the safest ERC20 wallets in the market, it is far from convenient. This won&#8217;t be an issue for long-term investors, but those wishing to stake or swap ERC20 tokens will find the process cumbersome. The Ledger Nano S Plus is available to <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison" rel="sponsored">buy for $79</a>. The most advanced model &#8211; Ledger Stax, retails for $279.    </p>

<h3><strong>4. Trust Wallet &#8211; Supports All ERC20 Tokens Plus 70 Other Blockchain Standards  </strong></h3>
<p>Trust Wallet is a non-custodial ERC20 wallet that is free and simple to use. It supports multiple devices, including browser extensions and smartphones. The latter includes an app for both iOS and Android. Trust Wallet is protected by a PIN and a 12-word passphrase. The passphrase is encrypted on the user&#8217;s device, and Trust Wallet cannot access it. </p>
<p>As such, this is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-decentralized-crypto-wallets.htm">best decentralized crypto wallets</a> for storing ERC20 tokens. In fact, we like that Trust Wallet supports custom tokens. In a nutshell, this means any ERC20 token can be added. Moreover, Trust Wallet is integrated with CoinMarketCap. This means that if the ERC20 token is listed on CoinMarketCap, Trust Wallet displays its value in real-time.   </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312862/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" alt="Trust Wallet" /></figure>
<p>In addition to ERC20 tokens, Trust Wallet supports more than 70 other blockchains. This includes Bitcoin, XRP, Arbitrum, Litecoin, Cardano, and Binance Smart Chain. The Trust Wallet app comes with staking tools and allows users to instantly swap ERC20 tokens. These features are not available on the browser extension. </p>

<li>The browser extension comes with limited functionality  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. MetaMask &#8211; User-Friendly Browser Extension For Desktop Users   </strong></h3>
<p>MetaMask is one of the best ERC20 wallets for desktop users. Its browser extension is user-friendly and supports Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Brave. It takes seconds to download and set up a new MetaMask wallet. Users simply need to choose a strong password and write down their 12-word backup passphrase. </p>
<p>MetaMask comes pre-installed to support the Ethereum network only. This makes it ideal for storing ERC20 tokens in one safe place. If an ERC20 token isn&#8217;t initially recognized, users can manually add it via the contract address. MetaMask supports five other networks &#8211; Arbitrum, Binance Smart Chain, Optimism, Avalanche, and Polygon. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313152/screenshot-2023-06-15-at-.jpg" alt="MetaMask wallet app" /></figure>
<p>These networks will need to be added manually, and all native tokens are supported. MetaMask supports staking within its wallet interface, but only for Ethereum. This feature is provided by <a href="https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html" rel="sponsored">Rocket Pool</a> and Lido. Users can also swap ERC20 tokens on MetaMask. This attracts a 0.875% fee, built into the exchange rate. </p>

<h3><strong>6. Coinbase Wallet &#8211; DeFi Wallet App Supporting Any ERCToken   </strong> </h3>
<p>Coinbase Wallet is also one of the best ERC20 wallets in the market. Not only does Coinbase Wallet support <i>any</i> ERC20 token, but also Bitcoin, Solana, Optimism, Avalanche, and more. The wallet is free to download and is available as an app for Android and iOS. </p>
<p>Coinbase Wallet is non-custodial, so only the user can access the private keys. These are stored on the user&#8217;s smartphone and come fully encrypted. It is important to remember that Coinbase cannot recover the private keys if they are misplaced. Nor can it help users recover stolen cryptocurrencies if the wallet is compromised. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115981/311618/screenshot-2023-06-06-at-.jpg" alt="Coinbase Wallet app" /></figure>
<p>The Coinbase Wallet app is secured by a PIN and biometrics. But there is no support for two-factor authentication or multi-sig permission. On the flip side, we like that Coinbase Wallet supports dApps. This includes OpenSea, PancakeSwap, ENS, SushiSwap, and Curve. The wallet also allows users to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. </p>

<h3><strong>7. Binance &#8211; Popular ERC20 Wallet for Active Traders    </strong> </h3>
<p>Active traders might consider Binance the best ERC20 wallet. This is a centralized wallet that connects to the Binance exchange &#8211; so users will not have access to their private keys. Instead, Binance is responsible for keeping client cryptocurrencies safe. The wallet is secured by two-factor authentication, which is required when logging in. </p>
<p>Binance sends a separate code to the user&#8217;s cell phone <i>and</i> email, which offers an extra layer of security. By choosing the Binance wallet, users will have access to industry-leading commissions. This amounts to just <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/trading" rel="sponsored">0.1% per slide</a> &#8211; which is reduced when holding BNB tokens. The Binance exchange has over 350 pairs, including many ERC20 tokens. </p>

<p>Additional ERC20 tokens can be found on the Binance Innovation Zone, which also connects to its wallet. Binance is also a good option for earning yields on ERC20 tokens. This includes liquidity farming, savings accounts, and staking. Binance also allows users to trade leveraged crypto products. The Binance wallet is also compatible with its native app, but fewer features are offered. </p>

<h2><strong>The Basics of ERC20 Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>After investing in an ERC20 project like Tether or Aave, the tokens need to be stored in a crypto wallet. ERC20 tokens can be stored in wallets that support the Ethereum network. Even if the specific token isn&#8217;t supported, some ERC20 wallets allow users to add them manually.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>ERC20 tokens need to be stored in cryptocurrency wallets that support the Ethereum network. As the world&#8217;s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="sponsored">second-largest cryptocurrency</a> by market capitalization, this means the number of ERC20 wallets in the market is extensive. Not only that, but there are many different types of ERC20 wallets to choose from. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, while some ERC20 token holders prefer web-based wallets, others feel more comfortable with a hardware device. </li>
<li>Some investors opt for a mobile wallet app for added convenience. </li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, ERC20 wallets come with a unique Ethereum address. This address will support all ERC20 tokens. That said, users should check whether custom tokens can be added to the ERC20 wallet. If not, then the user will only be able to deposit ERC20 tokens that are supported. Nonetheless,<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users" rel="sponsored"> sending ERC20 tokens to a wallet address takes just 15 seconds on average</a>. </p>
<p>That said, wallet-to-wallet transactions require <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/" rel="sponsored">GAS fees</a>. And when ending ERC20 tokens, GAS fees need to be paid in <i>Ethereum</i>. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, suppose an investor wants to transfer Aave from their ERC20 wallet to an exchange. </li>
<li>Irrespective of how many AAVE tokens are being sent, the user will need to cover the Ethereum GAS fee. </li>
<li>This is determined by how busy the Ethereum blockchain is at the time of the transaction.  </li>
</ul>
<p>ERC20 wallets come with a unique password &#8211; known as &#8216;private keys&#8217;. But not all ERC20 wallets share this information. This will depend on whether the user opts for a custodial or non-custodial wallet.  </p>
<h2><strong>Why Do I Need an ERC20 Wallet?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>ERC20 wallets provide many different functions. Not only for storing and transferring ERC20 tokens but accessing DeFi products. </p>
<p>Read on to discover why ERC20 investors need a suitable wallet to engage with the Ethereum ecosystem. </p>
<h3><strong>Storage</strong></h3>
<p>Both short and long-term investors need a safe place to store their ERC20 tokens. This means keeping the tokens off unregulated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">crypto exchanges</a>. </p>
<p>The best ERC20 wallets offer various security tools to protect the tokens from hackers. For example, custodial wallets usually offer two-factor authentication via SMS and/or email. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116987/313332/screenshot-2023-06-16-at-.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency list" /></figure>
<p>Non-custodial wallets give users control of their private keys, which are usually encrypted on the respective device. </p>
<h3><strong>Wallet-to-Wallet Transfers</strong></h3>
<p>To send or receive ERC20 tokens, a wallet is needed. Users simply need to provide the Ethereum wallet address when sending ERC20 tokens. </p>
<p>This will be unique to the wallet, but all ERC20 tokens will be sent to the same address. </p>
<p>For example, suppose the user is given the following Ethereum address by their chosen wallet:</p>
<p><strong>0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe</strong></p>
<p>In this instance, all incoming ERC20 tokens will be sent to this address. </p>
<h3><strong>Ethereum DeFi Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain is the go-to network for DeFi platforms. Some of the most popular include UniSwap, Curve, SushiSwap, DODO, OpenSea, and Kine Protocol. </p>
<p>The best ERC20 wallets allow users to connect to DeFi platforms directly. This means users can swap tokens, earn staking rewards, and even borrow funds without leaving the wallet interface. </p>
<h3><strong>Fiat Payments</strong></h3>
<p>Some ERC20 wallets allow users to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money. This removes the need to use an external exchange. </p>
<p>Users should, however, keep an eye on fees. </p>
<h2><strong>Best ERC20 Wallets: Our Ranking Criteria </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>While security is a crucial factor when choosing the best ERC20 wallet, other metrics also need to be considered. This includes usability, fees, customer service, supported networks, and core features. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When compiling our list of the best ERC20 wallets, we focused on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custodianship:</strong> First, ERC20 token holders should explore the custodianship of a wallet. This determines whether or not the user has access to their private keys. If so, this is a non-custodial wallet. If not, the wallet is custodial.   </li>
<li><strong>Fees:</strong> The best ERC20 wallets do not charge fees for storing tokens. Nor should there be any extra fees for sending transactions. Instead, this should replicate the blockchain GAS fee. Just remember, while software wallets are free to use, hardware wallets need to be purchased.</li>
<li><strong>Wallet Type:</strong> Beginners are best suited for mobile or web-browser wallets, for the convenience on offer. That said, some ERC20 token holders prefer desktop or hardware wallets, depending on their requirements. We covered a broad range of wallet types to suit all needs. </li>
<li><strong>Supported Coins:</strong> Be sure to choose a wallet that supports <i>all</i> ERC20 tokens. The wallet should have a feature that allows users to add a custom token manually. If it doesn&#8217;t, the wallet will only support a limited number of ERC20 tokens. Leading ERC20 wallets also support Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-arbitrum-network-tokens.htm">best Arbitrum network tokens</a>.    </li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> The primary purpose of an ERC20 wallet is to keep investments safe. This means that the chosen ERC20 wallet should have suitable security features. For example, Best Wallet comes with biometric security. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, the best wallets for ERC20 tokens cover a good blend of security and convenience, plus support for a wide range of ERC20 tokens and features. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>How do ERC20 Wallets Work? The Basics</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>ERC20 wallets come with various fundamentals that should be learned before proceeding. First, investors will be provided with a unique ERC20 wallet address. Not only does this enable them to receive Ethereum, but all ERC20 tokens. This is because ERC20 tokens operate on top of the Ethereum framework. As such, Ethereum and ERC20 tokens use the same wallet standard. </p>
<p>That said, it is important to assess whether the chosen wallet accepts <i>custom</i> ERC20 tokens. If it does, then users can add an ERC20 token to their wallet even if it isn&#8217;t listed on an exchange. All the user needs to do is paste the contract address into the wallet. Thereon, any incoming ERC20 tokens transactions will be reflected in the wallet address. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/116825/312876/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-.jpg" alt="eToro Money crypto wallet" /></figure>
<p>When sending ERC20 tokens to another wallet, the user will need the correct address. If any mistakes are made, the transaction will be sent to a dead wallet address. In other words, the ERC20 tokens will be unrecoverable. Do remember that <i>sending</i> ERC20 tokens requires GAS fees. And as noted earlier, GAS fees must be paid in ETH and not the ERC20 token being sent. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if an investor wants to transfer Dai, they must have enough ETH in their ERC20 wallet to cover transaction fees. This is quoted by the Ethereum network and will vary depending on demand. Currently, ERC20 token transfers <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker" rel="sponsored">cost $1.73</a> or about 0.0010 ETH. This is considered competitive, as ERC20 GAS fees will often exceed $10.      </p>
</blockquote>
<p>ERC20 token holders should also be aware of how private keys work. After all, if opting for a non-custodial wallet, private keys are the responsibility of the user. All of the non-custodial wallets discussed today convert private keys to a 12 or 24-word passphrase. This makes it easier to write down and recover the ERC20 wallet if needed. </p>
<h2><strong>Different Types of ERC20 Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We have now covered the basics of how ERC20 wallets work. Next, let&#8217;s explore the most common <i>types</i> of ERC20 wallets, including hardware, software, and paper. </p>
<h3><strong>ERC20 Software Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>Most ERC20 token holders will opt for a software wallet. Especially those that actively buy, sell, and trade ERC20 tokens. </p>
<p>Options include a mobile wallet, which comes as an app for iOS or Android. This is the most convenient option, as users can send and receive ERC20 tokens anywhere, at any time. Moreover, mobile wallets are protected by screen locks, biometrics, and a backup passphrase.</p>
<p>Desktop and browser-based wallets are also popular. These options are suitable for ERC20 token holders that prefer transacting on a laptop or PC. In some cases, desktop wallets come with two-factor authentication, requiring users to verify access via an SMS code.  </p>
<h3><strong>ERC20 Hardware Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>ERC20 hardware wallets will appeal to two types of investors. First, those with a large value of ERC20 tokens in their portfolio. Or those that want to hold their ERC20 tokens long-term. </p>
<p>This is because hardware wallets come with unprecedented security controls. For instance, a PIN needs to be entered on the device when authorizing transactions. What&#8217;s more, the hardware device remains in cold storage, as it&#8217;s never connected to the internet. </p>
<h3><strong>ERC20 Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>An alternative option is to use an ERC20 paper wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>The user will first need to create an ERC20 wallet address.</li>
<li>This can be done from most software wallets, such as Trust Wallet.</li>
<li>The user will then transfer the ERC20 tokens to the newly generated wallet address. </li>
<li>Next, they will print the wallet address and the private keys onto a sheet of paper. </li>
<li>Then, the paper is kept somewhere safe, and thus &#8211; the private keys remain in cold storage at all times. </li>

<p>While this makes it challenging to actively send and receive funds, paper wallets are one of the safest and most cost-effective ways to store ERC20 tokens. </p>
<h2><strong>How Safe Are ERC20 Wallets?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The safety of an ERC20 wallet depends on various factors, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the wallet is non-custodial or custodial</li>
<li>Whether it&#8217;s a hot or cold wallet</li>
<li>The specific security features provided by the wallet</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s break the above list down into more detail &#8211; starting with custodianship. </p>
<p>Custodial wallets are responsible for keeping the user&#8217;s ERC20 tokens safe. While they don&#8217;t share the user&#8217;s private keys, the best custodial wallets offer a range of security controls. </p>
<p>The security of a non-custodial wallet will depend on whether the user opts for hot or cold storage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cold storage, available as a hardware or paper wallet, keeps the private keys offline at all times. This removes the threat of the wallet being hacked remotely. </li>
<li>Hot storage keeps the ERC20 tokens online at all times, which offers added convenience. Most non-custodial hot wallets are secured with a PIN, password, or biometrics. But two-factor authentication is not an option, as non-custodial wallets are decentralized. </li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, ERC20 token holders should do their due diligence on the security of a wallet before proceeding. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Set up an ERC20 Wallet?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Setting up an ERC20 wallet is relatively straightforward. Beginners can follow the step-by-step walkthrough below to get started with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/" rel="sponsored">Best Wallet</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Download Best Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Best Wallet is currently available as a mobile app with a desktop browser currently in development.</p>
<p>It can be found in the App Store or Play Store on Android/iOS and can be downloaded for free. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333847/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" alt="Best Wallet crypto app " /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Create Account</strong></h3>
<p>Users only need to input an active email address to create an account, as Best Wallet is decentralized and non-custodial and there is no <a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/kyc-process" rel="sponsored">KYC process</a> to complete.</p>
<p>Next, users decide what security settings to add &#8211; a four-digit passcode is the minimum but there is the option to add two-factor authentication and/or fingerprint ID. This can also be added/removed later.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Transfer or Buy ERC20 Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>A Best Wallet account has now been created and users will be redirected to the dashboard, where they can either purchase ERC20 tokens via third-party WERT or trade thousands of other tokens on the built-in DEX.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117101/333848/best-wallet-homescreen.jpg" alt="Best Wallet main wallet" /></figure>
<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>After reviewing the top ERC20 wallets for 2024, we found that Best Wallet is our top option. </p>
<p>This decentralized, non-custodial wallet has just launched as a free mobile app and gives users full control over managing their crypto holdings.</p>
<p>We also like that Best Wallet has numerous other features that make it more than just a wallet, including unique insights on tokens, early access to new projects and reduced fees while trading.</p>
<p>That is make possible by the $BEST token, which has not yet launched but will be airdropped to active users of the wallet in the near future.</p>

<h3>6. Metaspins &#8211; 100% Matched Bonus up to 1 BTC</h3>
<p>Metaspins has a deceptively standard welcome bonus of 100% matched up to 1BTC &#8211; until you look at it. This bonus has one of the lowest wagering requirements of 25x.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88910/235409/metaspins-casino.jpg" alt="Metaspins rakeback rewards" /></figure>
<p>After the welcome bonus, players can earn points towards Metaspins loyalty program. This program has multiple levels that offer anywhere from 15% to 60% cashback on losses. 60% cashback is a huge amount, so we think Metaspins has one of the best loyalty programs for returning players of any Bitcoin casino.</p>

<h2>Types of Crypto Casino Welcome Bonuses</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are several common types of Bitcoin casino bonuses, each with their own advantages. Here, we’ll take a closer look at the different types of crypto casino bonuses and where players can find them.</p>
<h3>Deposit Match Bonuses</h3>
<p>Deposit match bonuses are by far the most common type of Bitcoin casino free bonuses available today. With a deposit bonus, the amount of bonus a player earns is proportional to the size of their deposit, up to a maximum bonus amount. Deposit match bonuses require that players make a deposit, unlike a Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus.</p>
<p>Here are the best Bitcoin deposit match bonus offers for 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/"><strong>BC.Game</strong></a> &#8211; Earn up to $220,000 over 4 deposits</li>
<li><a href="https://cloudbet.com/en/bitcoin-bonus?af_token=ae4254b0cbbf0760d3442112d77a6748&amp;aftm_campaign=cryptonews"><strong>Cloudbet </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 5 BTC with a 100% match</li>
<li><a href="https://refpa4903566.top///L?tag=b_1671237m_3425c_&amp;site=1671237&amp;ad=3425"><strong>1xBit </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 7 BTC over 4 deposits</li>
<li><a href="https://betflip.io/?refId=630f9b2a574c3d8d53f10986"><strong>BetFlip </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 5 BTC over 4 deposits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Free Spins Bonuses</h3>
<p>Free spins bonus offers give players free plays on a casino’s slot machines. They offer a fun way to try out popular slot games, and players have a chance to win big without risking any of their own money. The more free spins, the more chances a player has to win.</p>
<p>Some of the best free spins bonuses can be found at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mBit </strong>&#8211; Earn 300 free spins after first deposit</li>
<li><strong>Winz.io </strong>&#8211; Earn 300 free spins with no wagering requirement</li>
<li><strong>FortuneJack </strong>&#8211; Earn 250 free spins after first deposit</li>
<li><strong>Hell Spin </strong>&#8211; Earn 100 free spins with every reload</li>
</ul>
<h3>No Deposit Bonuses</h3>
<p>A Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus is a coveted type of reward that can’t be found very often. In fact, none of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm"><u>Bitcoin casinos</u></a> we reviewed currently offer a Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus in 2024 for USA players.</p>
<p>A no-deposit bonus gives a player free cash or free spins just for creating a casino account in any <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-casino-free-spins.htm">Bitcoin casino with free spins in the USA</a>. There’s no deposit required and a player can start using the bonus funds right away to start playing slots and other casino games. If the player runs out of bonus funds, they can either make a deposit to keep playing or simply switch to a new casino.</p>
<p>Bitcoin casino USA no no-deposit bonus offers tend to be much smaller than deposit match bonuses when they can be found. For example, a $100 USA crypto casino with no deposit bonus would be considered very large, while deposit match bonuses can exceed $100,000 in value.</p>
<h3>Reload Bonuses</h3>
<p>Reload bonuses are bonus offers targeted at returning players. They provide an incentive for players to make another deposit to their account after they’ve already played through the casino’s welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Reload bonuses can be quite generous. Here are some of the best offers for returning players:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hell Spin</strong> &#8211; 50% match up to $200 + 100 free spins</li>
<li><strong>Betflip </strong>&#8211; 100% match up to $1,500 on weekends</li>
<li><strong>BetOnline </strong>&#8211; 35% match up to $35</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loyalty Bonuses</h3>
<p>Some casinos also offer loyalty bonuses for returning players. These are distinct from reload bonuses because they don’t necessarily require players to make a new deposit. Instead, they offer players rewards based on the amount they’ve wagered or the frequency with which they visit a casino.</p>
<p>Some popular loyalty bonuses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1xBit</strong> &#8211; Promo code store for points-based promotions</li>
<li><strong>Thunderpick</strong> &#8211; Surprise bonus offers for returning players</li>
<li><strong>Metaspins </strong>&#8211; Earn up to 60% cashback on losses</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bitcoin Casino Bonus Codes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm"><u>Bitcoin gambling sites</u></a> require bonus codes in order to claim a welcome bonus or reload bonus. These promo codes are used to ensure that players are getting the latest bonus offer. They can also be used to track referrals or to enable players to choose between several different available bonus offers.</p>
<p>That said, many Bitcoin casinos choose to forgo bonus codes, especially for new players. In that case, a bonus is applied automatically whenever players qualify for it. This helps ensure that players never miss out on a bonus opportunity.</p>
<p>Here are the bonus codes for the best Bitcoin casino bonus offers:<br />

<h3>Bitcoin Casino Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions</h3>
<p>Bitcoin casino bonuses come with a fair amount of fine print. It’s important to understand the restrictions on bonus offers and how bonus cash can be used. Here are some of the key terms and conditions to know:</p>
<h3>Wager Requirement</h3>
<p>The wager requirement is perhaps the most important condition every player should know about when using Bitcoin casino bonuses. This is the amount, relative to the amount of the bonus, that a player must bet in order to be able to withdraw their bonus funds.</p>
<p>As an example, say a $1,000 bonus has a wager requirement of 40X. That means that in order for the player to withdraw the bonus cash or any winnings earned by betting the bonus money, they must first wager at least $40,000 at the casino.</p>
<h3>Game Restrictions</h3>
<p>Some of the best crypto casino bonuses can be played on any games that a casino offers, but this isn’t usually the case. More frequently, bonus cash can only be used for certain types of games, like slots.</p>
<p>Many casinos restrict bonuses from being used on live dealer games. There may also be specific games or software providers for which bonus funds cannot be used.</p>
<h3>Valid Period</h3>
<p>Bonuses often don’t last forever. Casinos may require that players meet a bonus’s wagering requirement within a certain amount of time, like 30 or 60 days. This means that players have to be strategic about how large a bonus they claim based on how much they think they will wager in the days or weeks after signing up for a new casino site.</p>
<h3>Win Limits</h3>
<p>Some casinos place limits on the amount that players can win when using bonus funds. While this sounds a little underhanded, these limits are usually quite high. They’re mainly intended to prevent players from winning a massive jackpot while betting with bonus funds.<br />

<h2>Top 5 Tips for Using Online Crypto Casino Bonuses</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To get the most out of crypto casino bonuses, it helps to have a few tricks. Here are our top tips for playing with crypto casino bonuses.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look for no deposit bonuses. </strong>No-deposit casino bonus offers are tough to find, but they appear from time to time. The best USA Bitcoin casino with no deposit bonus lets players try out a casino without risking any of their own funds.</li>
<li><strong>Play eligible games.</strong> Players need to make sure that once they claim a bonus, they’re sticking to games that count toward the wager requirement. Most casinos only offer a limited amount of time to meet the wager requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Bet big.</strong> Bonus funds and free spins are use-it-or-lose-it in most cases. So, it’s worth betting big with a bonus rather than playing carefully and potentially missing out on bonus cash.</li>
<li><strong>Be strategic about reloads.</strong> Players can stretch their money a lot further by being strategic about how and when they deposit money into their accounts. Many casinos offer extra reload bonuses on specific days of the week.</li>
<li><strong>Loyalty pays off. </strong>While it can be tempting to claim casino bonuses at many different casinos, loyalty has its own rewards. Often, returning players receive surprise bonuses and perks that can be worth a lot of money.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

<p>This is a multi-chain crypto hot wallet designed to address some of the challenges present in many current wallet offerings – such as multiple wallets required for various blockchains, lack of crypto news within the wallet, network bridges and NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-160551 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706867543-best-wallet-best-crypto-wallet-2024.webp" alt="best wallet - best crypto wallet 2024" width="1200" height="561" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706867543-best-wallet-best-crypto-wallet-2024.webp 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706867543-best-wallet-best-crypto-wallet-2024-300x140.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706867543-best-wallet-best-crypto-wallet-2024-1024x479.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706867543-best-wallet-best-crypto-wallet-2024-768x359.webp 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706867543-best-wallet-best-crypto-wallet-2024-104x50.webp 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706867543-best-wallet-best-crypto-wallet-2024-83x40.webp 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706867543-best-wallet-best-crypto-wallet-2024-150x70.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>To address this, the creators of Best Wallet have created a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem that covers every aspect of digital asset management.</p>
<p>The non-custodial software wallet, available as a mobile app,  allows users to interact with coins, tokens and NFTs from multiple chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB. This ensures users aren&#8217;t confined to a single chain, allowing them to access limitless digital assets.</p>
<p>It also has several unique features that place it above other wallets &#8211; that includes market insights on trending and upcoming tokens, details on token airdrops, and even a built-in decentralized exchange to allow users to trade any token. Best Wallet is shaping up to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges.htm">best no-KYC crypto exchanges</a> on the market.</p>
<p>Acting as the backbone of the ecosystem is the $BEST token, which is the utility and governance token. Holders who stake $BEST tokens will receive benefits, including access to advanced analysis tools, swaps without fees, early token launch access and NFT drops.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/333478/best-wallet-3.jpg" alt="Best wallet portfolio management feature" /></figure>
<p>The tokens are not yet available but regular users of the wallet are set to get a huge airdrop of tokens in the coming months &#8211; with a total of 10% of the supply will be distributed to active users.</p>
<p>All in all, Best Wallet aims to be more than just a crypto wallet, with the developers seeking to make it a comprehensive digital asset management solution for multiple blockchains.</p>

<h3>3. Coinbase Wallet – Beginner-Friendly Crypto Wallet with Biometric Verification</h3>
<p>Coinbase is one of the most popular exchanges for those looking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-make-money-with-cryptocurrency.htm">make money with cryptocurrency</a> since it has a stellar reputation due to its safety, asset selection, and regulatory approval. This exchange also offers a dedicated crypto wallet, free to use and available on smartphones, tablets, or as a Google Chrome extension, and is one of the better browser based wallets out there.</p>
<p>Notably, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/" rel="sponsored">Coinbase wallet</a> is a self-custody wallet. Custodial wallets let users have complete control over their crypto assets. The wallet supports over 100,000 coins/tokens, yet it also allows users to store their Ethereum and Polygon NFTs in the same place.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267115/coinbase.jpg" alt="Coinbase Wallet app" /></figure>
<p>Coinbase allows users to bolster the security level even more by enabling two-factor authentication and biometric verification. Aside from its security features, the wallet also excels since it essentially acts as a handheld crypto exchange. Users can instantly buy and sell coins/tokens using a credit/debit card and even withdraw funds to an external bank account.</p>
<p>Since the Coinbase wallet provides access to the decentralized web, users can also make the most of the universe of DeFi apps available to them. Several opportunities are available in this regard, such as using liquidity pools to generate a yield or even taking part in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</p>

<h3>4. YouHodler &#8211; An Excellent Crypto Wallet With Up To 15% APY on Popular Cryptocurrencies, Crypto Loans and Trading</h3>
<p>Next, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/youhodler/" rel="sponsored">YouHodler</a> is one of the leading crypto wallets because it offers multiple features, like staking and trading all through a single wallet. Store coins from multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, but also coins like ApeCoin and Decentraland. Through the crypto wallet, you can swap and trade this coins as you please.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334320/youhodler.jpg" alt="YouHodler home page" /></p>
<p>Those who don&#8217;t want to trade can still earn yield on the tokens they hold. For example, Litecoin offers the highest annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 15%, while Solana has an APY of up to 13%, which is more than the 8% APY you can get by staking it on the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>Stablecoins have a solid APY of up to 12% for USDT and USDC. But to get this yield, you need to advance your levels by trading or holding a certain amount of funds in your account. The Basic level APY is 6% for stablecoins, which is still competitive with other DeFi services and enough to offset the yearly inflation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334321/youhodl-yield.jpg" alt="YouHodler crypto earn" /></figure>
<p>Bitcoin holders get to earn up to 4.5% APY depending on their level. However, YouHodler offers the chance to earn up to 0.2 BTC per month with Bitcoin Cloud Miner. In this case, you need to complete tasks on the YouHodler platform to earn sparks. Sparks are used on the Cloud Miner to mine blocks and earn BTC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/117320/334326/cloud-miner.jpg" alt="YouHodler BTC cloud mining feature" /></figure>
<p>Those who need instant liquidity but don&#8217;t want to sell their crypto assets can use YouHodler&#8217;s crypto loans. With a loan-to-value of 90%, you can collateralize your crypto assets and get other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies like EUR, USD, CHF and GBP and withdraw them if you need to.</p>
<p>YouHodler is an EU and Swiss-based company, regulated in Switzerland and in some EU countries. The funds within the wallet are secured using the Ledger Vault technology with $150 million in pooled crime insurance. As for your personal account, you can secure it with 2FA and biometrics.</p>

<h3>5. Ledger – One of the Best Crypto Hardware Wallets With High Security and Multi-Chain Functionality</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/%20" rel="sponsored">Ledger crypto wallet</a> is a hardware wallet widely considered one of the safest ways for investors to store their digital assets, whether that be cryptocurrencies or NFTs. This is because it uses &#8220;cold storage,&#8221; meaning users&#8217; private keys are kept offline and safe from threats.</p>
<p>Ledger comes with a mobile and desktop app called Ledger Live where you can monitor your crypto portfolio, regardless of which blockchain, you can buy crypto with fiat, stake your coins or exchange them. Each Ledger wallet supports over 5,500+ crypto assets.</p>
<p>The Ledger app also lets you connect with third-party services, such as 1inch DEX, MoonPay, Lido staking, YouHodler and more.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/334363/ledger-live.jpg" alt="Ledger Live apps" /></figure>
<p>To use the Ledger wallet, you need either the Ledger Nano X, Ledger Nano S Plus or the Ledger Stax. Nano X is particularly interesting since it doesn&#8217;t just boast USB functionality, but it can also connect to devices via Bluetooth. This means, you can safely execute transactions on your smartphone without connecting the Ledger wallet via cable.</p>
<p>This hardware crypto wallet even sells physical &#8220;chains&#8221; that allow crypto-savvy individuals to wear their Ledger wallet around their neck!</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267116/ledger.jpg" alt="Ledger hardware wallet devices" /></figure>
<p>Ledger also has a vast library of educational resources where you can learn everything Web3 including how to stake coins, what is cloud mining and more.</p>

<p>Trezor&#8217;s added security also allows users to generate up to 16 recovery shares and store them in different places, meaning if one seed phrase is compromised then there are additional layers of protection.</p>
<p>It is also open source meaning its software is consistently reviewed and tested by third parties to keep its security transparent &#8211; main rival Ledger has closed-source firmware.</p>
<p>Trezor comes with its own desktop, mobile and browser app, called Trezor Suite. This lets you manage your coins by sending or receiving them, you can verify transactions or go incognito with Coinjoin. You can also directly purchase cryptocurrencies from within the app.</p>

<h3>7. OKX – User-Friendly Crypto Wallet with NFT Support &amp; DEX Aggregator</h3>
<p>Another hugely popular crypto wallet app suitable for beginners is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/" rel="sponsored">OKX</a> wallet. OKX describes its wallet as a &#8220;portal to Web3&#8221; since it contains various helpful features, including crypto asset storage, NFT support, and a decentralized exchange (DEX).</p>
<p>The great thing about the OKX wallet is its cross-chain support. At the time of writing, the wallet supports crypto assets from over 50 networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and OKTC. The OKX wallet’s interface is easy to navigate and doesn’t feature any complex jargon, making it suitable for beginners.</p>

<h3>8. Binance – World’s Largest Exchange with Free Crypto Wallet App</h3>
<p>Binance needs no introduction as it remains the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, facilitating daily trading volumes of over $6 billion. The exchange offers its own crypto wallet that links to the BNB Chain – Binance&#8217;s own blockchain network.</p>
<p>Unlike other top cryptocurrency wallets, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" rel="sponsored">Binance wallet</a> is structured as a browser extension, downloading on Google Chrome and other leading platforms. It&#8217;s free to download and use, enabling Binance users to store and manage their crypto holdings while interacting with other assets on the BNB Chain and Ethereum.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267112/binance.jpg" alt="Binance wallet mobile app" /></figure>
<p>Since the Binance wallet is inherently linked to the Binance exchange, users can instantly transfer their holdings from the latter to the former. The wallet supports over 380 cryptos and allows users to buy crypto instantly using a bank transfer or credit/debit card.</p>
<p>Those looking to explore the Binance ecosystem further can check out the exchange&#8217;s NFT marketplace and earnings protocols. Binance is also fantastic for active investors since it allows anyone to set up recurring buy orders to purchase specific assets at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Finally, the Binance crypto wallet enables users to send and receive crypto using QR codes instantly. This feature is essential for newcomers, as it mitigates the risk of using an incorrect wallet address and potentially losing funds forever.</p>

<h3>9. StrikeX Wallet &#8211; Investing Made Easy With a Simple, Secure, Multi Crypto DeFi Wallet</h3>
<p>Though not as well known as some of the other wallets on the market, <a href="https://tradestrike.io/strikex-wallet/" rel="sponsored"><u>StrikeX</u></a> could be quite the dark horse for those interested in security and ease of use. At the time of this writing, the StrikeX parent company (tradestrike.io) has an excellent <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/tradestrike.io" rel="sponsored"><u>4.8 star rating on Trustpilot</u></a>, and social reviews are often an accurate indicator of the quality of service. The StrikeX wallet app is available on both IOS and Android.</p>
<p>The simplicity of StrikeX is likely what has led to so many positive reviews. It has been built from the ground up to be easy to use, with clear instructions, an open interface, and excellent interoperability with other wallets. Users can build a wallet address list for easy transfer, so they don’t have to continually copy and paste long strings for repeat transactions.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/327034/screen-shot-2023-08-30-at.jpg" alt="StrikeX Wallet mobile app" /></figure>
<p>It’s also possible to buy crypto through the wallet with a credit or debit card. A cross-chain swap allows users to swap 15,000+ cryptocurrencies across twelve blockchains, and an in-app QR code allows for easy connection with Web3 websites and applications.</p>
<p>What StrikeX does really well is that it is simple and easy to use, but builds on this with advanced functions in a way that does not overwhelm new users. It allows users to track portfolio performance across multiple wallets with visual charting, and also provides an overall market overview.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/327035/screen-shot-2023-08-30-at.jpg" alt="StrikeX mobile app" /></figure>
<p>There are very few downsides associated with this simple yet powerful crypto wallet, and we were very impressed with the address list, a simple technique that few providers have adopted, but which greatly increases the convenience of the application, giving it a more familiar feel. It’s also a pure DeFi wallet &#8211; no personal identification is required to use it.</p>
<p>There are not many downsides with this wallet &#8211; but it only supports Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum &amp; Solana at the present time. Other than this, it is an ideal wallet for beginners who want to anonymously and securely send and receive their Web3 assets.</p>

<h2>Crypto Wallets Explained</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Now that we’ve identified the best crypto wallets for beginners, let’s take a closer look at what these wallets are. In simple terms, cryptocurrency wallets are software programs or hardware devices that allow users to store, manage, and transfer popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.</p>
<p>These wallets act as the holder&#8217;s &#8220;portal&#8221; to the crypto market, making it easy to hold crypto assets safely over the long term. Various types of wallets are on offer, such as &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets, which offer varying degrees of safety and functionality.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll explore these wallet types in more detail later, but it&#8217;s important to note that all wallets have a &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;private&#8221; key. These keys are essential since they prove asset ownership and enable wallet holders to send/receive funds.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/crypto-wallets-explained.jpg" alt="Ledger device among crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/" rel="sponsored">TripleA</a>, it’s estimated that over 420 million people worldwide own crypto. Most of these people are based in Asia and North America, although this figure is growing every month. Due to this vast customer base, the importance of using crypto wallets is more significant than ever – especially since the market is still relatively unregulated compared to &#8220;traditional&#8221; asset classes and hackers and scammers are extremely active.</p>
<p>Ultimately, crypto wallets act as a way to store crypto safely without keeping it on an exchange or brokerage account, giving an individual more power over their holdings.  Although there are various types of crypto wallets with specific features and security measures, all of them are designed to serve this purpose.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>How Do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Whether someone’s looking to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> or is more interested in well-established coins, it&#8217;s vital to understand how wallet storage works. Regardless of where the Bitcoin account is held, using a crypto wallet is critical for protecting crypto asset holdings from cyber attackers and other bad actors.</p>
<p>The simplest way of viewing crypto wallets is as a method for protecting an investor&#8217;s holdings, via access to their public and private keys. As noted above, these keys have essential use cases – but what do they do? Here&#8217;s a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Key</strong>: The public key can be considered the wallet&#8217;s &#8220;account number&#8221; and is used to receive funds from other individuals/businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Private Key</strong>: The private key is an alphanumeric code unique to each wallet and used to prove ownership of the crypto assets inside. In this sense, the private key is like a password – meaning it should never be shared with anyone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crypto wallets store and manage the private key – <i>not</i> the actual crypto assets. This is because the crypto assets are still held on the blockchain, meaning the private key simply provides <i>access</i> to them.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets are so important because they use advanced cryptographic techniques to protect the user&#8217;s private key, essentially a password. Different wallets have different approaches, but they can range from DDoS protection to biometric verification – and even 3D face scans.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/how-do-they-work.jpg" alt="eToro Money crypto wallet" /></figure>
<p>The best crypto wallets usually offer backup and recovery options that ensure users can’t lose access to their crypto. In the past, if a user lost their private key, their crypto assets could never be re-accessed. Nowadays, many wallet providers have recovery seed phrases and other features that can restore access, although it is important individuals also take great care not to share or lose those.</p>
<p>Whether a user opts for a crypto hardware wallet or a software wallet, partnering with a well-respected provider is essential. Moreover, it&#8217;s also vital that users follow security practices, like ensuring their private keys remain confidential and implementing a backup procedure.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Why Do You Need a Cryptocurrency Wallet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finding and using the best crypto wallet available is an integral part of the crypto-trading journey for beginners, especially if they plan to hold, trade or manage large sums of crypto. These wallets are essentially for safely storing, sending, and receiving digital currencies, making them like a &#8216;crypto bank account&#8217;.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve touched on earlier, traders need these crypto wallets since they keep the private key safe. The private key is the only way for someone to gain unauthorized access to the user&#8217;s funds – if this key is kept safe, the funds are inaccessible.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/why-do-you-need.jpg" alt="Crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-things-to-buy-with-bitcoin.htm">best things to buy with Bitcoin</a> can only be purchased by sending payment from a reputable wallet provider. Since crypto wallets make it easy to send crypto payments, they’re vital for buying goods/services online that are denominated in digital currencies.</p>
<p>Another critical feature of crypto wallets is that they allow users to have complete control over their crypto assets. Since cryptocurrencies are decentralized, they aren&#8217;t held by intermediaries like banks. Even holding on a centralized exchange comes with its own risk, as FTX customers previously found when the exchange collapsed leading to billions of dollars in investor losses, or if the exchange is hacked &#8211; like has been recently seen with Huobi Global, when $8 million was stolen in September 2023. Thus, having a self-custody crypto wallet will ensure that only the user &#8220;owns&#8221; the associated crypto assets.</p>
<p>Finally, crypto wallets are also important because they make it easy to access the crypto market. Most wallets allow users to instantly buy/sell crypto from within the wallet&#8217;s interface and many providers offer support for NFTs and DeFi protocols, significantly broadening the investment possibilities.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Types of Crypto Wallets &#8211; Hardware and Software, Hot and Cold, Paper</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Deciding to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-altcoins.htm">buy altcoins</a> or crypto tokens is a huge decision – yet choosing where to store them post-purchase is just as important.</p>
<p>We’ve already discussed what crypto wallets are, but there various types of wallets on offer with a litany of language that can leave beginners confused.</p>
<h3><strong>Software Wallets (Hot Wallet)</strong></h3>
<p>Software wallets are the most popular type of storage solution for crypto assets, especially for beginners. These digital platforms allow users to store and manage cryptos in a user-friendly manner. The most important thing to note about these wallets is that they’re connected to the internet – which is in stark contrast to hardware wallets.</p>
<p>There are two main types of software wallets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile wallets</strong>: These are smartphone apps designed to provide on-the-go access to the user’s cryptos. Mobile wallets are often offered for free by many top exchanges, like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/" rel="sponsored">Best Wallet</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop wallets</strong>: These are applications that can be downloaded and installed on the user&#8217;s computer. Desktop wallets are slightly safer than mobile wallets since they store the user&#8217;s private key locally on the computer &#8211; MetaMask is one such is example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, these wallet types are considered &#8220;hot&#8221; since they&#8217;re connected to the internet. This makes them more susceptible to cyberattacks than &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets which have no connection to the internet.</p>
<h3>Hardware Wallets (Cold Wallet)</h3>
<p>Alternatively, crypto holders can store their assets in hardware wallets, which are also often referred to as cold wallets &#8211; think cold storage &#8211; as they are not connected to the internet until a user connects a physical device.</p>
<p>A Bitcoin hardware wallet is a physical device used to store the user&#8217;s private keys. These devices usually look like USB sticks and hold the private key offline – meaning hackers can&#8217;t access it.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/hardware-wallets.jpg" alt="Ledger Nano X device" /></figure>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-crypto-hardware-wallet" rel="sponsored">Kraken</a>, hardware wallets are one of the most effective ways for a user to protect their private key and are a must for investors or traders who are managing extremely large sums of crypto.</p>
<p>It is simply not safe to have huge holdings linked to the internet at all times.</p>
<p>However, these wallets must be connected to another device, such as a laptop or smartphone, to initiate transactions. So, although they have a much higher security level, hardware wallets aren&#8217;t as user-friendly as software wallets.</p>
<p>Another downside is that as they are physical devices they come with additional cost to purchase &#8211; Trezor&#8217;s latest Model T, for example, costs in excess of $200.</p>
<h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3>
<p>The third wallet type is paper wallets. Unlike an online Bitcoin wallet, paper wallets are a type of “cold” storage that involves a user writing their public and private keys on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The user would then store this piece of paper somewhere safe where nobody else could access it &#8211; for example in a safe, safety deposit box or locker.</p>
<p>The downside to this approach is that those with paper wallets still eventually need to use a crypto wallet app to spend or transfer digital assets.</p>
<p>Thus, paper wallets are relatively impractical and considered less safe than the alternatives – hence why they aren’t widely used. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2>How to Find Safe Crypto Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finding the best Bitcoin wallet can be tricky – especially since so many options exist. However, we’ve identified three tactics that traders can employ to find safe crypto wallets effectively:</p>
<h3><strong>Use a Reputable Provider</strong></h3>
<p>The most important tactic to use is only choosing crypto wallets offered by reputable providers. It&#8217;s a good idea to read online reviews and check a potential provider&#8217;s track record before downloading the wallet that they offer. Many crypto wallet providers are even endorsed by high-profile individuals or businesses, which can boost credibility.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Many of the top providers listed in this guide have a long track record of success in the space and high security scores. However, even highly-trusted wallets can be susceptible to attacks &#8211; Atomic Wallet was one of the leading providers in the space before North Korean hacker group Lazarus stole more than $100 million of customer funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Consider the Wallet’s Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>When <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm">choosing a Bitcoin wallet</a>, it&#8217;s also essential to thoroughly research the wallet&#8217;s security features. We&#8217;ll explore this further in the next section, although it typically involves checking the type of encryption on offer and deciding whether to use a hot or a cold wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/consider-security-features.jpg" alt="eToro Money wallet features" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Test the Wallet Before Making Large Transfers</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, it may be best to test out a wallet with a small amount of crypto before fully committing. This minimizes the risk of catastrophic loss while allowing users to test the wallet&#8217;s functionality and security features. Assuming the wallet is up to the task, users can confidently transfer more significant amounts of crypto.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Much like when choosing between the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best AI crypto trading bots</a>, deciding which cryptocurrency wallet to use involves analyzing various factors and will also come down to user preference.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at six of the most important factors to consider:</p>
<h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>The single most important factor to review when choosing a wallet is its security features. This includes the encryption technology it uses, how it manages the user&#8217;s private key and any backup options it has.</p>
<p>Many of the best Bitcoin wallets also offer two-factor authentication and biometric verification to enhance security further. There are even multi-signature wallets, which means they have two private keys rather than one.</p>
<p>Cold wallets are automatically much safer than hot wallets &#8211; due to them not being connected to the internet, hackers cannot access those funds without having physical access to the hardware device.</p>
<h3><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Another important consideration is the type of wallet to use. This can be boiled down to using either one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-hot-wallets.htm">best hot wallets</a> or a cold wallet. As noted earlier, the former is connected to the internet, while the latter isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>A crypto hardware wallet is generally considered the safest way to store a trader&#8217;s private key. However, they can sometimes be impractical; if practicality is the primary concern, a software wallet may be more suitable.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Those trading crypto daily would likely prefer a hot wallet as they want fast and easy access to funds.</p>
<p>But users should always choose a cold wallet if they are holding large sums of crypto over an extended period of time, and only connect to the internet when they wish to make a specific transaction &#8211; buying, selling or transferring elsewhere &#8211; and then disconnect.</p>
<h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3>
<p>Navigating the market can be tricky for beginners, so user-friendliness is an important consideration. Users should review a wallet&#8217;s interface design and ease of setup, both of which are crucial for making the trading process accessible to beginners.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is whether the wallet comes with any help or support. Most prominent providers, like OKX, have dedicated help centers with answers to the most commonly-asked questions, which can be a blessing to newbie investors.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are not particularly difficult to use but add a another step compared to software wallets, with the likes of Trezor not having a mobile app on iOS also another thing to consider.</p>
<h3><strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="sponsored">CoinMarketCap</a>, the crypto market is now valued at over $1.6+ trillion with tens of thousands of coins available.</p>
<p>Given the scale of the market, more new coins and tokens are springing up every week – so it’s a good idea to choose the best cryptocurrency wallet for asset selection.</p>
<p>Almost all crypto wallets will support the largest coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the top wallets also offer support for lesser-known tokens and stablecoins, which can be highly beneficial.</p>
<p>MetaMask is one of the best wallets for supported cryptos as it has multi-chain functionality and supports a massive range of tokens, as well as those new to the market.</p>
<h3><strong>Features &amp; Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>Users should also check out the wallet&#8217;s features and functionality. For example, if a user wishes to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-defi-coins.htm">best DeFi coins</a>, they should check whether the wallet provides access to the decentralized web.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/features-functionality.jpg" alt="NFT marketplace" /></figure>
<p>Many wallets also provide functionality for NFT storage alongside their crypto storage options. This can be a great benefit for investors interested in obtaining cryptos and NFTs to create a well-rounded portfolio of digital assets.</p>
<p>For NFTs specifically, investors who hold images from highly valuable collections should also consider placing them in cold storage and only connecting to the internet when carrying out a specific task such as selling.</p>
<h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, users should also consider the fees associated with using a wallet. Most software wallets are free to download and use – the only fees to be aware of are network fees that occur during transfers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, those who choose to use a Bitcoin hardware wallet must be aware that these wallets have an up-front cost since they are physical devices.</p>
<p>The price of these devices can vary significantly, although it usually ranges between $50 and $300, depending on the provider and model.</p>
<h2>How to Get &amp; Use a Crypto Wallet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

As noted earlier, our recommended crypto wallet app is offered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/" rel="sponsored">Best Wallet</a>, which is free to download, simple to use, and available on iOS and Android devices.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 2 – Create Account</strong></h3>
<p>Next, the app will ask you to use a current email address to create your account. Simply input your email address or select &#8216;Continue with Apple/Google&#8217; to quickly input an email address that&#8217;s already saved to your phone.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 – Confirm Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>Once an email address has been put in, the app will ask if you would like to add two-factor authentication (2FA), which means it will send you a six-digit code when you log in for added security.</p>
<p>This step can be stepped, although it is not possible to skip the next step which is inputting and confirming a four-digit password.</p>
<p>There is also the additional security feature of enabling fingerprint login which, if chosen, will allow users to skip putting in a password each time and just continue instantly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sports betting industry is far more complex than many people realize. While you may think you can simply put cash down on your favorite horse in the race, much more goes on behind the scenes, which brings us to bookmaking.</p>
<p>What is a bookmaker, what do they do, and how do they affect the outcome of your bet?</p>
<p>Bookmakers act similarly to casinos but for the sports betting world. The bookmaker can create odds for different matches, accept player bets, and pay out funds to winners after the game. Bookies, for short, essentially maintain everything revolving around sports betting wagering to ensure that balances remain even for winners and losers.</p>
<p>If this sounds confusing, don&#8217;t worry. We&#8217;ll cover everything you need to know below, like how they profit and determine the odds.</p>
<h2>What Do Bookmakers Actually Do?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Back in the day, people bet on sports by simply betting with each other. It was a simpler time. In the 20th and 21st centuries, though, the United States strictly prohibited sports betting aside from in Nevada because of Las Vegas, of course.</p>
<p>Because of this, a black market for sports betting emerged over time, creating the need for someone to facilitate the market. Those &#8220;someones&#8221; became bookmakers.</p>
<p>Some bookies developed large-scale networks of organized crime, while others simply accepted a few wagers from friends and family members. Over time, the sports betting industry grew so large that the Supreme Court had no option but to lift the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act by 2018, allowing individual states to determine whether or not they permit gambling.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the global sports betting market is worth <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3040540/Global-sports-gambling-worth-3-trillion.html">$3 trillion</a>, over <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/u-s-sports-betting-here-is-where-all-50-states-currently-stand-on-legalizing-online-sports-betting-sites/">30</a> U.S. states have legalized sports betting, and bookmakers are still facilitating this roaring market.</p>
<h2>So, what does a bookie do?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bookmakers open betting markets on different sporting events and then set odds based on potential outcomes that could occur. Next, they facilitate wagering by accepting bets and paying out winners.</p>
<p>Because of the modern digital era, most bookmakers exist online now to provide bettors with easy virtual betting platforms. Bookmakers often offer betting on exciting events beyond the world of sports, like political outcomes, Oscar winners, half-time performances, and more.</p>
<h2>How Bookmakers Set Odds</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We know what you&#8217;re wondering: How does a bookie work? Bookmakers want to make money just like everyone else, so they need to ensure that the odds are in their favor. To do so, they often employ professional statisticians or use complex equations to determine the odds of winning any given sporting event.</p>
<p>While these statisticians can use advanced software to inform their decisions, they still must be extremely knowledgeable in mathematics. Such teams are responsible for setting odds and lines that affect not only player outcomes but whether or not the bookmaker will profit.</p>
<p>To explain odds in the most simple terms, bookmakers assign probabilities to all possible outcomes, with the total adding up to 100%. For example, in a football game, the two possible outcomes of the game could be a 35% chance of Team A winning and a 65% chance of Team B winning.</p>
<h3>Understanding Odds and Their Calculation</h3>
<p>To calculate odds, bookmakers and their teams usually underscore whichever team they believe may win the event. In general, higher odds suggest a lower likelihood that that team will win, meaning you could receive a higher payout for betting on the underdog team.</p>
<p>Bookmakers have access to rich databases filled with sports data to help them inform their calculations. As the event comes closer, they can adjust their spreads based on the bets they receive.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find that odds for the same sporting events are usually about the same across bookmaker websites. This typically occurs because bookmakers follow the same formulas for calculating their odds.</p>
<p>It might seem strange when you notice that odds can change within the minutes leading up to the game, so let&#8217;s discuss the different factors that can influence these calculations at any given time.</p>
<h3>Factors Influencing Odds Setting</h3>
<p>Bookmakers don&#8217;t just look at raw data when setting odds and spreads. Many factors affect how humans perform during sporting events, so bookies consider all of these factors when setting odds.</p>
<p>First off, bookmakers look at the team&#8217;s recent performance and historical data to determine whether or not they&#8217;re favored to win. Then, they look more closely at individual players and how they may match up against each other during the game. If they discover sudden injuries or suspensions, this can greatly sway the odds of one team winning versus the other.</p>
<p>Bookmakers also consider which team has the home-court advantage and how well the weather will favor them in this location. Statisticians can also look at which team the general public typically favors when they play head-to-head.</p>
<p>As game day approaches, bookmakers keep their eyes on market fluctuations and adjust the odds accordingly. During the game, bookmakers offer in-play bets, with the odds updating in real time. This fast-action movement typically reflects the bettor market rather than all the factors we just went over.</p>
<h3>Profit Margin</h3>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve answered, &#8220;What is a bookmaker in gambling?&#8221; let&#8217;s go over how they make money. Bookmakers charge fees on all the bets they accept to ensure that they can take home commissions. The fee, also known as the vigorish (or vig), allows bookies to have higher incoming profits than outgoing payments for bets they owe to winners.</p>
<p>To achieve a successful profit margin, bookmakers have to adjust the odds in a way that balances the amount of people betting on losses versus wins. This calculation, on top of the vig, allows them to capitalize and turn a profit.</p>
<p>Most bookmakers take home around 10% in their profit margins. For big games, like the Super Bowl, though, bookmakers may charge higher fees of around 20% or more.</p>
<h2>The Vigorish (Vig) Explained</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To truly understand how bookies make their money, let&#8217;s look at a detailed example of the vig, which many refer to as the bookmaker&#8217;s juice. The main reason many struggle to make big earnings in sports betting is because of this overlooked premium that all players must pay.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re betting on a hockey match between teams A and B. For the sake of this example, we&#8217;ll say the teams have perfectly even odds of winning. Team A and B&#8217;s odds would be 50/50, 2.00, or +100, depending on which model you prefer to follow.</p>
<p>While these odds seem fair, the actual odds that the bookmakers set won&#8217;t appear nearly as forgiving. Rather than seeing 2.00 decimal odds for each team, you&#8217;d likely see something around 1.91 for both Teams A and B. So if you wagered $10 on Team A, for example, you&#8217;d stand to win $9.10.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s say Team A does win. Anyone who bet on Team B will lose their $10 while you get to celebrate your $19.10 earnings (including your $9.10 initial stake and a $10 payout from the loser). The bookmaker, on the other hand, would profit $0.90 even though they wagered the same amount on two outcomes with equal odds.</p>
<p>Essentially, the bookmaker came out ahead because they built in a profit margin. This profit margin causes the bettor to receive smaller payouts and skewed betting lines.</p>
<p>The above example displays how the vig works on even odds. In reality, bookmakers must also calculate odds to keep their books balanced for fair payouts while also maintaining their profit margins, so you can see why being an expert mathematician is key here.</p>
<h2>Risks in Bookmaking</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bookmaking may not be the risky business it was in the 20th century, but it&#8217;s still nowhere near risk-free. From losing profits to ending up with a lawsuit, bookmakers face a field of risks. While being a mathematician could help you mitigate some risks associated with odds and profit margins, statistics don&#8217;t even touch the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>One major concern that bookmakers face is fraud. For example, in 2022, Betfred faced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/28/betfred-fined-pounds-2-point-9m-gambling-safety-checks-money-laundering-controls">$3.5 million</a> in fines for accepting tens of millions of pounds from gamblers without performing the required safety checks to prevent money laundering.</p>
<p>Beyond fraud, digital bookmakers (which dominate the industry) must battle cybersecurity concerns. Even the most minor data breaches or hacking incidents can quickly crumble an entire institution, requiring bookmakers to pay millions back to bettors. Cybersecurity attacks can ruin bookmakers&#8217; reputations while threatening their finances.</p>
<p>The most obvious risk bookmakers face, though, is insufficient liquidity. If the house doesn&#8217;t have enough funds to pay winners, the whole process collapses.</p>
<p>The best way bookmakers can mitigate all of these risks is by investing in the proper tools. For example, cybersecurity insurance and fraud protection can prevent some financial issues, while advanced statisticians can ensure that bookmakers always have enough liquid cash to prevent collapses.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Odds Based on Betting Patterns</h3>
<p>Bookmakers must stay flexible if they want to reduce their risks. All bookies adjust odds based on real-time patterns to ensure the best possible outcomes. For example, if a lot of people are betting on the favored team during the few minutes leading up to the game, bookmakers may increase the odds on the underdog.</p>
<p>Bookmakers know how to locate and analyze many patterns, from bettor preferences and player behaviors to favorable market conditions. They use these patterns to develop odds that ensure their profits.</p>
<h2>Different Types of Bets and Their Profitability</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Sports betting involves seemingly endless types of betting, all the way down to what color a team may wear. Some of these bets are riskier than others, making some more profitable for bookmakers.</p>
<p>Bookmakers make it seem that betting on complex wagers will increase your odds of winning. Of course, this is simply a marketing tactic to increase their odds of profiting.</p>
<p>A single-win bet, the most straightforward of all, is typically the least risky and the least profitable for bookmakers. On the other hand, complex bets involving multiple layers have increased risks and, therefore, are more profitable for bookmakers. For example, bets like doubles, trebles, or accumulators require risky, layered bet slips that typically allow bookmakers to profit more.</p>
<p>Some sports also provide higher ROIs, on average, than others. According to data from <a href="https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/guides/finance/best-sports-to-bet-on/">Sports Betting Dime</a>, the sports leagues with the highest ROIs for betting on the moneyline, against the spread, or under/over include college football and basketball, the NFL, the NBA, the NHL, and MLB.</p>
<h2>Spread Betting and Its Impact on Bookmaker Earnings</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We&#8217;ve mentioned spreads, but what are these, and how do they affect payouts? Spread betting is the most popular type of sports betting, as it levels the playing field between the teams.</p>
<p>Rather than simply betting on which team will win or lose, as you would in a moneyline, a spread positions one team as the favorite and one as the underdog, defining a line between the two. This line subtracts points from the favorite&#8217;s total to provide more balanced betting.</p>
<p>For example, if Team A is favored to win by -8 against Team B, that means Team A will need to score at least eight more points than Team B for them to &#8220;win.&#8221; If you bet on Team A, and they score exactly 8 points above Team B, you will get your bet back and no more, but if they score more than 8 points, you will win your bet.</p>
<p>Spreads improve the profitability for underdog bettors and bookmakers because they provide improved odds for anyone betting on the underdog. In the example above, the underdog doesn&#8217;t even need to win the game for underdog bettors to win; they simply need to lose by fewer than eight points.</p>
<h2>Challenges in Bookmaking</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the challenges in bookmaking revolve around the risks of the job. You must have a lot of knowledge of the sports markets you&#8217;re betting in while having a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, finances, and more.</p>
<p>At the same time, all the knowledge in the world still cannot prepare you for the unforeseen outcomes of sporting events, so you must have enough liquid cash and profit margin prepared for errors.</p>
<h2>How Bookmakers Leverage Bettor Psychology</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bookmakers often leverage bettor psychology by taking advantage of gambling addictions, losses, superstitions, and biases. For example, many bookies provide additional bets you can add to your wager upon losing your initial one. From an outside perspective, this may not seem like a smart financial decision, but bookmakers present the option as an opportunity to recoup your losses.</p>
<p>From providing promotions for depositing more money to adjusting odds based on bettor habits, bookmakers know how to encourage players to increase their comfort in risk-taking.</p>
<h2>Legal and Regulatory Aspects</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As of 2024, sports betting is legal in 37 states. Despite more states legalizing gambling each year, bookmakers still face legality concerns. Legislation changes frequently, so bookmakers have to keep up with all of the certification requirements, tax laws, regulations, and more to ensure that they&#8217;re operating legally.</p>
<p>To stay compliant, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">sports betting websites</a> must follow <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/list-of-approved-kyc-rules">KYC (know your customer)</a> and anti-money laundering frameworks while acquiring consent from players. Beyond this, many websites use security features like SSL encryption to prevent data breaches.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
So, what is a bookmaker in betting? Bookies facilitate sports betting by adjusting odds for balanced outcomes, collecting wagers, and paying out winnings. As with everything in the gambling industry, the carefully calculated job comes with high risks &#8211; but also, potentially, high rewards.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3>What Is the Role of a Bookmaker?</h3>
<p>The role of a bookmaker, or bookie, is to facilitate fair sports betting. Bookies adjust odds to ensure that an even number of wagers win and lose for balanced funds. On a day-to-day basis, bookmakers are in charge of accepting or placing bets and then paying out winnings, similar to traditional casinos.</p>
<h3>How Does a Bookmaker Make Money?</h3>
<p>Bookmakers make their money by charging fees on top of wagers, also known as the vigorish (vig). Bookmakers can capitalize on multiple wager fees like the vig to take home commissions of around 10% to 20%. Bookies can usually cash out their percentages at the end of the week.</p>
<h3>Why Is Bookmaking Illegal?</h3>
<p>Bookmaking is only illegal if the bookie facilitates betting in a state that prohibits gambling. Gambling laws are determined by the state, so bookmakers can only operate legally in certain areas, even if they are providing their services online. As of 2024, sports betting is legal in 37 states.</p>

<p>Sports betting is also legal in Washington D.C., the capital city and federal district of the United States.</p>
<p>Before we launch into detailed sports betting regulations for all 50 states, it may be helpful to take a look at the history of sports wagering in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 1992, the federal government created the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), also known as the Bradley Act, which restricted all but a few states from any form of legalized sports gambling. This law may have had good intentions, but it allowed for the rise of underground sportsbooks and betting sites, many of which were run by the mob.</p>
<p>Years later, facing an economic recession, the federal government realized it needed to find new sources of tax revenue. In 2018, the Supreme Court struck down PASPA in a 7-2 decision, lifting the ban and allowing states to make their own rules for sports betting.</p>
<p>Although sports betting was now federally legal, legislators still faced significant hurdles to legalizing it at the state level. Below, we take a look at the legality of sports betting in each state.</p>
<h2>Legal Status of All 50 States</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3>Alabama</h3>
<p>Both in-person and online sports betting are currently illegal in Alabama, although there has been strong interest in passing a law that would make it legal. In 2021, such a bill made it to the Alabama Senate floor but promptly died. The following year, legislators proposed a constitutional amendment that would legalize sports betting and create a state lottery. That bill also failed.</p>
<p>However, there is still hope. Senator Greg Albritton believes there will be strong support for legalized sports betting in 2024, partly because the bordering states of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Florida currently allow sports wagering. Proponents believe that Alabama will eventually legalize betting to prevent the loss of tax revenue to other states.</p>
<h3>Alaska</h3>
<p>Both types of sports betting are currently illegal in Alaska, and that likely won’t change any time soon. The state’s isolation and vast landmass make it rather unappealing for sportsbooks, so they’re unlikely to lobby the government for change.</p>
<p>However, there have been a few attempts at making sports betting legal. In February 2022, Rep. Adam Wool introduced a bill, HB 385, that would legalize online sports betting. The Alaska Legislature adjourned in May 2022 with no action taken on the bill.</p>
<h3>Arizona</h3>
<p>Good news for those living in Arizona: Both online and in-person sports betting are 100% legal. Legalization came into effect in 2021 when Governor Doug Ducey signed sports wagering legislation into law.</p>
<p>Sports betting is legal for anyone 21 and up in Arizona. There are currently 16 sportsbooks in the state, including DraftKings, BetMGM, and BetRivers.</p>
<h3>Arkansas</h3>
<p>Arkansas was one of the first states to legalize sports betting just six months after the Supreme Court struck down PASPA. Voters approved a statewide ballot in November 2018, allowing retail sportsbooks to launch in July 2019. Online sports betting came a few years later, in March 2022.</p>
<p>Arkansas has just three legal sportsbooks to choose from, which is quite a few less than other states. Sportsbooks Betly, BetSaracen, and Oaklawn Sports have retail locations scattered throughout the state.</p>
<h3>California</h3>
<p>Both retail and online sports wagering are currently illegal in California. Prop 26 and 27 aimed to legalize wagering, but both failed to pass in 2022. Prop 26 received 70% “No” votes, while Prop 27 failed with a whopping 83% “No” votes.</p>
<p>In October 2023, two new initiatives were filed with the California Attorney General’s office in another attempt to legalize sports betting. To appear on the ballot, these initiatives would have to collect nearly 900,000 signatures.</p>
<p>Part of the reason sports betting remains illegal is opposition from the state’s tribal leaders. Without this support, there’s almost no chance of legalization.</p>
<h3>Colorado</h3>
<p>Both online and retail sports betting became legal in 2019 with the passage of Proposition DD. Residents voted “Yes” to legalization by a slim margin, and shortly thereafter, sportsbooks began popping up throughout the state.</p>
<p>There are currently 20 legal sportsbooks in Colorado, which is more than any other state. A few favorites include FanDuel, bet365, Draft Kings, and Caesars Sportsbook.</p>
<h3>Connecticut</h3>
<p>Sports betting became legal in Connecticut after Governor Ned Lamont signed new tribal gambling compacts in 2021. Residents can bet on all major sports leagues and college sports, except Connecticut-based teams (unless the team is competing in a tournament).</p>
<p>Currently, DraftKings, FanDuel, and SugarHouse are partnered with the Connecticut Lottery to offer sports betting in the state. Fanatics will soon be replacing SugarHouse as the company recently pulled out of a 10-year agreement with the state.</p>
<h3>Delaware</h3>
<p>Delaware was one of the first legal sports betting sites after the Supreme Court struck down PASPA. Both retail and online wagering are allowed, but the state hasn’t currently launched any online betting apps and doesn’t yet have plans to do so.</p>
<p>Delaware residents have just three retail options for betting: Delaware Park Casino &amp; Racing, Bally’s Dover Casino Resort, and Harrington Raceway and Casino.</p>
<h3>Florida</h3>
<p>Both online and retail sports wagering are legal in Florida, but the path to getting there hasn’t been easy. In 2021, the state agreed to give the Seminole Tribe the exclusive right to operate a betting app in Florida. However, the tribe took down the app after an onslaught of legal challenges and disagreements among lawmakers.</p>
<p>Online sports betting resumed in November 2023. Currently, Hard Rock Bet is the only legal sportsbook in the state. This sportsbook has six retail locations throughout Florida.</p>
<h3>Georgia</h3>
<p>There have been several efforts to legalize retail and online sports betting in Georgia, but so far, none have succeeded. In 2023, a bill that would have legalized sports betting failed to pass through the Senate. Other bills were put up for vote, but the 2023 legislative session ended without passing any of them.</p>
<p>Sports betting proponents expect lawmakers to renew their efforts for legalization in 2024.</p>
<h3>Hawaii</h3>
<p>Hawaii doesn’t have any form of sports betting — or any type of gambling at all, for that matter. Because the state has no casinos or lottery, it would be quite difficult to get sports betting up and running.</p>
<p>There have been some attempts at legalization, though. In 2023, lawmakers introduced a bill that would legalize poker and sports betting while bringing a retail sportsbook to Oahu. This bill did not pass.</p>
<h3>Idaho</h3>
<p>Both retail and online sports betting are illegal in Idaho and will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future. There have been zero attempts to introduce a bill that would legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court deemed PASPA unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Idaho does have several options if it chooses to legalize sports betting. The state has seven tribal casinos that could serve as retail sportsbooks. It could also choose an online-only format run through the state’s lottery.</p>
<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p>Retail and online sports betting are both legal in Illinois, but the path to reach legalization has been a rocky one. After several false starts, lawmakers finally managed to push legal sports betting through as part of a 900-page bill that Governor JB Pritzker signed in 2019.</p>
<p>Residents can bet on professional leagues and college sports at one of eight sportsbooks, including BetMGM, DraftKings, and BetRivers.</p>
<h3>Indiana</h3>
<p>Indiana legalized retail and online sports betting in 2019. This decision has proved financially advantageous for the state, with its sports handle hitting a record $513.6 million in November 2023.</p>
<p>Indiana residents have more than a dozen sportsbooks to choose from, including BetMGM, Caesars Sportsbook, and FanDuel.</p>
<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p>In Iowa, online and retail sports betting became legal in 2019. At first, bettors had to register at one of the state’s in-person sportsbooks, but now it’s legal to register online as well.</p>
<p>State law allows residents 21+ to bet on professional and college-level sports. It’s legal to bet on in-state college games; however, residents are prohibited from making prop bets on those events.</p>
<p>Iowa has 17 legal sportsbooks to choose from, including Betway, FanDuel, and BetRivers.</p>
<h3>Kansas</h3>
<p>Kansas became one of many legal sports betting states in 2022 when Governor Laura Kelly signed SB 84 into law. The bill officially went into effect in July 2022, making this one of the quickest launches of sports wagering nationwide.</p>
<p>There are currently six sportsbooks operating in Kansas, although legislation allows for up to 12, so residents could have more options in the future. Sportsbooks include DraftKings, BetMGM, and FanDuel.</p>
<h3>Kentucky</h3>
<p>Kentucky is one of the most recent states to legalize retail and online sports wagering. Seven sports betting apps went live in September 2023, including ESPN Bet, FanDuel, and Caesars. Bettors can wager on professional and collegiate sports.</p>
<p>Kentucky is an interesting outlier when it comes to betting age. Unlike many states that require bettors to be at least 21, residents 18+ can bet on sports within the state. Some online wagering apps require bettors to be 21+, though.</p>
<h3>Louisiana</h3>
<p>Louisiana has long been known for its thriving casino industry, so it should come as no surprise that online and retail sports wagering are legal here. Louisiana has legalized wagering in 55 of the state’s 64 parishes.</p>
<p>Legislation allows for up to 40 online sports wagering apps, but there are currently only eight in operation. They include PointsBet, bet365, and BetMGM.</p>
<h3>Maine</h3>
<p>Retail and online sports wagering became legal in Maine in 2022. Governor Janet Mills granted exclusive mobile sports wagering rights to the state’s Wabanaki Tribes, three of which have partnered with Caesars Sportsbook. Residents can also place their bets with DraftKings.</p>
<h3>Maryland</h3>
<p>Both retail and online sports wagering are legal in Maryland. Legalization occurred in 2021 after Governor Larry Hogan signed HB 940 into law. However, the sports betting launch was delayed until November 2023, when online sportsbooks finally began taking bets.</p>
<p>There are currently ten legal sportsbooks in the state, although legislation allows for up to 60. Online sportsbooks include DraftKings, BetRivers, and BetMGM. Those who prefer in-person wagering can head to Greenmount Station, Horseshoe Baltimore, Ocean Downs, or one of several other retail sportsbooks throughout the state.</p>
<h3>Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Massachusetts retail and online sports wagering became legal in 2022. Retail sports betting launched on January 31, 2023, and online wagering followed on March 10.</p>
<p>Bettors can wager on professional leagues but cannot bet on college-level teams (unless the teams are in a tournament). Betting is limited to residents 21+.</p>
<p>Legislation allows for up to 15 sportsbooks, eight of which are tied to a land-based partner. Sportsbooks include FanDuel, WynnBET, and Betr.</p>
<h3>Michigan</h3>
<p>Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed the bill to legalize sports wagering in 2019. Retail sportsbooks launched in 2020, but online wagering apps had a slower start and launched several months later in January 2021.</p>
<p>It’s legal to bet on pro and in-state college sports teams in Michigan. The state also allows residents to bet on some entertainment awards ceremonies, such as the Oscars.</p>
<p>There are currently 14 sportsbooks operating in Michigan, including FanDuel, Caesars, and BetMGM.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p>Minnesota is not one of the legal sports betting states. Lawmakers proposed new legislation that would legalize wagering in 2023, but bills fell short of passage.</p>
<p>Minnesota regulators are expected to make another attempt at legalization in 2024. Reportedly, gaming company IGT has been in talks with officials, which could prompt the introduction of new sports wagering bills.</p>
<h3>Mississippi</h3>
<p>Retail sports wagering has been legal in Mississippi since 2018. Many residents would love an online betting option, but wagering over the Internet is currently illegal in the state. Bettors must be located at a land-based, licensed casino to place bets.</p>
<p>Residents have quite a few retail sportsbooks to choose from, including Fitz Casino Hotel Tunica, Bally’s Vicksburg, and Harrah’s Gulf Coast.</p>
<h3>Missouri</h3>
<p>There have been substantial efforts to legalize retail and online sports betting in Missouri, but so far, none have succeeded. Although the legislation passed the House in 2023, it failed in the Senate, so lawmakers must wait until the 2024 session to try again.</p>
<p>Five of Missouri’s neighboring states allow sports betting, so proponents expect the eventual legalization of sports wagering to discourage residents from heading across state lines.</p>
<h3>Montana</h3>
<p>Montana is a friendly state for sports bettors. State law allows all licensed lottery retailers to offer on-site sports betting, which means residents can head to one of hundreds of sportsbooks to place their bets.</p>
<p>Online sports betting is technically allowed, but residents must be physically located at a retail sportsbook to use this option.</p>
<h3>Nebraska</h3>
<p>Retail sports betting has been legal in Nebraska since 2021. Online sports wagering isn’t yet legal, and it’s unclear whether this will change soon.</p>
<p>Residents can place bets at one of two retail sportsbooks: Grand Island Casino Resort and WarHorse Casino in Lincoln.</p>
<h3>Nevada</h3>
<p>Sports betting has been legal in Nevada since 1949. It was one of the few states not affected by PASPA, which made exceptions for states with existing state wagering programs.</p>
<p>Although online sports betting is legal, getting started is a bit complicated. Residents will need to download a sportsbook app, head to one of their retail locations, complete an application, and make their first deposit in person and in cash.</p>
<h3>New Hampshire</h3>
<p>Sports betting was legalized in New Hampshire with the passage of HB 480 in 2019. New Hampshire law allows for up to 10 sportsbooks in the state, and so far, 16 cities have authorized the placement of retail sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Currently, three sportsbooks operate in New Hampshire, all of which are run by DraftKings.</p>
<h3>New Jersey</h3>
<p>Retail and online sports betting became legal in New Jersey in 2018. Residents can choose from one of 16 sports betting apps, including FanDuel, DraftKings, and BetRivers. If residents want to bet in person, they may have to head to Atlantic City, as most of the state’s retail sportsbooks are located there.</p>
<h3>New Mexico</h3>
<p>Retail sports betting has been legal in New Mexico since 2018. Residents can only place bets at one of five tribal casinos, including Buffalo Thunder Casino, Route 66 Casino, Santa Ana Star Casino, and Inn of the Mountain Gods.</p>
<p>Residents don’t yet have any options for online sports betting, and it’s unclear whether there will be any legalization efforts in 2024.</p>
<h3>New York</h3>
<p>New York legalized in-person sports betting in 2019, with online sports betting following in 2021. Residents can currently bet using one of nine apps, including PointsBet, DraftKings, and BetRivers.</p>
<h3>North Carolina</h3>
<p>Both retail and online sports betting are legal in North Carolina, but bettors will have to wait until 2024 until online wagering launches in the state. For now, residents can place bets at Catawba Two Kings Casino and one of two Harrah’s casinos.</p>
<p>Legislation will allow for up to 12 online sportsbooks in North Carolina. It’s unclear which will launch in the state, but experts believe FanDuel, Caesars, and BetMGM are likely picks.</p>
<h3>North Dakota</h3>
<p>Retail sports betting was legalized in North Dakota in 2021. The state allows federally recognized tribes to accept bets on their reservation lands. Three have opened sportsbooks: Sky Dancer Casino &amp; Resort, Dakota Magic Casino, and 4 Bears Casino and Lodge.</p>
<p>Online sports betting currently isn’t legal in North Dakota. Lawmakers rejected a bill to legalize online wagering in 2021, and it’s unclear whether any efforts will be made in 2024.</p>
<h3>Ohio</h3>
<p>Ohio is one of the most recent states to legalize sports wagering. Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 29 into law in 2021, and 16 sportsbooks launched in January 2023. Currently, residents can place bets at one of 20 sportsbooks, including DraftKings, BetRivers, and Caesars.</p>
<h3>Oklahoma</h3>
<p>Oklahoma has no shortage of tribal casinos, but surprisingly, both retail and online sports betting remain illegal in the state. Governor Kevin Stitt is a strong proponent of sports wagering and plans to introduce legislation in 2024 that would legalize betting online and in person.</p>
<h3>Oregon</h3>
<p>Oregon sports betting became legal in 2019. DraftKings currently operates as the sole online sportsbook in the state.</p>
<p>Residents who wish to bet in person must do so at one of four tribal casinos: The Mill Casino &amp; Hotel, Chinook Winds Casino Resort, Spirit Mountain Casino, and Three Rivers Casino Resort. Unlike some other states, these casinos allow residents to bet on in-state collegiate games.</p>
<h3>Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Pennsylvania legalized sports betting in 2017 before the banning of PASPA, but its retail sportsbooks didn’t officially launch until November 2018. Online sports wagering launched in 2019.</p>
<p>Sports betting was legalized with the passage of HB 271, which included a comprehensive gambling package that established licensing fees and tax rates. The state has one of the highest tax rates in the country for sports betting at 36%.</p>
<p>Residents can bet at one of 12 legal sportsbooks in Pennsylvania, including FanDuel, BetPARX, PointsBet, and Unibet.</p>
<h3>Rhode Island</h3>
<p>Rhode Island started offering sports betting in 2018, just months after the banning of PASPA. The state only has one online sports wagering app, Sportsbook Rhode Island, which is part of the Rhode Island Lottery’s collaborations with William Hill and IGT.</p>
<p>Residents have just two options for in-person wagering: Bally’s Twin River Lincoln and Bally’s Tiverton.</p>
<h3>South Carolina</h3>
<p>All types of sports betting are illegal in South Carolina, but there has been a substantial push from lawmakers toward legalization. Legislators proposed bills in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, but so far, all have failed.</p>
<p>The most recent attempt is HB 3749, which could gain traction during the 2024 legislative session. This bill would legalize up to eight betting apps and make sports betting legal for anyone 18+. It also places no prohibitions on college sports wagering.</p>
<h3>South Dakota</h3>
<p>Sports betting is legal in South Dakota but with quite a few restrictions. The state only allows sports wagering in person at a Deadwood sportsbook or tribal casino. Residents can place bets from their mobile devices, but they must be physically located at a licensed casino or sportsbook. The state also prohibits betting on in-state college teams and minor league games.</p>
<h3>Tennessee</h3>
<p>Tennessee officially legalized online sports betting in June 2019, but it took until November 2020 for the first sportsbook apps to launch. Unlike many other states that have legalized sports wagering, Tennessee does not allow in-person betting and doesn’t have any plans to legalize it in the future.</p>
<p>Sports betting is open to residents 21+, and bettors can wager on both pro and in-state college sports.</p>
<h3>Texas</h3>
<p>Despite efforts from citizens and legislators, both retail and online sports betting remain illegal in Texas. The most recent effort, HB 1942, passed through the House in 2023. However, Lt. Governor Dan Patrick cut down the resolution before the Senate could vote on it despite bipartisan support.</p>
<p>Texas residents will have to head to neighboring Louisiana or New Mexico to place their bets. Legislators may have to give legalization more consideration if they don’t want to lose tax revenue to other states.</p>
<h3>Utah</h3>
<p>Sports wagering, and gambling of any kind, is illegal in Utah because of the state’s deep Mormon roots. Utah is so opposed to sports wagering that its code says it will remain illegal even if legalized at the federal level.</p>
<p>It’s highly unlikely that sports wagering will ever become legal in the state. Residents will have to travel to a neighboring state or try their luck with an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-offshore-betting-sites.htm">offshore sportsbook</a> instead.</p>
<h3>Vermont</h3>
<p>Vermont sports betting fans have plenty to be excited about. The state plans to launch legal sports betting on January 11, 2024, thanks to the passage of H.127.</p>
<p>The law will subject two to six sportsbooks and their subject operators to a 20% revenue tax. Bettors must be 21+ and cannot bet on Vermont college sports programs, except out-of-state tournaments. Bettors are also prohibited from using credit cards to fund online wagering accounts.</p>
<p>Right now, only two online sportsbooks have signed up for the launch: FanDuel and DraftKings. Fanatics will likely soon follow.</p>
<h3>Virginia</h3>
<p>Legal sports betting came to Virginia in 2021. It was one of the few states to launch an online-only option, although the state has plans for several retail sportsbooks in the works. Currently, the only retail option in the state is Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Bristol.</p>
<p>Online bettors have 16 apps to choose from, including Bally Bet, DraftKings, and SuperBook. Bettors must be 21+. The state prohibits residents from betting on in-state college teams and NFL drafts.</p>
<h3>Washington</h3>
<p>Retail sports betting became legal in Washington with the passage of HB 2638 in 2021. This bill allows for sports wagering at one of Washington’s 30 tribal casinos.</p>
<p>Online sports betting is not allowed in Washington. Residents will have to head to an in-person casino, such as Spokane Tribe Casino, Silver Reef Casino Resort, or Angel of the Winds Casino, to place their bets. Snoqualmie Casino offers a mobile sports betting app, but bettors must be physically located at an in-person sportsbook to use it.</p>
<h3>West Virginia</h3>
<p>Both online and retail sports wagering are legal in West Virginia. Residents can choose from one of nine betting apps, including Caesars, BetRivers, and BetMGM.</p>
<p>West Virginia places no restrictions on in-state college sports betting. The only restriction is that residents can’t bet on high school sports.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Wisconsin hasn’t technically legalized sports betting, but it has made agreements with federally recognized tribes to allow in-person wagering. Residents can place bets at one of six tribal casinos, including Potawatomi Casino, St. Croix Casino, and Oneida Casino West Mason.</p>
<p>Online wagering is legal, but heavily restricted. Residents can only place bets from their phones at a physical Oneida One-Stop location.</p>
<h3>Wyoming</h3>
<p>Online sports betting became legal in 2021 in Wyoming. The state currently has four sportsbook apps: FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesars, and BetMGM. There are currently no brick-and-mortar sportsbooks in operation.</p>
<h2>What’s To Come for Legal Sports Betting States in the U.S.?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As sports betting is legalized at the state level, it’s difficult to say what the future holds. Legislators in several states plan to introduce bills for legalization in 2024, and it’s unclear whether those bills will succeed.</p>
<p>If you don’t live in one of the states where sports betting is legal, your only option may be to use an offshore sportsbook. However, these sportsbooks aren’t regulated and offer few protections for consumers, so please tread carefully if you decide to go that route.</p>
