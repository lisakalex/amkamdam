<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always. Got to start off by apologizing for the lights. We are recording, not super late, but late enough. Normally, we got some nice sunlight on me in Mexico. I&#8217;m recording at 7:20 p.m. tonight because we have the one and only Alex Svanevik on the show today. He is a whole frigging day ahead of me in the one and only Singapore. We&#8217;re going to get into all this super pumped to have him on. The CEO of Nansen. You guys know what Nansen is. Alex is the CEO and Co-Founder of Nansen and has a background in artificial intelligence with 10 plus years as a data scientist and management consultant before Co-Founding Nansen in 2019. He&#8217;s also one of the initial DAO members of Lido Finance and PleasrDAO and serves on the board of Wallet Connect. Super pumped to have you on. Alex, welcome to the show, my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Thank you, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Thanks for having me. It&#8217;s great to be here. Pumped to have you and it&#8217;s always super cool when you&#8217;re a whole day ahead of someone, you know, recording.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>I&#8217;m living in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>You&#8217;re living in the future. You were chowing down on some just a beautiful mackerel breakfast before we got started here. I just finished burritos for dinner. You just finished a good old brekkie. We&#8217;d love to see it. Before the show you and I were shooting the shit a little and you had a couple pretty awesome stories. I got to get you to tell those. But before that, we got a touch on your incredible little tweet about Singapore. You have been in Singapore for the last six years. I&#8217;ve never been. It&#8217;s on my to do list. Seems like one of the sweetest places on the planet. You touched over a couple good points. You can tell them better than I can. I think this would be a great place to start. Tell us why you love Singapore so much and how cool life is there.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah. So I&#8217;ve lived, I think in seven different countries. So I feel like you have a relatively good sample to compare, you know, Singapore with, I don&#8217;t know where to start. I think to me, it&#8217;s actually about values. You know, I, I really like Singapore because I feel like the culture here is very meritocratic first of all. And that&#8217;s how the whole society has been, you know, created since Lee Kuan Yew kind of started transforming this place from a swamp to a metropolitan city-state. And that&#8217;s probably a bit of an exact duration, but that&#8217;s at least how people explain it. So it&#8217;s very meritocratic. It&#8217;s very efficient, which I think most people know, but when you live it day to day, it makes a big difference. Like if you need to get from A to B, you can get a go check or a grab in two, three minutes, which is the equivalent of Uber, let&#8217;s say. And because it&#8217;s so small and because the traffic, you know, it&#8217;s typically not jammed but on stuff you can get from A to B in like 10 max, 15 minutes. And then if you, if you need to get anything done in the public sector, like if you pick up your employment pass or anything like that, it&#8217;s incredibly fast, right? This is something that was unusual for me as a European having lived in, say Spain or Italy, where you want to get like your ID card and you have to show up at 4 AM in the morning, this long queue outside, then you finally make it. And you learn that there&#8217;s something wrong with their system. You have to come back like next week or whatever it is. So it&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s just very efficient. And then it&#8217;s interesting for people who are in crypto because it&#8217;s kind of getting that critical mass of a crypto scene here, which is quite exciting. Like I think some people, sorry, some places like Hong Kong where it&#8217;s a live is also interesting. And I love Hong Kong, but the crypto scene is a bit one sided and it&#8217;s mostly kind of the investors who are based there. Whereas in Singapore, I think you have both investors, you have founders of small protocols, companies. Then you have people who work in the big crypto companies like Coinbase, Binance, and so on. You&#8217;re based here. So you have a really kind of rich and diverse crypto scene that I really enjoy. I mean, I could probably spend the whole podcast talking about Singapore, frankly, but yeah, it&#8217;s a great place to live. I really like it. The weather is generally quite nice. If you like hot weather and it&#8217;s in a great location so you can travel to other great destinations like Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>So cool. Let&#8217;s jump right into Nansen here. When I first heard of Nansen, I mean, it was pretty close to when I got in the space not too long ago. I wasn&#8217;t as early as you were, but you and your team&#8217;s growth has been absolutely incredible. Kudos and massive shout out and well deserved to you guys. Before we jump into the whole thing, did you ever think that like you guys would literally be the behemoth of anything analytics and data related in the whole space? Like, cause again, you know, you had a, you left a good job to come start this in a risky industry. Did you ever have that hunch? Like we&#8217;re going to build the shit out of this thing and turn it into a monster. Was that ever a thought?</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, thanks for the kind words. I mean, to be totally honest, when we started Nansen, we kind of thought of it as a potential cashflow business. Like, I think that&#8217;s how we didn&#8217;t think, let&#8217;s go out with the spoil the ocean vision to become like a trillion dollar company. It was more like, hey, we know that there are certain unsolved problems in crypto, and in particular, a lot of the data was kind of either non-existing, the analytics were incorrect in many places. And there were just so many kind of basic analytical questions that you weren&#8217;t able to answer back when we started, in particular with regards to what&#8217;s happening on-chain. That&#8217;s what we are really good at. And so we thought if we just solve those problems, we&#8217;re probably going to have paying customers who want to answer those questions. And they&#8217;ll want to pay because investors at the end of the day want to make more money. So if we&#8217;re helping them make more money, then presumably they will be okay paying a subscription fee for the product. And so it was very much coming from a relatively humble place. But yeah, we did start growing very fast. Like we launched the product April 2020, we had our first paying customers the literal first day that we put up the landing page. And then word spread and we just started growing very organically. And then at the time, I was the only one working full-time on this project. And my other two co-founders were working part-time. And about six months later, we realized like this is turning into a real company. We need to hire people. You guys need to commit to this full-time. And so they did. And we raised a seed round so that we could hire people, even though we were making revenues, actually. But you still want to make sure that you have enough money in the bank, if things change, so that you can pay your employees and so on. So we did a seed round. We started hiring our first people. And then the next year, 2021, was incredible. And we did a Series A with A16C, we had a Series B with Excel and many other great investors later in the year. And yeah, I mean, some VCs we spoke to in 2021 said that we were literally one of the top five fastest growing SaaS companies that I&#8217;ve ever seen in terms of the revenue growth. So yeah, that was incredible. But it was also good timing with both DeFi really taking off. And so it was great. But it&#8217;s a good feeling for sure. And then you realize, actually, we can aim much higher here. And then you have to calibrate your vision and your aspirations, of course, which is a good thing, obviously. And then yeah, we&#8217;ve never looked back since.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I love that. Bit of a weird question here. You guys pull a shitload of data from, I mean, all the big boy, big gal chains. You pull data from over 250 million wallet addresses, which is absolutely bonkers. This is strictly my selfish curiosity here. Which chain is the easiest to pull data from and which chain is the hardest to pull data from? Which chain gives you sort of the sexiest and most enrichful and forward-looking, you know, trend esque data and are some you&#8217;re just like, oh, this is hogwash. This is nonsense. I&#8217;d love if you could sort of give us some gold on the pros and cons of pulling data from certain chains.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>I mean, I think those are two slightly separate things. I&#8217;ll answer first the version of your question, which is which one is the easiest or which one is the hardest. That&#8217;s a pretty straightforward answer. The easiest one for us is Ethereum, because that&#8217;s the one we&#8217;ve always started with, and we&#8217;ve developed the expertise to do that. It doesn&#8217;t have an insane amount of data volume, so it&#8217;s manageable with the block times and stuff. The one that&#8217;s hardest for sure is Solana. So it just has way more data. It&#8217;s not EDM, so it&#8217;s a totally different paradigm. But that&#8217;s why I say the questions you asked are a little bit different. So it doesn&#8217;t mean that the content for Hogwarts or that data is dirty or anything like that. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s very hard for us because it&#8217;s so different and the volume of data is so much greater. But we still do it because our customers want Solana data, and so you still do that. But I would say we have gotten insanely good at reading data from EDM chains. And of course, that is the dominant paradigm, if you will, of chains, like BNB chain, EVM, Polygon, Avalanche, SeaChain. All these different chains are all EVM chains. And so we&#8217;ve kind of sort of industrialized the ingestion of EVM chains to the point where if we decide to onboard a new EVM chain, we can do that in ours, in theory. Of course, there&#8217;s more work later with maintenance. You have to do attribution or labeling of the wallets that are active on the chain. That takes time. But the actual getting all the data into our database is pretty straightforward at this point. But it took many years to develop the technology to do it in such a streamlined manner.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>And present day we have, you know, not crypto related, but semi-crypto related. Everyone&#8217;s still on the AI train. It&#8217;s left the station. There&#8217;s no chance it&#8217;s ever coming back. You are one of the few people who can actually chime in and who&#8217;s two cents and, you know, hands in the cookie jar we can actually listen to. You have an MSC in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh. So, you know, I&#8217;ve asked a lot of people, what is AI going to do to crypto? You actually studied this shit. You know what&#8217;s going on. Especially as the CEO of Nansen, you guys are the bread and butter of data. How have you in particular, you and your team used AI to, you know, help pull data from all the different chains to help enrich your data sets, so on and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, so we use AI in two primary ways. That&#8217;s our AI strategy at Nansen. The first one is that we use it to supercharge our product, right? So it allows us to build certain innovative features and also deepen our data notes in a manner that was not possible just a few years ago, right? So we kind of think of AI as ubiquitous throughout Nansen. It&#8217;s not like, here&#8217;s the one AI feature. It&#8217;s more like it powers our search. It powers the NFT price estimates that our machine learning created. If you want to get an estimate of your Pudgy Penguin, then we have a machine learning model that gives you an estimate, almost like I say, hello, this estimate. And it&#8217;s all machine learning power. And so, and then in terms of the attribution, the labeling and so on, that&#8217;s an area where we will be using AI much more going forward. But yeah, so the first area is just making the product better. The second area, which I don&#8217;t think is unique to us as a company by any means, and certainly not unique to the blockchain industry either, is using AI to increase our organizational productivity and our individual productivity. So this is kind of the, I guess this is where, if you read the newspapers, this is where many people talked about the implications of AI, like AI is going to take our jobs and stuff. I think in my experience, what ends up happening is that you just increase productivity quite dramatically. So if you are working with anything content related, right? It could actually be video, it could be audio, but often it&#8217;s text, of course, if you&#8217;re writing content marketing, if you&#8217;re writing Twitter threads, you&#8217;re writing research, we&#8217;re basically using AI for all of those different things to shorten down the process and just save time and effectively increase productivity in the sense that you&#8217;re getting more output with less input, right, and the input is typically ours. So the way I think about this in a very broad sense is that whenever you&#8217;re doing work, there&#8217;s sort of three primary things you do. The first one is that there&#8217;s a prompt, right? You have something like a drive, hey, I need to do the same, like writing down the name of the task or whatever. Then there&#8217;s a long process, which historically has been always from the most time, which is the production, like the completion of that thing, the tasks, and then at the end, there&#8217;s an element of quality assurance, like whatever I made, it&#8217;s like, it makes sense. Maybe you do that with someone else, you&#8217;re quality assurance someone else&#8217;s work. With AI, the interesting thing is you end up spending like most of your time only on the first and the last bit, which in a way are the two, that&#8217;s where like you spend the least amount of hours. And the thing in the middle, the production, that&#8217;s now takes like 10 seconds because the, or it can be like half an hour if you wanna iterate, right? Because typically you quality assure, you go back and then you try again and you kind of give feedback to the AI as you&#8217;re working with ChatGPT, for example. And so at Nansen, one of our goals this quarter is to just collectively spend 5,000 hours working with AI. And the reason we set that goal was I realized that a lot of people don&#8217;t actually have the gut reflex of trying AI first for a task because you&#8217;re not used to that, right? Like you&#8217;re used to just doing stuff yourself, but we have to train people to say like, hey, I&#8217;m writing a, I&#8217;m trying to make a list of strategic accounts that our sales team wants to go after, for example. That&#8217;s like, can you use AI to do that? And it turns out absolutely you can, like me and our senior manager of Radley Ops yesterday, we&#8217;re spending like two, three hours literally with ChatGPT building out a list of 500 target account lists to go after. And he saved us an insane amount of time just doing that, right? And so the surprising thing is that you can use AI and I would say in particular ChatGPT for so many things. And even now I&#8217;ve been using it extremely actively the last six months, even now I&#8217;m realizing every day that like, wow, it&#8217;s actually pretty good at this thing here. Like if I prompt it in the right way and if I give it constructive and clear feedback if it does deliver on my expectations. Anyway, so I think. If we get the team to spend 5,000 hours, that works out to about four hours a week per person, that&#8217;s 10% of their time, right? Then you will have built up a bit of a gut reflex to think like, in my area, this is an area where AI is great and super helpful. It increases my output by like 10x or 100x in some cases. And then once you get the next quarter, because we plan orders through objectives and key results and so on, OKRs. And when you get the next quarter, we can start looking at, let&#8217;s look at the outputs and the outcomes we&#8217;re creating with AI. But for now, I just want to focus on the input. It&#8217;s like, put as many hours as you can into the process of working with AI. And then the best is that good things will come from that. So yeah, so basically like those are the two areas, right? To innovate on the product, make a radically better product. And specifically for us, that&#8217;s about kind of creating great interfaces to the data on Linux powered by AI, as well as deepening our data mode. And then there&#8217;s the organizational productivity piece where there are many principles. Like one principle is, why AI first? Another principle is make AI a team member. Like you should literally think of AI as team members. Like, hey, did you invite this AI to the meeting? Did you share the documents with the AI, right? Did you give the AI enough context to be helpful, to solve this problem? You kind of have to shift your mental model towards this not being software, but it&#8217;s like another team member, which is kind of weird and a bit science fiction, but I think we are actually there where it makes sense to work with AI in this way. So yeah, it doesn&#8217;t answer your question on specifically AI for crypto, but that&#8217;s at least how we think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I absolutely love that. You sort of fired me up there a little. I&#8217;m not going to lie too. I feel like you&#8217;re the kind of CEO where someone&#8217;s like, Hey, Alex, I need X amount of dollars for this AI subscription. You&#8217;re just like, you chuck the Amex at him.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Specifically for AI, for sure. I mean, like the reality is it&#8217;s more expensive to not have a ChatGPT subscription than it is to have one. It&#8217;s like way more expensive not to have it because you&#8217;re ending up spending a bunch of time on stuff that the AI could be helping you with and doing a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Do you know how many people and clients I talk to who still don&#8217;t use it every single day, who don&#8217;t have a GPT-4 subscription, where I&#8217;m just like, I can barely remember a year ago when this was not, you know, like I almost forget about life before it. And it&#8217;s one. Yeah, so you use it yourself. It&#8217;s in fact, every, I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s bookmarked. I mean, I don&#8217;t use the bookmark anymore because it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s such a habit of just, you know, Google Chrome, C H A, boom, that just pops, you know what I mean? It&#8217;s just wild how it works. That&#8217;s a good sign. Yeah, shout out Sam Altman, OpenAI and the team. You guys are incredible. Nansen Query, this was quite the launch. I mean, just enterprise ready blockchain data, doing it all currently supporting Arbitrum, Avalanche Base, Bitcoin, Dash, Doge, Ethereum, Solana, Terra, you name it. You guys are doing, doing it all. I would love to read this and give everyone the lowdown, but you can do a much better elevator pitch than I can, so I&#8217;m going to throw the ball over to your end of the court. What exactly is Nansen Query and why is it so powerful? And I&#8217;d love you to explain how much help it is giving to big, large enterprises.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, so the best story here is basically, we built the best on-chain analytics product for investors, right? And in doing that, we realized that, hey, we basically have built the most powerful data platform that powers this product. Why don&#8217;t we give access to that underlying data platform directly? It&#8217;s a bit like the kind of Amazon and AWS plane, right? Amazon builds a retail store, they have all the infrastructure, and then why don&#8217;t we just sell access to the infrastructure? And so that was the thought process behind Nansen Query. And we had many customers asking us to offer programmatic access to your data and so on. And so that&#8217;s really what Nansen Query solves. And we also realized that crypto is cool because you can get access to lots of data through APIs, often for free or very cheap. But the problem is that a lot of that stuff is not necessarily enterprise grade, and it&#8217;s not something you would want to kind of build your business on top of, whether that&#8217;s like products or trading algorithms and things like that. And so we had a real focus of making sure that this was enterprise grade, and we had the highest quality data, that we have unique data sets that you cannot get anywhere else, that we had extremely broad coverage of chains, and then also higher order things like DEXs, NFT marketplaces, and so on. And then overall, the platform itself was very performant with the best uptime and the fastest load time and things like that. So that&#8217;s how we ended up building Nansen Query. And I think where we&#8217;ve had the most success is surveying the kind of top tier crypto teams in the space, like an OpenSea or Arbitrum or Consensus, Binance, Coinbase, like the kind of really great teams that realize that maybe having like a data platform and having all these data pipelines in house is not a great idea because it just distracts us from our core mission, right? Like Coinbase is not a data company. You know, it wants to increase the economic freedom in the world and primarily, of course, they do that through offering a great exchange. And so instead of them spending a ton of time internally building out stuff, it&#8217;s actually much more economical to just buy this from us, right? So that&#8217;s the kind of basic premise of why we built Nansen Query and where we&#8217;ve had the most success. I also feel like it is a space where, you know, it&#8217;s great to have a few different alternatives for customers, right? You do wanna have kind of either free or cheap options for like hobbyists and so on. That&#8217;s not quite where we play with this offering. Like we figured let&#8217;s just focus on the kind of production grade and sort of enterprise tier customer segment. That&#8217;s kind of where we wanna play. And that&#8217;s where we think we will succeed the most. And then we will let other companies focus more on kind of the more downstream and broader pool of customers. So that&#8217;s where it is today. I think there&#8217;s still, and we support like 25 different chains. You mentioned some of them earlier. Like I said, we have unique data sets that are powered by, for example, our wallet label data, which makes it possible for people to create really unique insights that you can&#8217;t get anywhere else. And increasingly we are going to be focusing more on like the API endpoints surrounding this. So what we&#8217;ve learned is that, you know, we do have a user interface where you can just go in and write SQL queries, announce a query. You can create dashboards, charts, share them with your team, all this stuff. But we realized that many people actually just want to get the data where they are, right? So that&#8217;s why we added, well, like we have support for Google BigQuery, which is a data warehouse technology such that if you are already on that same technology, you can literally get all of our data sets in your data warehouse immediately. And so we&#8217;re exploring how we can do that with other data warehouse and technologies like Snowflake and so on. And of course, creating better API endpoints. But yeah, that&#8217;s basically what Nansen Query is. I think for those who are listening, there might be more investor types. So this is more like if you&#8217;re actually, you know, building a company, building a product, then this is a great product to explore.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Nansen Query&#8217;s for the Big Dogs, and Nansen 2, which we&#8217;ll get into is for the investors. And we&#8217;ll get into that in one second, but until then, we&#8217;ve got to give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Use the promo code, <strong>CRYPTONEWS50</strong>, to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50 all one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Back to the show with Alex here. We got to get into Nansen 2. Last year, you guys launched Nansen 2. AI functionalities, which to my knowledge was sort of the big sexy part of the launch. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t love that? Just reconstructed from its foundations, smart segments, more signals, you name it. Walk me through Nansen 2 and how you guys launched that because that was pretty spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, so I think, again, just to kind of go back to the backstory of why we went Nansen 2, it was actually started because we realized that the tech stack we had were giving us a little bit of headaches, both in terms of being able to shift new features, as well as the performance that I was talking about earlier was kind of giving us some issues. We felt like it wasn&#8217;t loading fast enough and things like that. And so what we decided to do was to rebuild the whole product from the ground up. Of course, we could still make use of lots of the great work on the data platform side of things, but even though we had some improvements we wanted to make. So the kind of impetus for why we wanted to create an obstacle was mostly around our own ability to just shift new features fast and also make sure our customers had a really snappy experience when they used the product. It felt a little bit clunky and slow. That was some of the feedback we&#8217;ve been getting from users over the years. But then when we decided to do that, we also thought, hey, this is a great chance for us to really level up the user experience more broadly and also to shift some of these innovative features that we had been dreaming of building for a long time that we had been struggling with because of the old tech stack. And so now from the user&#8217;s perspective, when you start using Nansen 2, I think especially if you&#8217;re familiar with Nansen 1, what you will notice right away is first of all, it&#8217;s just way faster and it&#8217;s like a hundred times faster in some cases. If you click on either you&#8217;re using a profiler, which allows you to look up a wallet or even a cluster of wallets or an entity like a Binance or a three arrows or Alavida or what have you, you can do that and it loads super quickly and it gives you that overview that people expect from Nansen 1 that you get the soothing capabilities that you want and it loads super fast. So that&#8217;s the first part. The second part is the user experience, as I said before, is just a lot more streamlined. So in Nansen 1, you needed to know which dashboard to go to if you wanted to do something and that was kind of inhibiting for a lot of people. It&#8217;s like, do I use NFT God Mode, NFT Paradise, like what&#8217;s the dashboard I need to be using to just answer this question? And we&#8217;ve kind of abstracted all of that away to the point where if you go into Nansen 2 today, you just smash command K, which brings us the search bar and you just input whatever it is you need. You paste in a wallet address, you write Pudgy Penguins or an entity collection, you write the symbol of a token, you write the name of an entity like a Binance or Coinbase, whatever, and we just take you to the right screen. So it feels like kind of a trivial thing, but it is actually a huge improvement in the user experience. You don&#8217;t have to think too much about how to get from A to B. Maybe there&#8217;s an analogy where we&#8217;re going back to the Singapore story on like we just want to make things very efficient. You don&#8217;t want this bureaucracy and a maze of stuff, you just want to go straight to the point and that&#8217;s what we helped users do. And then the last thing is the innovative features that I mentioned and the probably the two most loved features that we have shipped with Nansen 2 are signals, which is kind of like a feed. So if you don&#8217;t have a very clear idea of what you&#8217;re looking for, you can just go into signals and you get a feed almost like a Twitter feed and it just surfaces anomalous events from the blockchain. So like here&#8217;s a token that had 100 times the amount of centralized exchange inflow that it normally has. Maybe you should look at that. Maybe there&#8217;s something going on there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>So it&#8217;s gold nuggets.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know what I should be looking at today. Let me just check out the feed and maybe I&#8217;ll just find something interesting. And then you can drill down from there, right? So the mission of our company is to surface the signal and create winners in the future of finance. And so this is literally what that feature does. It just surfaces the signal for you because there&#8217;s so much stuff happening on chain, especially with 20 plus different chains that you support. So, and that&#8217;s AI powered as well. It&#8217;s like the stuff that the AI thinks you should look at because it is anomalous somehow is what&#8217;s going to show up in that sheet. So that&#8217;s the signal. The second feature is smart segments, which, you know, like I said, like you mentioned before, we have hundreds of millions of wallet labels, right? That&#8217;s one of the things that we are known for. But we also realized that we don&#8217;t want to be the bottleneck for people to create their own wallet labels and groups of wallets. And so we created this feature called smart segments where you can decide your own criteria of wallets. You can say, hey, I want to look at every wallet that made at least, you know, 10 ETHs and profits trading Board Apes. And you just put that in as your criteria. And now you get a little segment of the, let&#8217;s call it, you know, 80 wallets that did that. I support a little more, few hundred wallets that did that. And that segment, you can now profile them collectively in the sense that like, what other things are they doing? Which tokens do they own, NFTs, which transactions have they made in real time as a segment collectively. And you can pull that segment into, you know, the other parts of Nansen. Like you can filter using the segment if you&#8217;re looking at a specific token or NFT. And so, yeah, this is another, I think, super powerful feature that we have shipped in a basic form, but it&#8217;s going to get a lot more powerful in the next weeks. And of course, yeah, a lot of these things, like I said in the beginning, are AI powered, right? Everything from the search to signals, to of course, a lot of stuff that happens on the backend with regards to the attribution and labeling of addresses. Even I think the congestion of data will over time become more AI supported, because you may not want to have data engineers spend a ton of time writing kind of transformer code and parsing code. It probably makes sense to have AI support for that as well. That&#8217;s the summary of what Nansen 2 does. But it&#8217;s early days still. And I think if you&#8217;ve tried it, you kind of will see a material improvement from Nansen 1, but you should also know that this is early and we have a ton of really exciting features coming out this year for it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Alex, you&#8217;ve been on a roll. I wish you had more time here, man. This has been too much fun. A couple more questions and we&#8217;ll wrap up. Success story. I don&#8217;t know if you can tell me or not. I know the listeners would absolutely love this, but someone along the way must have used Nansen to find a specific signal and made an absolute shit ton of money. And we, on behalf of all the listeners and everyone at Cryptonews, we would love if you could give us just a little tiny, incy story of maybe someone. You don&#8217;t need to drop names, but just like the Board Ape example you said, where someone found something, bet a shit ton on it, and made an even bigger shit ton. I&#8217;d love you could give us a little nugget of gold here.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, there are a few different ones. Probably the most famous one is MEDCollector, which is a Twitter account. And he wrote a thread about how he made an insane amount of money flipping NFTs using Nansen. I can&#8217;t remember the exact numbers. I think it might&#8217;ve been something like 10 ETH to 800 ETH or something ETH flipping NFTs using Nansen. And by the way, just to be very clear, that&#8217;s, to his credit, he is the hero. We are just kind of the, like he is Batman. We are the Batmobile, right? Like he is the guy actually doing it. We&#8217;re just a tool. But the cool thing was he was not doing that on just one bat, right? He was doing it consistently and just grew the portfolio. So that&#8217;s incredible. And I&#8217;ve met them in person, which is cool. There&#8217;s also another story of one of our customers who I think put 500 bucks on a token that they discovered in Nansen and turned it into one and a half million dollars. There&#8217;s also a tweet that&#8217;s out there and we have it in some of our marketing material because it is pretty amazing. And then there are of course many other examples. There&#8217;s another one where there was a fund that had a lot of money, like hundreds of millions of dollars in anchor when the Terra thing was happening. And they had set up Nansen smart alerts so that they got notifications when liquidity was being drained from the curve pools. And because of those notifications, they also exited the curve pools and basically saved probably like maybe hundreds of miles, at least tens of millions of dollars were saved because they were able to get out fast enough. And they have told me that the smart alerts basically saved them.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>They owe you a dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yes, yeah. It&#8217;s not only kind of the moonshot shit coins that go 1000X. It can also be used for like defensive purposes to make sure that they don&#8217;t lose their money, right? So yeah, and there are a ton of other stories but those are three that come to mind for now.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s so cool. Alex, absolute treat. Thank you so much for coming on. This was a blast. I can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two. This was too much fun and we barely scratched the surface. You also had some electric stories that you told me before the pod. And folks, we will save those for round two because Alex, I mean, you would be up there for one of the people to have, probably not one, but maybe one dozen pints with and shoot the shit over some crypto stories. But we&#8217;ll have to wait until next time. Until then, wishing you and the team all the best. Before you let us go, please let us all know where everyone can find you personally and Nansen online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, so the best is to go to www.nansen.ai to try out our products. You can also find me on Twitter, @ASvanevik, just look for a very cute Pudgy Penguin. You can also find Nansen&#8217;s Twitter account @nansen_aiSo thanks for having me, Matt. It was great to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Hey, pudgies have been ripping. I know you&#8217;ve been calling that for a while, but no free ads on the podcast, but we&#8217;re going to give them one. Why do they ripen so much? What&#8217;s the deal with pudgies here?</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>You know, I used to say three Cs, but it&#8217;s actually now four Cs, cute community content. For example, they have like 10 billion views on DFC and they have more than one million followers on Instagram. But the fourth C is also the CEO, Luca, right? Luca is a fucking amazing operator and one of the truly great ones in crypto and he&#8217;s like 26 years old or something. Really an incredible operator. I&#8217;m actually helping on a call with him now in four minutes. So it&#8217;s the four Cs. That&#8217;s why Pudgy is doing so well, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Four C&#8217;s, I love it. Alex, thanks again, man. Really appreciate it, and can&#8217;t wait for next time.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Thank you so much, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the buzz around Bitcoin spot ETFs, all eyes are on a possible <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> ETF.</p>
<p>The SEC has already <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-delays-grayscales-spot-eth-etf-application.htm">delayed decisions</a> on applications from Grayscale and BlackRock. Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fidelity-follows-blackrock-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-where-next-for-ether-eth.htm">Fidelity&#8217;s proposal</a>, submitted in November, faces a crucial March deadline.</p>
<p>But, what are the chances of these products being approved soon? And does the approval of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> spot ETFs set a precedent for their potential approval?</p>
<h2>Spot Ether ETFs Could Face Challenges Similar to Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Gaining approval for Bitcoin ETFs was a lengthy and legally complex process. Brian Evans, CEO of BDE Ventures, suspects something similar will happen when it comes to the proposed Ether ETFs.</p>
<p>“There will be long, possibly drawn-out discussions over such issues as cash or in-kind redemptions as well as surveillance-sharing agreements,” he told Cryptonews.</p>
<p>“These were some of the issues with the BTC ETFs that had to be sorted out, and I suspect that something similar will play out with Ethereum.” He believes it&#8217;s highly likely that they will eventually receive approval.</p>
<h2>Impact of Ethereum&#8217;s Classification on ETF Approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ethereum currently exists in a regulatory ambiguity. But Rostin Behnam, Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), <a href="https://events.law.rutgers.edu/event/1866">previously said</a> it should be regulated as a commodity.</p>
<p>Clear definitions for decentralization from regulators like the CFTC will play a crucial role in the potential approval of a spot ETH ETF.</p>
<p>“End users of the ETF need clarity on who controls Ethereum if it really is a commodity. Ideally is ‘nobody’ like BTC,” said Pontem co-founder Alejo Pinto.</p>
<p>“The question I would ask if it’s a security: who controls it? Who is responsible for reporting requirements of ETH? I doubt Vitalik would do it,” he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if ether is categorized as a security, this could significantly complicate matters.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160560" style="width: 889px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-160560" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-300x136.png" alt="Spot Ether ETF" width="889" height="403" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-300x136.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-1024x465.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-768x348.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-1536x697.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-150x68.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm.png 1556w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160560" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: CCData</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ethereum enables users to use their Ether (ETH) tokens as collateral to support the network and engage in transaction validation. Under its proof-of-stake system, validators lock tokens to secure the blockchain and earn interest-like returns.</p>
<p>Consequently, certain regulators perceive this model as resembling an investment contract. This, by definition, could subject the asset to US securities laws.</p>
<h2>What if ETH is a Security?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously suggested that cryptocurrencies offering token staking <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-sec-chair-gary-gensler-refuses-say-if-eth-security-bullish-for-ethereum.htm">might be considered securities</a>.</p>
<p>Helika CEO Anton Umnov noted that such a classification would lead to greater SEC oversight and a focus on crypto market maturity.</p>
<p>Cryptosmart CEO Alessandro Frizzoni agreed, saying the possibility of Ethereum being labeled a security poses a hurdle to the ETF&#8217;s approval.</p>
<p>“It threatens the survival of the Ethereum project itself and could therefore put the Ethereum ecosystem under great uncertainty. I think Ethereum is decentralized enough to not be classified as a security and therefore the Spot Ethereum ETF will ultimately be approved,” Frizzoni said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Ethereum is categorized as a security, it would restrict the involvement of infrastructure partners and custodians in overseeing the ETF.</p>
<h2>Custody Challenges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Conversely, if Ether is not classified as a security, it could potentially follow a less strict regulatory route. It would still be required to address significant concerns related to investor protection and the integrity of the market, according to Web3 security firm HashEx CEO Dmitry Mishunin.</p>
<p>Mishunin pointed out that the market shouldn&#8217;t anticipate a substantial price spike after the approval of such an ETF.</p>
<p>“The market has a way of pricing in such developments well before they officially occur, meaning that by the time of approval, the event&#8217;s potential impact on Ethereum&#8217;s price might already be reflected in its current valuation,” he said.</p>
<p>Industry insiders also say the ETF issuers need to accurately track Ethereum&#8217;s price and securely handle custody of the underlying assets. BlackRock getting in on it makes an approval seem more likely, but regulators will still need more clarity.</p>
<h2>Spot Ether ETF Approval Timeline</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Deutsche Bank expects the first such ETF <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-expected-may-23rd-and-could-surge-in-value-new-report-says.htm">to be approved by May 23</a>. Meanwhile, TD Cowen <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-timeline-predictions-td-cowen.htm">expects approval to drag on</a> to 2025 or 2026.</p>
<p>Other crypto executives have mixed opinions, indicating that the outcome primarily hinges on political variables.</p>
<p>COZ CEO Tyler Adams is skeptical it will happen this year, pointing to regulators’ cautious approach when dealing with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>“I think that Ethereum is a pretty large, fundamental leap from Bitcoin due to its underlying model. Ethereum has an infinite supply and its technological volatility renders the discussion increasingly complex – the same does not exist for Bitcoin,” he said.</p>
<p>LayerTwo Labs co-founder Austin Alexander believes that approval may come to fruition in the next year or two.</p>
<p>“Even with a change at the SEC, perhaps with a Trump presidential victory, it’s still unclear to me that new leadership would speed things up in this regard,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Phillip Shoemaker, executive director of decentralized identity firm Identity.com is double the spot ETH ETF will ever materialize.</p>
<p>“Look how long it took the BTC ETFs to get approved, after all. If anything, I suspect that the SEC might soon go after the Ethereum blockchain and associated tokens,” he said.</p>
<p>“All this said, I do hope it happens. It would help further mainstream the space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-news/">Blockchain</a> and artificial intelligence (AI) together have the potential to boost each other, making the two fiels more exciting and diverse.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://tensquared.com/research/research-24-02/10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf">new report</a> from TenSquared Capital highlights the ways AI can enhance speed and efficiency in the Web3 arena.</p>
<p>Essentially, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-companies-leverage-ai-despite-ongoing-challenges.htm">AI joining forces with Web3</a> has the potential to tackle tough global issues. It can also automate essential tasks, boost data-driven choices, and amp up trust and transparency for users.</p>
<p>The growth equity firm’s research team explored specific areas where AI can be applied to make Web3 more structured.</p>
<h2>AI’s Power in Cross-Language Coding</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AI, particularly tools like ChatGPT and Github Co-Pilot, can significantly influence the crypto industry by simplifying code writing.</p>
<p>These AI tools empower developers to work on various blockchains, even if they are not well-versed in a specific programming language.</p>
<p>For instance, if a developer is proficient in Solidity but needs to code in Rust for Cosmos, they can rely on ChatGPT/Co-Pilot to assist in the translation process, TenSquared’s report said.</p>
<p>“AI code-writing tools lower the barrier to entry in blockchain and allow developers to write much more quickly,” they stated.</p>
<p>AI not only speeds up code writing — it can also enhance blockchain infrastructure.</p>

<p>The tech can create smart contracts and consensus protocols that make real-time decisions using on-chain data. Furthermore, it can improve Web3 security through AI-based detection systems, ensuring more accurate and efficient smart contract decisions.</p>
<p>A few startups have already embraced this. For example, Oraichain employs AI-powered APIs to establish the groundwork for intelligent smart contracts and advanced decentralized applications (DApps).</p>
<p>Additionally, DApps can use on-chain AI for data analysis and automation.</p>
<p>Experts predict AI agents will use crypto for most payments, as large language models (LLMs) can handle transactions via crypto wallets and interact with smart contracts and DeFi protocols effectively.</p>
<h2>Boosting Web3 Security</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Researchers and startups are already diving into AI-based consensus methods, which are key for keeping blockchains safe and scalable.</p>
<p>Take Velas, for example, which is developing an AI Delegated Proof-of-Stake system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Inery is working on a way to validate blocks more efficiently based on uptime.</p>
<p>AI also plays a role in beefing up Web3 security, helping to fend off cyberattacks and shore up blockchain defenses. It&#8217;s a big deal because security is a major roadblock for users getting into crypto.</p>
<p>Just in January, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-lost-127m-to-hackers-in-january-2024-more-crypto-news.htm">Web3 took a $127m hit</a> from hackers across 19 different incidents. And last year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-korea-hackers-illicit-gains-dwindled-in-2023-despite-more-attacks-chainalysis.htm">cyber fraud groups made off with over $1b</a> from the crypto industry, according to Chainalysis.</p>
<h2>AI in Credit Scoring</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AI can reshape decentralized finance (DeFi) by using historical lending data to create credit scores and improve loan decisions. For instance, Spectral&#8217;s MACRO Score is an on-chain credit score powered by advanced machine learning for DeFi lending.</p>
<p>Through trading bots and predictive analytics, AI can enable traders to enhance their decision-making and profit from market trends. Platforms like 3Commas offer crypto trading bots for automated strategies.</p>
<h2>Interactive Gaming</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Generative AI can personalize gaming stories and characters. For example, Inworld AI creates AI NPCs, making games like WebKinz more immersive. ASM, part of Futureverse, develops a platform for user interaction with AI Agents in gaming worlds.</p>
<p>AI can also enhance NFT platforms and Web3 social networks by delivering personalized content and relevant product recommendations to users.</p>
<p>However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently warned that the toughest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-discusses-challenges-between-crypto-and-ai-warns-tread-carefully.htm">challenge in crypto and AI integration</a> is creating a single, decentralized AI trusted by other applications.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, still coming in hot from Mexico. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have the one and only Bobby Zagotta back on for round two. He crushed it the first time. It was too good. We had to have him on for round two and today we have him. Even though you guys know who he is, I&#8217;m going to give him one intro just to tickle all of your fancies. We got Bobby Zagotta on the show today. As I said, US CEO and Chief Commercial Officer at Bitstamp. Before Bitstamp, he came from Kraken where he served as Chief Commercial Officer responsible for strategy, business, marketing, M&amp;A, research, analytics, global growth, a bit of everything. Before that, he was Senior Managing Director of Strategy and Execution and a member of the executive team at the CME Group, a global publicly traded financial exchange. As CEO of the Americas and Global Chief Commercial Officer at Bitstamp, Bobby is responsible for strategy and growing the presence and business globally, as well as overseeing day to day ops in the Americas, super tied into everything regulatory, Bitcoin ETF, and crypto as a whole. Super pumped to have you back on. Bobby, welcome back to show my friend. How you Doing?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Awesome. It&#8217;s great to be here. And I wish I was in Mexico with you. That would be even better</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I know, before the show, you and I were shooting the show a little. You are also a big fan of Cenotes. How incredible are Cenotes? What a treat they are.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>You know, we stumbled on them on a trip a few years back where it was on the side of a highway. And I was like, what is this? And we pulled off and it changed my life. It was like getting into another world. And then we became quite focused on them. And we hit them all over the area when we were down there by Playa Del Carmen. And yeah, they&#8217;re amazing. They&#8217;re absolutely amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s crazy. Mexico is one of these places, the more time you spend here, the more just insane you realize it is. They have these Cenotes everywhere, and I could be wrong. I don&#8217;t even know if there&#8217;s one Cenote in USA.I&#8217;m pretty darn sure there&#8217;s none in Canada. We have some beautiful lakes, like obviously BAMP with that turquoise, baby blue glacier like with the mountains in the background. It&#8217;s absolutely stunning. One of the few countries you have that. But Mexico has the Cenotes. They have all these ruins, they have the day of the dead. You have Chichen Itza, which is the pyramid that just like, how the hell was that thing built? No one knows. It&#8217;s a pretty wild place, and it would be pretty sweet. Any chance Bitstamp throws up a Playa Del Carmen office? Would you let your boy run that one for you?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Absolutely, yeah, I&#8217;ll put that on the agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Crypto in Mexico. Funny note, Crypto in Mexico, I was here last year as well. And the amount of places that now accept Bitcoin and Tether is actually pretty wild. It&#8217;s still not a lot, but when you take a walk down Fifth Ave, you&#8217;re seeing a hell of a lot more last weekend, you know, spend some time out with friends, bunch of Argentinians, and they were telling us as well, and Buenos Aires almost 25%, 33% of places now accept Tether and Bitcoin as well, because the currency is so bad. And it&#8217;s pretty wild to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, no, I think about it a lot. I mean, Latin America has a different use case basically and it&#8217;s a natural fit because of what you mentioned. The economic environment there and the level of trust in their institutions is very different than in the US or Canada, right? So here I think people look at Bitcoin as recreational or a potential investment, et cetera. But in many parts of Latin America, it&#8217;s much more than that. It&#8217;s a lifeline and it&#8217;s a means for very hardworking people to preserve their wealth versus watch it tumble in value based on bad policies or bad institutions or other factors. So yeah, I am not surprised to see that it&#8217;s becoming a little bit more an element of commerce there and I&#8217;m super excited about it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s another wild thing too. We were with a group of Argentinians. 80% of them had a crypto app on their phone. Most of them had Binance, but that&#8217;s literally what they use. Like when they get paid here in Mexico, they get paid, they transfer over to Binance, transfer it to another account and withdrawal and the blue dollar, whatever the heck that is in Argentina. I don&#8217;t even know. There&#8217;s like a regular Argentinian peso, then a blue dollar and a regular dollar. It couldn&#8217;t really, anyways, we were sort of into one as well. So we won&#8217;t dive into that, but just always interesting to think because when I&#8217;m in Toronto or with family and friends or visiting family and friends in the States and unless I&#8217;m with someone who is orange-pilled and is in the crypto sphere, like no one ever messes around on a day to day basis. And we have people here where it&#8217;s become part of the life. So pretty darn cool to see. But Bobby, you just jumped into Bitcoin there. I think we must. It would be a disservice to not jump into this. We had the Bitcoin ETF. The news was great, but the price action and sentiment is not exactly what we wanted to see.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, I mean, well, firstly, there&#8217;s no underestimating what a historic event this is. And a lot of people are saying this, but it really is true. This is a level of credibility and validation that has been lacking globally and specifically in the US. So that is super significant. And then of course, the access by new segments, segments who have been on the sidelines and waiting for the regulatory cover and kind of the process that they&#8217;re familiar with, such as an ETF process. That just represents a lot more capital coming into the ecosystem, which creates momentum and creates opportunities. So super positive and super historic. Now, I didn&#8217;t expect a massive spike in Bitcoin price or in all of our volumes, et cetera, as much as I expected supported growth over the next few quarters. Because if you are a pension fund or a large asset manager who has been waiting for this moment to get involved, it&#8217;s not like you just flip a switch. There&#8217;s work to do there. And to get all of the kind of research done and positioning with their customers and whatnot. And so I expect that the real benefit here will be felt over a period of time. And same thing on the retail side, like the direct retail side, this is noteworthy for them to, even if they&#8217;re not as likely to buy ETF shares as they are to go on an exchange and buy Bitcoin directly and want to hold it and want to custody the actual asset. I think many of them see this as like, all right, I&#8217;ve been maintaining a sliver of investment here, but now it&#8217;s time to increase and to double down a bit. So yeah, from a Bit stand perspective, we&#8217;re definitely feeling it in terms of being a primary liquidity provider for many of the authorized participants or authorized partners for that ecosystem. And we&#8217;re excited about it. I think the price action with Bitcoin right now is just a little bit of a hangover from, perhaps inflated expectations that it was going to be a massive spike in bull rally.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve been seeing so many rumors online and again, you gotta take these with a grain of salt, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard about this grayscale price action where it&#8217;s like so many people are getting out of grayscale and for that to happen, they need to sell Bitcoin, therefore price of Bitcoin is dropping so then they can get into the ETFs. Is any of this true or is this all just blah?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve seen those rumors as well. And I don&#8217;t, I think any kind of new major, multi-billion dollar investment tool and or ecosystem is going to have to find its sea level, if you will, because there&#8217;s a lot of new entrants and there&#8217;s a lot of people who&#8217;ve been waiting for this moment to get out and other things. So I don&#8217;t put much credence into long-term effects or market flaws, if you will. I just think it&#8217;s gotta find its C level and then start growing.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, well said there. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about Bitstamps&#8217; relationship with the ETF providers and how you guys are, again, just really providing regulatory light, not just for lack of better words, qualitative help, a quantitative help. You guys are a reputable exchange, obviously, and you&#8217;re supplying a lot of market data, a lot of surveillance to these ETF providers. They&#8217;re coming to you for advice. How are you guys working with them? How is this whole relationship, working on your end of the spectrum?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s working very well. And to your point, when a particular authorized partner is servicing BlackRock or a very large scale, super reputable ETF provider or issuer, it does raise the stakes for them a little bit to make sure everything&#8217;s buttoned up and that there&#8217;s no undo or unnecessary regulatory risk or other things. So Bitstamp comes to the fore in those situations typically because we have in general the most extensive licensing footprint and we&#8217;ve got a level of governance and in our company that&#8217;s not typical in the space. So you&#8217;ve heard me say some of this, but seven years of global financial audits by a big four accounting firm, that just doesn&#8217;t exist in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It doesn&#8217;t grow on trees.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, all kinds of ISO and other designations that we&#8217;ve got super professional governance, independent boards for all the entities. And it&#8217;s very much a compliance forward company and a compliance forward firm. And in the ETF side of the marketplace, that&#8217;s more important than it is on perhaps just the trading or speculating side. So yeah, we&#8217;re positioned very well as a liquidity provider for authorized partners to these issuers and certainly feeling that in a positive way in terms of volumes and opportunities related to it. Obviously the market is in this kind of funny moment right now, but still much better condition in my estimation than this time last quarter. When we were in kind of September, October, that was a very subdued market. And this is already a step function better than that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;d love to just keep us on this subject for a bit more and then we&#8217;ll get into some other stuff But I did tell the story on the pod a couple pods ago and I just love your two cents on this my buddy was at Atlanta Airport and flight got delayed had to go to a different terminal. And in two different terminals he saw an ad I want to say one was from grayscale and one was from or not grayscale one was from Valkyrie and the other may have been from BlackRock or someone else. But these ETFs are already pumping out ads in places with stupendous amount of foot traffic like Atlanta Airport, which is a Canadian I&#8217;m not sure but I&#8217;m pretty sure it might be the busiest airport in close to the world if not USA which is crazy. If you&#8217;re a consumer or if you&#8217;re a fund manager or or even just a financial advisor. And you&#8217;re getting your high net worth clients into these exchange or into these ETFs. Is it a simple pick is like a go for whoever has the lowest fee go for whoever&#8217;s doing the most social good and giving back 10 ticks to the Bitcoin miners like how do you feel about the ads already being out? I friggin love it personally and two if you were to advise, you know a consumer on which one to choose. What would what would you do and how would you tell them, you know the right one to pick?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, no, great question. I&#8217;m also excited to see the ads. And these guys have had a few years to prepare, unfortunately, because the approval took so long. But yeah, I think a lot of people, just individual consumers, as well as investment professionals working for companies, when they see ETF, it is familiar to them as their own kind of thumbprint. And so, they&#8217;ve probably been thinking, I really am curious about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. I really would like to add something to my portfolio that is a little bit less correlated, perhaps, to the stock market. But you know what, I&#8217;m not gonna take the time to figure out how to custody this and how to do it safely, which platform to operate in. I&#8217;m not gonna spend that kind of time. But when they see an ETF opportunity, they&#8217;re like, okay, now I&#8217;m ready. This makes it easy for me. I&#8217;ve already got gold ETFs, and I&#8217;ve already done this. I&#8217;ve been just a well trod path for me. I&#8217;m just gonna add Bitcoin to it and get my feet wet. So that&#8217;s kind of the macro sediment, obviously. But within that, there&#8217;s a lot of different types of players. To your point, some who might like, hey, that&#8217;s a cool ad, I&#8217;m gonna go with Valkyrie. Others who might be like, you know what? The only thing that&#8217;s meaningful to me is BlackRock or Fidelity. Like guys who are at such a scale and at such a reputation that I feel very safe. So I&#8217;m just gonna go there. And then I think there&#8217;s a significant part of the kind of target segment here that just wants to learn and wants to do the research. And what I would recommend to answer your question is, yeah, look at the prospectus. You understand the differences in pricing. I&#8217;ve seen some good articles that lay it all out, all the different offerings, and make a decision. I think they&#8217;re all, if they&#8217;re approved, which they are, that means that they&#8217;re fairly safe and reliable. And so I think you can have the luxury of choice, but do the homework and see which one feels right to you.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah DYOR, do your own research, one of the best, but most underused acronyms in all of crypto and investing. Let&#8217;s keep buzzing on Bitcoin, the halving. Everyone thinks April, to look in like April, if we go on this sort of current trend that we&#8217;re at, I&#8217;ve had some incredible guests on the Podcast over the last three months. And I wanna say it&#8217;s almost, three years ago, this would have been 100% as in the halving is going to be the best thing ever for Bitcoin. Now I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s almost 75, 25, 80, 20, maybe even 66, 33. A lot of folks, people who I trust and people who are much smarter than me and much more switched on in this space, are in the camp of it&#8217;s not going to have the biggest impact as it has over the last couple of halvings. What&#8217;s your take on this? Or is it still gonna help? Is this overvalued? Is it already priced in? What&#8217;s gonna happen with the halving? And I guess by the time this episode airs, really three months give or take.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I do think it&#8217;s gonna help, but I also agree with what you&#8217;re saying. It&#8217;s a little bit different sediment today than perhaps it felt like a few years ago. And I think that&#8217;s mostly a function of the space maturing. And people, particularly given the kind of tumultuous ride over the last 18 months, you know, are a little bit less ready to hype stuff, hype event driven stuff, and rather focus on the more fundamental aspects of this now fairly mature marketplace. And so I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s negative or positive, but I think that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s playing out here. And that&#8217;s how I think about it. I cannot fully understand the relationship between the halving and the market effect. I can&#8217;t map it, but I can appreciate history, right? And the history is quite clear and quite compelling about the relationship between halving and price increase for Bitcoin, usually with about a six month gap, right? But between those two things. So I&#8217;m not one to count it out, but I&#8217;m also not one to ever assume some kind of flipping of the switch, spike, bull run, you know, everything changes. I just think it&#8217;s going to be another brick in the wall, if you will, of the foundation of a solid and growing marketplace. And so yeah, I&#8217;m enthusiastic. I think in addition to, you know, the ETF and more institutional involvement, et cetera, it&#8217;s just going to be a momentum creator, which is good.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s exactly what we need. Last time we spoke, you did call this. And you did say that the Bitcoin ETF did need to happen. And if it did, it would have positive impact on the market. And from a sentiment perspective, I believe it has, obviously the price has fallen. Do we know if it&#8217;s exactly from that? Could it be grayscale? Could it be something else? None of us will ever know. What else needs to happen, Bobby, from a perhaps regulatory standpoint? Is there one of the few people who actually have the wherewithal and the experience and the switched on is to comment on this. Are there any other regulatory steps or building blocks that need to happen, short-term, long-term, for this momentum to really keep building? Any events, perhaps the election in November, is there anything else that could really help us that might be coming up in the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yes, absolutely. And, but I&#8217;ll start in the negative, right? So the uncertainty, this is my feeling, the uncertainty related to regulation in the US and the macro political environment in the US because the election is coming up. That uncertainty is really, I think, an anchor or a bit of a drag on progress and momentum in the marketplace today. So, my hope is that there can be some positive movement on regulation in the US this year. Now, that&#8217;s a tall order, given it&#8217;s an election year and everything. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a given, but I&#8217;m wondering if Congress can act on stable coins, for instance, one piece of the puzzle that is super relevant right now and in my estimation, easier to operate on from a legal framework perspective. That would really help. That would really be another momentum booster. And then the election is gonna happen one way or another in November. And will that be favorable to the market or not? We don&#8217;t know, but what we do know or what we believe is that clarity, more certainty is gonna help one way or another. We&#8217;re seeing this in Europe already. So in Europe, I&#8217;m just the regulatory front, they&#8217;re a little bit ahead in my estimation, right? Because the European Union has adopted the MiCA framework which will come into play at the end of the year. And that certainty or that clarity is allowing more institutions in particular, but more individuals as well get involved with a level of comfort and a level of confidence. And it&#8217;s starting to shape the conversations there in a way that&#8217;s not happening here yet. And how we&#8217;re feeling that mostly is, for instance, we have this white label offering, good stamp as a service, I think I mentioned to you last time, but it&#8217;s focused on institutions, banks and fintechs. And those companies are quite, we&#8217;re engaged with many of them right now who want to be able to offer crypto services to their customers for all the obvious reasons. Like they don&#8217;t want their customers leaving their ecosystem or their app to buy some Bitcoin. They&#8217;d rather keep them in their ecosystem and offer that service, but they&#8217;re not gonna build it at this stage. So they turn to a very regulated, long track record, very reliable technology kind of company, like Bitstamp to help provide that. In the US, banking and crypto are not sympatico today. And there&#8217;s a lot of frictions that have been put in place. And so it&#8217;s just at a very different spot. So to answer your question, if we could get a little bit more regulatory clarity in the US, that&#8217;s the missing link, if you will, for me, to really get the entire global marketplace to a next level.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s true. What&#8217;s that famous quote? If you don&#8217;t know the rules, you can&#8217;t play the game, something like that. Again, if there&#8217;s no rules, the big boys can&#8217;t get in. Do you guys white labeling that&#8217;s, I know we did discuss this a little bit last time, but I&#8217;d love to jump back into this. What exactly are you just really giving them exactly what they&#8217;re looking for? And I understand that this, you know, it doesn&#8217;t happen that much in the US it&#8217;s more Bitstamp global. As you just discussed because of the regulatory shit show in the States, but is this just financial extitute or institution X, Y or Z coming in and saying we want to keep, you know, we want to keep our people in our ecosystem and we need solution ABC. And you guys go look, we are, you know, we&#8217;re KYC&#8217;d and regulatory it up to Yin Yang and we&#8217;re going to give you what you want. You give it to them. They slap their label on it and boom, it&#8217;s just a good product, good relationships. That&#8217;s how it works for lack of better understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah I mean, in essence or at its core, it&#8217;s exactly that. But there&#8217;s a couple of nuances. First of all, we have different levels of offering. Some are like, you know, full white label, turnkey solution that a bank can just adopt. Others are kind of gradations of it. But what&#8217;s notable is, you know, these are some of the largest global banks in the world based in Europe that we&#8217;re in deep conversations with about this. And so, you know, that&#8217;s very noteworthy when you think about the overall crypto ecosystem. And these banks, of course, I can&#8217;t speak for them, but based on the work that we are proposing to do with them, you know, it&#8217;s exactly that. They want to be able to enable their millions of customers to just simply buy and sell, you know, it&#8217;s nothing exotic, but buy and sell, you know, the majors, the major cryptocurrencies in a simple, safe, reliable way. And so, you know, we&#8217;re kind of in Europe in particular, which is our home base and our, you know, kind of strongest marketplace. We&#8217;re a pretty obvious choice for that. And we&#8217;re excited. And there&#8217;s other related, you know, flavors of this, including with payments providers, you know, we&#8217;re in conversations with a couple of the world&#8217;s largest payment providers because they want to make it easier for their millions of clients to utilize crypto in their payments processes. And so, you know, these, if you just take those two, you know, possibilities, you know, that could really in Europe take the entire ecosystem, you know, to a next level. So, I&#8217;m anxious to, you know, for the rest of the world and specifically the US to get caught up.</p>

I was going to ask you about consensus, but I saw you take a big swig of what I assume is water out of that super nice looking bottle. Are you on the Stanley wave? Are you on the Stanley wave that&#8217;s absolutely blown up everywhere? Have you heard about this nonsense?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I don&#8217;t think I have. But it is water. Is that what it&#8217;s about?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I mean, this is like, this is pretty, you know, it&#8217;s TikToky, Instagramy, trendiness Stanley the cup company, the Tumblr, you know, keep your drink cold or warm. They&#8217;re thermos, yeah, they&#8217;re absolutely blowing up for no good reason. Just, it&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s just like, in today&#8217;s day and age, you get lucky for going viral. I had to ask if you had one. I don&#8217;t have one. I&#8217;m seeing people down here, mostly American and Canadian tourists, you know, showing off multiple Stanley mugs. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s like wearing a Rolex now to show it&#8217;s crazy. Some lady in California stole like 60 of them and was going to resell them on like just nonsense. Little off topic, but I guess one more thing on that note is you and I are hockey fans. The Stanley cup for the first time and like, you know, since SEO was invented in, I don&#8217;t know, the late nineties got outranked. So when you search Stanley cup, it is no longer Lord Stanley, the, you know, the hardest trophy to win in all of sports for hockey, the national hockey league. Now you have some crummy tumbler. Just what is our world succumbing to?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>That is wrong on so many levels. I don&#8217;t even know where to start.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Brutal. Let&#8217;s jump back in. As my duty, I always have to lurk my guest Twitter. And a couple days ago, you fired off a tweet that you are excited to share, that you are proposing a panel, DeFi for Capital Markets at Consensus. This seems super cool. You guys are obviously in the DeFi space as well, and especially in capital markets. That&#8217;s where we can really move the needle, not just retail. I feel like most of DeFi&#8217;s retail at the moment. Part of that is because, again, the complexities, the nuances, the account abstraction, it&#8217;s such a nightmare. It is truly just horrendously difficult to use. I&#8217;ll never forget the first time I dabbled with MetaMask or tried bridging coins or did anything of the like. It was nightmare fuel in the purest sense. What exactly is this DeFi for Capital Markets panel that you are proposing at Consensus 2024?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting and I couldn&#8217;t agree more. It&#8217;s kind of like, I think the right topic for this time for 2024. There&#8217;s so many dimensions to the DeFi opportunity and ecosystem, but the thing that is a still, a common denominator is it&#8217;s just a little bit too hard for institutions and individuals to participate. And it&#8217;s associated with risk also, so I think it&#8217;s a little bit different kind of risk profile than operating with a centralized exchange or other platform, and that requires more education. So the real question here is, when does that really quite incredibly innovative space, the DeFi space become more legit and integrated with the rest of the traditional financial services, capital markets space? And I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s gonna happen tomorrow, but I think it&#8217;s something that we need to be thinking about and talking about. So some very smart people put together this concept and this panel and were nice enough to include me in it. And, but yeah, super excited, but I guess we have to be chosen, right? It has to be somebody, people have to go and vote for this panel. So I encourage your audience to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>On the subject of 2024 trends, speaking of trends, are there any other trends, micro, macro, will stay away from any of the price prediction nonsense? But are there any other trends that are really getting you going again, or not even a month into the year? A lot of people, myself included, are bullish for a lack of better terms on this year. We have a lot of things that went in the right direction. Of course, the ETF just popped off. It should be good. The Fed also sort of said that there will be some rate cuts this year, and that usually goes hand in hand with good things for the economy. What trends do you see for 2024 that could take us in the right direction?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I definitely agree with those couple. And then what I would add to that is, you know, there&#8217;s, what we&#8217;re seeing at Bitstamp is really strong onboarding for institutions and for retail investors. And that&#8217;s always a leading indicator of confidence in the marketplace. So even during the last half of 2023, we saw a lot of increases in onboarding, even though the marketplace was tough, the volatility was quite low. And to me, that&#8217;s like, okay, people are getting ready, particularly institutions, you know, there&#8217;s some lead time there once they get onboarded, integrated, et cetera. And so far in 2024, that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s accelerated. So, and, you know, November, December, January have been really good volatility months, which is a big part of it. But also I think the, this wave of adoption that I believe we are embarking on here in 2024 is a little bit different investor, whether it&#8217;s an institution or an individual, it&#8217;s a little bit different mindset. They&#8217;re not the pioneers, right? They&#8217;re not the super comfortable with risk perspectives. They&#8217;re arguably the fast followers or the followers, right? Once the path has been paved over a bit, now they&#8217;re getting involved. And what they care about is a little bit different than what the first couple of waves care about, right? They&#8217;re not all about whiz bang, you know, Silicon Valley tech kind of mindset. They&#8217;re about like, is it safe? Who&#8217;s the right partner? You know, what I&#8217;m gonna, I&#8217;m not afraid to do my homework, you know, kind of it&#8217;s a different audience. And I think a little bit more conservative in many respects. And so that&#8217;s where, you know, companies that Bitstamp our position quite well, because it&#8217;s, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a little bit of a fight to quality, you know, still happening given the Binance situation and of course the, you know, the FTX and the other situations prior to that. So this next, the other trend is this next wave of adoption is gonna be different. More hedge funds, more asset managers, more traditional financial services companies, not just hardcore traders. And, I think probably a little bit different demographic of individuals involved, which is great. The other trend I would mention is more generational, right? So I&#8217;ve been reading a lot lately about, about wealth transfer. And, you know, we are in the midst of the largest wealth transfer generationally from one generation to another in history of the world, right? So, and it&#8217;s something like 10 trillion, you know, dollars of value or something that&#8217;s going to move, you know, from essentially the baby boom generation to, you know, younger generations that are, you know, either crypto native or super mobile adaptive and people who can naturally relate to the idea of digital money versus where all the money&#8217;s fitting right now with the older generations where it&#8217;s not as natural for them to relate to digital money and all the possibilities associated with it. So that&#8217;s another thing that&#8217;s not gonna just play out in 2024 is gonna play out over the next several years, but it&#8217;s real and it&#8217;s big.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>That&#8217;s, I always forget about this well transfer thing. It&#8217;s crazy. Like it really is, and I guess it&#8217;s my, would it be my generation as someone who&#8217;s born in 95 who is like, we&#8217;re the ones getting all this money now, right? It&#8217;s coming from our parents and my parents, parents, my grandparents, I mean, one left. But, you know, it is my generation, the millennials who are about to get all this cake, right? Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Exactly, and Gen Z also, but millennials primarily. And it&#8217;s, I think part of it is also the baby boom generation has lived longer than past generations because of all the advances in healthcare and fitness, et cetera. So they&#8217;ve held on to it longer too, so it&#8217;s more pent up. Yeah, I mean, like we&#8217;ve got an election coming up. We might have two 80 year old guys that we&#8217;re, you know, having to choose between in the US. Like how does that happen? You know, this generation really clings to stuff. And I sometimes like to see them retire and take a well-deserved break on a beach somewhere, maybe in Playa del Carmen.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>That&#8217;d be great. Well, I mean, I know this isn&#8217;t a political podcast, but, you know, we got a drama teacher running our country. So it&#8217;s a, you can&#8217;t win them all. That&#8217;s a little off topic, but that&#8217;s something I often think about too, where it&#8217;s like the incentives of being at the top of the political food chain. I feel like with social media and everything else, the cons almost outweigh the pros nowadays. And again, obviously, and for the states for you guys, it&#8217;s most powerful, arguably best country in the world. Most freedom you guys, once you&#8217;re present of the United States, you are truly a geopolitical figure. You&#8217;re one of the most powerful people in the world until the day you die. And then your family gets to bear those fruits as well. But it&#8217;s like, why aren&#8217;t more quality people wanting to do this? Like, and use this social good, I feel like it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s changed. And it&#8217;s like, Oh, I&#8217;d rather be an influencer or be a TikToker or be rich, you know, it&#8217;s like, we need more people to get into, to get into high level politics and, and actually move the needle. And I know in Canada, we have, I&#8217;m not as, I don&#8217;t follow the states, obviously, as much as I follow my own country, but we literally have zero people in the pipeline, Bobby. And to my knowledge, in the States, you guys don&#8217;t have a whole lot of people either. And it&#8217;s something that sort of baffles my mind. Why wouldn&#8217;t you want to be the most powerful person in the world? It seems like a pretty frigging cool game, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I know, I think about this a lot. And I think it&#8217;s true what you&#8217;re saying. I think for many potential great leaders, you know, and people who perhaps have a passion for that kind of social role and leadership opportunity, I think they get, you know, first of all, great opportunities in the business world, you know, and arguably the business world is another great leadership opportunity, you know, that it&#8217;s a capital L, if you can progress, it&#8217;s a really worthy and noble leadership opportunity, but very different than government. But it doesn&#8217;t come with all the cons of government like you alluded to, you know, it&#8217;s not, I&#8217;m sure, I haven&#8217;t done it, of course, but, you know, any kind of political role, you know, it&#8217;s not for the faint of heart, right? You get criticized, you know, 10 times a minute and your family gets scrutinized and, you know, your privacy is gone. And, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of cost. You gotta really want it and really believe, but because of this, I do fear that we don&#8217;t have the pipeline either. You know, it&#8217;s a little bit more complicated in this, I don&#8217;t know the Canadian frame of reference well, but in the States it&#8217;s quite complicated, you know, because I think there&#8217;s a lot of, you know, back room deal making where, you know, where perhaps the talent can&#8217;t break in. The talent, you know, maybe has a hard time bringing us a little bit too old school networks, et cetera. But I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, no, just building on your point about business. It&#8217;s like, if you can be a powerful businessman or woman and take a company public, make a couple of billion dollars, once you have a couple of billion, like there&#8217;s not much you can&#8217;t do in this world. You wanna buy an island, you wanna spend 500, you know, mil on a yacht, go for it. Like what can you not do, right? Wanna just fly private on multiple jets, wanna own a sports team. You can do whatever the hell you want without all the public scrutiny. So it&#8217;s like, it comes down to anything else in life. Life&#8217;s all about incentives. And I feel like we need to better incentivize, you know, the most powerful position in the world. But, you know, this isn&#8217;t the New York Times political podcast. So we&#8217;ll jump back to the crypto stuff. Bitstamp, you guys are shipping, you guys are always shipping. You guys are the king of shippers, just pumping out products at a crazy rate. We&#8217;d love to see that. What else do you guys have on the docket? I know you probably can&#8217;t tell me most of it, but of the things you can tell me, give me some gold here, Bobby. What are you guys up to over the next couple of months in 2024 for Bitstamp?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Sure. Well, we&#8217;re very excited. I&#8217;ll talk about retail and I&#8217;ll talk about institutions. Yeah, on the retail side, in 2023, we launched a new app experience that really is targeted at the types of users we were talking about earlier, this next wave of adoption. So, it&#8217;s a simple buy-sell experience, but it&#8217;s connected to our Learn Center so that people, it was a place people can go get educated in a very kind of bite-size and objective way, and then do simple transactions. And it&#8217;s in contrast to our Pro app, which is advanced order types and it&#8217;s really geared more towards traders and people who are very acquainted with the marketplace. So, that&#8217;s been great. We also have a lending offering available, not in the US, not in the UK, but in Europe and in Asia. It&#8217;s an opportunity for users to lend their crypto into a marketplace that is very highly organized and regulated and transparent so that they can earn a return or yield on that crypto. And this space a couple of years ago in the crypto ecosystem was a disaster. And, but it&#8217;s a place where Bitstamp can bring the Bitstamp version of it, which is regulated, transparent and super reliable. And so, that has grown quite a bit for us in its instance inception at the middle of last year. So, we are very excited about those two opportunities, fueling growth in 2024. We also think there&#8217;s some really interesting token projects out there, and we&#8217;re quite discerning about what we list on Bitstamp, but we think there&#8217;s some really interesting token projects out there that we&#8217;re evaluating. On the institutional side, we will have a fairly major announcement coming soon, but suffices to say, we want to give our institutional participants more ways to participate in crypto markets and participate with Bitstamp in our kind of safe, reliable way in crypto markets. So, that&#8217;s a primary focus with us. I wish I could tell you more, but coming soon. And then we&#8217;ve also launched an OTC offering in 2023 that we&#8217;re growing now. So, there&#8217;s an RFQ platform and also kind of a facilitation desk. So, this is, we just get a lot of requests from our client base and people who crypto whales or others who want to move size, and they&#8217;re smart enough about markets to know that that needs to be done in an orderly way, and we can make that turnkey for them. So, those are a few things we&#8217;re excited about.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always, bit of a flu game today. A little bit sick, a little under the weather. That&#8217;s what happens in Mexico. Sometimes you catch some bugs, c&#8217;est la vie. There&#8217;s a little bit of something going around, half of Mexico&#8217;s sick right now. But we&#8217;re battling through and I am super friggin pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, the one and only Vince Yang, the Co-Founder of zkLink the company building the first multi-rollup Layer 3.  Yes, you heard that right, a Layer 3, a true Layer 3 to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum Layer 2 rollups. Vince and the team are pioneering more liquid, secure and customizable DeFi trading experiences. Vince is a former engineer and began his experience in crypto with Bitcoin mining. Can&#8217;t wait to get into that as well. And this has evolved into a deeper exploration of areas, including Blockchain&#8217;s potential for applications as well as ZK proofs. One of the hottest topics out there right now. Vince, super pumped to have you on my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Doing well. Thank you, Matt, for the introduction. Hi, everyone it&#8217;s my pleasure to be here. And as you know, Chado is mad, I have a very good opportunity to introduce what we&#8217;ve been building for the past three years. And also, talk a little bit about my journey in the crypto space as well. And what&#8217;s happening on the market recently is very interesting. Seeing that ETF got approved and also then surprisingly the market is going down. And we&#8217;re all surprised a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, Bitcoin ETF gets approved. We all think we&#8217;re gonna be rich and then boom, gray scale, classic. You still have gray scale. For grayscale and FTX still somehow hoping us years after the whole fiasco and we&#8217;ll get into that as well. Folks, before Vince and I went live, we were discussing where he is in the world, where I am at the world. As you all know, I am in Mexico right now on Eastern Time Zone. Vince is in Singapore 13 hours ahead of me and it is 9 p.m. for him. It&#8217;s 8 a.m. for me and him and the team are still grinding at 9 p.m.  Before the show, I was like, oh God, I&#8217;m gonna have to tell Vince to turn his or to find a better solution. There&#8217;s way too much background noise because his whole team is still hauling ass. That&#8217;s so cool.  Vince, I&#8217;d love you to talk a little bit about the team, what you guys are building and is this an everyday thing? Are you guys hauling ass till 9 p.m. every single day of the week? What&#8217;s the work life balance like over in Singapore?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Our passion, I mean, work is our passion. I think it is quite normal to work at 9 p.m. still. I think it is also very normal for Blockchain builders, developer teams working on exciting stuff. We&#8217;re seeing amazing progress and daily process. And this happens with the hard work and also the grinding on different parts of the world. Yeah, it&#8217;s just very normal and we&#8217;re very used to this. And working with funds is naturally achieved. And when you love what you&#8217;re doing, what you&#8217;re building, this is work is a big part of our life. And we really enjoyed the whole journey, the process. And our team right now is we are mostly Asians on the team. So we have a few colleagues that is rooted in other continents of the world. And most of the team in Singapore, Hong Kong, a few in China, and outside Asia, we have a few colleagues in the US, in North America, in Europe as well. And roughly in total, we are a team of 40 people. We have been building this since three years ago, starting in the year 2021 in Q1. And we&#8217;ve envisioned the idea of Ethereum scaling solutions, ZK Rollups, OP Rollups this work going to be very popular. There was a lot of discussions there. And we thought that there&#8217;s going to be a very important primitive in it. It&#8217;s for the interoperability among the Rollups. Then we were thinking about bringing it really and taking this problem using the ZK knowledge, zero-knowledge proof technology. I myself started in the crypto space not on very early days in the year of 2019. I joined one of my close friends who returned to Asia from the US, resigned from World Bank, and joined the industry. And he convinced me that this is the future. So there was a very big opportunity cost for him to just let go of what he had been building for a career for a long time and joined a totally new industry. And it was tech, savvy, and financial oriented as well. So somehow he thinks this is the next big thing and this is the opportunity to change, to be part of the history and to ride the wave with the history. And then we joined together to start it in a Bitcoin manufacturing company and also started our own mining operation business. And after a year or so, we decided to dive deeper into the Blockchain space, understanding deeper into the technology. So I came from a technical background. I used to be an engineer working in a French company. I did my master&#8217;s degree in France. And after graduation, I spent the first three years of my career working in an international automotive company and building out the power train system. And I had a little bit of experience with coding, like riding the low level codes with the CEC shop. And after joining this Blockchain space in 2019 and 2020, I started to learn reading codes in Solidity, understanding reading the white paper, yellow paper, Bitcoin, Ethereum, understanding all the basic concepts that started from absolutely zero. I jumped into the rapid hole with zero understanding, zero idea of what&#8217;s coming and what&#8217;s the technology is all about. And then gradually I had this, you know, idea of, the first touch with the international proof was quite an amazing experience to me. And I was immediately amazed by the properties and also the potentials of this technology. And I had a lot of discussion, brainstorming with the friends that were interested in this topic. And started from there, we had the initial idea of building out something that could bring value and enable adoption and empower applications and user adoptions in Blockchain space. That&#8217;s how the whole thing started in 2021.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. So you and your Co-Founder left some really cushy jobs as well, which I, you know, you got to take risks. You want to, you want to make some shit happen? You got to take risks and I love that. Vince, let&#8217;s jump right into obviously two stars of the show. One is yourself. Two is zkLink. Love the name as well. Beautiful name you guys have. And the comfort swag for the people watching this if not listening. That&#8217;s such a clean hoodie. Feel free to send one over to me Vince and I will rock that and everywhere I go.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Send me your address. I&#8217;ll make sure there are some.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it. Absolutely clean. I want you to give our listeners the elevator pitch on what exactly zkLink is, but before we jump into that, when I was doing a bit of research for the show, I&#8217;ve heard of L3s before. Now, my understanding of L3s is there&#8217;s a lot of L2 networks, a lot of Layer 2 companies and ecosystems that tell the narrative that they are an L3, but they&#8217;re really not an L3. They&#8217;re more like an L2.5. Then obviously everyone knows what L1s are, the biggest one being ETH,  I mean Bitcoin if you quantify that as an L1. But the problem with L2s is they&#8217;re very general, purpose scalability-oriented, where we need L3s for applications-specific scalability customization, a lot of interoperability, actually creating apps and dApps on top of these L2s to really make things seamless and make shit happen in the Web3 ecosystem. This is when I was like, wow, this is going to be a really fun episode because this is something that we really desperately need as a whole. Everyone talks about how ETH can be the catalyst in the network and the ecosystem to onboard the masses into Web3, but it very well could be an L3 that does this because without a beautiful UX and UI and very simple interface, aka an L3, it&#8217;s going to be difficult for ETH to do that. I hope that stage setting was a decent explanation in my understanding of what exactly an L3 is, but I&#8217;d love for you to jump into it, tell us exactly what you and the team are building at zkLink and give us the lowdown on what exactly L3s are and why they are so important to onboard the masses into the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yeah, Matt, your understanding of the Layer 3 is actually very good. And you already touched the pinpoints that are, you know, Layer 3s first list is built on top of Layer 2s and Layer 2s built on top of Layer 1. And today, the most discussion of Layer 3s are like, a relative to the Ethereum ecosystem, right? So for Bitcoin&#8217;s also not deep. There are also discussions of Bitcoin Layer 2, but still not yet. They&#8217;re getting there for Layer 3 for Bitcoin or any other Layer 1. So the Layer 3s discussion nowadays is it&#8217;s within the Ethereum ecosystem. And a Layer 3 is a third Blockchain Layer built on top of Ethereum Layer 2s and the Ethereum Layer 2s are scaling solutions, building on top of Ethereum to scale the Ethereum and to try and to break the Blockchain trilemma on of Ethereum. At the second, we&#8217;re building the first cross Rollup Layer 3 or multi-Rollup Layer 3, meaning that this Layer 3 is unified Layer, the third Layer on top of multiple Layer 2s. We call it the Nexus. We have actually two platforms. So we recently launched the zkLink Nexus, which is the first multi Rollup Layer 3 on top of multiple ZK Rollup Layer 2s. And there are already very famous projects and companies building ZK Rollup Layer 2s scaling solutions for Ethereum, like Stackware, Stacknet, zkSync, Scroll, Polygon zkEVM, Tyco, Consistence Linear. All those are already big projects and popular. And these different zkLink Layer 2s, they have their own ecosystem. As you already mentioned, they are general purpose Layer 2s scaling the Ethereum to build, you know, so it&#8217;s built for general purpose applications and even compatible also and developers can build in any sort of applications using a Solidity programming language. But eventually, these Layer 2s will, at some points, you know, meet the same problem as the Layer 1s that did not have, you know, the throughputs performance. They need it by some high performance applications. So then there comes the needs of Layer 3. Layer 3 will be application-specific. They will meet the specific demands for certain applications for high performance and low transaction costs. And at the same time, you don&#8217;t want to make a compromise on security. So you build a Layer 3 on top of the Layer 2s using, you know, the similar stack, like the Layer 2 developers like Arbitrum, or PMizum, Stackware, zkSync are all launching their Layer 3 solutions using their Layer 2 tech stack. So Arbitrum launched the Orbit. It&#8217;s basically setting transactions on Arbitrum. And then zkSync, Hyperchain, the ZK stack on top of zkSync era there too. And then you have the Stackware stacknet. Stacknet Layer 3, the Matara scaling engine on top of Stacknet Layer 2. In comparison with these single row up Layer 3s, zkSync is building a new type of Layer 3, which is a cross-row up Layer 3 that settles transactions on top of multiple Layer 2s. The ones that I just mentioned are the ZK Rollup Layer 2s. The reason why it is only working on multiple Layer 2s is because the ZK Rollup Layer 2s can talk to the Ethereum contract through the canonical message channel at a quicker space. So because for any cross-chain or cross Rollup architecture, if you want to achieve the finality of the transactions, you need like a fast and secure state synchronization across the Layer 2s. And only the ZK Rollup Layer 2s talk to this, Ethereum contracts through the canonical message channel at a faster space. Now at the moment as these ZK Layer 2s is still at early stage, the settlement speed is like anywhere between several hours to 24 hours up to 24 hours. But OP Rollup will take up to 7, 14 days for this challenge period, you know, because this using a&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b><b></b>It&#8217;s that long?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yes. And then the fraud proof is not alive yet. So no, I&#8217;m not aware of alien OP Rollups that has already launched the fraud proof. So basically the OP Rollups is running, the finality of the transactional rule, the Rollup stakes up to 7 to 14 days. And the ZK Rollups, the finality of the transactions on Ethereum Layer 1, is much faster. And it couldn&#8217;t be even faster in future with the developments of these ecosystems. Well, by theory, it can go down to like, you know, within an hour, several minutes, like that. And then a Layer 3 on top of these Layer 2s, ZK Layer 2s, and will be able to settle the transaction happening on the Layer 3 on Ethereum through these message channel between the Layer 2 and the Ethereum Layer 1, ZK Layer 2. So there&#8217;s from Layer 3 to Layer 2, the text minutes, and from Layer 2 to the Ethereum, the text minutes. So add together, you can also set the transaction, have a faster finality on Ethereum within minutes. So this is the idea of how we consider the Layer 3 can achieve a Ethereum equivalent security because this is the fundamental problem, right? So anything when you develop, any problem you try to solve, you do not want to solve the problem with the price of making a compromise on security. When there&#8217;s a most compromise on security, then you think about what benefits it comes with, right? So with the cross rub Layer 3, you have the benefits of aggregated assets and liquidity from these multiple ecosystems. Currently, I think that there are roughly 500 million on TVL, each of these ZK Layer 2s respectively, when it goes to, when they&#8217;re live on Mainnet, this number will grow for sure with the development of the ecosystem, with the launch of their token respectively. And then on this, the cross rub Layer 3, you&#8217;ll be able to tap to all these assets existing natively in these different Layer ecosystems respectively. So application building on top of this Layer 3 can list the tokens across this ecosystem, can create a trading pair of a stock and ZKS from ZK sync or a USDT or to any token, and you will be able to merge Ethereum from different Layer 2s into the same pool, into the same token. And so it&#8217;s the same for the stable coins. In that sense, you will be able to aggregate this good credit and the unified liquidity on the third Layer. So it starts from Ethereum Layer 1, and then it goes up to multiple different Layer 2s. And then with the opening and access, it emerges again and be connected with the unified Layer 3. So this is a scheme, this is similar to the Ethereum logo.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Very cool.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yeah, this is how we solve this interprobability and also liquidity fragmentation problem that are going to be a major problem for the Rollup ecosystem. Because we&#8217;re going to have hundreds of Rollups, hundreds of Layer 2 for deeper purposes. One of my colleagues just left the team to build out another Layer 2 recently, RWA focused Layer 2 because obviously he sees a market demand for that for RWA focused Layer 2. And this seems to be a very good interesting idea and a very good opportunity. But the problem is that with the more and more builders entering the space, we&#8217;re going to see hundreds of Rollups, even thousands. And all they are going to create, become very complicated and fragmented user experience, liquidity fragmentation and navigation complexities and increase the fraction cost for moving from one Layer to another. Because hundreds of Rollups meaning you&#8217;re going to have to use a lot of different bridges.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>That&#8217;s nightmare fuel. That&#8217;s not we need one one single unified solution</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>User experience that you would want, you know, if you, yeah, like you for crypto master adoption, we think we believe that abstraction is very important. Simplification is very important. Every step you reduce for user journey, every step you abstract for the user understanding, the more intuitive it becomes, the simpler it comes, and the more users you will be able to to get, you know, outside of the crypto space. For crypto native users, of course, they will try so hard and try to try all you can to understand the concepts to try out the different you take knowledge, but for general users, even using the centralized platform like you centralized exchanges, sometimes, you know, a high learning cost for them. So we have to at least match the user experience of the centralized platform like, you know, as simple as Coinbase.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s got to be clean.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yes, clean and intuitive. Right. So it&#8217;s user friendly, awesome. How really and what they are trying to match the user experience from the Web2 applications, very smooth, sleek, similar.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yeah, I think the decentralized applications you eventually have to match that kind of level of user experience. Otherwise, mass adoption or onboarding building next building of users, on chain or onto the decentralized applications will not happen unless we will have the infrastructure being ready for these types of applications. Second, it is exactly building these built, the infrastructure to build for this purpose to onboard the next building traders on chain to empower the next generation of super applications, starting with the trading applications by order book or AMM driven NFT gaming inter-sider us and achieve this target. I think there&#8217;s three comes with the natural benefit of hyperscaling because it is the third Layer. Each Layer you go up, you have like a scalability benefits margin again on that. And it comes with reduced cost because you can batch transactions and generate a proof and then set the transactions on the second Layer and then the Ethereum. So you have the scalability gain, you have the cost again. At the same time, you have the ability to aggregate assets and abstract the complexities of course multiple Layer 2s, which means simplified user experience, which also means simplified developer experience. This is the valid proposition of zkLink and Layer 3. And we believe this will be particularly beneficial for decentralized financial products like order book taxes for perpetual contracts for options or gaming companies. Yes, we&#8217;re hoping to get this infrastructure mature and production ready for the best developers that can deliver the best producer experience. Like you said, simple clean user interface, one unified interface for to serve multiple purposes and using the infrastructure we&#8217;re building.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. It&#8217;s funny and you brought up a great point there, Vince. In order to onboard the masses, again, this isn&#8217;t fake news. This is the realist of news and it needs to be clean. It needs to be sexy. It needs to be easy. It needs to be frictionless. And the teams that build those products right now are nine times out of 10. They&#8217;re exchanges. They&#8217;re centralized exchanges. And when we onboard a Web2 user into the Web3 ecosystem, usually their first touch point is in exchange. But once you leave that exchange and you start messing around with DeFi, it&#8217;s nightmare fuel. It is way too complex. There is so much friction. I&#8217;ll still never forget the first couple of times I sent a MetaMask transaction or let alone had to bridge a coin to another coin. Like, are you kidding me? That was scary as hell. I&#8217;m just like, where&#8217;s my money? Is it gone to an abyss? And that&#8217;s scary stuff. So we need more teams like you guys build. And Vince, we need to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. But when we get back, we still have a bunch of topics to discuss. We&#8217;re going to get into ZK proof, some ETH, some DeFi unifying L1s and L2s. And of course, the Bitcoin ETF, we all thought it was going to pump and it dumped. We also got to get into ZKL token. You and the team had a lovely public raise going on. I believe it just concluded and we&#8217;ll get into that right after this. But until then, huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. That is PrimeXBT. We love the team at PrimeXBT as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a veteran, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. PrimeXBT is always offering innovative products and professional trading conditions and solutions to all of their customers. PrimeXBT is also running an exclusive promotion for listeners of the Cryptonews Podcast. The promo code is <strong>CRYPTONEWS50</strong>. And you can use that to receive 50%. That is 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50. All in word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Vince. Let&#8217;s jump right into ZKL. I was flabbergasted perhaps as a bit of a big word, but it was such a clean raise done by you and the team. Obviously, we&#8217;ve been planning this for a couple of weeks now. So whenever I have a guest on the pod, as soon as we get them locked and loaded, I do my initial deep dive and then every couple of days after that, I&#8217;ll lurk socials, see what&#8217;s going on, read blog posts, check coin price whatever. You guys obviously don&#8217;t have a public trading coin, but this is what the purpose of this raise was for. It was done just beautifully in my opinion. Everything was super clean, really good update, clear communication. I&#8217;d love if you could walk us through sort of the rationale behind one launching the coin. What is its utility? And if you could start by talking about how you guys chose to do the public raise and how you guys made it so clean. So perhaps other teams who are listening could emulate and follow what you guys did. I think that&#8217;d be a great place to start your events.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yeah, thank you very much, Matt, for, you know, yeah, this whole process behind it, since actually, you know, we have been spending a lot of time and, you know, made a lot of efforts to make this happen. Or the reason that we choose to do this community race is mostly to, you know, engage and, you know, grow our community and to be able to deepen our relationship with our early community members and supporters. This is a very good opportunity for us to establish a deeper relationship with our community with this community sale. Because this token sales actually comes at a discount. Our last round of private runs was raised as a higher valuation than the community sale round happening right now. So we want our community members to have the feeling that their support, ongoing support is deeply appreciated and we will reward the early adopters and their non-term support in many different ways. This is the, I think, starting with the community sales is a good way, in our opinion, to show our appreciation. And the whole process is managed by our team together. And we have seen overwhelming support from our community. We have roughly in total 300 to 350,000 of community members in our Discord channel. And we&#8217;ve seen overwhelming support and very positive feedbacks from our community members. They like the idea that we are launching at the right timing after almost three years of grinding, technical grinding and building and seeing that the ecosystem is also beginning to grow very fast. Recently, as we continue to embody more ecosystem applications, developer teams, and we&#8217;re launching different initiatives to enhance the momentum of the ecosystem growth, we recently launched the liquidity alliance program to onboard market makers to provide the liquidity to boost equal liquidity in our ecosystem application. And to make all these initiatives possible, then a token will be naturally needed. And also this token, fundamentally, is the native utility token and the governance token of the protocol. It will be the payment token for the proof market to provide the necessary computational resources needed to generate the proof and sustain the operation of the network and also as a governance instrument to ensure the decentralization and the sustainability of the network in long term. And to govern the key developments and also the different matters like the community votes and how to develop our ecosystem for other important initiatives after the token genesis events. They will be collectively decided by the Katao member together using the token as the instrument to coordinate this process. And also it will be the utility token for developers to use as a license fee to pay for the infrastructure service. And also, of course, the developers in the beginning as startups, they might find it is expensive to pay in this token, so the DAO will provide initial support for the, to onboard the early-stage startups to facilitate the whole process and to promote adoption. And in return, there could be some sort of agreement between the DAO and the developer team is to pay by future revenue sharing, so it&#8217;s quite flexible over there. And with this token sale, we&#8217;re entering the fast track to bring the product and the Mainnet life and to involve multiple teams. And we have a very busy pipeline of key partnerships and integrations in the next few months with the strategic technology providers related to the Rollup framework that we&#8217;re building, and also some important applications that we think that will be very exciting for our community and the users. So I cannot reveal the details right now, but I&#8217;m personally very excited for what&#8217;s coming. And we hope that our community members who have been lucky and won the lottery for the whitelist to board and for those who have not, they will still have the opportunity to be rewarded. And we want to engage them in non term, and we really appreciate their support. And I think it appears to me that this community sale is one of the most popular ones in the recent history of current list. So we&#8217;re really happy for that, and we deeply appreciate the support from our community members.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>100%. Well said there. I mean, I&#8217;m sure you can&#8217;t tell me this, but you know, you got to shoot your shot. What&#8217;s the plan for centralized exchanges? You guys are going to do the whole Kip/Bam and Kaboodle, Binance, Coinbase, everyone. You&#8217;re going to do all the big boys, all the big gals. Is that coming up soon?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>That&#8217;s definitely our target. Yeah, we definitely want to try our best. So we&#8217;re still in the process of figuring out what&#8217;s the opportunities, what was possible. We try very hard and we try our best to get the list on the best platforms to have a stronger momentum for everything. This is like, stay tuned.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah. You know, Vince, I had to ask. I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t be doing my job if I didn&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s take a step away from zkLink and yourself, of course. And we&#8217;re going to talk about the Bitcoin ETF. I mean, this impacts everyone. Obviously, you guys aren&#8217;t involved in the Bitcoin space primarily. You guys are team ETH building an L3, of course. But did you guys expect this price action to happen? Like, you know, I want to say when the Bitcoin ETF launched at 46, 47, heck, we might have even been at 48 at the time. And then boom, we&#8217;re, you know, I think yesterday we hit 39,000. Like, what&#8217;s going on there? I know you guys have some very incredible and very switched on smart lads and lasses on the team. Like, did you guys expect this to happen? Was this a big shock to you? Do you think it&#8217;s going to increase long term? Do you think the halving will still have the effect that everyone thinks it does? What&#8217;s your sort of short term sentiment on Bitcoin?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>To start with, I have to admit that I&#8217;m not an expert in trading. So I&#8217;m really not very good at market analysis or pricing predictions. But we all care about the price of Bitcoin because of course it&#8217;s the beta of the whole market. So it&#8217;s the indicator that we all care about. I still have a lot of friends that are working in the Bitcoin space, the Bitcoin miners and also the mining companies, the mining farm companies. So I&#8217;m still pretty close to the Bitcoin community. The feeling that I&#8217;ve got from the Bitcoin community is that they really don&#8217;t care that much about the short-term price changes, whether it&#8217;s like writing from the 26K to the 48K, with the rally due to the idea of approval, the expectations, or whether it&#8217;s just the most recent, the last three days, the selling pressure coming from probably the grayscale and the liquidations. Within the zkLink team, I think everyone is very focused on building out the infra. So they don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>But you guys don&#8217;t give a shit about that. I had to ask just because again, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s real estate. It&#8217;s some of the biggest news.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>It&#8217;s not actually 100% that we are not, you know, caring much about the price changes because this will give us more time. I think if we somehow we think this is, we expect this to happen. And it&#8217;s not a totally a bad thing for the builders, for the developer teams. When the pricing is really very fast, everything is rising very fast. And then you see, there&#8217;s a feeling with the team data, okay, are we too slow? Everyone else thinks really, yeah, the big boys is really, you know, made it and they&#8217;re going so fast and everything moving so fast. We have the feeling that we&#8217;re not doing it. We&#8217;re not executing another dealer in fast enough. But when the price is stabilized or slowly going down, then we feel like, okay, there&#8217;s more time for us and we can be more focused on the coding and developing the ecosystem and everything. But as we&#8217;re doing the community, so of course we hope that the whole market is going strong and we do believe that in, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gonna happen in the next one, we got two, but we know that in this year, the overall, the market is will go strong. So there&#8217;s a lot of positive signals we&#8217;ve seen with the Bitcoin halving, which is gonna happen very soon, with the Ethereum upgrade, can go now updates. So a lot of impositives things and also with the infrastructure getting mature very quickly, new types of applications being unlocked, new doors being opened, and also with interest, a cut, is the expectation. Don&#8217;t think that this short-term dumping pressure will be a big problem with long-term. Yeah, so overall, we just do, once we&#8217;ve continued to focus on what we were building and once we ship fast, as fast as possible.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. Vince, this has been absolutely incredible. A couple more questions, mate, and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. Let&#8217;s talk 2024 trends, 2024 hot topics. Besides the solutions and pieces of infrastructure that you and the team are working on, is there anything outside of you and your guys realm that really excites you at the moment? Obviously, you guys are doing everything. ZK related, L1, L2, L3, more specifically L3. Any other areas of crypto or ecosystems that really tickle your fancy at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang</b><br />
I think for the past few weeks, we have seen interesting things happen with the modular production space. So building a Layer 3 harshly is also part of the broader modular landscape, because you have to decouple some of the key components to be flexible, to be customizable, to meet the diversity of bounds. So we work hand in hand with the modular solution providers like Celestia, EigenDA, or the Oracle, the other shared sequences. This will be a very important trend for the Rollup ecosystem. You have to decouple the components to be flexible, customizable, to meet the diversity of bounds, to have a flexibility to reduce the cost and to have some enhanced performance in certain areas using different solutions, making compromise on different parameters. So I think this is the way. But we&#8217;re also doing this within the Ethereum ecosystem. This is still the strongest developer community where most of the fundamental innovations are happening on a daily basis. So we expect that this is still we want to focus on the Ethereum community. And there are constraints coming with Ethereum for sure. And outside the Ethereum community, there are also important innovations happening on a daily basis, like within the Cosmos ecosystem. We&#8217;ve seen exciting things, like dYdX building out at their way four, is a fully decentralized margin engine implemented in the Cosmos Layer 1 chain. It&#8217;s amazing. We&#8217;re internally exploring what their building and that we find is really amazing. And also innovations happening on other ecosystems, like Solana recently just, you know, what have come back, right? So after the FTX inclusion, and the Solana ecosystem is growing so fast that it&#8217;s getting strong. And for us, from the technology perspective, we think that the most important game changer in the year 24 is account abstraction. Because this is most fundamental element related to user experience, abstraction again is so important for user experience for adoption. Account abstraction will give us, will set the grounds for us to build out everything, you know, on top of it. So they can get also working with account abstraction solution providers. And we&#8217;re more like, you know, doing some deep work on the front of chain Rollup of abstraction, trying to integrate them and, you know, abstract these and simplify these for developers and users, while account abstraction is providing solutions for all end users, including you and me. And I hope that in 2024 we&#8217;ll be able to see some amazing products using account abstraction and, you know, give us like, this product that we like to use day to day, like exchanges with social accounts, social recovery, social login, et cetera. And I&#8217;m mostly excited about the progress on abstraction. I would say this is too pretty early and there&#8217;s a huge potential there. And a lot of the infrastructures will have account abstraction embedded. And it&#8217;s not mature yet. It&#8217;s not user-ready. It&#8217;s not production ready. I hope that it will get ready very soon.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yep, well said. Vince, pleasure having you on, my man. This was a great episode, super pumped for you and the team. You guys are building something incredible and sky&#8217;s the limit and I&#8217;ll be following along. Really appreciate you coming on and can&#8217;t wait for our second round. But before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and zkLink online and on socials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of open-source technology provider <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/komodo/"><strong>Komodo Platform</strong></a>, talked to <em>Cryptonews</em> about the current crypto investment sentiment, incoming &#8220;major&#8221; institutional investments, and the renewed rise of decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unstoppable-and-push-protocol-launch-token-gated-chat-more-crypto-news.htm">DeFi</a>).</p>
<p>The expert further shared interesting insights into major themes that will define 2024, non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-25-january.htm">NFT</a>) use cases leading to increased interest, the US SEC Chair&#8217;s disinterest in the crypto industry&#8217;s opinion, and more.</p>
<p>Read on to learn what he told us.</p>
<h2>Investors are Enthusiastic, But Cautious</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency space is not easy to predict as it&#8217;s ever-changing. That said, Stadelmann shared that for most retail investors, enthusiasm is driven by the potential of crypto. At the same time, caution persists due to market volatility and regulatory uncertainties.</p>
<p>When it comes to institutional investors, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has created a wave of optimism and signals growing confidence that crypto will only gain more momentum over the next few years.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Stadelmann noted that the crypto market’s short-term trends remain tied to macroeconomic factors. These significantly influence investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Speaking of hard-to-predict areas: crypto market&#8217;s price trends and news events. However, Stadelmann said there are some possible themes to consider.</p>
<p>As said, the US <strong>Securities and Exchanges Commission</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-blames-social-media-account-hack-on-sim-swap-attack-in-fake-bitcoin-etf-post.htm">SEC</a>) finally approved the first round of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/castle-fund-just-because-bitcoin-etfs-are-allowed-doesnt-mean-theyll-succeed.htm">ETFs</a>) in January. Per the CTO,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Although the initial hype around this news has since faded, major investments from institutions are only beginning.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, throughout February and the rest of 2024, we’ll see more of these large players from TradFi start to enter the crypto space.</p>
<figure id="attachment_156731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156731" style="width: 2401px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-156731" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes.png" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes.png 2401w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-300x157.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-1024x537.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-768x403.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-1536x806.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption-text">The daily volume (in USD) for spot bitcoin ETFs. Source: theblock.co</figcaption></figure>
<p>Therefore, we&#8217;ll soon see to what extent institutional investors and ETFs factor into the market’s price movement.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note the anticipation building around the next <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">Bitcoin halving</a>, expected in April.</p>
<p>Halvings typically signal the start of a new bull market cycle for BTC – but also for altcoins. It will be interesting to see, Stadelmann said, if BTC and/or altcoins can reach new all-time highs post-halving.</p>
<h2>DeFi Market Poised to Grow Again</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Things have significantly changed for DeFi between 2022 and 2024. And the shift goes beyond crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/expect-massive-inflows-to-follow-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-but-bull-market-is-still-in-question-experts-say.htm">market</a> prices.</p>
<p>The bear market of 2022 brought numerous challenges to many DeFi projects, Stadelmann said. This includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-atm-vulnerability-fixed-hackers-could-have-gained-full-control.htm">vulnerabilities</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-setback-smart-contract-exploit-results-over-200-ethscriptions-being-nabbed.htm">smart contract exploits</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/regulatory-uncertainty-makes-poloniex-deeply-frustrated-3887.htm">regulatory uncertainties</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>And these remain major concerns in 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also during 2022, DeFi&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) went from more than $150 billion to less than $40 billion. However, as of January 2024, TVL has rebounded to $55 billion at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The CTO opined,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The space appears poised to grow once again.”</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_156727" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156727" style="width: 1192px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-156727" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama.png" alt="" width="1192" height="330" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama.png 1192w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama-300x83.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama-1024x283.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama-768x213.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama-150x42.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1192px) 100vw, 1192px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-156727" class="wp-caption-text">Source: defillama.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another noteworthy shift since 2022 has been the maturation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-dominates-with-nearly-50-of-ethereum-layer-2-total-value-locked.htm">Layer 2</a> (L2) blockchain networks, which has increased scalability and reduced transaction costs. DeFi applications on these networks are now usable from a cost perspective, said the expert.</p>
<p>Also, cross-chain interoperability developments have contributed to a more united DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Major Themes for 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We’ve already noted the potential future movements in crypto prices, investment sentiment, and DeFi markets.</p>
<p>But 2024 has much more to offer. Stadelmann listed the year’s major themes. He said these will gain more importance even beyond 2024 as the crypto space matures.</p>
<p>First and foremost, he said, is the interoperability among different <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-association-addresses-sen-warrens-criticism-of-crypto-hires.htm">blockchain</a> networks.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the blockchain space diversifies, the need for users to trade across blockchains will only continue to increase.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the CTO’s opinion, more users will turn to peer-to-peer (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/p2p-crypto-platform-paxful-resumes-operations-led-by-delaware-lawyer-heres-latest.htm">P2P</a>) bridge solutions, like the one offered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/last-minute-crypto-gift-ideas-for-tech-natives-and-newcomers.htm"><strong>Komodo Wallet</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Next: L2s will continue to grow and witness accelerated adoption. More users are moving into the DeFi space and are using decentralized apps (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ledger-removes-bug-allowing-popular-decentralized-applications-to-be-compromised-heres-the-latest.htm">dapps</a>) more frequently. Hence, it is critical to alleviate Layer 1 congestion and reduce transaction costs by processing a significant portion of transactions off-chain.</p>
<p>Stadelmann said that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The ongoing development and adoption of L2 solutions signify a crucial step towards achieving mainstream scalability for blockchain technology.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Gary Gensler is Not Interested in Crypto Industry’s Opinion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The central theme for 2024, Stadelmann said, is the pursuit of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-senator-says-lack-of-regulatory-clarity-driving-crypto-outside-us.htm">regulatory clarity</a>. And greater certainty will, hopefully, create a catalyst for accelerated market growth.</p>
<p>Governments and regulatory bodies globally are increasingly engaging with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptocurrency-industry-spends-record-18-96-million-in-federal-lobbying-so-far-in-2023.htm">the crypto industry</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Stadelmann recently <a href="https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/01/08/open-letter-gary-gensler-decision-define-sec-legacy/">wrote an open lette</a>r to SEC Chair <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gary-gensler-warns-about-ais-impact-to-financial-systems-doesnt-touch-on-cryptocurrency.htm">Gary Gensler</a>. Asked if Gensler is interested in hearing the crypto industry’s opinions, Stadelmann replied that he doesn’t think so.</p>
<p>One positive move from Gensler’s administration was the approval of new ETFs. And yet,</p>
<blockquote><p>“After years of delays, the main factor for approval was likely political pressure from capital-rich institutions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, we have seen very little movement to protect investors or make crypto more accessible to investors, he said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SEC enforcement actions against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-faces-sec-pressure-for-financial-transparency-in-ongoing-legal-saga.htm"><strong>Ripple</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/judge-to-address-in-binance-case-are-cryptocurrencies-securities-under-u-s-law.htm"><strong>Binance</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-gives-coinbase-shot-at-full-dismissal-in-sec-case.htm"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm"><strong>Kraken</strong></a> have stunted the potential growth of the crypto industry. And while the agency has clear evidence against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-likens-binance-ftx-expresses-concern-over-crypto-industry.htm"><strong>FTX</strong></a> and “other industry players that have blatantly hurt investors,” argued Stadelmann, Gensler decided not to focus on these issues.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3&#x20e3;Fraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure retail investors into scams. These investments continue to be replete w/ fraud- bogus coin offerings, Ponzi &amp; pyramid schemes, &amp; outright theft where a project promoter disappears w/ investors’ money.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>NFT Use Cases Wil Result in More Interest</h2>

Finally, non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/magic-eden-rewards-top-nft-news-today-24-january.htm">NFTs</a>), despite discussions of their decline, are here to stay.</p>
<p>Stadelmann said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am optimistic about their future in 2024 and beyond. The NFT market has undergone a major shift in focus, expanding beyond digital art to include gaming, virtual real estate, and metaverse-related assets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Industries will continue to adopt NFT technology. Subsequently, use cases will diversify and lead to renewed interest.</p>
<p>“I predict we’ll see NFT become more integrated with real-world assets, which will provide unique experiences that go beyond simple digital ownership,” the CTO opined.</p>

<h2>Why Don’t We Have DeFi Simplicity Yet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It’s been said for years that simplicity and ease of use are the answer to DeFi’s adoption issues. Stadelmann argues that achieving this goal has proven to be a difficult task.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle is the inherent complexity of DeFi processes involving <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/liquidity-pool-comprising-paypals-pyusd-stablecoin-on-curve-locks-135-million-in-value.htm">liquidity pools</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-yield-farming.htm#:~:text=Yield%20farming%2C%20to%20put%20it,they%20come%20with%20high%20risk.">yield farming</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Balancing user-friendly interfaces with the intricacies of blockchain technology presents a non-stop challenge.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some potential solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhance user education through comprehensive tutorials; e.g. users taking the time to learn about the fundamentals of blockchain technology and how to use specific DeFi platforms;</li>
<li>simplify the DeFi onboarding process for crypto newcomers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Komodo Wallet, for example, recently added a <a href="https://app.komodoplatform.com/#/fiat">fiat on-ramp</a>, lowering the barrier to DeFi market participation. Users can directly buy crypto with fiat instead of signing up for a centralized exchange account and learning how to transfer assets on-chain.</p>
<h2>Year of the Dragon Brings New Roadmap</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Stadelmann couldn’t share any specific Komodo’s plans for 2024, but said that it will focus on enhancing blockchain interoperability to unify the DeFi space.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We plan to release our 2024 roadmap on Chinese New Year, which falls on February 10, 2024, as it marks the beginning of the Year of the Dragon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, in December, the platform added the above-mentioned fiat on-ramp to Komodo Wallet (web) that supports providers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brazils-central-bank-pix-joins-ramp-networks-payment-solutions.htm"><strong>Ramp</strong></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-banxa-and-cardanos-yoroi-wallet-enable-in-app-fiat-on-off-ramping-bybit-reveals-personality-based-trading-nft-usdt-competition.htm"><strong>Banxa</strong></a>, which support bank transfers, <strong>Apple Pay</strong>, <strong>Visa</strong>/<strong>Mastercard</strong> cards, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former CIA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden on Tuesday called for financial aid to support Tornado Cash founder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tornado-cash-co-founder-expresses-concerns-about-upcoming-trial-on-money-laundering-charges.htm">Roman Storm’s legal defense</a>.</p>
<p>Storm and his co-founder Semenov were <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1702">arrested</a> in Aug. 2023 for alleged sanctions violations in the US through their crypto mixing service, accused of laundering over $1b.</p>
<p>“My legal team and I are going to put forth a strong defense at trial, not just for my family&#8217;s sake, but for the future of software developers and financial privacy,” Storm said in a video posted to X on Monday.</p>
<p>“Folks, I need your help. Whether you&#8217;re a passionate developer, involved with Web3, or just care about software and privacy, this legal battle will affect you. So, please help contribute to my legal defense, because this case will set a major precedent for years to come,” he added.</p>
<p>Storm, who holds both US and Russian citizenship, was <a href="https://twitter.com/brianeklein/status/1694779420731658700">released on bail</a> shortly after his detention on a $2 million bond secured against his Washington state residence.</p>
<p>Snowden has asked supporters to help, saying: ” Privacy is not a crime.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you can help, please help. Privacy is not a crime. <a href="https://t.co/R4vauNLRB4">https://t.co/R4vauNLRB4</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1749860224612159834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Tornado Cash saw an 85% drop in transactions following OFAC sanctions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Storm, together with Semenov and developer Alexey Pertsev, founded Tornado Cash in 2019.</p>
<p>The mixer, still operational as of now, offers users a way to hide their transaction history, effectively protecting their financial privacy from outside observation.</p>
<p>Tornado Cash accomplishes this by masking the trails of transactions, providing a shield against any form of surveillance and tracking.</p>
<p>In 2022, the US Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/the-chopping-block-did-ofac-overstep-by-sanctioning-tornado-cash-ep-386.htm">imposed sanctions</a> on Tornado Cash for alleged exploitation by North Korean hackers in money laundering activities.</p>
<p>These sanctions intended to forbid anyone in the US from engaging with the service, including sending or receiving funds through it.</p>
<p>The indictment claimed that Tornado Cash functioned as a money service business without registration, a requirement under FinCEN regulations.</p>
<p>Post OFAC sanctions, <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/tornado-cash-volume-dramatically-reduced-post-sanctions-but-illicit-actors-are-still-using-the-mixer">Tornado Cash saw an 85% drop in overall volume</a>, with illicit transactions through the mixer decreasing by about 77%, according to TRM Labs.</p>
<h2>Edward Snowden’s advocacy mirrored in Storm&#8217;s mission</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Snowden&#8217;s backing of Roman Storm makes sense, as they both appear to share views on privacy and encryption.</p>
<p>He became known for disclosing National Security Agency (NSA) materials to the media, resulting in major privacy rulings and changes in policies and technologies.</p>
<p>Critics argue that Tornado Cash provides a legitimate tool for users seeking financial privacy, useful for anonymous political donations, or shielding personal finances.</p>
<p>Groups like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coin-center-sues-janet-yellen-over-tornado-cash-sanctions.htm">Coin Center</a> and the Blockchain Association have backed the service&#8217;s developers.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host Matt Zahab and we are buzzing as always. And I am super pumped to have one of the OGs. Now what I mean OG, this guy is a true original gangster, may or may not have worked on the first smart contract in the whole friggin world. And I&#8217;m not talking like you guys are probably thinking, oh, it was in 2010, a couple of years before ETH was created. No, this was before I was born. This is a very OG smart contract. We&#8217;re going to get into all this. But before we do the show, the star of the show today we have Dean Tribble, the CEO of Agoric Opco, the software dev company supporting Agoric, the JavaScript smart contract platform and proof of stake Blockchain. Dean drives the vision to build a safe and composable JavaScript smart contract platform to onboard the next 14 million developers into Web3. As discussed, Dean is a literal OG cypherpunk and pioneer in distributed systems and smart contract technology as he may have literally worked and built on the first smart contract ever. Also had another company called Agorics where he was CTO and it got acquired by Microsoft. Ever heard of him? He was also CTO of VerifyValid and VP of Deluxe where his echeck systems have carried billions of dollars. We have a true OG on the pod today and he has one of the most electric mustaches I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life. Super pumped to have him on. Dean, welcome to the show my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>I am doing great. Thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m excited to be here. I occasionally say yes and this mustache is older than Vitalik but.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it. Dean, super pumped to have you on here my man. You have an incredible background and sometimes we get the term OG thrown around on the podcast and I usually refer to those as like OGs in the crypto space where they got in between 2010 to 2013, 2014. They&#8217;ve been in the space for a decade. In the crypto space that would usually quantify you as an OG. But when we talk about smart contracts here, you told me before the show that you worked on the first smart contract in 1989. That is friggin bananas. Dean I was born in 1995.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>I was young, I was like three years old. No, the first production smart contract. I don&#8217;t know what people were doing in labs, but this was deployed to production with paying customers running pre-Internet, pre-web. You dial up on your, whatever it is, 1200 bod modem to connect to this thing in order to orchestrate. What&#8217;s a smart contract is sort of the heart of this software that is enforcing the terms of a contract like arrangement between third parties, right? So it&#8217;s so eBay, PayPal, Venmo, Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, those are all smart contract businesses. So smart contract was trillion dollar market cap before Blockchain came along, right? It&#8217;s about the role of the software to the customers. And so it enables strangers to cooperate. And that&#8217;s really been our vision, our mission for now, literally decades, is software enabling strangers to cooperate. Right? Millions of people buy things from strangers that they probably wouldn&#8217;t like if they met them in person. And it works every day, all the time, because software is orchestrating and enforcing the terms of the exchange, the delivery, the monies, all these kinds of things. There used to be a comedian that would do an act of, okay, so I&#8217;m going to summon a stranger to my house, climb into the stranger&#8217;s car, and have them take me someplace that I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going. And I&#8217;ve never met this person. And if you told someone 20 years ago that people were going to be doing this all the time, every day, they would look at you like you were crazy. And yet, because you could build software in the middle that could orchestrate and add safety and security and investigation and background and all these things. Now, people do that routinely, all the time, orchestrated by software, enforcing the terms of that engagement. And so it&#8217;s huge value. It&#8217;s really changed the face of the world and how we do business. And the first production, one of those that was really thought of itself as smart contract logic that was doing this sort of thing was the Amex in 1989, and I helped help get the smart contract part of it. Right?</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>That&#8217;s wild. How does building present day smart contracts on Ethereum and Solidity differ from the first one you ever built back in 1989? I mean, I&#8217;m sure absolutely every component is different, but I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through some of the biggest differences here, Dean.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>So first there&#8217;s, what&#8217;s the big difference of having Blockchain? So forget any of those things, right? Blockchain, we&#8217;ve got replicated execution on machines that are in different jurisdictions and different, administered by different independent parties, and they&#8217;re all checking each other&#8217;s work and coming to consensus about what happened. And that difference means that now you can run software with a level of integrity that did not exist before Blockchain. Right? You&#8217;re not trusting any one party, you&#8217;re not giving a backdoor if you do it, right. If you really decentralize, you&#8217;ve got this environment where you really can rely on the software. So now you can have smart contract businesses without a trusted intermediary like eBay or PayPal or Venmo, Airbnb or StubHub. Sometimes they take huge chunks, 35% of your ticket sales. Sometimes they do illegal things like Enron did, where they were a trusted intermediary for electricity trading. And it was a huge value potentially to the world. And they got greedy and started slipping in trades after, in theory, businesses closed and they were manipulating the market and all these things that a decentralized, transparent system they would not have been able to do, right? And so being able to eliminate the trusted intermediary by having software itself be what you rely on to enforce the terms of a contract like arrangement is what enables the Uniswaps and everything from sort of smart contracts on Ethereum to rich and more programmable environments like Gork. All of those are enabled by being able to run software with high integrity, which we weren&#8217;t able to do anywhere near this safely before. So that&#8217;s the first thing is Blockchain makes a difference there in terms of what you can do. Now, the thing about Solidity is it was hugely important in making that shift, right? Run software in an environment where it can&#8217;t be tampered with by any individual organization or regime. And that&#8217;s really important, right? Because at the level of scale we&#8217;re talking about reengineering how humans cooperate, regimes do intervene, right? And  it&#8217;s Venezuela or the US government doesn&#8217;t matter, right? If you&#8217;re on the other side of it, it&#8217;s not a comfortable place to be. And them being able to backdoor stuff so that you cannot rely on the software that&#8217;s executing would mean that software cannot provide us the kind of safe environment that if I physically meet you at a swap meet and trade something with you, I&#8217;ve got control of what&#8217;s going on. And it doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily that I&#8217;ve got necessarily the Tim May Cypherpunk world, but it&#8217;s got to be higher assurance than what regimes tend to want to have happen. Okay, so that&#8217;s the first. Then there&#8217;s the programming environment. Now, I compare ETH with Flash, right? If you remember Flash, you were just barely old enough. No, sorry, you remember Flash. All the marketing sites were Flash, all the Internet games, Flash, right? That was how people built interactive WYSI things right? One of the things that a prior company that was inspired by the same papers, right? So Agoric, by the way, comes from the greek word Agara, which means the open marketplace and so in 1986.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I like that.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Mark Miller. Yeah, it&#8217;s lovely. We&#8217;ve tried various grecian pillars as logos and stuff like that. So Mark Miller and Eric Drexler wrote a paper called the Agoric Open Systems paper that really shared a vision of software agents creating and participating in markets. And that was a big early piece that shows up on a16z cryptocanon. It&#8217;s one of the real inspirations for Nick Zabo, who worked with us at the time, and various others, Hal Finney and so forth, for how to build software, how to build large scale distributed systems. And so we had a prior company called Agoric that was building smart contracts at Sun Labs for doing control of network systems, control of network resources, compute resources and memory and satellite dish time, and all these kinds of things, right? So it&#8217;s an early smart contract environment. And so that was an area of getting software to enforce the terms of contract, like arrangement between third parties, where those third parties might be software agents, they might be AIs, or they might be people, right? Or they might be businesses, they might be any of these kinds of things. But you really want to be able to have a level, smooth playing field where all them could work again. So one of the things we did, because the macromedia Flash was trying to be able to do this desktop thing where you could pull in software from lots of third parties and run it, and they were having problems from a security point of view. So they brought us in to audit their computational model and how you do that. And one of the things we discovered was, yeah, synchronous reentrant call and message sender as a security model were both really problematic, real security hazards that humans could not get their head around, right? And so we saw this in Flash, which was the dominant programming language for large scale interactive experiences on the web. We saw this in Flash, and it was really harming the ability of Flash to grow. It was the brick wall that Flash programming is running into. And EVM has all those same properties. It was inspired by that work. It built along the same properties because they make simple things simple. They just make hard things essentially impossible. And so we&#8217;re now very early in the world of programming, right? I mean, there&#8217;s a lot of money in Blockchain, but we&#8217;re very mean, you know, AMM, you know, Uniswap. That&#8217;s huge. It&#8217;s a lot of money. It&#8217;s a really simple program. It&#8217;s a few thousand lines, right? I mean, it&#8217;s just, we&#8217;re not really doing yet large scale distributed applications on Blockchain. There&#8217;s an economy there and that&#8217;s really important and valuable. And I don&#8217;t mean to deride that at all, but it&#8217;s all very transactional. It&#8217;s all, I do one transaction, I can figure out what that looks like and then we&#8217;re done. Right? But most software doesn&#8217;t work that way. You don&#8217;t do large scale collaboration on a whiteboard using transactions. Right? You do it using long lived experiences, long lived software activities and that sort of thing that just don&#8217;t work well on current Blockchain. So back to your current question. So the programming model is pretty weak. It has fundamental security hazards that are very dangerous. The biggest difference in Blockchain world in some sense versus Web2 smart contracts is Web2 smart contracts. I&#8217;m hosting my environment, running my program, provide a service to my customers that is a smart contract service, but I&#8217;m in control of all the software I run in my environment. Right? And that means that I don&#8217;t have a lot of security hazards of running third party code and having third party code all cooperate with each other and attack each other. So the developer deploying to a Cloud service, they&#8217;re generally not deploying, where they&#8217;re also embedding third party code. Or at least that&#8217;s the theory, and let&#8217;s come back to that in a moment. But in the cryptoverse in Blockchain, you&#8217;re deploying in a hostile environment where because of pseudonymity and anonymity, it is very easy for attackers if there&#8217;s a hole in you, in your code to exploit it. Yeah, and because money shows up there first, and there&#8217;s good reason why money shows up in the cryptoverse first before lots of other ways we might leverage this software because money shows up there first. It&#8217;s a rich target. So you&#8217;ve got an immature market with platforms that have fundamental security hazards that are hard for humans to reason about in a hostile environment. And so that&#8217;s been an interesting adventure and breeding ground and stuff like that. We&#8217;ve got people talk about ETH as sort of the proven, battle tested. No, it&#8217;s lost $9 billion. That&#8217;s not battle tested. That&#8217;s you lost. So it&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s a hostile environment, it&#8217;s dangerous environment. We have much better techniques that have been deployed there that are one of the reasons why we built Agoric and other people have built other technologies to solve other parts of that hard problem. But that&#8217;s one of the ways in which it is a different environment is that you&#8217;re going out into a target rich environment, as it were.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>100%. Great spiel there, Dean. Speaking of Agoric, let&#8217;s jump right into it. Give me the elevator pitch. Give me the 32nd TLDR too long didn&#8217;t read elevator pitch on Agoric. And then we&#8217;ll get into all the fun stuff because we have  snaps to talk about. We have your Mainnet One B partnership with BitGo, IST, ShadeSwap. You guys have been absolutely launching stuff left, right and center. Before we get into all the cool launches, though. Give me the elevator pitch, then we&#8217;ll get into it.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Sure. And then ask me in a month the elevator pitch will change just a little bit. So let me tease that. So the hardest thing to scale is developers, right? You can&#8217;t sort of scale users with one app that lots of people want to use, but that doesn&#8217;t scale the platform or the economy. For that, you need to scale developers. You need millions of developers if you&#8217;re going to get where a business that wants to roll out a website also wants to update the smart contracts or do something a little bit custom for their special business. And you don&#8217;t take over the world, you don&#8217;t take over the economy, you don&#8217;t take over how people do business unless all the developers on the planet can build this stuff, right? Web2 is all over the world because millions of developers can program it. And so to do that, you have to meet developers where they&#8217;re at, and you have to meet them with an abstract enough model they can program to it. They don&#8217;t care in the mainstream about wether it&#8217;s ETH or Solana or Agoric or Cosmos or whatever. What they care, what users care about is the experience they can get, and they care about it being safe and they care about it being usable, and they care about all the things that they care about in Web2. There&#8217;s nothing magical about Web3, except that you have early adopters that care to make sure it&#8217;s decentralized and private and enables them to do things that they weren&#8217;t able to do before. But as you start expanding that out, these fundamental basics of it&#8217;s got to be usable, it&#8217;s got to be focused on. My benefits are fundamental. So we enable the world&#8217;s developers to be able to approach Web3. And we enable it in a way that through our system, they can orchestrate, they can coordinate activity across lots of assets, across lots of chains without it being something they have to think about very hard. That ability to rapidly build rich, complex, interesting applications is something that has not been available to Web3 before. And that&#8217;s what we bring to the table.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Super interesting there. And the name, I love the name, too. What is it about everyone stealing names from the old greek language? They all slap, too, though. You know what I mean, Dean? I love it. But anyway.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Okay, so Agoric came was one of the early ones, right? That was 85, 86.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>No, that&#8217;s very true.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Originally inspired by software. Sorry. Using markets to control resource allocation in software. Right? That computers were crossing the threshold where instead of talking about tens of bytes or hundreds of bytes or maybe 600 and 40k was a big machine at the time. Right? Instead of talking about that, you&#8217;re talking about gigabytes and terabytes, and now you can&#8217;t manage all of that yourself. How do you do that? And that&#8217;s where Agoric came from, was use markets to bid for compute cycles and memory and network space.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>A little off topic here, Dean? But is that sort of similar to what we&#8217;re seeing in the AI space with all the race for GPU power?</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Yes, actually, very much. And it&#8217;s another one of those things where there&#8217;s demand for a resource, there&#8217;s a lot of it. You&#8217;re not going to manage individual GPUs. You want to manage them by large swaths, and you want to allocate them to where they&#8217;re valuable for. You would like to do that in a way so that people can get large volume, but small players can still come in and get high value volume. Microeconomics and markets are great for that, and they&#8217;re better than all the central planning fallacies that governments across the world want to use for how to allocate resources. Markets are just great. And so using them for allocating compute resources for high demand is really valuable. And that&#8217;s why. EIP, what is it? 1557. The market based allocation of block space. One of the contenders was an algorithm from the original Agoric open systems papers. The escalator algorithm was designed to show how you could do incentive analysis and mechanism design for using auctions to do compute resource allocation. And we now see that showing up for blockspace auctions in Blockchain.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>So cool, Dean, let&#8217;s jump into  Snaps here. MetaMask has introduced Snaps, which is an application built to add extended features and functionality to MetaMask. MetaMask is one of the most popular and important apps to the Blockchain space as a whole, minus the whole seed phrase part. It&#8217;s pretty darn easy to use. It&#8217;s pretty darn efficient to use. I personally think we need something a little bit better to onboard the masses, but in regards to MetaMask as a whole, it is a pretty friggin darn good app, and I&#8217;m sure a lot of us are very grateful to have it. You and the team worked your tails off to help launch MetaMask Snaps, and I&#8217;d love for you to talk about it.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>So remember earlier I mentioned deploying Web2 apps is not the same hostile environment, right? You&#8217;re running third party code in your application. But in fact you are right, because the study of all these apps says that only 3% of the code in some large scale deployed web apps, and typical across GitHub, only 3% is actually application code you wrote, and 97% is libraries you got from somewhere else. So there&#8217;s this big supply chain of how do you trust those libraries? How much authority do those libraries have? And in typical web architecture they have all the authority of your application running, and you&#8217;ve got complete exposure to all of that code. You know, Aaron Davis, one of the founders of MetaMask, was concerned about that. He was concerned about their software supply chain. And so he and Dan Finley searched around and they saw what Agoric was doing for hardened JavaScript. It was called SES at the time, and that&#8217;s been an effort. That was one of the things that led to Agoric is it&#8217;s been an effort over the last 15 years, Mark Miller, our Chief Scientist, has been driving into the JavaScript standards, the elements to be able to do large scale safe programming where you&#8217;re not completely exposed to every library you try to use, where you can grab something and say, here&#8217;s the authority you have and no more. And it&#8217;s easy to program that. When I load a clock, it needs access to the timer, but it does not need access to Unix Exec, it does not need access to my password file, it does not need access to my keys, it doesn&#8217;t have to encrypt anything, it just needs to read the damn time, right? And so when I created, I want it to be trivial programming behaviorally, so it gets the authority to read the clock and that&#8217;s it. And now I can ask it the time and it could lie about the time, right? It could be a bad clock, but it can&#8217;t lie about the time. And oh by the way, send my password file to another country, right? Because it just launched loads with just the authority it needs in a natural programming style, and it does not check that the guy asking for the time is one of those people that&#8217;s allowed to ask for the time, like the message sender silliness that you get from Flash and Solidity and so forth, because that&#8217;s just a terrible model for composing libraries into larger applications. The model is I launch you, I give you the time thing, and now you can tell me the time I want, you can format, oh, I want to give you my location, my locale, so you can format it in international form, that&#8217;s great too. You don&#8217;t get to sniff around my disc and decide what area I&#8217;m on, you don&#8217;t get to look at the geo, and I give it to you to decide what physical location I&#8217;m in. It&#8217;s like, I&#8217;ll tell you where I&#8217;m at, you just give me the render. So they reach out to us and we connected on that. And that was the basis of the JavaScript execution model that we&#8217;re running on a Blockchain where we natively execute standard JavaScript just in a deterministic fashion. So you can run on 100 machines and come to the same answer, even though you&#8217;re running it at different times in different locations. So hardly JavaScript is the way I refer to it. And the way to think about it is it&#8217;s the JavaScript you thought you were programming in already. It is the version of JavaScript that does what you expect when you&#8217;re doing things. JavaScript starts out very malleable, right? You can change what it means to iterate an array, to walk through all the elements of an array and print them out, or format them, or do something with them. And the problem is you can change that to oh, by the way, read the file system, copy a file and send it to another country, right? And that is not what I expect when I iterate an array. That is not what I expect when I print a message to the user. And so what hardened JavaScript does is it locks down the world, so that the array iteration or printing a message to the user does what I expect, it does what the standard says. So JavaScript starts out very malleable, which is useful for certain kinds of things, but almost no application actually needs that or wants that. What it wants is the JavaScript programming language that they are all programming in. And so that&#8217;s what hardened JavaScript is. And in that process we lock down all of the security hazards that people sort of think of historically associated with JavaScript, but they&#8217;ve been locked down for a long time. It&#8217;s just people sort of still have this racial memory of early days of JavaScript, but JavaScript every day controls trillions of dollars in transactions across every facet of human existence. If it had big security hazards, people would not be doing that and they&#8217;d know by now.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Well said there Dean. We got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor the show. But when we get back we have to discuss your guys&#8217; massive partnership with BitGo and of course BLD staking, which is pretty freaking cool. Until then, huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, that is PrimeXBT. We love the team at PrimeXBT as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. PrimeXBT is also running an exclusive promotion for listeners of the Cryptonews Podcast. Use the promo code <b>CRYPTONEWS50</b> that is CRYPTONEWS50 all one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Dean. Let&#8217;s jump right into the partnership with BitGo and you guys integrating BLD. This is massive for institutional adoption of DeFi, tons of financial institutions want access to creme de la creme grade smart contracts. They don&#8217;t have the wherewithal or the know how and the resources to do it themselves. So they piggyback off of people like yourselves and your team. You gotta love to see that shit. Walk me through the partnership here. What is the importance of partnering with BitGo? And walk me through a little bit more because full disclosure, Dean, I don&#8217;t  fully understand the whole BLD staking and how that helps. But I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through why the partnership with Bitco and the importance of the BLD staking as well.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>So first, BLD is the native token of the Agoric chain. It&#8217;s, if you will, the foundation on which the economy is built. So it provides governance. It&#8217;s how you can get an account abstraction wallet set up, which we&#8217;ve had forever. It is an element that is used for getting rewards from the system. And the design of the Agoric system is a two token world where BLD is at the bottom and that&#8217;s the foundation on which things are built. And IST Interstable Token is a stable token natively built in JavaScript using all the best practices of overcollateralized, backed by crypto assets and other stables. But it&#8217;s all designed, the infrastructure and platform is all designed natively to include async network access, async secure access to assets on other chains. And so the IST stable token, for example, can you pull over Atom or staked Atom, some of the staking derivatives or Osmo or various other things, assets that the community will decide are appropriate backing, use those as collateral and mint the stable token IST and then you can take it to other chains across the ecosystem. Not just use it on Agoric to pay gas fees or pay for network services, but buy NFTs on Stargaze and OmniFlix, or buy assets in Osmosis or ShadeSwap or other places. And so it&#8217;s a stable token that is starting out on Agoric, starting out designed for the connected interchange, bridging across. It just went live on StellaSwap, on Polkadot, I think. And so it&#8217;s sort of appearing and spreading outwards because it&#8217;s very focused on being about sort of the chain abstract world, the world where, I&#8217;ve just got robust stuff that&#8217;s running on robust systems providing services to users. I don&#8217;t care where it&#8217;s running, I want to be able to pay for it with the same kinds of mechanisms. I want to be able to access assets on Aave or Solana or wherever it is and roll them up into complex, interesting interactions that needs to be programmed in sort of the Agoric nice async smart contracting model and so forth. So build is the fundamental token that lets institutions and whales and others participate in that new foundation that will be rolling out and ramping up this year. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s exciting for them to have access to build is that something that as we start connecting to Web2 and getting some of these Web2 interested parties able to now start participating in Web3, start to build in Web3, that interesting to institutions, that here&#8217;s the place that they&#8217;ll be able to participate, they&#8217;ll understand how to do so, and that lets them participate economically as well. And the economy that grows with ISD, the economy that grows with functionality on the Agoric chain and with being able to coordinate access to assets on other chains, that economy, it pays rewards to build holders that stake. So that&#8217;s where the staking comes in is the way you really participate. You get build, you stake it, and now you go deploy your thing and you&#8217;re going to get rewards from the overall ecosystem based on the ongoing usage and growth of the platform. And we&#8217;re very focused on it tying to usage and growth. Right? The important thing is that participation be aligned with growing the economy, with growing participation, with growing activity, as opposed to aligned with charging rents for people coming on board, right? One of the things you see in a lot of these chains, there&#8217;ll be an underlying token. ETH is the canonical example, but it&#8217;s common and it&#8217;s useful for starters, where you pay gas fees on Ethereum in ETH, right? ETH is a volatile commodity. It&#8217;s different yesterday from tomorrow. It&#8217;s subject to lots of market fluctuations. And yet you&#8217;re paying effectively your postage bill or your rent using these volatile assets. I mean, that&#8217;s like paying for your rent with gold or with Apple shares. You can do it. But a few thousand years ago, we realized that an economy that used stable units of account and stable currencies for paying for services and long lived contracts was a better economy. Right? It had less friction. It made it much more plausible to do some of the kinds of things I talked about that you can&#8217;t easily do in crypto right now, like long term contracts, subscriptions, mortgages, these things where I&#8217;m not going to cut a mortgage in ETH, that I&#8217;m going to be owing a certain amount of ETH in 40 years. That would be crazy. I have no idea what ETH will be worth in 40 years. Right? But I kind of have an idea of what the dollar will be worth, or the euro, or anything that&#8217;s designed to be low volatility. Yeah, it&#8217;ll go up smoothly, but it&#8217;ll still be sort of a predictable thing so I can write a long term contract, I can hedge a long term contract, I can trade off different things. You really want your economy to be in terms of stable units of account of things with low volatility. And so we want that to grow. So the reward to the build stakers where build is this token that is intended to be able to grow with the size of the economy. It provides rewards for the economy growing the amount of IST transacting the amount of economic activity, not just the amount of thrashing of computers happening. And so that means it&#8217;s the equivalent of paying your rent in dollars, not paying your rent.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Huge.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Okay, so back to BitGo. So the thing that BitGo brings is they bring a network of 1500 institutions, make whales and exchanges. And so that provides much better, much richer, much easier access to build for the larger world of economic participants in crypto and growing. They also work with, and this is one of the places where it&#8217;s just so exciting to find this alignment where they work with major brands and sort of enterprises and small and medium companies as well, but they work with Web2 companies, they work with traditional companies that are trying to find their way into how can we work safely with crypto in a way that brings its value but keeps us in our lane, producing value that we need to for our customers. And wether that&#8217;s the Nikes of the world that are dipping their toe into NFTs to celebrate activity, or NFTs to provide access to events and access to private content, those are really valuable. But that&#8217;s not something that they should dive directly in and expose themselves to the kinds of regulatory thing that BitGo is already expert at and a lot of us are already experienced with. And so working with BitGo aligns well with we&#8217;re an ideal platform for Web2 applications to start getting to start moving over into Web3 and adding Web3 capability because you&#8217;re already programming in a language that they already know. It already works with their existing tools vs. Code and Webstorm, it uses the best in practice style of programming of libraries with components that you can reuse. And those are things that the rest of crypto just doesn&#8217;t really have. And it&#8217;s sort of the bar that Web2 programmers kind of expect. And this is one of the ways that we are one of the fundamental bridges for getting crypto access out to the mainstream world of developers and giving mainstream developers the ability to get in, try things without having to spend six months learning a language that they might never want to use again. Right? Instead, let&#8217;s just use the stuff they&#8217;ve got and meet them where they&#8217;re at. And so partnering with BitGo, we just got a bunch of opportunities there.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>100%. Dean, you&#8217;ve been on a roll here. One more question and then we will wrap up as we are getting a little tight for time. Bitcoin, absolutely massive right now. More powerful than ever with the recent ETF news. We love to see that you&#8217;re big on institutional adoption. You guys are doing a bunch for institutional adoption of DeFi. We just talked about that with Agoric&#8217;s partnership with BitGo. Let&#8217;s jump into Bitcoin in particular and something that you guys are doing, which is the Babylon integration for Bitcoin timestamping. This is a little above my pay grade. I don&#8217;t completely understand the importance of this. I&#8217;d love if you could dumb it down and explain it to a non dev guy like myself. Walk me through this integration, this partnership, and why and how Babylon integration for Bitcoin timestamping is so important.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Sure. So remember I said the value Blockchain brings is multiple machines in different jurisdictions running the same stuff and coming to consensus. There are lots of different mechanisms for consensus, and that&#8217;s getting faster and stronger and better. So Bitcoin has the granddaddy magic that Satoshi brought to the world, which is this proof of work Consensus, right? So the simple thing, people, when they hear about Consensus, they think voting, right? I&#8217;ve got an electorate. There&#8217;s an issue at hand. They vote. The issue might be, did Dean win the election or did he get his money back? Because in Agoric, it&#8217;s one or the other, and I can&#8217;t get rugged, right? But it&#8217;s a bunch of machines that they vote. And if I know what all those machines are, I can count the votes. Okay, now, it turns out to be much more complicated than that, because I can count the votes, but why should you trust me? So instead, there&#8217;s these weird protocols so that all of them count the votes and they come to agreement that they all agree that Dean won the auction or whatever it is, right? And so that Consensus is critical for decentralization. It means that compromising some subset of those machines, you can&#8217;t compromise the integrity of execution, because two thirds plus one will still vote that Dean won the auction. And the people that some organization compromised, well, they just end up getting voted off the island, right? Because they&#8217;re clearly out to lunch. And so that ability to, if I can name all the machines they can vote, is where proof of stake and these fast finality engines come in. But what Bitcoin came up with was, this was before we knew how to do decentralized proof of stake. And people wonder about it. It still means that people with money could do the staking. There&#8217;s always concerns, as we continue to try to push the limits of how sure can we make it that these are not subject to compromise. The thing that proof of work does in Bitcoin in particular is it has a model where machines can come to Consensus without knowing all the machines participating, right? So there could be 10,000 machines participating, none of which I&#8217;ve heard of, and yet they can come to consensus, and it sounds like magic. That&#8217;s why I refer to it as the proof of work magic that Satoshi brought to the table. It really was important and novel. That was a huge contribution to the world&#8217;s ability to do safe computation. And so it continues to exist. One of the values of Bitcoin is that it kind of is the same thing. It&#8217;s kind of stable over time. It&#8217;s not evolving rapidly to adapt to what it is we need right now. People like to refer to it as money. To my concern, to my perspective, it is not a money. It is an asset. It is like gold. Its value may change, but it is this valuable asset. At some point, they&#8217;re not making more of it. It&#8217;s clear how much it inflates all that sort of thing. So it makes a great asset on which to base things and so forth. And so it has this novel security model that is time tested, is well understood and really seems robust and will be robust going into the future. The nice thing about what Babylon brings is let&#8217;s take all these additional things that people are doing for faster performance that we all think is secure. But like any crypto algorithm, you think it&#8217;s secure until it&#8217;s not. And so one of the nice things that the Babylon chain does is it brings back all of those things and links them back to the granddaddy security model of Bitcoin. And you don&#8217;t really want a lot of proof of work chains because it&#8217;s slow. It takes a long time to be sure it&#8217;s gotten to finality. It&#8217;s power intensive and so forth. But it is uniquely powerful in the assurance that it gives you. So by being able to link all these novel things going out there back to the security of Bitcoin, you now get all the security weight, all of that assurance that Bitcoin&#8217;s expensive security model provides, you can now provide it to all these much faster, much lighter, much more expressive systems out there like Agoric. And so it&#8217;s one of those things, where did we need it now? No, you don&#8217;t need security until, oops, I wish we had had security. You need it before you need to put it in place before you need it. And since this is a year where the ability to abstract across chains, chain abstraction, right? Agoric is a key part of the future of chain abstraction, the future of making it so that people coming in, they can just experience all these assets and services without thinking very hard about where they&#8217;re at. You were a key ingredient of that. We could ramp very quickly. And having that security in the bank as it were having that underpinning there in place is really a nice thing to have, right? It&#8217;s a nice value to be able to lean on when we need it going forward. So that&#8217;s why that&#8217;s exciting. Additionally, it is an example of this broad connectivity, this ability to orchestrate across chains. And so the ability to have Bitcoin and start to access it as an asset value Babylon is a great example. One of the earliest of hey, this asset out there, we can apply it in ways that don&#8217;t compromise its integrity, but instead leverage it to do these other things. Starting to get it in where Bitcoin is the token that everybody knows already. JavaScript is the programming language that everybody knows already. The future potential of pulling those together. And I note, incidentally, that BitGo is the one that does wrap Bitcoin potential of being able to enable all the programmers in the world to program the main asset they&#8217;ve already heard of. If they&#8217;ve been hiding under a rock or hiding in an IT group somewhere, that&#8217;s the kind of thing where opportunistically that could easily become really important.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The future of money is digital and many countries are developing their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). This in turn will have far-reaching implications on society, businesses, and banks, as the use of physical cash declines.</p>
<p>Retail CBDCs are government-backed digital fiat money which is regulated by the country’s central bank and seen as an alternative to crypto. But when it comes down to introducing CBDCs, there are concerns about data protection and security.</p>
<p>To use CBDCs individuals will have to part with personal information and this is where it gets sticky. Many individuals do not want their everyday transactions monitored. Let alone give the government access to this data which in turn could be used to control consumer behaviour on a mass scale.</p>
<p>Over the years Governments have pushed to develop CBDCs almost in response to crypto. Regulators and governments are wary of crypto due to the lack of transparency around the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Crypto remains volatile so is unlikely to be considered a currency despite El Salvador becoming the first country to make bitcoin legal tender in September 2021. We have yet to see if El Salvador’s Bitcoin bet pays off.</p>
<h3><strong>Donald Trump on CBDCs</strong></h3>
<p>Most recently former US President Donald Trump <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trumps-promise-i-will-never-allow-the-creation-of-a-cbdc.htm">grabbed headlines</a> speaking in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He defined CBDCs as a “dangerous threat to freedom.” Pro-crypto former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently dropped out of his campaign, was also present on stage, officially endorsing Trump.Trump has been dismissive about the value of cryptos and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the past.</p>
<p>The 2024 Republican frontrunner has once again promised against the creation of a CBDC “to protect Americans from government tyranny.”But would introducing CBDCs solve any issues? Is there a way around privacy and security concerns? The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claims there is <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp80.pdf">and released a report</a> in November 2023 on <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp80.pdf">“Project Tourbillon”</a> which explores privacy and security.</p>
<p>The BIS claims its findings through <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp80.pdf">Project Tourbillon</a> introduce a new privacy paradigm that balances user needs and public policy objectives: payer anonymity. For example, if a consumer pays a merchant using CBDCs and does not disclose personal information to anyone, including the merchant, banks and the central bank. So if the identity of the merchant is disclosed to the merchant’s bank (as part of the payment) but is kept confidential there. The central bank does not see any personal payment data.</p>
<h3><strong>Is China Ahead of the Curve? </strong></h3>
<p>Over the years many countries have been developing their own CBDCs almost in stealth mode. China’s e-CNY pilot has been distributed and used widely. For example from February to March 2022,  e-CNY was piloted in the Beijing Winter Olympics venues.</p>
<p>In December, Singapore’s regulatory body the<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg"> Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)</a>  said it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-china-to-begin-piloting-digital-currency-in-tourism-spending-push.htm">plans to begin piloting</a> the e-CNY in collaboration with China to encourage tourism spending. The two countries first signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work together back in 2020. No timeline was given for when the digital currency would be trialled.</p>
<p>Sweden’s e-krona CBDC – which will be issued by Sweden’s central bank, Riksbank, has put in place privacy architecture for its pilot. Sweden has been moving toward becoming a cashless society.</p>
<p>The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria have already introduced CBDCs. And more than 100 countries are in the exploration stage. Central bankers in Brazil, China, the euro area, India, and the UK are at the forefront, according to an <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/11/20/central-bank-digital-currency-development-enters-the-next-phase">International Monetary Fund (IMF) report</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the first <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-frenzy-begins-as-sec-finally-approves-first-spot-bitcoin-funds-bitcoin-remains-unresponsive.htm">Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded funds receive historic approval</a> in the United States, Asian industry leaders, particularly in Hong Kong, are actively exploring similar crypto products.</p>
<p>BitGo’s APAC Director Abel Seow told Cryptonews that they are witnessing an increased interest in similar products post spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States. He said that they are seeing increased momentum in markets like Hong Kong, and “murmur of interest” in places like South Korea.</p>
<p>Over a dozen fund providers are currently in discussions with Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to formulate a strategy for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/10-fund-companies-preparing-to-launch-spot-crypto-etfs-in-hong-kong.htm">launching a local Bitcoin spot ETF</a>.</p>
<p>Abel further noted that the surge in crypto ETFs shows that a lot of these regulators around the world have been keeping an eye on what the US are doing and what they will be doing. If the US approves spot Ethereum ETF in May, that could be another monumental moment for everyone involved, he added.</p>
<p>BitGo was earlier selected as custodian for Hashdex’s spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.</p>
<p>Talking about Hong Kong, Abel noted that they have deep capital markets among the best recognized markets in the region and a very skilled institutional workforce that is plugged into the rest of the world. Launching an ETF or ETF derivatives would be playing to their strengths, he added.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, several asset managers have hinted at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-expected-to-approve-spot-crypto-etfs-by-mid-2024.htm">launching a spot Bitcoin ETF this year in Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<h2>BitGo Eyes Further Expansion into Asia</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BiGo recently acquired in-principle approval as a major payment institution. Abel emphasized on the importance of Asian markets for them going forward. He noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve secured our IPA with MAS in Singapore with full approval coming soon. In Korea, we’ve established a partnership with Hana Bank, known as the JP Morgan of Korea. These milestones contribute to BitGo&#8217;s global expansion goals, and we are prioritizing the APAC region with new hires”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bitgo.com/newsroom/press-releases/bitgo-secures-usd100m-series-c-funding-at-usd1-75b-valuation/">BitGo raised $100 million</a> in series C funding at a valuation of $1.75 billion valuation in August last year.</p>
<h2>Future of Structured Crypto Products</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Talking about the future of structured crypto products like spot Bitcoin ETF, Abel said that there could be a world where such products become the norm for private clients to access crypto. He noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I suspect that as momentum builds up in this space, and people get more comfortable, they will see Bitcoin as an asset class no similar to tech stocks. And whether you want to buy options on GameStop or options on Bitcoin, it can be one of the same thing.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an insightful interview with <em>Cryptonews</em>, Dan Hoover, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer at investment firm <a href="https://www.castlefunds.com/"><strong>Castle Funds</strong></a>, discussed several Bitcoin ETF-related <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pantera-capital-projects-bitcoin-price-resurgence-and-increased-defi-market-activity.htm">topics</a>.</p>
<p>These include how valuable Bitcoin ETF trading volume information really is, what it takes for ETFs to succeed, why TradFi market minutiae are “very foreign” to most crypto market participants, and much more.</p>
<p>This is what he had to say.</p>
<h2>When is Trading Volume a Valuable Information?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The spot Bitcoin ETFs&#8217; initial trading volumes suggest that the supporting players in any successful exchange-traded product (ETP) launch are not yet up and running in volume, Hoover told <em>Cryptonews</em>. (Note: ETFs are a subset of ETPs as a broader category.)</p>
<p>Therefore, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Trading volume is only powerful information if it results in creation of new ETP shares (assets in the Trust that the sponsor can charge a fee on).”</p></blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, it just shows that the same shares are changing hands repeatedly.</p>
<p>Typically, this means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>hedging costs are high because of the poor availability of substitutes for the index/asset being tracked that can be cheaply borrowed;</li>
<li>there aren’t enough Authorized Participants (APs) onboarded to create or redeem shares, so there’s less urgency to create or redeem shares at lower premiums or discounts; fewer APs mean that arbitrage opportunities may exist in the market longer as there are fewer parties and less capital available to take advantage;</li>
<li>the equity options market-makers aren’t able to transact in size yet, usually due to high borrowing costs or broker-level restrictions on options trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an investor in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/spot-bitcoin-etfs-would-reduce-power-of-whales-and-increase-stability-nansen-analyst.htm">bitcoin</a> markets, said Hoover, he would prefer that the BTC held in an ETP be purchased in the market and belong only to the fund or Trust, instead of being borrowed from another party that keeps a claim on the coins.</p>

<h2>Just Because Bitcoin ETFs are Allowed Doesn’t Mean They’ll Succeed</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Spot Bitcoin ETFs come with a set of benefits. These include fewer access challenges for investors and a competitor for the poorly-performing futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, Hoover argued.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, the launch issues “will ease a bit.&#8221; There will be an opportunity for the market participants &#8211; APs, broker-dealers, and options market-makers &#8211; to resell ETPs to individual investors, Hoover said.</p>
<p>Long-term, however, while ETPs are “a reasonable solution” to the regulatory ambiguity constraining access for most US investors,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I believe that the ETP technology (with its additional liquidity sources, price discovery functions, etc.) is a poor solution to digital-asset market access problems.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, it took nearly three decades for ETFs to become fully regulated in the USA, so Hoover finds it unlikely that “the current suite of products will lose their regulatory reasons to exist any time soon.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the COO explained that the Bitcoin markets are “understandably very concerned” about several large market participants trading BTC on a continuous market – while the supply and demand are constrained to a single specific point in time five days a week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shane Rodgers, the Chairman and Co-founder of the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/interview-with-shane-rodgers-navigating-future-of-crypto-markets-amidst-regulatory-hurdles-altcoin-saturation.htm">PDX</a></strong> platform, argued that there aren’t downsides to the Bitcoin ETFs. The only thing is that, in the short term, investors continue to be “overly exposed to the vagaries of unsophisticated small money in the spot retail space.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, said Rodgers,</p>
<blockquote><p>“[There are] tremendous benefits to the upside in terms of prices and valuations, as well as, especially, increasing mass acceptance and adoption of BTC, and of crypto assets generally.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Issuing is one thing, but whether an ETP, including the spot Bitcoin ETF, will <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-ceo-most-of-11-approved-bitcoin-etfs-wont-survive-more-crypto-news.htm">actually succeed</a> is another. Hoover noted that success depends on several key questions. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the sponsor (<strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>Franklin</strong>, <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Bitwise</strong>, <strong>Grayscale</strong>) have enough relationships with APs, market makers, and institutional investors to keep trading in the Bitcoin ETF orderly?</li>
<li>Are there substitutes for the Bitcoin ETF that could be cheaper, safer, or track the underlying more closely if market conditions change?</li>
<li>Does the sponsor have relationships with enough brokerage houses to complete due diligence and trade on the platforms (e.g., <strong>Merrill Lynch</strong>, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, <strong>Edward Jones</strong>)?</li>
<li>Does the sponsor have enough other products or its own capital available to market its brand and support advisors with marketing materials?</li>
</ul>
<p>Rodgers opined that the only real differentiating factor so far in the approved BTC spot ETFs are the fees.</p>
<p>Additionally, crypto is still a speculative and volatile asset class. “The fact you can participate via an ETF does not mitigate the safety or volatility of the underlying spot asset,” he said.</p>

Hoover noted that it is essential to understand how demand for “exposure” to Bitcoin through an ETP actually impacts the “flows” or value of assets within that ETP.</p>

<p>He explained that the ETPs have several layers of separation between “demand for Bitcoin by investors” and additional shares.</p>
<p>Importantly,</p>
<blockquote><p>“These market minutiae are very foreign to most participants in the digital asset markets, and the idea that there are so many layers between market demand for the ETP and demand for the underlying asset can be difficult to connect with the expectations of &#8216;massive flows&#8217;.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hoover gave an example of an investor who wants to purchase ETP shares. They place the order with their broker. Then, the order could be filled from any or several sources.</p>
<p>Here are four scenarios, and only one results in ETP seeing additional assets under management (AUM):</p>
<ul>
<li>The broker has shares in inventory or an order from another customer in the opposite direction, in which case the ETP sees no additional AUM as a result of the investment.</li>
<li>The broker doesn’t have the shares available, but they can borrow in the shares. This happens under the assumption that they will have an offsetting order in the next two business days, which is standard settlement for the shares. The ETP again sees no additional AUM.</li>
<li>The broker buys the shares in the market from another broker. The ETP sees no additional AUM.</li>
<li>If there is demand for the shares not satisfied by the existing order book (buyers and sellers) and still not satisfied when considering the cost of borrowing the ETP shares from long-term holders such as index or pension funds, an AP may approach the ETP to create a new “basket” (generally, around $1 million worth) of new ETP shares. In this case, the ETP finally gets to see (and charge fees on) the investor’s capital.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this said, there are reasons for hedgers not to choose the new Bitcoin ETF. “Orderly trading in ETP shares is dependent on cheap, accurate hedging,” the expert said. It is driven by the availability of good substitutes for the asset the ETP seeks to track.</p>
<p>However, given the costs of hedging in the futures market and the regulatory difficulties when it comes to broker-dealers owning spot BTC themselves, Hoover said he wouldn’t find it surprising if some hedgers choose the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-ceo-calls-for-simultaneous-approval-of-spot-products-to-level-the-field.htm"><strong>Grayscale</strong></a> product, shares of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-overcomes-bankruptcy-eyes-stock-market-return.htm">mining</a> companies, or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vanguard-holds-significant-stake-in-microstrategy-indirect-bitcoin-exposure.htm"><strong>MicroStrategy</strong></a> as better accessible BTC substitutes than the spot BTC.</p>
<h2>BTC Settles Every 15 Minutes, Bitcoin ETF Shares Only on Business Days</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hoover also commented on the initial selling pressure in spot BTC, saying “there are some reasonable explanations” there.</p>
<p>There was some “sell the news” pressure, but also what he described as the release of pent-up demand to close out the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscales-bitcoin-trust-gbtc-outpaces-majority-of-etfs-with-half-a-billion-in-trading-volume.htm">GBTC</a> arbitrage trade carried by certain participants for years.</p>
<p>The CEO mentioned that the broader pressure on the markets was likely related to the early stages of setting up efficient hedging operations to keep market-making profitable and the trading costs reasonable.</p>
<p>He again noted the differences between trading these product shares and trading digital assets 24/7.</p>
<p>First, he said, there is the above-discussed “long path” between market demand for ETP shares and flows measured by new ETP shares being issued.</p>
<p>Then, Hoover said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The SEC approved the first trades on Thursday before a three-day weekend in the US markets, which contributed to the delay.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A trade creating new ETP shares (“flow”) on Thursday would not need to be paid for with cash until next Tuesday. Therefore, there is no efficient hedging of any price action until Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Bitcoin settles with each block or approximately every 10-15 minutes. However, the Bitcoin ETF shares settle on T+2 New York business days. It does not include weekends and holidays.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This timing difference, compounded by the fact that the ETP needs to price at the 4:00 pm New York close of the equity markets, creates a potential for manipulative activity in the Bitcoin market similar to that seen in the foreign-exchange markets in the early 2010s, for which a cartel of 15 banks paid more than $2.3billion to settle ligitation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The APs who bought the new Trust shares on Thursday and Friday, said Hoover, had a responsibility to manage their exposure to the price of BTC while the equity markets and the banks do not work.</p>
<p>Hence, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-buys-over-13-days-of-bitcoin-production-a-sign-of-supply-shortage.htm"><strong>BlackRock</strong></a>, for example, was obligated to help its customers (the APs) meet that responsibility.</p>
<p>Per Hoover, agreeing to issue new shares of the iShares IBIT trust on Friday, lock in an amount of BTC due in exchange for those shares based on the Friday 4:00p price in New York, and then wait to buy in the BTC until the following Wednesday when the shares were issued and settled – would have been “very irresponsible.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>ETP Is an Institutional Product, It Can’t Be a Retail One</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Lastly, Hoover explained that the market for ETP shares is ultimately an institutional market. All ETPs are institutional products by definition.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-fidelitys-spot-ethereum-etf.htm">SEC</a>) requires companies to issue new shares of these products in expensive blocks. iShares IBIT, for example, is targeting a block size of $1 million, said Hoover.</p>
<p>BlackRock and the other Bitcoin ETF sponsors have consistently marketed their products to the “advisor” and “buy-side” markets.</p>
<p>This includes managers of model portfolios (e.g., <strong>Edelman Financial Engines</strong>), “robo-advisors” (such as <strong>Schwab’s Intelligent Portfolios</strong> product), and professional asset managers (hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, and the like).</p>
<blockquote><p>“If an individual investor can’t place an order for ETP shares directly with the fund or trust via a transfer agent, and be guaranteed that their shares will be purchased at net asset value of the fund or trust on that day, the product is not a retail product.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are regulatory restrictions, but also the margins on ETP fees “simply aren’t large enough to support the massive cost of mass-marketing to retail investors.”</p>
<p>The business relies on economies of scale, Hoover said. A few flagship products provide enough fees to support marketing the sponsor’s brand across all of the products on the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka has always been a country where cash is king and this remains the case despite the country planning to introduce its digital currency by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Once dubbed &ldquo;the pearl of the Indian Ocean&rdquo; &#8212; Sri Lanka is known for producing the finest tea, fresh coconuts, and spices. Not forgetting the exotic wildlife including the leopard, elephant, sloth bear, blue whale, and sperm whale.
</p>
<h4><strong>What You Need To Know About Bitcoin In Sri Lanka</strong></h4>
<p>
Sri Lanka <a href="https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/news/risks-of-using-and-investing-in-cryptocurrency-20230329#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20Directions%20No,payments%20related%20to%20cryptocurrency%20transactions.">remains anti-crypto</a>. Its stance on cryptocurrencies is that digital currency is not considered legal tender in the country. According to directions No. 03 of 2021 under Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017, Electronic Fund Transfer Cards (EFTCs) such as debit cards and credit cards are not to be used for payments related to cryptocurrency transactions.
</p>
<h4><strong>Would Bitcoin Solve Sri Lanka&#8217;s Economic Crisis </strong></h4>
<p>
Sri Lankan economic crisis first started in 2019 and in 2022, Sri Lanka&#8217;s economy struggled after fuel supplies ran dry. In terms of GDP, Sri Lanka is expected to reach $76.86 billion by the end of 2024, according to data from <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/sri-lanka/gdp#:~:text=GDP%20in%20Sri%20Lanka%20is,according%20to%20our%20econometric%20models.">Trading Economics,</a> and in the long-term, Sri Lanka&#8217;s GDP is projected to trend around $79.54 billion in 2025 and $82.33 billion in 2026, reports Trading Economics.&nbsp;In October 2023,<a href="https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/about/organisational-structure/principal-officers/nandalal-weerasinghe"> Nandalal Weerasinghe,</a> the Governor of the Central Bank in Sri Lanka, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-can-btc-eth-bounce-back-from-double-bottom-support-levels.htm">said he believes that</a> the adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies will worsen the nation&rsquo;s economic condition.</p>
<p>Last year, American millionaire Tim Draper travelled to Sri Lanka and proposed using Bitcoin as a legal tender to combat the corruption that caused the island nation&rsquo;s hyperinflation. &nbsp;But Sri Lanka wasn&#8217;t having any of this. During a TV shoot in Sri Lanka, Draper met with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Weerasinghe to suggest Bitcoin as a practical solution for solving financial issues. But Weerasinghe, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka &ndash; a major authority figure <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-can-btc-eth-bounce-back-from-double-bottom-support-levels.htm">made it clear that doing so</a> would aggravate the economic condition of the nation.
</p>
<h4><strong>Central Bank Warns of Crypto Scams&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>
The Central Bank has warned the public of the growing number of financial scams operating with the promise of high returns based on crypto-investments.&nbsp;&ldquo;These scams include deceiving individuals and obtaining money from them with the promise of providing a high return by investing money in cryptocurrency, as well as deceiving individuals to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency projects. Such scams circumvent traditional regulatory and legal protection mechanisms, resulting in individuals losing their hard-earned money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Central Bank made it clear that it has not issued any licence or authorized any individual or business to operate schemes involving cryptocurrency, or mining operations, cryptocurrency exchanges, deposit-taking or custody services related to cryptocurrency or any cryptocurrency investment advisory service.
</p>
<h4>Central Bank Plans to Launch Digital Currency</h4>
<p>
Sri Lanka&rsquo;s Central Bank announced plans to introduce a digital currency by the end of 2024 its official told a top committee in Parliament, as reported by the Colombo-based local media news site <a href="https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Central-Bank-to-introduce-digital-currency-by-the-end-of-this-year/108-274975">Daily Mirror LK.</a>&ldquo;The exercise of introducing &lsquo;Lanka Pay&rsquo; and &lsquo;Central Bank Digital Currencies&rsquo; has already begun. The two systems will be launched by the end of this year,&rdquo; Central Bank officials informed the Ways and Means Committee in Parliament, reports <a href="https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Central-Bank-to-introduce-digital-currency-by-the-end-of-this-year/108-274975">Daily Mirror LK</a>.</p>
<p>Central Bank officials were called before the committee to discuss issues pertaining to online payments in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Chairman of <a href="https://www.parliament.lk/en/component/committees/commitee/showCommittee?id=580">Ways and Means Committee</a> Patali Champika Ranawaka inquired about the regulation of online payment systems in Sri Lanka,&rdquo; Parliamentary Media Unit (PMU) said. In September 2023,&nbsp; Nandalal Weerasinghe, the Governor of the Central Bank <a href="//www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/about/Speech_20231103_keynote_speech_at_the_forum_in_KDU_e.pdf">acknowledged in a keynote</a> speech that interest in digital currencies has been gaining traction and within the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are also engaged in studies on the potential of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) which is the digital form of legal tender issued by the Central Bank. There is consensus across global central banks that CBDC will help enhance the efficiency and resilience of the payment system while also serving to increase financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Importantly, other potential benefits of CBDC include more effective monetary transmission and improved financial transparency,&rdquo; <a href="//www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/about/Speech_20231103_keynote_speech_at_the_forum_in_KDU_e.pdf">said</a> Weerasinghe. For now, Sri Lanka is showing signs of revival through growing tourism but cryptocurrency remains an unregulated investment instrument and is not recognized as an asset class.&nbsp;<br style="font-weight: 400"><br style="font-weight: 400"></p>

A true chiseled veteran, and has supported many great entrepreneurs and companies through good and bad times. Super pumped to have you on, Matthew. Welcome to the show, my friend. How are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Great to be here. This will be a lot of fun. Thanks for that. Great intro. We got the same name. We&#8217;re dressed the same. I think we&#8217;re ready to go.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>We planned it. Yeah. If you guys are watching this and not listening, you guys are in for a treat. This is going to be a good one. Let&#8217;s jump right into it. Talk of the talk, the creme de la creme right now everyone&#8217;s talking about the Bitcoin ETF. This is going to air on Thursday, January 18, folks, we are recording one day earlier. So this episode is going to be hot and fresh. Bitcoin ETF, it popped off. Everyone thought it was going to rip. I was glued to CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap. I was glued to Twitter for those first couple of days checking all the inflows. I know we did break all the records for most inflows and highest volume for any ETF over the first couple days. We love to see that, but we don&#8217;t love to see the price action. What happened there? Was this part of this whole GPTC where everyone was selling off in order to move into the ETF. Matthew, give us the laydown. Give us the lowdown. What happened with the first week of trading with the Bitcoin ETF?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure, it did end up being a sell the news situation for sure. We actually view these ETF inflows and outflows as quite important. So we&#8217;re actually currently internally doing a real deep dive on this issue. But currently my view is that selling from GPTC was probably a significant factor. Beyond that, it may be a little hard to say, but I think the short term price action is mostly a sideshow from what I think is really substantially more important. And here&#8217;s what I think is more important. The Bitcoin ETF has been an enormous success. In fact, the aggregate trading volume of the new Bitcoin ETFs are substantially higher than the trading volume of all, approximately 500 ETFs that were launched in 2023, all of them put together. So let me just repeat that, because it&#8217;s so important, you combine everything launched in 2023, all the United States ETFs, combine them all, the trading volume of all those combined, you compare it to the new Bitcoin ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs are higher in trading volume than everything done in 2023. I repeated it because I think that&#8217;s really quite extraordinary. This is a blockbuster success for the Bitcoin ETF in terms of people demonstrating that they absolutely want this product. So what that means is very quickly, Wall Street is going to become addicted to this asset class. This is only the first domino to fall. I think that&#8217;s bullish for the prospect of an Ethereum ETF in terms of these powerful Wall Street interests that will be even more determined to make this happen. I think it&#8217;s extremely positive for Wall Street in general, getting more involved in this industry. I think that is the most important takeaway for me from the Bitcoin ETF rather than short term price action, maybe influenced by GPTC outflows. Honestly, who cares? I think that small potatoes compared to this much more important thing, which is that huge success for Wall Street, they&#8217;re going to want to do this more and more in all different ways, participate in our industry.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, well said there. Speaking of the ETF, I had a buddy, it was actually yesterday, and he was at Atlanta airport, and obviously that&#8217;s one of the biggest and most popular airports in the world. He had to go to two different terminals because his flight got canceled. Long story short, in both terminals, he saw an advertisement for two different ETFs. I believe it was the Valkyrie one was one of them, and the other one, it may have even been. I think it might have been the BlackRock. But these guys, it&#8217;s a weekend and they already have ads in airport terminals like, this is bananas. What can we see from an actual pushing the ETF perspective? Like, are these guys going to go balls to the walls with advertisements and calling all the brokers and trying to get this in everyone hands as quick as possible.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Matt, this is such a great point, so I&#8217;m really glad you brought this up. We&#8217;ve actually been having a lot of conversations with people around just this issue in recent weeks. So an ETF is fundamentally a commodity product, by which I mean that there is not a huge differentiator from any one Bitcoin ETF compared to any one of the others. Mechanics may differ around the margins, at least for this class of Bitcoin ETFs. There are some nuances around if it&#8217;s cash to cash, or actually, there&#8217;s some nuances on the mechanics, but you can think of at least this class of Bitcoin ETFs as substantially all the same. So what that means is that from the provider perspective, there is a substantial risk of a war on fees, and that these fees will ultimately be driven to zero, which means not literally zero, but 0.2%. Let&#8217;s say 0.1% even effectively. Here&#8217;s what that means. The Bitcoin ETF providers are trying to establish beachheads through marketing, thinking that at least some of the inflows will be sticky and they can decrease the probability of competing only on price. So, as Matt, as you identified already through the example of your friend, who, God help him, is in Atlanta, I think pulling out for that guy. But at any rate, through the example of your friend, we are already seeing that there is absolutely going to be balls to the walls marketing on these ETFs. And that is enormously powerful for our industry. It&#8217;s enormously powerful in showing people that our industry, I mean, we all know this, but people outside our industry still may have question marks that our industry is here to stay, that it&#8217;s going to be a powerful asset class. I know that&#8217;s hard to imagine because we&#8217;re at one point x trillion dollars as an asset class, 1.6, or whatever it is today. Hard to imagine. But for people outside our industry, they may still have question marks, and this is going to be very powerful for demonstrating our legitimacy. The fact that this is an institutional ready asset class, and it&#8217;s going to start causing people to really think about, not if they take this industry seriously or if they should buy some Bitcoin, but rather asking questions like what percentage of my portfolio should be crypto questions like that. So I really think it&#8217;s enormously important, the marketing spent.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>So as a consumer, and I know we are buzzing on the Bitcoin ETF, it&#8217;s just such a powerful and present day topic. We&#8217;ll move on. But last question here. As a consumer or as a market manager, how do you choose what ETF to put your clients in? Is it strictly just like you said, the battle of advertising and marketing? Is it the one who has the lowest fee for the first little bit? Is it the one who&#8217;s doing the social good and giving 10% back to the Bitcoin miners? How do you choose which one to get into if it&#8217;s really all the same product at the end of the day?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So I&#8217;m not really in the business of advising on Bitcoin ETFs, but if a buddy said to me, hey, quick question which ETF should I do? I would say just sort them by fees. Go with the one with the lowest fee is probably your best bet. I would probably double check to make absolutely sure that that would be my final recommendation. But yeah, ultimately, these are commodity products, and the providers of these products do not want people to think like that. They want instead people to think emotionally, which is why they&#8217;re running expensive ad campaigns.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, well said there. Let&#8217;s jump into some, we can also get into some of you and your team&#8217;s investments. And you guys have done an incredible job, by the way, and I can&#8217;t wait to get into that. But let&#8217;s talk about some of the 2024 trends as we&#8217;re still hot and fresh, nice and early in the year. We&#8217;ve seen Solana absolutely rip its pants off and go for just an absolute ripper. Magoo it&#8217;s made a lot of people a lot of money, especially all those folks who sort of bought at the top last year. And if they did hold all the way down to the nine dollar mark and wrote it back up, good for them. We&#8217;re seeing Deepn, which is a massive trend right now, account abstraction in Ethereum. We&#8217;re seeing a lot of decentralized finance trends. A whole lot of everything. What are you most excited for? Liquid staking, I also have to mention, are there any trends in particular, Matthew, that are really tickling you and your team&#8217;s fancy right now that you guys have all eyes on?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So we&#8217;re looking at a number of different narratives, as we always do. Maybe I&#8217;ll just pick one that I spent most of my time on today. Today we&#8217;ve been looking carefully at the probability of an Ethereum ETF analyzing that very carefully. Will it be considered a commodity or a security? Maybe because of the futures product precedent that is passed. Maybe because of that, there&#8217;s precedent that it could be treated as a commodity. So we&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time looking at Ethereum ETF, if it&#8217;s going to happen or not. The first time that it could get approved is in May. Of course, it would not launch in May, but that could be substantially bullish for Ethereum. And additionally, the new Cancun upgrade and some of the new EIPs we think could be quite conducive as well to reducing congestion effectively and lowering the cost of transactions on Ethereum. On a related note, we&#8217;re also carefully looking at RWAs, and we do think that there&#8217;s a substantial probability that Ethereum will be a natural home for RWAs. So we&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time on Ethereum in recent days, and in fact, with myself specifically, I spent a lot of my time on Ethereum today.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>ETH hasn&#8217;t gone up in price as much as everyone would have liked to over the last little bit. Is there a specific reason for this? I know you guys are obviously super tied into everything in this regard. And just as a quick little follow up to this question, how could the ETH ETF, are we going to see similar buy the narrative, sell the news kind of thing by the ETF, sell the news? What&#8217;s going to go on with the ETH ETF if it does happen in May, like a lot of people think it will?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>I think that there is also a grayscale ETH product, so there could be selling pressure as a result of that. I&#8217;d have to look at the details, but that&#8217;s certainly a possibility, and I think that could be by the narrative and ultimately sell the official event. That&#8217;s a possibility, but I think there&#8217;s always high error bars around it. Your first question, or the first part of your question, was around Ethereum and perhaps why it&#8217;s underperformed a little bit in recent months. Yeah, so I gave some reasons why Ethereum possibly might have a more bullish 2024. There&#8217;s also another factor to that, which I think explains why it&#8217;s been underperforming recently. So, as I was explaining it the other day, if you have, for example, Bitcoin, which has a substantially smaller feature set, it&#8217;s robust, it&#8217;s well understood, it has a compelling narrative around it, it can do a few things very well, such as capture people that are interested in digital gold. On the other end of the spectrum, you have something like Solana, which has an enormously rich feature set that can do many, many things quite well, if you&#8217;re on those two opposite ends of the spectrum, I think those are two really interesting places to be. If you split the middle of those two things, I think that&#8217;s tough.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Good point.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>You&#8217;re going to have a lot of people who are saying, well, Bitcoin is probably better for that than Ethereum, and a lot of people who are going to say, well, Solana is really more suitable than Ethereum for this. So I think that creates a lot of difficulties. But with that said, for example, RWAs may have a natural home on Ethereum. We&#8217;ll have to see. But to the extent that narrative does take off, to the extent these Cancun and these new EIPs prove to be catalysts, there could be a more compelling 2024. But I think that there&#8217;s still this fundamental challenge of competitive positioning.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, there&#8217;s so many different narratives about ETH right now, and your team sent over an incredible little cheat sheet to help prep for this Podcast. And one thing that I was completely unaware of, Matthew, is that Celsius has approximately 300 million cited in ETH as a primary factor planning to unstake its ETH holdings. I believe it actually started a couple of weeks ago on January 4, and distribute these to creditors in Ethereum or convert them to USDC. There is also a give or take, ten day elongated ETH withdrawal queue. I still can&#8217;t believe that Celsius has this much of a pull on the market, you know what I mean? Because it happened, what, two years ago with FTX and Celsius. You don&#8217;t even want it to be front of mind because it had such a negative impact. But these things, they&#8217;re still fucking our day up. It&#8217;s like years later what&#8217;s going on with the whole Celsius and FTX?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sorry, go ahead. It&#8217;s like all those words you muted on Twitter, right? You can&#8217;t take it anymore. I&#8217;m going to just mute Celsius.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>But yeah, unfortunately, there&#8217;s still to some extent an overhang for our industry. But you know, for specific products and in specific ways, we do still have aftershocks, even today from some of the tumult that we had earlier. I truly, really look forward to never hearing some of these names again, but unfortunately, they do impact us still.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s truly wild. I&#8217;d love to jump to some VC views here, just sort of strictly from a VC perspective. Obviously, you are currently in Asia. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about some of the difference in regards to the regulatory environment in Asia versus western markets. And if you could tie that into sort of the light of the BTC ETF approval, that would be great as well.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>So I think the first thing that it strikes me as really quite important is I don&#8217;t think you can discuss it in terms of an Asia regulatory framework, for example. It&#8217;s very tempting to do that. I fully get that. But it really varies considerably from country to country. And in fact, it even varies considerably from mainland China to Hong Kong. So I really think you kind of have to go jurisdiction by jurisdiction. Mainland China, for example, is not necessarily super friendly to crypto. There are a lot of misconceptions. People think that Bitcoin is banned in mainland China, which is not true, but still, it&#8217;s not super friendly at all. Whereas Hong Kong is really quite permissive by comparison. So if it really makes sense to even differentiate between mainland China and Hong Kong, it definitely makes sense to differentiate between Vietnam and Singapore and Thailand and India and all these places throughout Asia. So that&#8217;s the first thing that I would really emphasize. I think there are a lot of dangers to treating it as a monolithic block.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Very interesting. It&#8217;s, again, for someone like me, mean the only part of Asia I&#8217;ve been to is India. I&#8217;ve unfortunately never been to China or Hong Kong or Eastern Asia. It&#8217;s on the to do list. I will get there. And we&#8217;ve had so many really incredible VCs, similar to yourself on the show, who do reside in Asia and work a lot of magic in Asia, and we don&#8217;t get to see or use any of these incredible products that are in Asia as well. That I feel like does have a lot of emphasis on how you would choose to invest. Even like the WeChat, right? These super products that us over here in, you know, we have our iPhone, we have WhatsApp. I mean, heck, unless if you&#8217;re in Canada and USA, you don&#8217;t even use WhatsApp, you use iMessage. And then you have these mega company conglomerates in Asia and China, like the WeChats where you have your bank, you have your messaging, you have your commerce, you have absolutely everything. It&#8217;s pretty freaking cool to see. Are there any crypto specific companies, Matthew, at the moment, that are really making moves in Asia because it&#8217;s such a massive friggin market? Are there any on your radar that are really getting you guys going?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Let me answer in this way. So one of the most important things actually, for my business is the fact that the information asymmetry between east and west, west and east in our industry is absolutely enormous. It&#8217;s staggering.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>For a recent example is with ordinals. Ordinals took off far faster and is still far more popular in Asia, especially in China, frankly, versus the west. So as a result of having access to boots on the ground and information both west and east, we were able to be one of the first investors anywhere in the west to actually invest in ordinals and related technologies. It is absolutely fascinating. Far more than TradFi by a factor of ten, if not 100. How little the relationship circles overlap, how little information is transmitted both ways, east and west, west and east. It absolutely blows my mind whenever I think about it. There&#8217;s just absolutely enormous differences in consumer preferences, in narratives and popular coins and things like that. For example, if I were to name the most popular meme coin in recent weeks, or one of them in China, I think with high confidence. You haven&#8217;t heard of it. RATS like the animal. One of the most popular meme coins in Asia recently. Of course you haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Big no.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Right? And so there&#8217;s just this enormous gap. No, obviously. Please. That&#8217;s a shit coin.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah. Not financial advice.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Absolutely not even like, it&#8217;s a shitty meme coin. Okay. But there&#8217;s shitcoins and meme coins and maybe there&#8217;s some overlap. This is a shitty meme coin. All right? It&#8217;s garbage. I just want to be clear. But at any rate, it has been enormously popular and there&#8217;s no visibility at all of that internationally. So again, similarly, ordinals massively earlier in Asia, massively more popular to this day. There are many narratives like that. Solana is much more popular in the west. Polygon is much more popular in India. There are a lot of geographic and community differences in our industry to an extent that really is quite staggering to me to this day.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s so cool and very well explained there.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>I&#8217;ve seen so many crazy you know because it&#8217;s just like in Asia, it&#8217;s one thing, same as in the west. There are funny videos and all kinds of weird jokes. I&#8217;ve seen so many RATS videos, I never want to see another one. Please do not send me RATS videos.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yes. Folks, not investment advice. He has just given us a good story to fortify the point of east versus west narratives. But huge shout out to our sponsor of Tthe show PrimeXBT.

And I&#8217;m back to the show with Matthew. Let&#8217;s jump into a couple more VC questions and VC points here. I think being a VC is an incredible job. I know it&#8217;s sort of been glorified over the last ten years, especially with someone like me who spends far too much time on Twitter. I follow a shit ton of VCs. Seems like a really cool job. Obviously, you got to work your ass off, you got to work your tail off, and it&#8217;s all about getting that little itty bit of alpha to hit a home run. It&#8217;s a volume based game. Anytime I have a VC on the show, I always need to ask, how do you and your team go about your investment strategy? Are there any queries or nuances that you really dig down on that you really look into, right? Besides the obvious, like, what is the overall market? Like, what&#8217;s the tam, what&#8217;s the moat? How good is the team? Is this the first time founder. Are there any sort of weird ones, weird pointers, nuances that you could discuss about how you and the team go about your investment strategy?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>I think ultimately, as a VC, especially in earlier stages, ultimately you are betting on people. And I think that especially in crypto, you want to have someone that you are confident will plug away. A lot of people work on projects for three months and then they say, oh, I didn&#8217;t immediately get traction. Now I&#8217;m going to work on something else, or they&#8217;ll have a huge success with their first product, and then they&#8217;ll say, well, instead of continuing to develop that, we will develop adjacent products, but we&#8217;ll do that under new tokens, which is not great for your investors. So I think one of the most important things, especially in earlier stages, is to probe and evaluate the extent to which you think that someone is likely to keep grinding away for long periods of time, basically.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>And that&#8217;s number one, of course. Give me some weird ones here, Matthew. Any super weird ones where a team came in with a new narrative, or is there something about a pitch deck, perhaps, or the way someone dresses or anything, any sort of weird hunches and follow up to that is the importance of trusting your gut. Was there ever one where your gut was just like, Matthew, you need to do this. I have to do this.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>I look for a lot of trust related signals. It&#8217;s probably one that is a good answer to your question. So I carefully observe how people treat their wife or girlfriend, their kids, if they have pets, I&#8217;m more likely to trust them. To be honest, I look for a lot of trust related signals. I&#8217;m less likely to trust someone if they don&#8217;t like animals and kids.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>100%, I love that. What about some of your biggest winners and losers that you can talk about? Did you and the team pass up any behemoths that still sort of eat you away? And I hate to ask the negative s question, but the people are going to love it. Any big winners and big losers that you can discuss on the show here Matthew?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So, of course, it&#8217;s well known that we were very early investors in Solana. Although we accumulated most of our position in the secondary market, we were extremely early out of our institutional fund. We&#8217;re thrilled about our performance with layer zero, where we came in at seed. Those are two examples that we are well known for in terms of the ones that got away. Okay, I&#8217;ll give you an example. At this point in time, I was not yet investing my own money. I was not doing angel checks at this time, and I should have made an exception because I remember getting a deck in 2015, I guess it was. And I said to my team that this is the best deck I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life. This is the most compelling thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. And I should have said to myself, well, you&#8217;re not doing angel checks. Maybe you should do your first angel checks. But I didn&#8217;t think that way. I just thought, this is absolutely fucking amazing. And I just didn&#8217;t think, any guesses as to what that was?</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>ETH?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>No, but I mean, the timing is right.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It wasn&#8217;t. ETH. What was it?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>BitMEX best deck I&#8217;ve ever.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>What made the deck so good?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>It was absolutely crystal clear that this was the right team. An opportunity that super fucking made sense. It was just enormously compelling in terms of them demonstrating clarity of vision that they had the people to accomplish the vision demonstrating that they already had, even in the earliest iterations, something that people wanted. It was like, jaw dropping g ood. I mean, it was really astonishingly compelling.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I&#8217;m just taking notes here on the secret sauce of making a pitch deck here. So BitMEX came across. And obviously they are bloody huge. What can you and the team learn from something like this?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Well, I think what I should have learned is that you should be willing to bend your own rules if something&#8217;s that fucking good.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>If something that appealing comes across the table should be broken.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>If you&#8217;re not doing angel checks and it&#8217;s the best fucking thing you&#8217;ve ever seen, maybe you should do an angel check.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Maybe write a check. I was just going to ask you about your gut, just because this is a subject that I&#8217;m extremely passionate about and I journal myself and I look back at times when I made good or bad decisions and either did or didn&#8217;t trust my gut. What was your gut saying at the time? Are you just reiterating the points that you&#8217;ve said over the last two minutes where just everything screamed, this is going to be a home run? This is absolutely freaking incredible.</p>
<p><b>Matthew</b> <b>Graham</b><br />
Yeah, I just thought it was absolutely going to be a home run. Just like, this guy is going to fucking kill it. Which actually, I was off by a year or two because he struggled. Arthur struggled for the first year or two. In fact, he struggled to get funding. Even when he got some funding, he struggled to get substantial traction to the point where they entered an accelerator in mainland China, in Shanghai, I think it was. It&#8217;s called China accelerator. It&#8217;s owned by SOSV. So they had gotten funding. They were not getting traction. They gave away equity to an accelerator, is how badly they were struggling. So actually, it took them a good year or two of grinding. So I was wrong in the sense that I thought it was going to be an immediate fucking home run. I was wrong about that, but actually, the breakthrough moment for them is when they implemented 100X leverage was actually when they just went hockey stick.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, to the moon. Very cool. Matthew, you&#8217;ve been absolutely on fire here. We are getting a little tight for time. A couple more questions. I want to go back to 2024 investment narrative. Investment trends. I named off a couple. Is there any in particular that you and the team are super keen on right now? 2024 investment trends and investment narratives.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure, there&#8217;s a lot we&#8217;re keen on, but to give another example, we are having the most innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem that we&#8217;ve had in quite some time. So that&#8217;s really very fascinating to us, and we&#8217;re spending a lot of time looking at that. Already made some investments around that space. They aren&#8217;t public yet, but we&#8217;re very excited about them.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Anything else like Deepn or liquid staking? Are these narratives too far out for you guys to dabble, or are these actually the true thing?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>We are actively looking at both those sectors. I can&#8217;t expand on that at that time, but we are actively looking at both those sectors. You could probably assume my meaning is more than that. And then with Deepn specifically, though, I do still hold the view that with the possible exception of Helium, I think in the bullcase for Deepn. In the bullcase three years from now, if you look at a top ten Deepn list, I think it will be very different than it is today, with the possible exception of Helium. But I do think that&#8217;s a very compelling sector, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Interesting. Last question. Give me a hot take. Something super friggin spicy. Seshuan spicy. I&#8217;m talking blow your socks off spicy. Matthew, give me one hot take before we let you go today.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Gary Gensler will be gone at this time next year. He&#8217;s out of here this time next year.</p>
<p><b>Matt</b> <b>Zahab</b><br />
Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>There have been a lot of rumors swirling that he might have 1ft out the door anyway for some time. Even rumors of he was thinking of making a congressional run. A lot of different stuff, but it&#8217;s not a high confidence hot take. You want a hot take? It was the first one that came to mind.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Maybe it&#8217;s just a wish, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Me too. I would love that. I would absolutely love that. Matthew, you were an absolute treat today. Learned a ton and had a lot of fun. Can&#8217;t wait for round two. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you personally and Ryze Labs online and on socials?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So I&#8217;m on Twitter. I&#8217;m notoriously addicted to Twitter, and I can be found @mattyryze on Twitter, and Ryze Labs, ryzelabs.io . And we are on Twitter as well.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Love it. And last question. I didn&#8217;t even ask. What about the name Ryze? Where did that come from?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So we rebranded because our initial name reflected our China specialty, but we&#8217;ve long since had grown to having an emerging market specialty. So we wanted a name that could fit with our growth trajectory and that had some good connotations around it. We have boots on the ground everywhere from Latin America to India, China, Singapore, and a lot of different places in between. So we wanted a name that could kind of keep up with us.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it. It&#8217;s clean and it&#8217;s got a z in it. Big fan. Matthew thank you so much. Absolute pleasure having you on and can&#8217;t wait for round two.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>All right, thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talking with <em>Cryptonews</em>, three experts have shared their views on spot Bitcoin ETFs trading volumes.</p>
<p>They discussed the initial price drop post-approval, how the US Fed and presidential election could affect the market, BlackRock’s marketing approach, the benefits and downsides of the new product, and more.</p>
<p>For this article, we talked to Vijay Marolia, the Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of <strong>Regal Point Capital</strong> and a money manager with over 20 years of capital markets experience, Shane Rodgers, the Chairman and Co-founder of the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/interview-with-shane-rodgers-navigating-future-of-crypto-markets-amidst-regulatory-hurdles-altcoin-saturation.htm">PDX</a></strong> platform, and Dan Hoover, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer at investment firm <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/etfs-are-inevitable-but-not-imminent-crypto-expert-argues.htm">Castle Funds</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Read on to learn what they told us.</p>
<h2>Initial Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume Suggests That BTC Will Only Get Bigger</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Talking about the approved <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-all-the-essentials-facts-winners-losers-tickers-and-fees.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> trading volumes, Vijay Marolia opined that “Bitcoin isn’t going away anytime soon.”</p>
<p>Shane Rodgers argued that volumes indicate the size and scope of the new ETF market. They suggest that BTC adoption and investment will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ll see that reflected in direct BTC prices and trading volumes,” said Rodgers.</p>
<p>He added that the market is correct to anticipate massive inflows.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This will drive BTC prices and crypto valuations overall well into the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The market saw an initial price decrease following the new Bitcoin ETF approval.</p>
<p>Per Marolia,</p>
<blockquote><p>“This as the first act of a strategic shift in institutional investors exposure—this is not necessarily a vote on a bull or bear market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rodgers argued that the drop doesn&#8217;t tell us much at all &#8211; only that BTC is behaving like a normal financial asset more and more. These moves are quite normal in traditional financial assets, he said.</p>
<p>He added that “it should also always be remembered that retail investors are &#8216;sheep&#8217;. Most recent Bitcoin selling has been profit taking, overtaken by unfounded worry from the retail crowd.”</p>
<p>Most Bitcoin trading happened on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tusd-says-recent-depegging-is-related-to-binance-launchpool-activities.htm"><strong>Binance</strong></a> and some of the bigger Asian exchanges. But the selling was “unsophisticated,” Rodgers opined, “and in our view created a nice buying opportunity.”</p>
<p>Rodgers also commented on some recently expressed BTC supply shortage concerns. When asked if these are valid, he replied “Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a digital asset divisible by 18 decimal points, making the maximum supply of 21 million BTC irrelevant, he said. Therefore, there will never be a shortage of BTC.</p>
<h2>Donald Trump’s US Presidential Win Would Delay Strong Bull Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As time goes by, things are bound to change. The question is in which direction.</p>
<p>Rodgers commented that the near-term and long-term impact of the new Bitcoin ETFs on the market is positive. And not just for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/spot-bitcoin-etfs-would-reduce-power-of-whales-and-increase-stability-nansen-analyst.htm">BTC</a>, he added, but the entire crypto space.</p>
<p>Per Marolia, we are likely to see “slightly less volatility” in the coming months while average volumes start to increase. This follows the mentioned initial decrease. The expert argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is a healthy way of building a “base” of strong (read: long-term) investors.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Marolia brought up a couple of key factors that will significantly impact the market in the coming years: the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/benjamin-cowen-bearish-on-fed-rate-cuts-how-will-bitcoin-price-react-to-the-feds-policy-shift.htm"><strong>US Federal Reserve</strong></a> and the 2024 presidential elections.</p>
<p>One should keep in mind that Bitcoin was created due to a lack of trust in global fiat monetary systems, he noted.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the Fed lowers rates or ANY democratic wins the election (including undercover democrat, Nikki Haley, this is BULLISH for Bitcoin and will cause more inflation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, should <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trumps-promise-i-will-never-allow-the-creation-of-a-cbdc.htm">Donald Trump</a> win the election (again), Marolia opined that it would slow down or delay another strong bull market in Bitcoin. He said that it would likely cause dollar strength and that, just like gold, we price Bitcoin in dollars.</p>
<h2>BlackRock’s Marketing Approach is a Step to Mass Adoption</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/global-directory"><strong>BlackRock</strong></a> has been making headlines left and right, specifically in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-new-bitcoin-etf-debuts-strong-holding-over-120-million-in-btc.htm">ETF context</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that BlackRock is targeting an audience besides crypto enthusiasts. Asked if this is the correct approach, Rodgers said it is – especially at this point in the maturity cycle for the asset class.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This helps us get past reliance on the unsophisticated average retail investor, to more prudent investors with greater capital and better judgement. It’s a step along the way to increasing mass adoption.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the company recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-buys-over-13-days-of-bitcoin-production-a-sign-of-supply-shortage.htm">purchased 11,439 BTC</a>. Per Rodgers, however, this purchase, in and of itself, has “zero meaningful impact.”</p>
<p>Dan Hoover, the CCO/COO at <strong>Castle Funds</strong>, said he doesn’t believe that BlackRock is buying this much BTC for themselves. The number was implied by the increase in assets under management (AUM) reported for the <strong>iShares Bitcoin Trust</strong> (IBIT) after the first two days of trading, he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If this is the case, I think that this is a positive sign that the ETP’s can in fact scale their creation (and, theoretically, their redemption) processes in an orderly fashion.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If the BTC were purchased over the holiday weekend, it shows that risk-management processes are in place, such as hedging. This helps mitigate risk to the market-makers and Authorized Participants (APs). This is healthy for both the ETP holders and the market in general, he argued.</p>
<p>But downsides remain, Hoover noted. The Bitcoin market relies on transparency in holdings and movements, tracking flows across different wallets with each block mined.</p>
<p>However, he said, BlackRock – or any of the brokers they are using to buy the underlying BTC – are unlikely to be readily identifiable on chain for now. This will persist at least until the patterns of ownership are worked out.</p>
<p>“When added to the timing delays, the net result is confusion and volatility until the market learns how to track and adapt to these market actors,” Hoover said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency landscape is poised for a major change with the recent approval of spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at Nansen, believes the approval will specifically impact crypto whales, who control a large share of the current token supply and wield unmatched influence in spot markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that crypto token ownership is very skewed, with &#8216;whale&#8217; wallets owning a large share of the token supply,&#8221; Barthere said in a recent interview with Cryptonews.com.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Any change in that structure would probably reduce price volatility in the long term, intuitively.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She also opined that the arrival of ETFs will bring more liquidity to the spot markets, which could lead to a more stable market.</p>
<p>Last week, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023">granted approval</a> to 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant departure from more than a decade of regulatory opposition.</p>
<p>The decision comes more than a decade after the initial filing for a crypto-based ETF, a financial product designed to track the performance of various assets such as commodities and equities.</p>
<p>The newly approved ETFs will specifically track the spot market price of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Wall Street giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, alongside several native crypto firms, are among those bringing these ETFs to the market.</p>
<p>The approval of these products has the potential to attract significant capital inflows into Bitcoin, with many crypto executives expressing enthusiasm about their impact on the digital asset market.</p>
<h2>Barthere Expects a Redistribution of Bitcoin Supply Among New Buyers</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
When asked about the immediate effects of Bitcoin spot ETFs, Barthere foresees a redistribution of the token supply to new buyers but cautions that investor sentiment hinges on broader economic factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will likely lead to some redistribution of token supply to new buyers. &#8216;Investor sentiment&#8217; depends mainly on other factors, e.g., if inflation continues to decelerate and the Fed delivers on the rate cuts expected by markets,&#8221; she elaborated.</p>
<p>Regarding the short-term performance of these ETFs, Barthere expects lower-fee ETFs to attract more inflows.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;ETFs and futures are different instruments; we would expect futures to stay favoured for trading and hedging, and ETFs to be a go-to retail instrument, like in traditional finance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The competitive landscape among Bitcoin spot ETF providers, according to Barthere, will be shaped by factors like reputation, size, existing footprint, and management fees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reputation/size/existing footprint + management fee will probably lead to some leaders dominating the market,&#8221; she predicts.</p>
<p>JPMorgan analysts <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-poised-for-36-billion-influx-jpmorgan-highlights-rotational-capital-movement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">have also predicted</span></a> that the success of these newly created ETFs will hinge on fees and liquidity.</p>
<p>Given the high 1.5% fees associated with GBTC, they expect significant outflows from this Bitcoin trust.</p>
<p>Furthermore, speculative investors who purchased discounted GBTC shares in the secondary market over the past year, anticipating the elimination of the discount to Net Asset Value (NAV) upon conversion, are likely to take profits.</p>
<p>This could lead to approximately $3 billion exiting GBTC and flowing into the newly launched ETFs.</p>
<p>The analysts anticipate even larger outflows of $5-$10 billion if GBTC fails to reduce its fees to the 0.25% level set by issuers like BlackRock.</p>
<h2>ETH Spot ETFs to Take the Spotlight</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Barthere anticipates positive effects on Ethereum and altcoins, spurred by speculation on subsequent spot ETFs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will probably be speculation on the next spot ETFs, which is positive for ETH and altcoins,&#8221; she asserted</p>
<p>She added that other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, will be seeking ETF approval soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. BlackRock is rumoured to have already started the application process for a spot ETH ETF,&#8221; she revealed.</p>
<p>As reported, QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm, has forecasted that <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/qcp-capital-predicts-eth-to-outperform-btc-in-the-medium-term-amid-eth-spot-etf-approval-expectations.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin</span></a> in the medium term as the narrative surrounding potential ETH Spot ETF approvals will help the cryptocurrency outshine BTC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs, in Barthere&#8217;s view, removes regulatory and custodial obstacles, facilitating traditional finance&#8217;s investment in BTC.</p>
<p>However, she noted that blockchain technology adoption remains a separate process, highlighting ongoing pilots by major institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a landscape where technology reshapes traditional finance, we are witnessing a pivotal change led by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitget-launches-10m-fund-to-support-female-led-startups-in-web3.htm">web3</a> and decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. These innovations are setting the stage for revolutionary investment models, while new products like spot Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-present-new-trading-opportunities-amid-global-price-swings-arthur-hayes.htm">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) could redefine the industry.</p>
<p>Alex de Lorraine, CEO of Archblock, shared his insights in an interview with Cryptonews.com, offering a unique perspective on the evolving landscape of web3. Archblock, founded in 2017, initially aimed to develop software for trust companies but quickly pivoted towards leveraging blockchain technology. The company provides web3 services for institutional users, offering tools including Archblock Institution Platform.</p>
<p>De Lorraine views web3 as a significant advancement in the digital world, one that extends beyond the realms of technology into the very fabric of financial interaction and empowerment. He emphasizes web3&#8217;s potential to democratize access to financial services, making them more inclusive and accessible.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the essence of web3, de Lorraine stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I strongly believe that web3 encompasses everything. I think that web3 is the next generation of finance systems. It can do way more. I get that, but I&#8217;m focusing on finance only.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Web3 Empowers Financial Accessibility</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“And when I saw what the system can do. I got excited because it&#8217;s the first time in hundreds of years that we actually are changing something completely,” said de Lorraine. “What I mean by that is like, first I looked at it from an accounting point of view. Web3 allows you to do stuff that we&#8217;re not able to do in a normal kind of finance world.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_152314" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152314" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-152314" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705473707-archblock-logo-2.png" alt="Archblock" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705473707-archblock-logo-2.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705473707-archblock-logo-2-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705473707-archblock-logo-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705473707-archblock-logo-2-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705473707-archblock-logo-2-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-152314" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Archblock</figcaption></figure>
<p>De Lorraine elaborated on the unique capabilities of web3 that traditional finance systems lack. He highlighted the unparalleled scalability of web3, likening it to the internet in its ability to underpin a vast array of services and systems. “It&#8217;s like having one system that powers everything,” he explained. This aspect of web3, according to de Lorraine, allows for a level of integration and efficiency that traditional banking systems cannot match.</p>
<p>Furthermore, de Lorraine pointed out the transformative nature of web3 in terms of transparency and accountability. He mentioned how web3 could offer a new level of transparency in financial transactions, which is not possible with traditional finance. In an environment where every transaction is recorded and open to trace, one simply “cannot lie,” de Lorraine emphasized.</p>
<p>Highlighting the accessibility of web3, de Lorraine remarked on its potential to level the financial playing field. He underscored, “Web3 is about democratizing finance. It’s about making financial services accessible to anyone with internet access.”</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETFs&#8217; Potential Impact on Web3</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As the first spot Bitcoin ETFs got approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the finance world is also changing and potentially intersecting with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/federal-reserves-rate-cut-could-spark-institutional-interest-in-defi-and-stablecoins-fidelity-predicts.htm">DeFi</a>. &#8220;Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a game changer,&#8221; de Lorraine commented in the interview. &#8220;They offer a way for traditional investors to engage with digital assets within a familiar and regulated framework.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jp-morgan-spot-bitcoin-etfs-could-see-25-billion-inflows-from-existing-products-without-fresh-capital.htm">Bitcoin ETFs</a> could serve as a bridge between the traditional financial system and the emerging world of digital assets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He noted that while they do not directly leverage the decentralized nature of web3, their presence in mainstream markets is a testament to the growing acceptance and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies. &#8220;It&#8217;s about acknowledging the value and potential of digital assets in a format that traditional investors are comfortable with,&#8221; de Lorraine added.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For many, diving directly into buying and holding cryptocurrencies can be daunting due to the perceived risks and technical barriers. Bitcoin ETFs simplify this, making it easier for a wider audience to participate in the crypto market without needing deep technical knowledge.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>TrueUSD Stablecoin Depegged to $0.984</h2>

TrueUSD (TUSD), a stablecoin originally issued by Archblock, experienced a notable drop below its $1 peg. On Jan. 16, TUSD dropped to $0.984, a significant deviation for a stablecoin designed to maintain parity with the US dollar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian crypto market is buzzing with talks of taxation and regulations. With the central government set to announce the interim budget on 1st February, crypto exchanges and traders are hoping for relief from the 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) and 30% tax on crypto. However, the chances of their wish being granted seem less likely.</p>
<p>In a conversation with Gaurav Mehta, the founder of <a href="//catax.app/%5C%22" rel="sponsored">Catax</a>, India&rsquo;s first crypto tax software, we explore where India is heading with crypto tax laws and regulations.
</p>
<h2>India&rsquo;s First Crypto Tax Software</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Gaurav conceived the idea of running a crypto tax software back in 2014 and had already started pitching the idea to investors, 8 years before any formal crypto tax regulations in India. Though the solution of crypto taxes didn&rsquo;t start to materialize until 2022 for Catax.</p>
<p>Gaurav, who works as a forensic expert with different law enforcement agencies on cases related to blockchain, was a guest lecturer at National Academy of Direct Taxes where he trained IRS officers from 2021-2023. Catax, which primarily started to serve crypto taxation solutions to governments and businesses, aims to help a million retail customers with free crypto tax solutions in 2024-2025, Gaurav told Cryptonews.
</p>
<h2>Government is Building Competency in Catching Crypto Tax Evaders</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Talking about current crypto taxations in India, Gaurav said:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Up until 2023, the anonymity of the blockchain primarily benefited individuals. However, starting in 2024, the dynamics shift in favor of organizations, compliance, and all stakeholders. This shift occurs because the recent advancements have enabled the capacity to interpret, and track the blockchain effectively. As a result, taxation is poised to become a significant concern for everyone in the upcoming years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;The government is now building competency in this domain that will ultimately translate into identifying the people who are evading taxes,&rdquo; he added.
</p>
<h2>The Battle of 1% TDS on Crypto Transactions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
As per Gaurav, 1% TDS on crypto taxes is justifiable as it helps remove the fraud from markets such as pump and dump schemes. He said: &ldquo;The 1% TDS is primarily to remove the speculation from the market which has been there for such a long time manipulating the public, 1% TDS ensures that the people are only encouraged to engage in necessary and effective trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, before 1% TDS on crypto transactions was implemented in India in July 2022, nearly <a href="//cryptonews.com/news/indian-government-misses-on-420-million-in-crypto-taxes.htm%5C%22">three to five million customers flew to offshore exchanges</a> in five months. This resulted in approximately a loss of $420 million in taxes for the Indian government. Now, all the <a href="//cryptonews.com/news/india-blocks-offshore-crypto-exchanges-after-non-compliance-warning.htm%5C%22">offshore crypto exchanges have been blocked</a> in India.</p>
<p>Earlier, in <a href="//cryptonews.com/exclusives/interview-2023-year-end-wrap-with-coindcx-co-founder-neeraj-khandelwal.htm%5C%22">an interview with Cryptonews</a>, co-founder of India&rsquo;s leading crypto exchange CoinDCX, Neeraj Khandelwal, said &ldquo;1% TDS on crypto transactions is a &ldquo;death blow&rdquo; to the industry.
</p>
<h2>Future of Crypto Regulations in India</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Gaurav noted that given India has a protectionist economy, meaning the government closely oversees the funds flowing outside of the country, unlike the developed countries like the USA or UK, it is unlikely that crypto regulations will be similar to those countries.</p>
<p>However, India currently has a community of more than 15 million investors who have a vested interest in crypto and are trying to convince the government to bring regulations. Gaurav further added that given India&rsquo;s economic position, there could be regulations that separate crypto trading from crypto ownership. He added:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We may have something where people would be able to create a Demat-like account on the crypto exchanges and would be able to buy and sell their crypto. But to transfer the crypto from India to somewhere else that clearance would be done by National Securities Depositories Ltd (NSDL) and Central Securities Depositories Ltd (CDSL) like entities.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h2>RBI Governor Remains Critical of Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos today, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das, once again reiterated the negative stance on crypto, saying, &ldquo;cryptocurrency is highly speculative and country like India should be very careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cryptocurrencies have huge risk, particularly for emerging market economies because it can impact your financial stability, currency stability, and monetary system.There is no underlying value. It is not a currency, but it has the potential to become a currency in which event it can occupy the part of the payments system. It can impact your banking system and therefore it has very much risk involved in it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Crypto regulations was among one of the main topics during the G20 summit last year in India. The Indian government proposed universal regulations for all the G-20 members and accepted a <a href="//cryptonews.com/news/key-g20-policy-paper-suggests-against-blanket-crypto-ban-calls-for-comprehensive-regulatory-oversight.htm%5C%22">synthesis paper proposing a IMF and FSB</a>. The crypto community in India continues to wait for any formal regulations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again the social elite gathered in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF) – a global event bringing together the most influential players in politics and business to discuss the upcoming trends in business.</p>
<p>For the last seven years, crypto players have edged their way into Davos during the WEF. Who can forget 2017 (peak crypto) &#8212; crypto was the hottest trend. The talk of the town not forgetting the initial coin offering (ICO) phase.</p>
<p>After the ICO bubble popped <a href="https://in.investing.com/analysis/beyond-icos-can-cryptocurrencies-find-new-legitimacy-via-stos-and-ieos-200209669" rel="sponsored">there was an attempt to make</a> “security token offerings” (STOs) and “initial exchange offerings” (IEOs) a thing but this fizzled out too.</p>
<p>In 2018, the WEF saw more chatter around Bitcoin and how some cryptocurrencies were a fad, but blockchain technology was here to stay. Then eventually crypto and blockchain technology took a back seat at Davos and chatter around the importance of regulation continued on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>In 2019, attendees continued <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/davos-2019-leaders-share-mixed-cryptocurrency-predictions/" rel="sponsored">to try and revive the sector,</a> with many verbally bashing crypto as fad. Back then at the WEF, Jeff Schumacher, founder of BCG Digital Ventures, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/davos-2019-leaders-share-mixed-cryptocurrency-predictions/" rel="sponsored">said:</a> “I do believe it [bitcoin] will go to zero. I think it’s a great technology but I don’t believe it’s a currency. It’s not based on anything.”</p>
<p>Between 2020-2023 (excluding 2021 when the WEF was cancelled due to Covid) – crypto continued to remain on the outskirts – although addressed and included (for diversity) it is no longer the hot new trend as it was in 2017. Despite crypto players desperately trying to revive the sector with cool afterparties and Bitcoin pizza day – crypto remains niche,  a bit like Marmite.</p>
<h4><strong>WEF Davos Discussion Points</strong></h4>
<p>Cryptonews touched base with attendees on the ground in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Davos, WEF attendees have been discussing the recent approval of ETFs and how this significant achievement could potentially lead to widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies,&#8221; said Marcos Benitez, head of sales Switzerland for<span class="&quot;gmail-Apple-converted-space&quot;"> </span>Copper.co.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many countries are looking to the United States to follow a similar regulatory framework. It&#8217;s worth noting that within the first two days of the listing of various Bitcoin ETFs, a staggering $4.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency had already been traded,&#8221; added Benitez.</p>
<h4><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval </strong></h4>
<p>CoinDesk <a href="//www.coindesk.com/author/christine-lee/%5C%22" rel="sponsored">producer and anchor</a> Christine Lee, who is at Davos said the crypto crowd gathered this year is optimistic due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the ETFs.</p>
<p>“The crypto vibe in Davos 2024 is decidedly more optimistic thanks to the SEC’s approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs, driving the market higher in anticipation of further institutional adoption. When the news was announced last week, entrepreneurs at CfC St. Moritz, a highly curated crypto conference pre-Davos, were popping champagne bottles, and the wine continued to flow at the various parties throughout the World Economic Forum this week,” said Lee.</p>
<p>Lee has attended numerous events in Switzerland explains many crypto companies are back on the Promenade in Davos, though their operations have scaled back coming off the bear market.</p>
<p>“Circle is opting for private meetings rather than last year’s blowout party and Filecoin Foundation has dialed back their budget. Others making repeat appearances include Hedera, Caspar Labs, 1 Inch, the Global Blockchain Business Council, CV VC, and Skybridge Capital,” said Lee.</p>
<h4><b>WEF Davos 2024 Crypto Media Coverage </b></h4>
<p>Here is a round up of some of the interesting coverage coming out of Davos relating to the cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<p>Reuters, Divya Chowdhury and Lisa Pauline Mattackal <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/skybridges-scaramucci-sees-bitcoin-over-170000-by-2025-halving-spot-etfs-2024-01-15/" rel="sponsored">report</a> hedge fund SkyBridge&#8217;s Anthony Scaramucci believes Bitcoin&#8217;s price could breach $170,000 next year, driven by demand for newly listed exchange traded-funds and April&#8217;s halving event. &#8220;If bitcoin&#8217;s at $45,000 on the halving, where it roughly is right now, it&#8217;ll be $170,000 by mid- to late 2025,&#8221; the SkyBridge founder and managing partner told the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/skybridges-scaramucci-sees-bitcoin-over-170000-by-2025-halving-spot-etfs-2024-01-15/" rel="sponsored">Reuters Global Markets Forum</a> at Davos.</p>
<p>CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal and MacKenzie Sigalos <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/davos-2024-ai-takes-over-wefs-main-area-pushing-crypto-aside.html" rel="sponsored">report</a> that, artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be dominate the Promenade far more than crypto firms this year, reversing a trend from the past few years. The duo look back at their previous converge of crypto at Davos.  In January 2023, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/14/why-the-2022-crypto-winter-is-unlike-previous-bear-markets.html" rel="sponsored">the crypto winter had set in</a>, firms pulled back on splashing the cash at Davos, but there was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/davos-1point4-trillion-wipeout-hits-crypto-industry-at-wef.html" rel="sponsored">still a heavy presence from the industry</a>, inclduing a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/19/davos-mystery-of-orange-bitcoin-car-revealed-and-owner-slams-critics.html" rel="sponsored">mysterious orange bitcoin car</a>. Today it seems Davos is all about AI which is dominating the WEF.</p>
<p>Financial News, Bilal Jafar <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/crypto-davos-world-economic-forum-as-ripple-president-asks-mature-players-to-represent-20240113" rel="sponsored">reported,</a> the crypto world has long headed to Davos in January, but has rarely been admitted inside the WEF. Instead, it has chosen to represent itself outside the heavily guarded conference. Jafar reports, crypto seeks legitimacy at World Economic Forum as Ripple president urges ‘mature players’ to attend.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, and this is an extra special episode for a couple of reasons, folks. Episode number 300 of the Cryptonews Podcast. This thing started almost three years ago, just less than three years ago. Crazy to think here we are still buzzing. The train is still on the tracks. 300 episodes later. Love you guys so much. Thank you as always for tuning in. Without the listeners, this show would still not be on the tracks. Love you guys so much gratitude. Thank you for everything. And it truly warms my heart that we have somehow gotten to episode 300 and it&#8217;s been a ride. Hopefully we have another 300 in store. Reason number two why this episode is extra special the Bitcoin ETF got approved yesterday. Folks we are recording on Thursday, January 11th. This is going to air on Monday the 15th and we have a Bitcoin ETF locked and loaded. It has finally happened and I can&#8217;t wait to get into it with the one and only Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata. Greg has spent over a decade as a professional trader in traditional finance markets with proprietary firms such as SMB Capital, Chopper Trading and DRW, before co founding and working as CEO of Genesis Volatility, a leading crypto options insights provider. Genesis Volatility was acquired by Amberdata in 2022 to grow their options data analytics capabilities for their roster of institutional clients such as Citi, NASDAQ, Franklin Templeton. Ever heard of them? And more. Super pumped to have you on for episode 300. Greg, welcome to the show, my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Doing great. Thank you, Matt. And I&#8217;m very happy that we spoke a little French before the show. Very happy to hear that as well. That was very cool.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. Got a fellow French Canadian on the pod. We love to see that. And it&#8217;s also episode 300, which is incredible. One thing that stands out before we get into the Bitcoin ETF, obviously you and the team at Genesis Volatility, you guys were acquired, and congrats on that. That is absolutely huge by Amberdata. And as I was reading the bio, the last firm of your roster of institutional clients was Franklin Templeton. Did you see the laser eyes that they put on their profile picture yesterday?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, I think it&#8217;s pretty on point. I mean, the laser eyes and 100k Bitcoin are sort of synonymous. And it&#8217;s pretty interesting that Ben Franklin is the guy on the $100 bill. 100k Bitcoin seems very much in the cards, so it&#8217;s on point.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I believe it was Will. The classic Will. How am I forgetting his last name? Anyways, you know who I&#8217;m talking about. Will. Oh, boy. The on-chain analytics guy for Bitcoin. My apologies, Will. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m forgetting your name. You&#8217;re one of the GOATs in the space. But he was the one who tweeted out yesterday that Franklin Templeton put the laser eyes on, and he&#8217;s like 1.4 trillion AUM. So when you have firms like Franklin Templeton putting laser eyes on their logo, you know shit&#8217;s about to get spicy. Let&#8217;s jump right into it here, Greg, Bitcoin ETF got approved yesterday. Again, folks, we are recording on Thursday, January 11. When you hear this, it will be Monday the 15th. Let&#8217;s get right into it. What does this mean for us? What does this mean for TradFi? What does this mean as a whole market for all of us? Start us off and then we&#8217;ll jump into some of the nitty gritty fun stuff here.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, I think in the medium to long term, it&#8217;s definitely bullish, upside trend. The way that I like to think about it is that if I look at assets under management in, say, North America alone, there&#8217;s about $53 trillion under management. It makes a lot of sense just from like, a modern portfolio theory perspective. Allocate 1% or 2% of a portfolio to crypto as an asset class, specifically Bitcoin, which we&#8217;ll have the ETF for. And so that&#8217;s easily a trillion dollars of flows over, say, call it the next twelve to 18 months. And right now, the Bitcoin market cap is 850 billion or 900 billion, around a trillion dollars itself. So if you increase flows, purchasing flows by a trillion dollars, that doesn&#8217;t double the market cap. That does something like 5X the market cap. Buying a trillion dollars of Bitcoin is going to move the market cap along the way as you&#8217;re trying to execute. So what I expect to happen is that slowly, financial advisors, pension funds, kind of the big traditional, risk averse, protect my capital, preserve my capital sort of mindset. We&#8217;ll naturally allocate some portfolio to Bitcoin as an asset class, an uncorrelated asset class with positive expected value. It&#8217;s exactly what you want to put into a portfolio.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>So you said it might 4X to 5X the market cap as a whole. What&#8217;s this going to do to the price? And I know price predictions. Little wishy washy. I know it&#8217;s a cop out question on my end, but it&#8217;s what the listeners want. It&#8217;s what everyone wants. You got to give the people what they want. What&#8217;s this going to do to the price? Present day we&#8217;re sitting at around 47K, give or take. If this 4 to 5X is, are we really going to hit six figs Bitcoin? Will this mean that we bring this up to 200k, 100k? What&#8217;s your price prediction here in regards to Bitcoin maybe a year from now, in 2025?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, I think a year from now. The $100,000 mark is very clear. That&#8217;s sort of the obvious mark. But 4 to 5X really puts it at 200 to 250 in terms of twice. Yeah, absolutely. I think it&#8217;s totally in the cards. Another thing that&#8217;s really interesting with sort of a Bitcoin ETF, as opposed to the existing ETFs that we have that are built on top of like CME futures, I&#8217;m thinking of specifically BETO, is that as people allocate funds to these ETFs, well, all of a sudden we&#8217;re starting to get coins put into cold storage in order to sort of back up the underlying value of these ETFs. And so the trading float of Bitcoin on-chain or the active coins&nbsp; on-chain , that&#8217;s going to slowly diminish as well. So you&#8217;ll sort of see sort of a more passive holding, a new entry of passive holders in Bitcoin. So the people who are really investing for the long term or doing a portfolio allocation, they&#8217;re not trading Bitcoin, they&#8217;re putting in a portfolio for multiple years. So that&#8217;s going to reduce the float, and I think that&#8217;s going to be pretty bullish as well for prices.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. I&#8217;d love if you could give myself and the listeners a quick rundown on how the ETF actually works, because this is to my understanding, and I&#8217;ve done a fair bit of research in this regard. It differs from the traditional ETFs as most ETFs have a basket of traditional stocks and bonds, equities, you name it. Many of the ETFs here have cut their fees and have some wild cash and carry models. And I was wondering if there&#8217;s any downside to sort of the cash and carry model versus the redemption of underlying assets. Also, not being able to withdraw Bitcoin from the ETF itself is sort of wild and just sort of fortifies the point that you just brought up in regards to there&#8217;s going to be a huge supply shock when so much Bitcoin is being held in cold storage. And with institutional custodial masters like your Coinbases, so on and so forth, what, and how do sort of all of these ETFs work? How do they work? I&#8217;d love if you&#8217;d give just a quick rundown in that regard, and then we&#8217;ll keep buzzing on this subject.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so one of the things that&#8217;s really interesting is if we compare to the past products like Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, which is a closed end fund, basically they have Bitcoin that they hold and they issue shares against that. But essentially you can&#8217;t do a redemption process. So that&#8217;s why we saw at first a premium to net asset values in the Grayscale ETF or the Pink Sheets ETF closed in fund, and then a discount later on. If we look at regular ETFs like we&#8217;re finally getting now, there&#8217;s two kind of models for creation and redemption of shares. The process of creating and redeeming shares is to enable the actual price of the ETF to track the net asset value accurately. So we won&#8217;t get these types of premiums or discounts that we saw in Grayscale&#8217;s previous ETF. And then there&#8217;s in kind. So basically, like you said, creating and redeeming shares with actual Bitcoin or in cash, which is going to be like the cash equivalent value. So I think the process of doing the actual underlying for creating a redemption was sort of a new complexity, especially with digital assets that I think the SEC was not fully comfortable with. But you essentially are going to get the same monetary experience, or the same economic value in terms of experience by the cash creation and redemption scheme. So basically, people will buy and sell shares at the cash value of the theoretical underlying Bitcoin. So that&#8217;ll be a great way to have a clean ETF product. And then if we compare it to what&#8217;s existing right now in terms of BETO, which is going to be rolling to two front month contracts in CME, that&#8217;s going to be, again, a deviation of spot. So CME futures will sometimes trade at a premium to spot, sometimes they trade at a discount, and then there&#8217;s this kind of consistent contango or carry that grinds away the value of the ETFs itself. And so now, again, with the new spot ETF, that will be adjusted for as well, and we won&#8217;t have that type of persistent grind from the contango basis.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>That&#8217;s huge. How funny are the names as well? Like some of these names that are coming off like, I love the tickers, rather, not the names, but you have HODL, you have, like, do you not find it wild that again, the biggest financial institutions in the world have picked literal memes for their tickers? Who would have thought that that would ever happen?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, I think that&#8217;s really funny and it&#8217;s like, super interesting. It&#8217;s also some of the more new ETF issuers that have those crazy names like VanEck has. They&#8217;re on Twitter, they&#8217;re posting funny memes and stuff like that. They&#8217;re really engaging in sort of this younger investor culture with memes and sort of inside jokes in the industry that crypto Twitter often pings back and forth. So we&#8217;ll see if that really attracts the investor base, because right now there&#8217;s going to be a lot of competition for assets between all the various ETFs. So we&#8217;ll see who really wins. But it&#8217;s cool to see A, sort of that meme culture being included with some of these firms, and then B, some of these firms are actually sharing some of their profit splits and giving it back to the Bitcoin core foundation. So I think stuff like that is really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, that is great. Speaking of the different ETFs, how the heck does one sort of choose which of the, I believe 11 right now perhaps 13. How does one choose which ETF to invest in? Is it as simple as whatever your financial advisor has ties to? Like, if you&#8217;re with VanEck, if you&#8217;re with BlackRock, whatever the case may be, all the fees seem pretty similar. Everyone seems to be giving back between two and a half to 10% to the Bitcoin foundation or Bitcoin developers. How does one choose which ETF to invest in?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so that&#8217;s really interesting. So there&#8217;s going to be sort of different audiences, but the way that I would make this choice, what&#8217;s really interesting to me is going to be the options market that are listed on these ETFs. I think this is the catalyst to grow crypto vault trading. 5X, 10X. So what we&#8217;re going to see is, first of all, not every ETF is going to have options listed against it. So the ones that do have options listed against it are going to be, naturally, the more popular ones will get most of the volume. And then from there, it&#8217;s going to take a little bit of time to see which ETF actually has sort of that sticky volume, and then volume begets more volume. So I think that&#8217;s really how it&#8217;s going to play out. It&#8217;s going to be the ones with the options market. And then within the options market, who has the most liquidity and where are most people playing? And then I think once that&#8217;s settled, it&#8217;s going to be really hard to dislodge the winner from that.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>And what about the price of these ETFs? Because again, a lot of people online, I had two friends called me yesterday TradFi friends who were like, oh, should I just buy the ETF at 47,000? And I&#8217;m like, look, I could be wrong here, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the ETF is not going to replicate the price of Bitcoin. This isn&#8217;t just a way into Bitcoin. They&#8217;re going to be priced how the owners of the ETF choose to price them. Is there going to be different pricing between everyone? Are they all going to be priced the same at the start and then sort of rise and fall in a correlative value? I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through sort of the process of how it gets priced and some of the price action we&#8217;re going to see when the ETFs do go for a rip and then fall down as well.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so pricing is going to be another one of those levers where people are going to try to bet, or these companies are going to best try to estimate what&#8217;s the most attractive trading price. I expect most of the ETFs to be between $20 and $100, what the price will be. And we saw something similar back when CME launches futures. So you saw the same type of scheme in terms of contract multipliers. CME had a 5X contract, whereas Sibo was able to secure the 1X contract. And so theoretically, the 1X contract is a lot cleaner product. You&#8217;re trading one contract for one Bitcoin. But in the end, that wasn&#8217;t enough of a differentiator to win over the volume that CME was able to capture. So I think, again, it&#8217;s one of those levers, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the main thing that will drive adoption for a particular ETF.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Well said there. Last question on the ETF, Greg, unless there&#8217;s anything else that you&#8217;d love to divulge into, but the difference in Volatility and Implied Volatility in the crypto market and the effect on BTC price, I&#8217;d love if you could tie this into the Bitcoin ETF. What is this going to do to Volatility and Implied Volatility in crypto markets? As a whole in relation to the ETF finally being approved.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah. So Implied Volatility is the options market&#8217;s best estimate or the pricing estimate of future Realized Volatility. And Realized Volatility is historically, how has this asset moved around? So if we look at the past four years of ball markets, we&#8217;ve had a consistent trend lower in Realized Volatility as Bitcoin has matured as an asset class. And I expect that that structural trend stays intact, but we have cyclical moments of higher Volatility. And so from mid October, the rally, as we broke above 30K with the sort of geopolitical conflicts going on in the Middle East, that was a catalyst for Cyclical Volatility that was quickly followed through by the ETF deadline and a narrative around the ETF decision. So we saw a nice pump in Realized Volatility and Implied Volatility as the options market was betting that we&#8217;d have a big vol event with this announcement. Turns out that the announcement itself had almost no Realized Volatility. So the options market overpriced the future movement. And I think that&#8217;s really one of the interesting things about crypto Volatility. I mean, crypto Volatility is really what I&#8217;m passionate about. And it&#8217;s one of these markets that not only do we not know the true value of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, but we even know less about the path of that valuation or the wiggles along the way, aka the Volatility of this asset class. So everyone&#8217;s trying to kind of figure this out on the fly. So it&#8217;s a really even playing field. And a lot of the most knowledgeable people will be people who are retail by definition, who&#8217;ve been around crypto for a long time and have a really good feel for it. So what we&#8217;re going to see here in terms of the path of future Volatility, I expect well capitalized investors to start maturing this market and making Volatility go down overall. But we&#8217;ll have some good episodes of interesting moments. And I think this is really when people who&#8217;ve been around for a while in the crypto space can really outperform.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah. Take advantage of that. And that is exactly what you and the team do at Amberdata, and we are going to get into that in one quick second. But until then, Greg, we have to give a massive shout out to our sponsor of the show.

Let&#8217;s jump right into Amberdata. Give us the elevator pitch on what you and the team do, and then we&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty here.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so Amberdata is a diversified digital assets data company. So we have blockchain data, we have DeFi data, we have spot market data, and then we have futures, perpetuals, and options data. So my role is really being in charge of the derivatives data, futures, perps, and options. But what&#8217;s really interesting about Amberdata is that we have the whole data suite, and again, crypto is a new asset class. We don&#8217;t know how to value it. We don&#8217;t know how to figure out how to trade the ball yet. We&#8217;re still figuring all that out as a community. But what&#8217;s even more interesting is that there&#8217;s new data assets. So on-chain&nbsp; data is a very interesting aspect, and there&#8217;s a lot of hidden treasures there that haven&#8217;t been figured out. And then combining that on-chain&nbsp; data with derivatives data with spot data, especially in a fragmented market where there&#8217;s exchanges all over the place, say, in Korea and Japan and in North America and Europe, that often trade at different prices or have different sort of investor bases, it&#8217;s a great way to essentially find patterns in the market that haven&#8217;t been discovered yet.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Greg, you and the team at Amberdata compile so much data from absolutely everywhere, especially from CEXs. And no, we&#8217;re not talking about porn sex, or wild sex. We&#8217;re talking about centralized exchanges here, CEXs. We&#8217;re talking about data directly from the CME Dex pool data, decentralized exchanges, and offshore exchanges. How do you guys sort of pick and choose which data to pull? What data moves the needle, what doesn&#8217;t? And then how do you sort of pile it all together to actually build out futures markets, derivatives markets, options trading markets, how does that whole process work?</p>
<p><b>Greg</b> <b>Magadini</b><br />
Yeah, so, typically, especially speaking for the derivatives element, if we&#8217;re looking at DeFi derivatives or centralized exchange derivatives, or TradFi derivatives, the number one thing that we start looking at, especially with the DeFi space, is how much adoption and engagement is occurring for a particular protocol. And so once we see that a particular protocol or a certain exchange has a lot of sort of volume and tight spreads and is trustworthy, then it becomes a real good candidate for us to include the data sets. Obviously, everyone&#8217;s limited resources, so we have to pick and choose sort of the best candidates for our developers to incorporate the data sets. And then we often create relationships with these exchanges or these protocols as well. And so chatting with the people who run these exchanges or run these protocols is a great way for us to understand sort of the quality behind the team and the product itself. And then from there, we will build features around it. We&#8217;ll consume the raw data, and then build derived data, works around that raw data, and really create actionable insights for our customers.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>And derivatives as a whole. I&#8217;d love if you could just give a quick sort of TLDR on derivatives trading in crypto differs a little from traditional derivatives. I get asked this all the time. I never have a good answer for it, as I rarely dabble with any type of future options or derivative trading. But how exactly does a derivative trading platform work? And what advice would you sort of give to, maybe not a rookie, because I would never, ever advise a rookie to dabble with derivatives, but perhaps a crypto trader who is becoming more seasoned and wants to dabble with derivatives. How would you explain it to them? And what advice would you give them if they wanted to get into the space?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so there&#8217;s kind of two core derivatives. There&#8217;s Delta One products and then nonlinear products. So delta one products are essentially linear, but they&#8217;re leveraged. So that&#8217;s really the futures and perpetuals of the world. You can think of being long or perpetual as a magnified position on the price going up or down, and you pay some sort of carry for that privilege. And so in a perpetual, the carry is periodic, say, every 8 hours in a future. It&#8217;s implicit in the future&#8217;s expiration. So a future that expires in three months might trade at a premium of $1,000 to the current Bitcoin price. And that is essentially the implied interest rate for being long that future, or what you would collect for being short that future. There&#8217;s really interesting cash and carry strategies you can do there, which are low risk as opposed to just betting on a magnified percentage move in the underlying. On the nonlinear side, which is Options, you have these payouts that are convex. And so you&#8217;re either taking convexity risk or you&#8217;re selling convexity risk. And that really comes down to what we analyze in the Implied Volatility markets. Convex payments essentially have a non symmetrical payout. So it&#8217;s sort of one of those things where if I win, I might win a much larger amount from long options than what I&#8217;m risking. But on the flip side, I sort of have a time decay component there. And so for that asymmetry, you pay a huge premium. And so you want to understand how that is being priced. And you do that by looking at the Options market. In terms of venues to trade these things, Deribit is sort of the most trusted and the largest venue in terms of nonlinear products. In terms of linear products, CME has now become number one space. So we can see the greatest open interest in CME futures as of today. And then again, the spot Bitcoin ETF is really going to be a nice place to expand the venues for North American traders, especially, who want to trade options on a product like Bitcoin.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Well said there. One of the things that I&#8217;m always curious about, how does options trading, because again, it&#8217;s still not massive, massive in crypto, but I feel like after the ETF is approved and it has been approved, I feel like it will become and continue to get bigger and bigger. How will this impact just traditional trading and pricing as a whole? Because if we have, let&#8217;s say, hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in interest, in forward interest, where you have tons of people and traders and institutions who all have levered longs, let&#8217;s just use Bitcoin, for example, and everyone thinks Bitcoin is going to rip, and they all have levered longs open. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about some of the network effects, like how does that affect the average Joe like myself, who doesn&#8217;t dabble in those types of products too often, what are the implications? What are the network effects of that?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so that&#8217;s actually a really interesting perspective, and I actually think it&#8217;s a counterintuitive answer. So although options enable traders to take more speculative risk if they choose to, truly what options do is that they&#8217;re like insurance, and they allow you to isolate the risk you want to take and defer the risk you don&#8217;t want to take. So in a lot of ways, what happens is that big investors, what they&#8217;ll do is they&#8217;ll derisk their Bitcoin exposure or their stock exposure. You see this in equity indexes a lot, and what they&#8217;ll do is that they&#8217;ll sell calls and buy puts and essentially reduce the Volatility of their exposure in one place and then transfer that risk to a market participant who&#8217;s willing to take that risk. So that&#8217;s typically like a market maker or a speculator on the other side. So what you could actually see is that it&#8217;s going to be part of the maturing process that should theoretically, over time, bring Volatility down. Now, one caveat here is that, again, with leveraged products, although most of the time I do think it&#8217;s going to be a derisking event because it allows people to derisk, in certain scenarios, the variance of variance, meaning there&#8217;ll be episodes where Volatility will be increased if everyone&#8217;s leaning on the same side and we get some sort of like magnified event that could bring Volatility of Volatility higher. So most of the time Volatility is low, but all of a sudden it can flip on a dime. And so that&#8217;s one of those things to keep in mind, but that&#8217;s how I think about it.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Interesting, very interesting. Let&#8217;s get into some hot takes here, Greg, you&#8217;ve been on fire. You&#8217;ve been on an absolute roll. Doesn&#8217;t have to be price predictions, but will we continue to see sort of the present day narratives and trends keep ripping? Like the Solana ecosystem being on fire, Bitcoin going to 100k, ETH struggling with its sort of OG narrative being sort of digital gas for the ecosystem. What trends and hot takes do you have for crypto and 2024?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so I think ETH the big sort of headwind there is, what is going to be the regulatory landscape for Ethereum? Again, EIP 1559 is really bullish in the sense that it can actively reduce the supply of Ethereum if transaction fees are high enough and frequent enough but Ethereum is still not still ambiguous. Is it a commodity or is it a security? And then all the protocols or the ERC-20 projects built on top of Ethereum are sort of falling into the security bucket. And so I kind of wonder out loud if there&#8217;s less activity on Ethereum because DeFi protocols are being sort of scrutinized in the regulatory landscape. Well, does that change the value proposition of EIP 1559? And then does that flip Ethereum from a deflationary asset to an inflationary asset? So that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s kind of interesting to me. I do think Ethereum has been a laggard, and I do expect it to catch up like we&#8217;ve been seeing recently. But again, to me, the big line there is going to be the regulatory landscape in terms of Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin has proved itself in 2023 to be a very interesting non correlated, positive expected value investable asset. What I mean by that is that Bitcoin rallied when everything else was crashing. SVB, banking crisis. Bitcoin benefited a lot from that. And then the terror attacks in Israel in mid October, Bitcoin benefited from that as well. We saw similar price action with the Ukraine and Russia crisis or Russia war a couple of years back. So it&#8217;s one of those situations that I think Bitcoin is proving itself to be a safe haven. But if we get a bull market you know, true, proper bull market, historically all coins outperform. So that&#8217;s sort of the trade off.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Interesting. What about Solana? Any takes on Solana? Everyone talk of the town right now went from $9 to $100 in what, 6, 7, 8 months, still room to grow there.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>So Solana is actually not a crypto I&#8217;ve been following very closely. I kind of just forgot about it after FTX crashed. I know that Deribit is going to launch Solana options once again. And so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see when that option market comes back for Solana, what sort of adoption we see there in the derivatives market. But yeah, obviously it&#8217;s been on fire. I don&#8217;t have a good take on Solana, though, personally.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />

<p>The <strong>MetaMask Snaps</strong> plugin, which provides access to the popular <strong>MetaMask</strong> wallet&rsquo;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metamask-expands-global-presence-with-payment-partnerships-across-six-countries.htm">30 million monthly active users</a>, is now available on the open-source, proof-of-stake network <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hedera-adds-major-household-name-to-its-council-why-is-this-important.htm">Hedera</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This Hedera Wallet Snap plugin, built by <a href="https://www.tuum.tech/" rel="sponsored"><strong>Tuum Technologies</strong></a>, enables developers, companies, and individuals to enjoy new benefits beyond MetaMask&rsquo;s native features, said the press release. Developers can now integrate Hedera&rsquo;s functionality into MetaMask-based applications.</p>
<p>Donald Bullers, Founder and CEO of Tuum Technologies, told <em>Cryptonews</em> that the prevailing market conditions provide &ldquo;a significant validation of the enduring presence of decentralized technologies&rdquo; powered by distributed ledger technology (DLT).
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This acknowledgment is expected to broaden adoption among a previously skeptical demographic, leading to a substantial increase in crypto wallet account activations.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Consequently, there is a heightened demand for ongoing product innovation in the space to meet the growing needs of users, Bullers said.
</p>
<h2>Enabling Access to Range of Networks through MetaMask</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Tuum Technologies is a software engineering company and a developer of open-source, decentralized identity solutions.</p>
<p>It created Snaps, which extends the functionality of MetaMask by enabling developers to create custom plugins.</p>
<p>The integration of Hedera into an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), multichain wallet &ldquo;opens up numerous doors&rdquo; for developers, users, and companies to interact with the Hedera network directly through MetaMask applications.</p>
<p>Bullers told <em>Cryptonews</em> that,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The introduction of Hedera&#8217;s native functionality to MetaMask&rsquo;s 30 million MAUs not only increases interoperability but also extends access to a diverse range of networks, including Hedera.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
This amalgamation, said he, combines MetaMask&rsquo;s robust security features and Hedera&rsquo;s speed and cost-effectiveness, &ldquo;elevating the overall user experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It &ldquo;paves the way for user experience efficiencies,&rdquo; said the announcement, enabling anyone to send <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-hedera-hbar-price-rallies-10-and-this-other-coin-could-explode-next-heres-why.htm">HBAR</a> to Hedera and EVM addresses. It also enables the retrieval of account information and viewing of token balances.
</p>
<h2>More Features Coming Soon</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
The Hedera Wallet Snap eliminates the need for Hedera JSON-RPC Relay. This allows the plugin users to retrieve account information from the Hedera Consensus Node and the Hedera Mirror Node.</p>
<p>Per CEO Bullers,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For developers and companies currently operating MetaMask-enabled applications or planning to build them, this integration offers an alternative to Hedera JSON RPC Relay and opens doors to Hedera&#8217;s full suite of capabilities.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The use of native integration, as opposed to relying on Hedera JSON RPC Relay, allows developers to support features from the Hedera Token Service (HTS) and extend their capabilities into other network services. These include File Service, Smart Contract Service, and Consensus Service.</p>
<p>Bullers noted that the initial release comprises basic functionalities. The team is actively working on incorporating advanced features in the coming months. This will include viewing transaction history and staking/unstaking HBAR to and from Hedera Network nodes.</p>
<p>Kiran Pachhai, Co-founder of Tuum Technologies, commented that the Hedera Wallet Snap is &ldquo;a sophisticated plugin that empowers developers to enhance the capabilities of their applications beyond the native features of MetaMask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shayne Higdon, Co-founder and CEO of <strong>The HBAR Foundation</strong> added that this is just a first step for the plugin. Specifically as more features and functionalities will be announced in the coming months.</p>
<p>Hedera Wallet Snap can be installed from MetaMask Open Beta. It is available on GitHub as a JavaScript NPM package.</p>
