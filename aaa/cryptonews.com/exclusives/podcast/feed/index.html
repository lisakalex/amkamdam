<strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always. Got to start off by apologizing for the lights. We are recording, not super late, but late enough. Normally, we got some nice sunlight on me in Mexico. I&#8217;m recording at 7:20 p.m. tonight because we have the one and only Alex Svanevik on the show today. He is a whole frigging day ahead of me in the one and only Singapore. We&#8217;re going to get into all this super pumped to have him on. The CEO of Nansen. You guys know what Nansen is. Alex is the CEO and Co-Founder of Nansen and has a background in artificial intelligence with 10 plus years as a data scientist and management consultant before Co-Founding Nansen in 2019. He&#8217;s also one of the initial DAO members of Lido Finance and PleasrDAO and serves on the board of Wallet Connect. Super pumped to have you on. Alex, welcome to the show, my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Thank you, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Thanks for having me. It&#8217;s great to be here. Pumped to have you and it&#8217;s always super cool when you&#8217;re a whole day ahead of someone, you know, recording.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>I&#8217;m living in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>You&#8217;re living in the future. You were chowing down on some just a beautiful mackerel breakfast before we got started here. I just finished burritos for dinner. You just finished a good old brekkie. We&#8217;d love to see it. Before the show you and I were shooting the shit a little and you had a couple pretty awesome stories. I got to get you to tell those. But before that, we got a touch on your incredible little tweet about Singapore. You have been in Singapore for the last six years. I&#8217;ve never been. It&#8217;s on my to do list. Seems like one of the sweetest places on the planet. You touched over a couple good points. You can tell them better than I can. I think this would be a great place to start. Tell us why you love Singapore so much and how cool life is there.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah. So I&#8217;ve lived, I think in seven different countries. So I feel like you have a relatively good sample to compare, you know, Singapore with, I don&#8217;t know where to start. I think to me, it&#8217;s actually about values. You know, I, I really like Singapore because I feel like the culture here is very meritocratic first of all. And that&#8217;s how the whole society has been, you know, created since Lee Kuan Yew kind of started transforming this place from a swamp to a metropolitan city-state. And that&#8217;s probably a bit of an exact duration, but that&#8217;s at least how people explain it. So it&#8217;s very meritocratic. It&#8217;s very efficient, which I think most people know, but when you live it day to day, it makes a big difference. Like if you need to get from A to B, you can get a go check or a grab in two, three minutes, which is the equivalent of Uber, let&#8217;s say. And because it&#8217;s so small and because the traffic, you know, it&#8217;s typically not jammed but on stuff you can get from A to B in like 10 max, 15 minutes. And then if you, if you need to get anything done in the public sector, like if you pick up your employment pass or anything like that, it&#8217;s incredibly fast, right? This is something that was unusual for me as a European having lived in, say Spain or Italy, where you want to get like your ID card and you have to show up at 4 AM in the morning, this long queue outside, then you finally make it. And you learn that there&#8217;s something wrong with their system. You have to come back like next week or whatever it is. So it&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s just very efficient. And then it&#8217;s interesting for people who are in crypto because it&#8217;s kind of getting that critical mass of a crypto scene here, which is quite exciting. Like I think some people, sorry, some places like Hong Kong where it&#8217;s a live is also interesting. And I love Hong Kong, but the crypto scene is a bit one sided and it&#8217;s mostly kind of the investors who are based there. Whereas in Singapore, I think you have both investors, you have founders of small protocols, companies. Then you have people who work in the big crypto companies like Coinbase, Binance, and so on. You&#8217;re based here. So you have a really kind of rich and diverse crypto scene that I really enjoy. I mean, I could probably spend the whole podcast talking about Singapore, frankly, but yeah, it&#8217;s a great place to live. I really like it. The weather is generally quite nice. If you like hot weather and it&#8217;s in a great location so you can travel to other great destinations like Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>So cool. Let&#8217;s jump right into Nansen here. When I first heard of Nansen, I mean, it was pretty close to when I got in the space not too long ago. I wasn&#8217;t as early as you were, but you and your team&#8217;s growth has been absolutely incredible. Kudos and massive shout out and well deserved to you guys. Before we jump into the whole thing, did you ever think that like you guys would literally be the behemoth of anything analytics and data related in the whole space? Like, cause again, you know, you had a, you left a good job to come start this in a risky industry. Did you ever have that hunch? Like we&#8217;re going to build the shit out of this thing and turn it into a monster. Was that ever a thought?</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, thanks for the kind words. I mean, to be totally honest, when we started Nansen, we kind of thought of it as a potential cashflow business. Like, I think that&#8217;s how we didn&#8217;t think, let&#8217;s go out with the spoil the ocean vision to become like a trillion dollar company. It was more like, hey, we know that there are certain unsolved problems in crypto, and in particular, a lot of the data was kind of either non-existing, the analytics were incorrect in many places. And there were just so many kind of basic analytical questions that you weren&#8217;t able to answer back when we started, in particular with regards to what&#8217;s happening on-chain. That&#8217;s what we are really good at. And so we thought if we just solve those problems, we&#8217;re probably going to have paying customers who want to answer those questions. And they&#8217;ll want to pay because investors at the end of the day want to make more money. So if we&#8217;re helping them make more money, then presumably they will be okay paying a subscription fee for the product. And so it was very much coming from a relatively humble place. But yeah, we did start growing very fast. Like we launched the product April 2020, we had our first paying customers the literal first day that we put up the landing page. And then word spread and we just started growing very organically. And then at the time, I was the only one working full-time on this project. And my other two co-founders were working part-time. And about six months later, we realized like this is turning into a real company. We need to hire people. You guys need to commit to this full-time. And so they did. And we raised a seed round so that we could hire people, even though we were making revenues, actually. But you still want to make sure that you have enough money in the bank, if things change, so that you can pay your employees and so on. So we did a seed round. We started hiring our first people. And then the next year, 2021, was incredible. And we did a Series A with A16C, we had a Series B with Excel and many other great investors later in the year. And yeah, I mean, some VCs we spoke to in 2021 said that we were literally one of the top five fastest growing SaaS companies that I&#8217;ve ever seen in terms of the revenue growth. So yeah, that was incredible. But it was also good timing with both DeFi really taking off. And so it was great. But it&#8217;s a good feeling for sure. And then you realize, actually, we can aim much higher here. And then you have to calibrate your vision and your aspirations, of course, which is a good thing, obviously. And then yeah, we&#8217;ve never looked back since.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I love that. Bit of a weird question here. You guys pull a shitload of data from, I mean, all the big boy, big gal chains. You pull data from over 250 million wallet addresses, which is absolutely bonkers. This is strictly my selfish curiosity here. Which chain is the easiest to pull data from and which chain is the hardest to pull data from? Which chain gives you sort of the sexiest and most enrichful and forward-looking, you know, trend esque data and are some you&#8217;re just like, oh, this is hogwash. This is nonsense. I&#8217;d love if you could sort of give us some gold on the pros and cons of pulling data from certain chains.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>I mean, I think those are two slightly separate things. I&#8217;ll answer first the version of your question, which is which one is the easiest or which one is the hardest. That&#8217;s a pretty straightforward answer. The easiest one for us is Ethereum, because that&#8217;s the one we&#8217;ve always started with, and we&#8217;ve developed the expertise to do that. It doesn&#8217;t have an insane amount of data volume, so it&#8217;s manageable with the block times and stuff. The one that&#8217;s hardest for sure is Solana. So it just has way more data. It&#8217;s not EDM, so it&#8217;s a totally different paradigm. But that&#8217;s why I say the questions you asked are a little bit different. So it doesn&#8217;t mean that the content for Hogwarts or that data is dirty or anything like that. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s very hard for us because it&#8217;s so different and the volume of data is so much greater. But we still do it because our customers want Solana data, and so you still do that. But I would say we have gotten insanely good at reading data from EDM chains. And of course, that is the dominant paradigm, if you will, of chains, like BNB chain, EVM, Polygon, Avalanche, SeaChain. All these different chains are all EVM chains. And so we&#8217;ve kind of sort of industrialized the ingestion of EVM chains to the point where if we decide to onboard a new EVM chain, we can do that in ours, in theory. Of course, there&#8217;s more work later with maintenance. You have to do attribution or labeling of the wallets that are active on the chain. That takes time. But the actual getting all the data into our database is pretty straightforward at this point. But it took many years to develop the technology to do it in such a streamlined manner.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>And present day we have, you know, not crypto related, but semi-crypto related. Everyone&#8217;s still on the AI train. It&#8217;s left the station. There&#8217;s no chance it&#8217;s ever coming back. You are one of the few people who can actually chime in and who&#8217;s two cents and, you know, hands in the cookie jar we can actually listen to. You have an MSC in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh. So, you know, I&#8217;ve asked a lot of people, what is AI going to do to crypto? You actually studied this shit. You know what&#8217;s going on. Especially as the CEO of Nansen, you guys are the bread and butter of data. How have you in particular, you and your team used AI to, you know, help pull data from all the different chains to help enrich your data sets, so on and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, so we use AI in two primary ways. That&#8217;s our AI strategy at Nansen. The first one is that we use it to supercharge our product, right? So it allows us to build certain innovative features and also deepen our data notes in a manner that was not possible just a few years ago, right? So we kind of think of AI as ubiquitous throughout Nansen. It&#8217;s not like, here&#8217;s the one AI feature. It&#8217;s more like it powers our search. It powers the NFT price estimates that our machine learning created. If you want to get an estimate of your Pudgy Penguin, then we have a machine learning model that gives you an estimate, almost like I say, hello, this estimate. And it&#8217;s all machine learning power. And so, and then in terms of the attribution, the labeling and so on, that&#8217;s an area where we will be using AI much more going forward. But yeah, so the first area is just making the product better. The second area, which I don&#8217;t think is unique to us as a company by any means, and certainly not unique to the blockchain industry either, is using AI to increase our organizational productivity and our individual productivity. So this is kind of the, I guess this is where, if you read the newspapers, this is where many people talked about the implications of AI, like AI is going to take our jobs and stuff. I think in my experience, what ends up happening is that you just increase productivity quite dramatically. So if you are working with anything content related, right? It could actually be video, it could be audio, but often it&#8217;s text, of course, if you&#8217;re writing content marketing, if you&#8217;re writing Twitter threads, you&#8217;re writing research, we&#8217;re basically using AI for all of those different things to shorten down the process and just save time and effectively increase productivity in the sense that you&#8217;re getting more output with less input, right, and the input is typically ours. So the way I think about this in a very broad sense is that whenever you&#8217;re doing work, there&#8217;s sort of three primary things you do. The first one is that there&#8217;s a prompt, right? You have something like a drive, hey, I need to do the same, like writing down the name of the task or whatever. Then there&#8217;s a long process, which historically has been always from the most time, which is the production, like the completion of that thing, the tasks, and then at the end, there&#8217;s an element of quality assurance, like whatever I made, it&#8217;s like, it makes sense. Maybe you do that with someone else, you&#8217;re quality assurance someone else&#8217;s work. With AI, the interesting thing is you end up spending like most of your time only on the first and the last bit, which in a way are the two, that&#8217;s where like you spend the least amount of hours. And the thing in the middle, the production, that&#8217;s now takes like 10 seconds because the, or it can be like half an hour if you wanna iterate, right? Because typically you quality assure, you go back and then you try again and you kind of give feedback to the AI as you&#8217;re working with ChatGPT, for example. And so at Nansen, one of our goals this quarter is to just collectively spend 5,000 hours working with AI. And the reason we set that goal was I realized that a lot of people don&#8217;t actually have the gut reflex of trying AI first for a task because you&#8217;re not used to that, right? Like you&#8217;re used to just doing stuff yourself, but we have to train people to say like, hey, I&#8217;m writing a, I&#8217;m trying to make a list of strategic accounts that our sales team wants to go after, for example. That&#8217;s like, can you use AI to do that? And it turns out absolutely you can, like me and our senior manager of Radley Ops yesterday, we&#8217;re spending like two, three hours literally with ChatGPT building out a list of 500 target account lists to go after. And he saved us an insane amount of time just doing that, right? And so the surprising thing is that you can use AI and I would say in particular ChatGPT for so many things. And even now I&#8217;ve been using it extremely actively the last six months, even now I&#8217;m realizing every day that like, wow, it&#8217;s actually pretty good at this thing here. Like if I prompt it in the right way and if I give it constructive and clear feedback if it does deliver on my expectations. Anyway, so I think. If we get the team to spend 5,000 hours, that works out to about four hours a week per person, that&#8217;s 10% of their time, right? Then you will have built up a bit of a gut reflex to think like, in my area, this is an area where AI is great and super helpful. It increases my output by like 10x or 100x in some cases. And then once you get the next quarter, because we plan orders through objectives and key results and so on, OKRs. And when you get the next quarter, we can start looking at, let&#8217;s look at the outputs and the outcomes we&#8217;re creating with AI. But for now, I just want to focus on the input. It&#8217;s like, put as many hours as you can into the process of working with AI. And then the best is that good things will come from that. So yeah, so basically like those are the two areas, right? To innovate on the product, make a radically better product. And specifically for us, that&#8217;s about kind of creating great interfaces to the data on Linux powered by AI, as well as deepening our data mode. And then there&#8217;s the organizational productivity piece where there are many principles. Like one principle is, why AI first? Another principle is make AI a team member. Like you should literally think of AI as team members. Like, hey, did you invite this AI to the meeting? Did you share the documents with the AI, right? Did you give the AI enough context to be helpful, to solve this problem? You kind of have to shift your mental model towards this not being software, but it&#8217;s like another team member, which is kind of weird and a bit science fiction, but I think we are actually there where it makes sense to work with AI in this way. So yeah, it doesn&#8217;t answer your question on specifically AI for crypto, but that&#8217;s at least how we think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I absolutely love that. You sort of fired me up there a little. I&#8217;m not going to lie too. I feel like you&#8217;re the kind of CEO where someone&#8217;s like, Hey, Alex, I need X amount of dollars for this AI subscription. You&#8217;re just like, you chuck the Amex at him.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Specifically for AI, for sure. I mean, like the reality is it&#8217;s more expensive to not have a ChatGPT subscription than it is to have one. It&#8217;s like way more expensive not to have it because you&#8217;re ending up spending a bunch of time on stuff that the AI could be helping you with and doing a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Do you know how many people and clients I talk to who still don&#8217;t use it every single day, who don&#8217;t have a GPT-4 subscription, where I&#8217;m just like, I can barely remember a year ago when this was not, you know, like I almost forget about life before it. And it&#8217;s one. Yeah, so you use it yourself. It&#8217;s in fact, every, I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s bookmarked. I mean, I don&#8217;t use the bookmark anymore because it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s such a habit of just, you know, Google Chrome, C H A, boom, that just pops, you know what I mean? It&#8217;s just wild how it works. That&#8217;s a good sign. Yeah, shout out Sam Altman, OpenAI and the team. You guys are incredible. Nansen Query, this was quite the launch. I mean, just enterprise ready blockchain data, doing it all currently supporting Arbitrum, Avalanche Base, Bitcoin, Dash, Doge, Ethereum, Solana, Terra, you name it. You guys are doing, doing it all. I would love to read this and give everyone the lowdown, but you can do a much better elevator pitch than I can, so I&#8217;m going to throw the ball over to your end of the court. What exactly is Nansen Query and why is it so powerful? And I&#8217;d love you to explain how much help it is giving to big, large enterprises.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, so the best story here is basically, we built the best on-chain analytics product for investors, right? And in doing that, we realized that, hey, we basically have built the most powerful data platform that powers this product. Why don&#8217;t we give access to that underlying data platform directly? It&#8217;s a bit like the kind of Amazon and AWS plane, right? Amazon builds a retail store, they have all the infrastructure, and then why don&#8217;t we just sell access to the infrastructure? And so that was the thought process behind Nansen Query. And we had many customers asking us to offer programmatic access to your data and so on. And so that&#8217;s really what Nansen Query solves. And we also realized that crypto is cool because you can get access to lots of data through APIs, often for free or very cheap. But the problem is that a lot of that stuff is not necessarily enterprise grade, and it&#8217;s not something you would want to kind of build your business on top of, whether that&#8217;s like products or trading algorithms and things like that. And so we had a real focus of making sure that this was enterprise grade, and we had the highest quality data, that we have unique data sets that you cannot get anywhere else, that we had extremely broad coverage of chains, and then also higher order things like DEXs, NFT marketplaces, and so on. And then overall, the platform itself was very performant with the best uptime and the fastest load time and things like that. So that&#8217;s how we ended up building Nansen Query. And I think where we&#8217;ve had the most success is surveying the kind of top tier crypto teams in the space, like an OpenSea or Arbitrum or Consensus, Binance, Coinbase, like the kind of really great teams that realize that maybe having like a data platform and having all these data pipelines in house is not a great idea because it just distracts us from our core mission, right? Like Coinbase is not a data company. You know, it wants to increase the economic freedom in the world and primarily, of course, they do that through offering a great exchange. And so instead of them spending a ton of time internally building out stuff, it&#8217;s actually much more economical to just buy this from us, right? So that&#8217;s the kind of basic premise of why we built Nansen Query and where we&#8217;ve had the most success. I also feel like it is a space where, you know, it&#8217;s great to have a few different alternatives for customers, right? You do wanna have kind of either free or cheap options for like hobbyists and so on. That&#8217;s not quite where we play with this offering. Like we figured let&#8217;s just focus on the kind of production grade and sort of enterprise tier customer segment. That&#8217;s kind of where we wanna play. And that&#8217;s where we think we will succeed the most. And then we will let other companies focus more on kind of the more downstream and broader pool of customers. So that&#8217;s where it is today. I think there&#8217;s still, and we support like 25 different chains. You mentioned some of them earlier. Like I said, we have unique data sets that are powered by, for example, our wallet label data, which makes it possible for people to create really unique insights that you can&#8217;t get anywhere else. And increasingly we are going to be focusing more on like the API endpoints surrounding this. So what we&#8217;ve learned is that, you know, we do have a user interface where you can just go in and write SQL queries, announce a query. You can create dashboards, charts, share them with your team, all this stuff. But we realized that many people actually just want to get the data where they are, right? So that&#8217;s why we added, well, like we have support for Google BigQuery, which is a data warehouse technology such that if you are already on that same technology, you can literally get all of our data sets in your data warehouse immediately. And so we&#8217;re exploring how we can do that with other data warehouse and technologies like Snowflake and so on. And of course, creating better API endpoints. But yeah, that&#8217;s basically what Nansen Query is. I think for those who are listening, there might be more investor types. So this is more like if you&#8217;re actually, you know, building a company, building a product, then this is a great product to explore.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Nansen Query&#8217;s for the Big Dogs, and Nansen 2, which we&#8217;ll get into is for the investors. And we&#8217;ll get into that in one second, but until then, we&#8217;ve got to give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Last year, you guys launched Nansen 2. AI functionalities, which to my knowledge was sort of the big sexy part of the launch. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t love that? Just reconstructed from its foundations, smart segments, more signals, you name it. Walk me through Nansen 2 and how you guys launched that because that was pretty spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, so I think, again, just to kind of go back to the backstory of why we went Nansen 2, it was actually started because we realized that the tech stack we had were giving us a little bit of headaches, both in terms of being able to shift new features, as well as the performance that I was talking about earlier was kind of giving us some issues. We felt like it wasn&#8217;t loading fast enough and things like that. And so what we decided to do was to rebuild the whole product from the ground up. Of course, we could still make use of lots of the great work on the data platform side of things, but even though we had some improvements we wanted to make. So the kind of impetus for why we wanted to create an obstacle was mostly around our own ability to just shift new features fast and also make sure our customers had a really snappy experience when they used the product. It felt a little bit clunky and slow. That was some of the feedback we&#8217;ve been getting from users over the years. But then when we decided to do that, we also thought, hey, this is a great chance for us to really level up the user experience more broadly and also to shift some of these innovative features that we had been dreaming of building for a long time that we had been struggling with because of the old tech stack. And so now from the user&#8217;s perspective, when you start using Nansen 2, I think especially if you&#8217;re familiar with Nansen 1, what you will notice right away is first of all, it&#8217;s just way faster and it&#8217;s like a hundred times faster in some cases. If you click on either you&#8217;re using a profiler, which allows you to look up a wallet or even a cluster of wallets or an entity like a Binance or a three arrows or Alavida or what have you, you can do that and it loads super quickly and it gives you that overview that people expect from Nansen 1 that you get the soothing capabilities that you want and it loads super fast. So that&#8217;s the first part. The second part is the user experience, as I said before, is just a lot more streamlined. So in Nansen 1, you needed to know which dashboard to go to if you wanted to do something and that was kind of inhibiting for a lot of people. It&#8217;s like, do I use NFT God Mode, NFT Paradise, like what&#8217;s the dashboard I need to be using to just answer this question? And we&#8217;ve kind of abstracted all of that away to the point where if you go into Nansen 2 today, you just smash command K, which brings us the search bar and you just input whatever it is you need. You paste in a wallet address, you write Pudgy Penguins or an entity collection, you write the symbol of a token, you write the name of an entity like a Binance or Coinbase, whatever, and we just take you to the right screen. So it feels like kind of a trivial thing, but it is actually a huge improvement in the user experience. You don&#8217;t have to think too much about how to get from A to B. Maybe there&#8217;s an analogy where we&#8217;re going back to the Singapore story on like we just want to make things very efficient. You don&#8217;t want this bureaucracy and a maze of stuff, you just want to go straight to the point and that&#8217;s what we helped users do. And then the last thing is the innovative features that I mentioned and the probably the two most loved features that we have shipped with Nansen 2 are signals, which is kind of like a feed. So if you don&#8217;t have a very clear idea of what you&#8217;re looking for, you can just go into signals and you get a feed almost like a Twitter feed and it just surfaces anomalous events from the blockchain. So like here&#8217;s a token that had 100 times the amount of centralized exchange inflow that it normally has. Maybe you should look at that. Maybe there&#8217;s something going on there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>So it&#8217;s gold nuggets.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know what I should be looking at today. Let me just check out the feed and maybe I&#8217;ll just find something interesting. And then you can drill down from there, right? So the mission of our company is to surface the signal and create winners in the future of finance. And so this is literally what that feature does. It just surfaces the signal for you because there&#8217;s so much stuff happening on chain, especially with 20 plus different chains that you support. So, and that&#8217;s AI powered as well. It&#8217;s like the stuff that the AI thinks you should look at because it is anomalous somehow is what&#8217;s going to show up in that sheet. So that&#8217;s the signal. The second feature is smart segments, which, you know, like I said, like you mentioned before, we have hundreds of millions of wallet labels, right? That&#8217;s one of the things that we are known for. But we also realized that we don&#8217;t want to be the bottleneck for people to create their own wallet labels and groups of wallets. And so we created this feature called smart segments where you can decide your own criteria of wallets. You can say, hey, I want to look at every wallet that made at least, you know, 10 ETHs and profits trading Board Apes. And you just put that in as your criteria. And now you get a little segment of the, let&#8217;s call it, you know, 80 wallets that did that. I support a little more, few hundred wallets that did that. And that segment, you can now profile them collectively in the sense that like, what other things are they doing? Which tokens do they own, NFTs, which transactions have they made in real time as a segment collectively. And you can pull that segment into, you know, the other parts of Nansen. Like you can filter using the segment if you&#8217;re looking at a specific token or NFT. And so, yeah, this is another, I think, super powerful feature that we have shipped in a basic form, but it&#8217;s going to get a lot more powerful in the next weeks. And of course, yeah, a lot of these things, like I said in the beginning, are AI powered, right? Everything from the search to signals, to of course, a lot of stuff that happens on the backend with regards to the attribution and labeling of addresses. Even I think the congestion of data will over time become more AI supported, because you may not want to have data engineers spend a ton of time writing kind of transformer code and parsing code. It probably makes sense to have AI support for that as well. That&#8217;s the summary of what Nansen 2 does. But it&#8217;s early days still. And I think if you&#8217;ve tried it, you kind of will see a material improvement from Nansen 1, but you should also know that this is early and we have a ton of really exciting features coming out this year for it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Alex, you&#8217;ve been on a roll. I wish you had more time here, man. This has been too much fun. A couple more questions and we&#8217;ll wrap up. Success story. I don&#8217;t know if you can tell me or not. I know the listeners would absolutely love this, but someone along the way must have used Nansen to find a specific signal and made an absolute shit ton of money. And we, on behalf of all the listeners and everyone at Cryptonews, we would love if you could give us just a little tiny, incy story of maybe someone. You don&#8217;t need to drop names, but just like the Board Ape example you said, where someone found something, bet a shit ton on it, and made an even bigger shit ton. I&#8217;d love you could give us a little nugget of gold here.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, there are a few different ones. Probably the most famous one is MEDCollector, which is a Twitter account. And he wrote a thread about how he made an insane amount of money flipping NFTs using Nansen. I can&#8217;t remember the exact numbers. I think it might&#8217;ve been something like 10 ETH to 800 ETH or something ETH flipping NFTs using Nansen. And by the way, just to be very clear, that&#8217;s, to his credit, he is the hero. We are just kind of the, like he is Batman. We are the Batmobile, right? Like he is the guy actually doing it. We&#8217;re just a tool. But the cool thing was he was not doing that on just one bat, right? He was doing it consistently and just grew the portfolio. So that&#8217;s incredible. And I&#8217;ve met them in person, which is cool. There&#8217;s also another story of one of our customers who I think put 500 bucks on a token that they discovered in Nansen and turned it into one and a half million dollars. There&#8217;s also a tweet that&#8217;s out there and we have it in some of our marketing material because it is pretty amazing. And then there are of course many other examples. There&#8217;s another one where there was a fund that had a lot of money, like hundreds of millions of dollars in anchor when the Terra thing was happening. And they had set up Nansen smart alerts so that they got notifications when liquidity was being drained from the curve pools. And because of those notifications, they also exited the curve pools and basically saved probably like maybe hundreds of miles, at least tens of millions of dollars were saved because they were able to get out fast enough. And they have told me that the smart alerts basically saved them.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>They owe you a dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yes, yeah. It&#8217;s not only kind of the moonshot shit coins that go 1000X. It can also be used for like defensive purposes to make sure that they don&#8217;t lose their money, right? So yeah, and there are a ton of other stories but those are three that come to mind for now.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s so cool. Alex, absolute treat. Thank you so much for coming on. This was a blast. I can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two. This was too much fun and we barely scratched the surface. You also had some electric stories that you told me before the pod. And folks, we will save those for round two because Alex, I mean, you would be up there for one of the people to have, probably not one, but maybe one dozen pints with and shoot the shit over some crypto stories. But we&#8217;ll have to wait until next time. Until then, wishing you and the team all the best. Before you let us go, please let us all know where everyone can find you personally and Nansen online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Yeah, so the best is to go to www.nansen.ai to try out our products. You can also find me on Twitter, @ASvanevik, just look for a very cute Pudgy Penguin. You can also find Nansen&#8217;s Twitter account @nansen_aiSo thanks for having me, Matt. It was great to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Hey, pudgies have been ripping. I know you&#8217;ve been calling that for a while, but no free ads on the podcast, but we&#8217;re going to give them one. Why do they ripen so much? What&#8217;s the deal with pudgies here?</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>You know, I used to say three Cs, but it&#8217;s actually now four Cs, cute community content. For example, they have like 10 billion views on DFC and they have more than one million followers on Instagram. But the fourth C is also the CEO, Luca, right? Luca is a fucking amazing operator and one of the truly great ones in crypto and he&#8217;s like 26 years old or something. Really an incredible operator. I&#8217;m actually helping on a call with him now in four minutes. So it&#8217;s the four Cs. That&#8217;s why Pudgy is doing so well, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Four C&#8217;s, I love it. Alex, thanks again, man. Really appreciate it, and can&#8217;t wait for next time.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Svanevik<br />
</strong>Thank you so much, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, still coming in hot from Mexico. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have the one and only Bobby Zagotta back on for round two. He crushed it the first time. It was too good. We had to have him on for round two and today we have him. Even though you guys know who he is, I&#8217;m going to give him one intro just to tickle all of your fancies. We got Bobby Zagotta on the show today. As I said, US CEO and Chief Commercial Officer at Bitstamp. Before Bitstamp, he came from Kraken where he served as Chief Commercial Officer responsible for strategy, business, marketing, M&amp;A, research, analytics, global growth, a bit of everything. Before that, he was Senior Managing Director of Strategy and Execution and a member of the executive team at the CME Group, a global publicly traded financial exchange. As CEO of the Americas and Global Chief Commercial Officer at Bitstamp, Bobby is responsible for strategy and growing the presence and business globally, as well as overseeing day to day ops in the Americas, super tied into everything regulatory, Bitcoin ETF, and crypto as a whole. Super pumped to have you back on. Bobby, welcome back to show my friend. How you Doing?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Awesome. It&#8217;s great to be here. And I wish I was in Mexico with you. That would be even better</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I know, before the show, you and I were shooting the show a little. You are also a big fan of Cenotes. How incredible are Cenotes? What a treat they are.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>You know, we stumbled on them on a trip a few years back where it was on the side of a highway. And I was like, what is this? And we pulled off and it changed my life. It was like getting into another world. And then we became quite focused on them. And we hit them all over the area when we were down there by Playa Del Carmen. And yeah, they&#8217;re amazing. They&#8217;re absolutely amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s crazy. Mexico is one of these places, the more time you spend here, the more just insane you realize it is. They have these Cenotes everywhere, and I could be wrong. I don&#8217;t even know if there&#8217;s one Cenote in USA.I&#8217;m pretty darn sure there&#8217;s none in Canada. We have some beautiful lakes, like obviously BAMP with that turquoise, baby blue glacier like with the mountains in the background. It&#8217;s absolutely stunning. One of the few countries you have that. But Mexico has the Cenotes. They have all these ruins, they have the day of the dead. You have Chichen Itza, which is the pyramid that just like, how the hell was that thing built? No one knows. It&#8217;s a pretty wild place, and it would be pretty sweet. Any chance Bitstamp throws up a Playa Del Carmen office? Would you let your boy run that one for you?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Absolutely, yeah, I&#8217;ll put that on the agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Crypto in Mexico. Funny note, Crypto in Mexico, I was here last year as well. And the amount of places that now accept Bitcoin and Tether is actually pretty wild. It&#8217;s still not a lot, but when you take a walk down Fifth Ave, you&#8217;re seeing a hell of a lot more last weekend, you know, spend some time out with friends, bunch of Argentinians, and they were telling us as well, and Buenos Aires almost 25%, 33% of places now accept Tether and Bitcoin as well, because the currency is so bad. And it&#8217;s pretty wild to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, no, I think about it a lot. I mean, Latin America has a different use case basically and it&#8217;s a natural fit because of what you mentioned. The economic environment there and the level of trust in their institutions is very different than in the US or Canada, right? So here I think people look at Bitcoin as recreational or a potential investment, et cetera. But in many parts of Latin America, it&#8217;s much more than that. It&#8217;s a lifeline and it&#8217;s a means for very hardworking people to preserve their wealth versus watch it tumble in value based on bad policies or bad institutions or other factors. So yeah, I am not surprised to see that it&#8217;s becoming a little bit more an element of commerce there and I&#8217;m super excited about it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s another wild thing too. We were with a group of Argentinians. 80% of them had a crypto app on their phone. Most of them had Binance, but that&#8217;s literally what they use. Like when they get paid here in Mexico, they get paid, they transfer over to Binance, transfer it to another account and withdrawal and the blue dollar, whatever the heck that is in Argentina. I don&#8217;t even know. There&#8217;s like a regular Argentinian peso, then a blue dollar and a regular dollar. It couldn&#8217;t really, anyways, we were sort of into one as well. So we won&#8217;t dive into that, but just always interesting to think because when I&#8217;m in Toronto or with family and friends or visiting family and friends in the States and unless I&#8217;m with someone who is orange-pilled and is in the crypto sphere, like no one ever messes around on a day to day basis. And we have people here where it&#8217;s become part of the life. So pretty darn cool to see. But Bobby, you just jumped into Bitcoin there. I think we must. It would be a disservice to not jump into this. We had the Bitcoin ETF. The news was great, but the price action and sentiment is not exactly what we wanted to see.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, I mean, well, firstly, there&#8217;s no underestimating what a historic event this is. And a lot of people are saying this, but it really is true. This is a level of credibility and validation that has been lacking globally and specifically in the US. So that is super significant. And then of course, the access by new segments, segments who have been on the sidelines and waiting for the regulatory cover and kind of the process that they&#8217;re familiar with, such as an ETF process. That just represents a lot more capital coming into the ecosystem, which creates momentum and creates opportunities. So super positive and super historic. Now, I didn&#8217;t expect a massive spike in Bitcoin price or in all of our volumes, et cetera, as much as I expected supported growth over the next few quarters. Because if you are a pension fund or a large asset manager who has been waiting for this moment to get involved, it&#8217;s not like you just flip a switch. There&#8217;s work to do there. And to get all of the kind of research done and positioning with their customers and whatnot. And so I expect that the real benefit here will be felt over a period of time. And same thing on the retail side, like the direct retail side, this is noteworthy for them to, even if they&#8217;re not as likely to buy ETF shares as they are to go on an exchange and buy Bitcoin directly and want to hold it and want to custody the actual asset. I think many of them see this as like, all right, I&#8217;ve been maintaining a sliver of investment here, but now it&#8217;s time to increase and to double down a bit. So yeah, from a Bit stand perspective, we&#8217;re definitely feeling it in terms of being a primary liquidity provider for many of the authorized participants or authorized partners for that ecosystem. And we&#8217;re excited about it. I think the price action with Bitcoin right now is just a little bit of a hangover from, perhaps inflated expectations that it was going to be a massive spike in bull rally.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve been seeing so many rumors online and again, you gotta take these with a grain of salt, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard about this grayscale price action where it&#8217;s like so many people are getting out of grayscale and for that to happen, they need to sell Bitcoin, therefore price of Bitcoin is dropping so then they can get into the ETFs. Is any of this true or is this all just blah?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve seen those rumors as well. And I don&#8217;t, I think any kind of new major, multi-billion dollar investment tool and or ecosystem is going to have to find its sea level, if you will, because there&#8217;s a lot of new entrants and there&#8217;s a lot of people who&#8217;ve been waiting for this moment to get out and other things. So I don&#8217;t put much credence into long-term effects or market flaws, if you will. I just think it&#8217;s gotta find its C level and then start growing.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, well said there. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about Bitstamps&#8217; relationship with the ETF providers and how you guys are, again, just really providing regulatory light, not just for lack of better words, qualitative help, a quantitative help. You guys are a reputable exchange, obviously, and you&#8217;re supplying a lot of market data, a lot of surveillance to these ETF providers. They&#8217;re coming to you for advice. How are you guys working with them? How is this whole relationship, working on your end of the spectrum?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s working very well. And to your point, when a particular authorized partner is servicing BlackRock or a very large scale, super reputable ETF provider or issuer, it does raise the stakes for them a little bit to make sure everything&#8217;s buttoned up and that there&#8217;s no undo or unnecessary regulatory risk or other things. So Bitstamp comes to the fore in those situations typically because we have in general the most extensive licensing footprint and we&#8217;ve got a level of governance and in our company that&#8217;s not typical in the space. So you&#8217;ve heard me say some of this, but seven years of global financial audits by a big four accounting firm, that just doesn&#8217;t exist in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It doesn&#8217;t grow on trees.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, all kinds of ISO and other designations that we&#8217;ve got super professional governance, independent boards for all the entities. And it&#8217;s very much a compliance forward company and a compliance forward firm. And in the ETF side of the marketplace, that&#8217;s more important than it is on perhaps just the trading or speculating side. So yeah, we&#8217;re positioned very well as a liquidity provider for authorized partners to these issuers and certainly feeling that in a positive way in terms of volumes and opportunities related to it. Obviously the market is in this kind of funny moment right now, but still much better condition in my estimation than this time last quarter. When we were in kind of September, October, that was a very subdued market. And this is already a step function better than that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;d love to just keep us on this subject for a bit more and then we&#8217;ll get into some other stuff But I did tell the story on the pod a couple pods ago and I just love your two cents on this my buddy was at Atlanta Airport and flight got delayed had to go to a different terminal. And in two different terminals he saw an ad I want to say one was from grayscale and one was from or not grayscale one was from Valkyrie and the other may have been from BlackRock or someone else. But these ETFs are already pumping out ads in places with stupendous amount of foot traffic like Atlanta Airport, which is a Canadian I&#8217;m not sure but I&#8217;m pretty sure it might be the busiest airport in close to the world if not USA which is crazy. If you&#8217;re a consumer or if you&#8217;re a fund manager or or even just a financial advisor. And you&#8217;re getting your high net worth clients into these exchange or into these ETFs. Is it a simple pick is like a go for whoever has the lowest fee go for whoever&#8217;s doing the most social good and giving back 10 ticks to the Bitcoin miners like how do you feel about the ads already being out? I friggin love it personally and two if you were to advise, you know a consumer on which one to choose. What would what would you do and how would you tell them, you know the right one to pick?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, no, great question. I&#8217;m also excited to see the ads. And these guys have had a few years to prepare, unfortunately, because the approval took so long. But yeah, I think a lot of people, just individual consumers, as well as investment professionals working for companies, when they see ETF, it is familiar to them as their own kind of thumbprint. And so, they&#8217;ve probably been thinking, I really am curious about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. I really would like to add something to my portfolio that is a little bit less correlated, perhaps, to the stock market. But you know what, I&#8217;m not gonna take the time to figure out how to custody this and how to do it safely, which platform to operate in. I&#8217;m not gonna spend that kind of time. But when they see an ETF opportunity, they&#8217;re like, okay, now I&#8217;m ready. This makes it easy for me. I&#8217;ve already got gold ETFs, and I&#8217;ve already done this. I&#8217;ve been just a well trod path for me. I&#8217;m just gonna add Bitcoin to it and get my feet wet. So that&#8217;s kind of the macro sediment, obviously. But within that, there&#8217;s a lot of different types of players. To your point, some who might like, hey, that&#8217;s a cool ad, I&#8217;m gonna go with Valkyrie. Others who might be like, you know what? The only thing that&#8217;s meaningful to me is BlackRock or Fidelity. Like guys who are at such a scale and at such a reputation that I feel very safe. So I&#8217;m just gonna go there. And then I think there&#8217;s a significant part of the kind of target segment here that just wants to learn and wants to do the research. And what I would recommend to answer your question is, yeah, look at the prospectus. You understand the differences in pricing. I&#8217;ve seen some good articles that lay it all out, all the different offerings, and make a decision. I think they&#8217;re all, if they&#8217;re approved, which they are, that means that they&#8217;re fairly safe and reliable. And so I think you can have the luxury of choice, but do the homework and see which one feels right to you.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah DYOR, do your own research, one of the best, but most underused acronyms in all of crypto and investing. Let&#8217;s keep buzzing on Bitcoin, the halving. Everyone thinks April, to look in like April, if we go on this sort of current trend that we&#8217;re at, I&#8217;ve had some incredible guests on the Podcast over the last three months. And I wanna say it&#8217;s almost, three years ago, this would have been 100% as in the halving is going to be the best thing ever for Bitcoin. Now I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s almost 75, 25, 80, 20, maybe even 66, 33. A lot of folks, people who I trust and people who are much smarter than me and much more switched on in this space, are in the camp of it&#8217;s not going to have the biggest impact as it has over the last couple of halvings. What&#8217;s your take on this? Or is it still gonna help? Is this overvalued? Is it already priced in? What&#8217;s gonna happen with the halving? And I guess by the time this episode airs, really three months give or take.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I do think it&#8217;s gonna help, but I also agree with what you&#8217;re saying. It&#8217;s a little bit different sediment today than perhaps it felt like a few years ago. And I think that&#8217;s mostly a function of the space maturing. And people, particularly given the kind of tumultuous ride over the last 18 months, you know, are a little bit less ready to hype stuff, hype event driven stuff, and rather focus on the more fundamental aspects of this now fairly mature marketplace. And so I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s negative or positive, but I think that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s playing out here. And that&#8217;s how I think about it. I cannot fully understand the relationship between the halving and the market effect. I can&#8217;t map it, but I can appreciate history, right? And the history is quite clear and quite compelling about the relationship between halving and price increase for Bitcoin, usually with about a six month gap, right? But between those two things. So I&#8217;m not one to count it out, but I&#8217;m also not one to ever assume some kind of flipping of the switch, spike, bull run, you know, everything changes. I just think it&#8217;s going to be another brick in the wall, if you will, of the foundation of a solid and growing marketplace. And so yeah, I&#8217;m enthusiastic. I think in addition to, you know, the ETF and more institutional involvement, et cetera, it&#8217;s just going to be a momentum creator, which is good.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s exactly what we need. Last time we spoke, you did call this. And you did say that the Bitcoin ETF did need to happen. And if it did, it would have positive impact on the market. And from a sentiment perspective, I believe it has, obviously the price has fallen. Do we know if it&#8217;s exactly from that? Could it be grayscale? Could it be something else? None of us will ever know. What else needs to happen, Bobby, from a perhaps regulatory standpoint? Is there one of the few people who actually have the wherewithal and the experience and the switched on is to comment on this. Are there any other regulatory steps or building blocks that need to happen, short-term, long-term, for this momentum to really keep building? Any events, perhaps the election in November, is there anything else that could really help us that might be coming up in the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yes, absolutely. And, but I&#8217;ll start in the negative, right? So the uncertainty, this is my feeling, the uncertainty related to regulation in the US and the macro political environment in the US because the election is coming up. That uncertainty is really, I think, an anchor or a bit of a drag on progress and momentum in the marketplace today. So, my hope is that there can be some positive movement on regulation in the US this year. Now, that&#8217;s a tall order, given it&#8217;s an election year and everything. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a given, but I&#8217;m wondering if Congress can act on stable coins, for instance, one piece of the puzzle that is super relevant right now and in my estimation, easier to operate on from a legal framework perspective. That would really help. That would really be another momentum booster. And then the election is gonna happen one way or another in November. And will that be favorable to the market or not? We don&#8217;t know, but what we do know or what we believe is that clarity, more certainty is gonna help one way or another. We&#8217;re seeing this in Europe already. So in Europe, I&#8217;m just the regulatory front, they&#8217;re a little bit ahead in my estimation, right? Because the European Union has adopted the MiCA framework which will come into play at the end of the year. And that certainty or that clarity is allowing more institutions in particular, but more individuals as well get involved with a level of comfort and a level of confidence. And it&#8217;s starting to shape the conversations there in a way that&#8217;s not happening here yet. And how we&#8217;re feeling that mostly is, for instance, we have this white label offering, good stamp as a service, I think I mentioned to you last time, but it&#8217;s focused on institutions, banks and fintechs. And those companies are quite, we&#8217;re engaged with many of them right now who want to be able to offer crypto services to their customers for all the obvious reasons. Like they don&#8217;t want their customers leaving their ecosystem or their app to buy some Bitcoin. They&#8217;d rather keep them in their ecosystem and offer that service, but they&#8217;re not gonna build it at this stage. So they turn to a very regulated, long track record, very reliable technology kind of company, like Bitstamp to help provide that. In the US, banking and crypto are not sympatico today. And there&#8217;s a lot of frictions that have been put in place. And so it&#8217;s just at a very different spot. So to answer your question, if we could get a little bit more regulatory clarity in the US, that&#8217;s the missing link, if you will, for me, to really get the entire global marketplace to a next level.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s true. What&#8217;s that famous quote? If you don&#8217;t know the rules, you can&#8217;t play the game, something like that. Again, if there&#8217;s no rules, the big boys can&#8217;t get in. Do you guys white labeling that&#8217;s, I know we did discuss this a little bit last time, but I&#8217;d love to jump back into this. What exactly are you just really giving them exactly what they&#8217;re looking for? And I understand that this, you know, it doesn&#8217;t happen that much in the US it&#8217;s more Bitstamp global. As you just discussed because of the regulatory shit show in the States, but is this just financial extitute or institution X, Y or Z coming in and saying we want to keep, you know, we want to keep our people in our ecosystem and we need solution ABC. And you guys go look, we are, you know, we&#8217;re KYC&#8217;d and regulatory it up to Yin Yang and we&#8217;re going to give you what you want. You give it to them. They slap their label on it and boom, it&#8217;s just a good product, good relationships. That&#8217;s how it works for lack of better understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah I mean, in essence or at its core, it&#8217;s exactly that. But there&#8217;s a couple of nuances. First of all, we have different levels of offering. Some are like, you know, full white label, turnkey solution that a bank can just adopt. Others are kind of gradations of it. But what&#8217;s notable is, you know, these are some of the largest global banks in the world based in Europe that we&#8217;re in deep conversations with about this. And so, you know, that&#8217;s very noteworthy when you think about the overall crypto ecosystem. And these banks, of course, I can&#8217;t speak for them, but based on the work that we are proposing to do with them, you know, it&#8217;s exactly that. They want to be able to enable their millions of customers to just simply buy and sell, you know, it&#8217;s nothing exotic, but buy and sell, you know, the majors, the major cryptocurrencies in a simple, safe, reliable way. And so, you know, we&#8217;re kind of in Europe in particular, which is our home base and our, you know, kind of strongest marketplace. We&#8217;re a pretty obvious choice for that. And we&#8217;re excited. And there&#8217;s other related, you know, flavors of this, including with payments providers, you know, we&#8217;re in conversations with a couple of the world&#8217;s largest payment providers because they want to make it easier for their millions of clients to utilize crypto in their payments processes. And so, you know, these, if you just take those two, you know, possibilities, you know, that could really in Europe take the entire ecosystem, you know, to a next level. So, I&#8217;m anxious to, you know, for the rest of the world and specifically the US to get caught up.</p>

I was going to ask you about consensus, but I saw you take a big swig of what I assume is water out of that super nice looking bottle. Are you on the Stanley wave? Are you on the Stanley wave that&#8217;s absolutely blown up everywhere? Have you heard about this nonsense?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I don&#8217;t think I have. But it is water. Is that what it&#8217;s about?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I mean, this is like, this is pretty, you know, it&#8217;s TikToky, Instagramy, trendiness Stanley the cup company, the Tumblr, you know, keep your drink cold or warm. They&#8217;re thermos, yeah, they&#8217;re absolutely blowing up for no good reason. Just, it&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s just like, in today&#8217;s day and age, you get lucky for going viral. I had to ask if you had one. I don&#8217;t have one. I&#8217;m seeing people down here, mostly American and Canadian tourists, you know, showing off multiple Stanley mugs. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s like wearing a Rolex now to show it&#8217;s crazy. Some lady in California stole like 60 of them and was going to resell them on like just nonsense. Little off topic, but I guess one more thing on that note is you and I are hockey fans. The Stanley cup for the first time and like, you know, since SEO was invented in, I don&#8217;t know, the late nineties got outranked. So when you search Stanley cup, it is no longer Lord Stanley, the, you know, the hardest trophy to win in all of sports for hockey, the national hockey league. Now you have some crummy tumbler. Just what is our world succumbing to?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>That is wrong on so many levels. I don&#8217;t even know where to start.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Brutal. Let&#8217;s jump back in. As my duty, I always have to lurk my guest Twitter. And a couple days ago, you fired off a tweet that you are excited to share, that you are proposing a panel, DeFi for Capital Markets at Consensus. This seems super cool. You guys are obviously in the DeFi space as well, and especially in capital markets. That&#8217;s where we can really move the needle, not just retail. I feel like most of DeFi&#8217;s retail at the moment. Part of that is because, again, the complexities, the nuances, the account abstraction, it&#8217;s such a nightmare. It is truly just horrendously difficult to use. I&#8217;ll never forget the first time I dabbled with MetaMask or tried bridging coins or did anything of the like. It was nightmare fuel in the purest sense. What exactly is this DeFi for Capital Markets panel that you are proposing at Consensus 2024?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting and I couldn&#8217;t agree more. It&#8217;s kind of like, I think the right topic for this time for 2024. There&#8217;s so many dimensions to the DeFi opportunity and ecosystem, but the thing that is a still, a common denominator is it&#8217;s just a little bit too hard for institutions and individuals to participate. And it&#8217;s associated with risk also, so I think it&#8217;s a little bit different kind of risk profile than operating with a centralized exchange or other platform, and that requires more education. So the real question here is, when does that really quite incredibly innovative space, the DeFi space become more legit and integrated with the rest of the traditional financial services, capital markets space? And I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s gonna happen tomorrow, but I think it&#8217;s something that we need to be thinking about and talking about. So some very smart people put together this concept and this panel and were nice enough to include me in it. And, but yeah, super excited, but I guess we have to be chosen, right? It has to be somebody, people have to go and vote for this panel. So I encourage your audience to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>On the subject of 2024 trends, speaking of trends, are there any other trends, micro, macro, will stay away from any of the price prediction nonsense? But are there any other trends that are really getting you going again, or not even a month into the year? A lot of people, myself included, are bullish for a lack of better terms on this year. We have a lot of things that went in the right direction. Of course, the ETF just popped off. It should be good. The Fed also sort of said that there will be some rate cuts this year, and that usually goes hand in hand with good things for the economy. What trends do you see for 2024 that could take us in the right direction?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I definitely agree with those couple. And then what I would add to that is, you know, there&#8217;s, what we&#8217;re seeing at Bitstamp is really strong onboarding for institutions and for retail investors. And that&#8217;s always a leading indicator of confidence in the marketplace. So even during the last half of 2023, we saw a lot of increases in onboarding, even though the marketplace was tough, the volatility was quite low. And to me, that&#8217;s like, okay, people are getting ready, particularly institutions, you know, there&#8217;s some lead time there once they get onboarded, integrated, et cetera. And so far in 2024, that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s accelerated. So, and, you know, November, December, January have been really good volatility months, which is a big part of it. But also I think the, this wave of adoption that I believe we are embarking on here in 2024 is a little bit different investor, whether it&#8217;s an institution or an individual, it&#8217;s a little bit different mindset. They&#8217;re not the pioneers, right? They&#8217;re not the super comfortable with risk perspectives. They&#8217;re arguably the fast followers or the followers, right? Once the path has been paved over a bit, now they&#8217;re getting involved. And what they care about is a little bit different than what the first couple of waves care about, right? They&#8217;re not all about whiz bang, you know, Silicon Valley tech kind of mindset. They&#8217;re about like, is it safe? Who&#8217;s the right partner? You know, what I&#8217;m gonna, I&#8217;m not afraid to do my homework, you know, kind of it&#8217;s a different audience. And I think a little bit more conservative in many respects. And so that&#8217;s where, you know, companies that Bitstamp our position quite well, because it&#8217;s, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a little bit of a fight to quality, you know, still happening given the Binance situation and of course the, you know, the FTX and the other situations prior to that. So this next, the other trend is this next wave of adoption is gonna be different. More hedge funds, more asset managers, more traditional financial services companies, not just hardcore traders. And, I think probably a little bit different demographic of individuals involved, which is great. The other trend I would mention is more generational, right? So I&#8217;ve been reading a lot lately about, about wealth transfer. And, you know, we are in the midst of the largest wealth transfer generationally from one generation to another in history of the world, right? So, and it&#8217;s something like 10 trillion, you know, dollars of value or something that&#8217;s going to move, you know, from essentially the baby boom generation to, you know, younger generations that are, you know, either crypto native or super mobile adaptive and people who can naturally relate to the idea of digital money versus where all the money&#8217;s fitting right now with the older generations where it&#8217;s not as natural for them to relate to digital money and all the possibilities associated with it. So that&#8217;s another thing that&#8217;s not gonna just play out in 2024 is gonna play out over the next several years, but it&#8217;s real and it&#8217;s big.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>That&#8217;s, I always forget about this well transfer thing. It&#8217;s crazy. Like it really is, and I guess it&#8217;s my, would it be my generation as someone who&#8217;s born in 95 who is like, we&#8217;re the ones getting all this money now, right? It&#8217;s coming from our parents and my parents, parents, my grandparents, I mean, one left. But, you know, it is my generation, the millennials who are about to get all this cake, right? Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Exactly, and Gen Z also, but millennials primarily. And it&#8217;s, I think part of it is also the baby boom generation has lived longer than past generations because of all the advances in healthcare and fitness, et cetera. So they&#8217;ve held on to it longer too, so it&#8217;s more pent up. Yeah, I mean, like we&#8217;ve got an election coming up. We might have two 80 year old guys that we&#8217;re, you know, having to choose between in the US. Like how does that happen? You know, this generation really clings to stuff. And I sometimes like to see them retire and take a well-deserved break on a beach somewhere, maybe in Playa del Carmen.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>That&#8217;d be great. Well, I mean, I know this isn&#8217;t a political podcast, but, you know, we got a drama teacher running our country. So it&#8217;s a, you can&#8217;t win them all. That&#8217;s a little off topic, but that&#8217;s something I often think about too, where it&#8217;s like the incentives of being at the top of the political food chain. I feel like with social media and everything else, the cons almost outweigh the pros nowadays. And again, obviously, and for the states for you guys, it&#8217;s most powerful, arguably best country in the world. Most freedom you guys, once you&#8217;re present of the United States, you are truly a geopolitical figure. You&#8217;re one of the most powerful people in the world until the day you die. And then your family gets to bear those fruits as well. But it&#8217;s like, why aren&#8217;t more quality people wanting to do this? Like, and use this social good, I feel like it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s changed. And it&#8217;s like, Oh, I&#8217;d rather be an influencer or be a TikToker or be rich, you know, it&#8217;s like, we need more people to get into, to get into high level politics and, and actually move the needle. And I know in Canada, we have, I&#8217;m not as, I don&#8217;t follow the states, obviously, as much as I follow my own country, but we literally have zero people in the pipeline, Bobby. And to my knowledge, in the States, you guys don&#8217;t have a whole lot of people either. And it&#8217;s something that sort of baffles my mind. Why wouldn&#8217;t you want to be the most powerful person in the world? It seems like a pretty frigging cool game, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>I know, I think about this a lot. And I think it&#8217;s true what you&#8217;re saying. I think for many potential great leaders, you know, and people who perhaps have a passion for that kind of social role and leadership opportunity, I think they get, you know, first of all, great opportunities in the business world, you know, and arguably the business world is another great leadership opportunity, you know, that it&#8217;s a capital L, if you can progress, it&#8217;s a really worthy and noble leadership opportunity, but very different than government. But it doesn&#8217;t come with all the cons of government like you alluded to, you know, it&#8217;s not, I&#8217;m sure, I haven&#8217;t done it, of course, but, you know, any kind of political role, you know, it&#8217;s not for the faint of heart, right? You get criticized, you know, 10 times a minute and your family gets scrutinized and, you know, your privacy is gone. And, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of cost. You gotta really want it and really believe, but because of this, I do fear that we don&#8217;t have the pipeline either. You know, it&#8217;s a little bit more complicated in this, I don&#8217;t know the Canadian frame of reference well, but in the States it&#8217;s quite complicated, you know, because I think there&#8217;s a lot of, you know, back room deal making where, you know, where perhaps the talent can&#8217;t break in. The talent, you know, maybe has a hard time bringing us a little bit too old school networks, et cetera. But I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, no, just building on your point about business. It&#8217;s like, if you can be a powerful businessman or woman and take a company public, make a couple of billion dollars, once you have a couple of billion, like there&#8217;s not much you can&#8217;t do in this world. You wanna buy an island, you wanna spend 500, you know, mil on a yacht, go for it. Like what can you not do, right? Wanna just fly private on multiple jets, wanna own a sports team. You can do whatever the hell you want without all the public scrutiny. So it&#8217;s like, it comes down to anything else in life. Life&#8217;s all about incentives. And I feel like we need to better incentivize, you know, the most powerful position in the world. But, you know, this isn&#8217;t the New York Times political podcast. So we&#8217;ll jump back to the crypto stuff. Bitstamp, you guys are shipping, you guys are always shipping. You guys are the king of shippers, just pumping out products at a crazy rate. We&#8217;d love to see that. What else do you guys have on the docket? I know you probably can&#8217;t tell me most of it, but of the things you can tell me, give me some gold here, Bobby. What are you guys up to over the next couple of months in 2024 for Bitstamp?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Sure. Well, we&#8217;re very excited. I&#8217;ll talk about retail and I&#8217;ll talk about institutions. Yeah, on the retail side, in 2023, we launched a new app experience that really is targeted at the types of users we were talking about earlier, this next wave of adoption. So, it&#8217;s a simple buy-sell experience, but it&#8217;s connected to our Learn Center so that people, it was a place people can go get educated in a very kind of bite-size and objective way, and then do simple transactions. And it&#8217;s in contrast to our Pro app, which is advanced order types and it&#8217;s really geared more towards traders and people who are very acquainted with the marketplace. So, that&#8217;s been great. We also have a lending offering available, not in the US, not in the UK, but in Europe and in Asia. It&#8217;s an opportunity for users to lend their crypto into a marketplace that is very highly organized and regulated and transparent so that they can earn a return or yield on that crypto. And this space a couple of years ago in the crypto ecosystem was a disaster. And, but it&#8217;s a place where Bitstamp can bring the Bitstamp version of it, which is regulated, transparent and super reliable. And so, that has grown quite a bit for us in its instance inception at the middle of last year. So, we are very excited about those two opportunities, fueling growth in 2024. We also think there&#8217;s some really interesting token projects out there, and we&#8217;re quite discerning about what we list on Bitstamp, but we think there&#8217;s some really interesting token projects out there that we&#8217;re evaluating. On the institutional side, we will have a fairly major announcement coming soon, but suffices to say, we want to give our institutional participants more ways to participate in crypto markets and participate with Bitstamp in our kind of safe, reliable way in crypto markets. So, that&#8217;s a primary focus with us. I wish I could tell you more, but coming soon. And then we&#8217;ve also launched an OTC offering in 2023 that we&#8217;re growing now. So, there&#8217;s an RFQ platform and also kind of a facilitation desk. So, this is, we just get a lot of requests from our client base and people who crypto whales or others who want to move size, and they&#8217;re smart enough about markets to know that that needs to be done in an orderly way, and we can make that turnkey for them. So, those are a few things we&#8217;re excited about.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Love that. Bobby, always appreciate you coming on man. We have a blast together and you always make my head spin in the best ways possible. Always leave me with some homework to do and I&#8217;m sure our listeners feel the same way. Appreciate you as always. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Bitstamp online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Yeah, we were very active on X and on LinkedIn from a social media standpoint as am I. And that&#8217;s our primary focus from a social media standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>And folks, as always, I will plug everything and Bobby coming in hot with the X. Wow, I always ask Twitter. I still call Twitter. I&#8217;m trying. My name&#8217;s Twitter. I don&#8217;t call it X in or whatever. It&#8217;s always Twitter for me. The domain is nice. The x.com domain is nice, but it&#8217;s always Twitter. Bobby, thank you as always. Can&#8217;t wait for round three. And at your guys&#8217; current clip, I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;ll be sooner rather than later. But thanks again, and we&#8217;ll talk soon.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Zagotta<br />
</strong>Thank you, Matt. It&#8217;s been great.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Folks, what an episode with Bobby Zagotta. Always bring in the heat. We love having Bobby on as he gives us some gold every single time.

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always, bit of a flu game today. A little bit sick, a little under the weather. That&#8217;s what happens in Mexico. Sometimes you catch some bugs, c&#8217;est la vie. There&#8217;s a little bit of something going around, half of Mexico&#8217;s sick right now. But we&#8217;re battling through and I am super friggin pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, the one and only Vince Yang, the Co-Founder of zkLink the company building the first multi-rollup Layer 3.  Yes, you heard that right, a Layer 3, a true Layer 3 to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum Layer 2 rollups. Vince and the team are pioneering more liquid, secure and customizable DeFi trading experiences. Vince is a former engineer and began his experience in crypto with Bitcoin mining. Can&#8217;t wait to get into that as well. And this has evolved into a deeper exploration of areas, including Blockchain&#8217;s potential for applications as well as ZK proofs. One of the hottest topics out there right now. Vince, super pumped to have you on my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Doing well. Thank you, Matt, for the introduction. Hi, everyone it&#8217;s my pleasure to be here. And as you know, Chado is mad, I have a very good opportunity to introduce what we&#8217;ve been building for the past three years. And also, talk a little bit about my journey in the crypto space as well. And what&#8217;s happening on the market recently is very interesting. Seeing that ETF got approved and also then surprisingly the market is going down. And we&#8217;re all surprised a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, Bitcoin ETF gets approved. We all think we&#8217;re gonna be rich and then boom, gray scale, classic. You still have gray scale. For grayscale and FTX still somehow hoping us years after the whole fiasco and we&#8217;ll get into that as well. Folks, before Vince and I went live, we were discussing where he is in the world, where I am at the world. As you all know, I am in Mexico right now on Eastern Time Zone. Vince is in Singapore 13 hours ahead of me and it is 9 p.m. for him. It&#8217;s 8 a.m. for me and him and the team are still grinding at 9 p.m.  Before the show, I was like, oh God, I&#8217;m gonna have to tell Vince to turn his or to find a better solution. There&#8217;s way too much background noise because his whole team is still hauling ass. That&#8217;s so cool.  Vince, I&#8217;d love you to talk a little bit about the team, what you guys are building and is this an everyday thing? Are you guys hauling ass till 9 p.m. every single day of the week? What&#8217;s the work life balance like over in Singapore?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Our passion, I mean, work is our passion. I think it is quite normal to work at 9 p.m. still. I think it is also very normal for Blockchain builders, developer teams working on exciting stuff. We&#8217;re seeing amazing progress and daily process. And this happens with the hard work and also the grinding on different parts of the world. Yeah, it&#8217;s just very normal and we&#8217;re very used to this. And working with funds is naturally achieved. And when you love what you&#8217;re doing, what you&#8217;re building, this is work is a big part of our life. And we really enjoyed the whole journey, the process. And our team right now is we are mostly Asians on the team. So we have a few colleagues that is rooted in other continents of the world. And most of the team in Singapore, Hong Kong, a few in China, and outside Asia, we have a few colleagues in the US, in North America, in Europe as well. And roughly in total, we are a team of 40 people. We have been building this since three years ago, starting in the year 2021 in Q1. And we&#8217;ve envisioned the idea of Ethereum scaling solutions, ZK Rollups, OP Rollups this work going to be very popular. There was a lot of discussions there. And we thought that there&#8217;s going to be a very important primitive in it. It&#8217;s for the interoperability among the Rollups. Then we were thinking about bringing it really and taking this problem using the ZK knowledge, zero-knowledge proof technology. I myself started in the crypto space not on very early days in the year of 2019. I joined one of my close friends who returned to Asia from the US, resigned from World Bank, and joined the industry. And he convinced me that this is the future. So there was a very big opportunity cost for him to just let go of what he had been building for a career for a long time and joined a totally new industry. And it was tech, savvy, and financial oriented as well. So somehow he thinks this is the next big thing and this is the opportunity to change, to be part of the history and to ride the wave with the history. And then we joined together to start it in a Bitcoin manufacturing company and also started our own mining operation business. And after a year or so, we decided to dive deeper into the Blockchain space, understanding deeper into the technology. So I came from a technical background. I used to be an engineer working in a French company. I did my master&#8217;s degree in France. And after graduation, I spent the first three years of my career working in an international automotive company and building out the power train system. And I had a little bit of experience with coding, like riding the low level codes with the CEC shop. And after joining this Blockchain space in 2019 and 2020, I started to learn reading codes in Solidity, understanding reading the white paper, yellow paper, Bitcoin, Ethereum, understanding all the basic concepts that started from absolutely zero. I jumped into the rapid hole with zero understanding, zero idea of what&#8217;s coming and what&#8217;s the technology is all about. And then gradually I had this, you know, idea of, the first touch with the international proof was quite an amazing experience to me. And I was immediately amazed by the properties and also the potentials of this technology. And I had a lot of discussion, brainstorming with the friends that were interested in this topic. And started from there, we had the initial idea of building out something that could bring value and enable adoption and empower applications and user adoptions in Blockchain space. That&#8217;s how the whole thing started in 2021.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. So you and your Co-Founder left some really cushy jobs as well, which I, you know, you got to take risks. You want to, you want to make some shit happen? You got to take risks and I love that. Vince, let&#8217;s jump right into obviously two stars of the show. One is yourself. Two is zkLink. Love the name as well. Beautiful name you guys have. And the comfort swag for the people watching this if not listening. That&#8217;s such a clean hoodie. Feel free to send one over to me Vince and I will rock that and everywhere I go.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Send me your address. I&#8217;ll make sure there are some.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it. Absolutely clean. I want you to give our listeners the elevator pitch on what exactly zkLink is, but before we jump into that, when I was doing a bit of research for the show, I&#8217;ve heard of L3s before. Now, my understanding of L3s is there&#8217;s a lot of L2 networks, a lot of Layer 2 companies and ecosystems that tell the narrative that they are an L3, but they&#8217;re really not an L3. They&#8217;re more like an L2.5. Then obviously everyone knows what L1s are, the biggest one being ETH,  I mean Bitcoin if you quantify that as an L1. But the problem with L2s is they&#8217;re very general, purpose scalability-oriented, where we need L3s for applications-specific scalability customization, a lot of interoperability, actually creating apps and dApps on top of these L2s to really make things seamless and make shit happen in the Web3 ecosystem. This is when I was like, wow, this is going to be a really fun episode because this is something that we really desperately need as a whole. Everyone talks about how ETH can be the catalyst in the network and the ecosystem to onboard the masses into Web3, but it very well could be an L3 that does this because without a beautiful UX and UI and very simple interface, aka an L3, it&#8217;s going to be difficult for ETH to do that. I hope that stage setting was a decent explanation in my understanding of what exactly an L3 is, but I&#8217;d love for you to jump into it, tell us exactly what you and the team are building at zkLink and give us the lowdown on what exactly L3s are and why they are so important to onboard the masses into the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yeah, Matt, your understanding of the Layer 3 is actually very good. And you already touched the pinpoints that are, you know, Layer 3s first list is built on top of Layer 2s and Layer 2s built on top of Layer 1. And today, the most discussion of Layer 3s are like, a relative to the Ethereum ecosystem, right? So for Bitcoin&#8217;s also not deep. There are also discussions of Bitcoin Layer 2, but still not yet. They&#8217;re getting there for Layer 3 for Bitcoin or any other Layer 1. So the Layer 3s discussion nowadays is it&#8217;s within the Ethereum ecosystem. And a Layer 3 is a third Blockchain Layer built on top of Ethereum Layer 2s and the Ethereum Layer 2s are scaling solutions, building on top of Ethereum to scale the Ethereum and to try and to break the Blockchain trilemma on of Ethereum. At the second, we&#8217;re building the first cross Rollup Layer 3 or multi-Rollup Layer 3, meaning that this Layer 3 is unified Layer, the third Layer on top of multiple Layer 2s. We call it the Nexus. We have actually two platforms. So we recently launched the zkLink Nexus, which is the first multi Rollup Layer 3 on top of multiple ZK Rollup Layer 2s. And there are already very famous projects and companies building ZK Rollup Layer 2s scaling solutions for Ethereum, like Stackware, Stacknet, zkSync, Scroll, Polygon zkEVM, Tyco, Consistence Linear. All those are already big projects and popular. And these different zkLink Layer 2s, they have their own ecosystem. As you already mentioned, they are general purpose Layer 2s scaling the Ethereum to build, you know, so it&#8217;s built for general purpose applications and even compatible also and developers can build in any sort of applications using a Solidity programming language. But eventually, these Layer 2s will, at some points, you know, meet the same problem as the Layer 1s that did not have, you know, the throughputs performance. They need it by some high performance applications. So then there comes the needs of Layer 3. Layer 3 will be application-specific. They will meet the specific demands for certain applications for high performance and low transaction costs. And at the same time, you don&#8217;t want to make a compromise on security. So you build a Layer 3 on top of the Layer 2s using, you know, the similar stack, like the Layer 2 developers like Arbitrum, or PMizum, Stackware, zkSync are all launching their Layer 3 solutions using their Layer 2 tech stack. So Arbitrum launched the Orbit. It&#8217;s basically setting transactions on Arbitrum. And then zkSync, Hyperchain, the ZK stack on top of zkSync era there too. And then you have the Stackware stacknet. Stacknet Layer 3, the Matara scaling engine on top of Stacknet Layer 2. In comparison with these single row up Layer 3s, zkSync is building a new type of Layer 3, which is a cross-row up Layer 3 that settles transactions on top of multiple Layer 2s. The ones that I just mentioned are the ZK Rollup Layer 2s. The reason why it is only working on multiple Layer 2s is because the ZK Rollup Layer 2s can talk to the Ethereum contract through the canonical message channel at a quicker space. So because for any cross-chain or cross Rollup architecture, if you want to achieve the finality of the transactions, you need like a fast and secure state synchronization across the Layer 2s. And only the ZK Rollup Layer 2s talk to this, Ethereum contracts through the canonical message channel at a faster space. Now at the moment as these ZK Layer 2s is still at early stage, the settlement speed is like anywhere between several hours to 24 hours up to 24 hours. But OP Rollup will take up to 7, 14 days for this challenge period, you know, because this using a&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b><b></b>It&#8217;s that long?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yes. And then the fraud proof is not alive yet. So no, I&#8217;m not aware of alien OP Rollups that has already launched the fraud proof. So basically the OP Rollups is running, the finality of the transactional rule, the Rollup stakes up to 7 to 14 days. And the ZK Rollups, the finality of the transactions on Ethereum Layer 1, is much faster. And it couldn&#8217;t be even faster in future with the developments of these ecosystems. Well, by theory, it can go down to like, you know, within an hour, several minutes, like that. And then a Layer 3 on top of these Layer 2s, ZK Layer 2s, and will be able to settle the transaction happening on the Layer 3 on Ethereum through these message channel between the Layer 2 and the Ethereum Layer 1, ZK Layer 2. So there&#8217;s from Layer 3 to Layer 2, the text minutes, and from Layer 2 to the Ethereum, the text minutes. So add together, you can also set the transaction, have a faster finality on Ethereum within minutes. So this is the idea of how we consider the Layer 3 can achieve a Ethereum equivalent security because this is the fundamental problem, right? So anything when you develop, any problem you try to solve, you do not want to solve the problem with the price of making a compromise on security. When there&#8217;s a most compromise on security, then you think about what benefits it comes with, right? So with the cross rub Layer 3, you have the benefits of aggregated assets and liquidity from these multiple ecosystems. Currently, I think that there are roughly 500 million on TVL, each of these ZK Layer 2s respectively, when it goes to, when they&#8217;re live on Mainnet, this number will grow for sure with the development of the ecosystem, with the launch of their token respectively. And then on this, the cross rub Layer 3, you&#8217;ll be able to tap to all these assets existing natively in these different Layer ecosystems respectively. So application building on top of this Layer 3 can list the tokens across this ecosystem, can create a trading pair of a stock and ZKS from ZK sync or a USDT or to any token, and you will be able to merge Ethereum from different Layer 2s into the same pool, into the same token. And so it&#8217;s the same for the stable coins. In that sense, you will be able to aggregate this good credit and the unified liquidity on the third Layer. So it starts from Ethereum Layer 1, and then it goes up to multiple different Layer 2s. And then with the opening and access, it emerges again and be connected with the unified Layer 3. So this is a scheme, this is similar to the Ethereum logo.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Very cool.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yeah, this is how we solve this interprobability and also liquidity fragmentation problem that are going to be a major problem for the Rollup ecosystem. Because we&#8217;re going to have hundreds of Rollups, hundreds of Layer 2 for deeper purposes. One of my colleagues just left the team to build out another Layer 2 recently, RWA focused Layer 2 because obviously he sees a market demand for that for RWA focused Layer 2. And this seems to be a very good interesting idea and a very good opportunity. But the problem is that with the more and more builders entering the space, we&#8217;re going to see hundreds of Rollups, even thousands. And all they are going to create, become very complicated and fragmented user experience, liquidity fragmentation and navigation complexities and increase the fraction cost for moving from one Layer to another. Because hundreds of Rollups meaning you&#8217;re going to have to use a lot of different bridges.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>That&#8217;s nightmare fuel. That&#8217;s not we need one one single unified solution</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>User experience that you would want, you know, if you, yeah, like you for crypto master adoption, we think we believe that abstraction is very important. Simplification is very important. Every step you reduce for user journey, every step you abstract for the user understanding, the more intuitive it becomes, the simpler it comes, and the more users you will be able to to get, you know, outside of the crypto space. For crypto native users, of course, they will try so hard and try to try all you can to understand the concepts to try out the different you take knowledge, but for general users, even using the centralized platform like you centralized exchanges, sometimes, you know, a high learning cost for them. So we have to at least match the user experience of the centralized platform like, you know, as simple as Coinbase.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s got to be clean.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yes, clean and intuitive. Right. So it&#8217;s user friendly, awesome. How really and what they are trying to match the user experience from the Web2 applications, very smooth, sleek, similar.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yeah, I think the decentralized applications you eventually have to match that kind of level of user experience. Otherwise, mass adoption or onboarding building next building of users, on chain or onto the decentralized applications will not happen unless we will have the infrastructure being ready for these types of applications. Second, it is exactly building these built, the infrastructure to build for this purpose to onboard the next building traders on chain to empower the next generation of super applications, starting with the trading applications by order book or AMM driven NFT gaming inter-sider us and achieve this target. I think there&#8217;s three comes with the natural benefit of hyperscaling because it is the third Layer. Each Layer you go up, you have like a scalability benefits margin again on that. And it comes with reduced cost because you can batch transactions and generate a proof and then set the transactions on the second Layer and then the Ethereum. So you have the scalability gain, you have the cost again. At the same time, you have the ability to aggregate assets and abstract the complexities of course multiple Layer 2s, which means simplified user experience, which also means simplified developer experience. This is the valid proposition of zkLink and Layer 3. And we believe this will be particularly beneficial for decentralized financial products like order book taxes for perpetual contracts for options or gaming companies. Yes, we&#8217;re hoping to get this infrastructure mature and production ready for the best developers that can deliver the best producer experience. Like you said, simple clean user interface, one unified interface for to serve multiple purposes and using the infrastructure we&#8217;re building.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. It&#8217;s funny and you brought up a great point there, Vince. In order to onboard the masses, again, this isn&#8217;t fake news. This is the realist of news and it needs to be clean. It needs to be sexy. It needs to be easy. It needs to be frictionless. And the teams that build those products right now are nine times out of 10. They&#8217;re exchanges. They&#8217;re centralized exchanges. And when we onboard a Web2 user into the Web3 ecosystem, usually their first touch point is in exchange. But once you leave that exchange and you start messing around with DeFi, it&#8217;s nightmare fuel. It is way too complex. There is so much friction. I&#8217;ll still never forget the first couple of times I sent a MetaMask transaction or let alone had to bridge a coin to another coin. Like, are you kidding me? That was scary as hell. I&#8217;m just like, where&#8217;s my money? Is it gone to an abyss? And that&#8217;s scary stuff. So we need more teams like you guys build. And Vince, we need to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. But when we get back, we still have a bunch of topics to discuss. We&#8217;re going to get into ZK proof, some ETH, some DeFi unifying L1s and L2s. And of course, the Bitcoin ETF, we all thought it was going to pump and it dumped. We also got to get into ZKL token. You and the team had a lovely public raise going on. I believe it just concluded and we&#8217;ll get into that right after this. But until then, huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. That is PrimeXBT. We love the team at PrimeXBT as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a veteran, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. PrimeXBT is always offering innovative products and professional trading conditions and solutions to all of their customers. PrimeXBT is also running an exclusive promotion for listeners of the Cryptonews Podcast. The promo code is <strong>CRYPTONEWS50</strong>. And you can use that to receive 50%. That is 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50. All in word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Vince. Let&#8217;s jump right into ZKL. I was flabbergasted perhaps as a bit of a big word, but it was such a clean raise done by you and the team. Obviously, we&#8217;ve been planning this for a couple of weeks now. So whenever I have a guest on the pod, as soon as we get them locked and loaded, I do my initial deep dive and then every couple of days after that, I&#8217;ll lurk socials, see what&#8217;s going on, read blog posts, check coin price whatever. You guys obviously don&#8217;t have a public trading coin, but this is what the purpose of this raise was for. It was done just beautifully in my opinion. Everything was super clean, really good update, clear communication. I&#8217;d love if you could walk us through sort of the rationale behind one launching the coin. What is its utility? And if you could start by talking about how you guys chose to do the public raise and how you guys made it so clean. So perhaps other teams who are listening could emulate and follow what you guys did. I think that&#8217;d be a great place to start your events.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yeah, thank you very much, Matt, for, you know, yeah, this whole process behind it, since actually, you know, we have been spending a lot of time and, you know, made a lot of efforts to make this happen. Or the reason that we choose to do this community race is mostly to, you know, engage and, you know, grow our community and to be able to deepen our relationship with our early community members and supporters. This is a very good opportunity for us to establish a deeper relationship with our community with this community sale. Because this token sales actually comes at a discount. Our last round of private runs was raised as a higher valuation than the community sale round happening right now. So we want our community members to have the feeling that their support, ongoing support is deeply appreciated and we will reward the early adopters and their non-term support in many different ways. This is the, I think, starting with the community sales is a good way, in our opinion, to show our appreciation. And the whole process is managed by our team together. And we have seen overwhelming support from our community. We have roughly in total 300 to 350,000 of community members in our Discord channel. And we&#8217;ve seen overwhelming support and very positive feedbacks from our community members. They like the idea that we are launching at the right timing after almost three years of grinding, technical grinding and building and seeing that the ecosystem is also beginning to grow very fast. Recently, as we continue to embody more ecosystem applications, developer teams, and we&#8217;re launching different initiatives to enhance the momentum of the ecosystem growth, we recently launched the liquidity alliance program to onboard market makers to provide the liquidity to boost equal liquidity in our ecosystem application. And to make all these initiatives possible, then a token will be naturally needed. And also this token, fundamentally, is the native utility token and the governance token of the protocol. It will be the payment token for the proof market to provide the necessary computational resources needed to generate the proof and sustain the operation of the network and also as a governance instrument to ensure the decentralization and the sustainability of the network in long term. And to govern the key developments and also the different matters like the community votes and how to develop our ecosystem for other important initiatives after the token genesis events. They will be collectively decided by the Katao member together using the token as the instrument to coordinate this process. And also it will be the utility token for developers to use as a license fee to pay for the infrastructure service. And also, of course, the developers in the beginning as startups, they might find it is expensive to pay in this token, so the DAO will provide initial support for the, to onboard the early-stage startups to facilitate the whole process and to promote adoption. And in return, there could be some sort of agreement between the DAO and the developer team is to pay by future revenue sharing, so it&#8217;s quite flexible over there. And with this token sale, we&#8217;re entering the fast track to bring the product and the Mainnet life and to involve multiple teams. And we have a very busy pipeline of key partnerships and integrations in the next few months with the strategic technology providers related to the Rollup framework that we&#8217;re building, and also some important applications that we think that will be very exciting for our community and the users. So I cannot reveal the details right now, but I&#8217;m personally very excited for what&#8217;s coming. And we hope that our community members who have been lucky and won the lottery for the whitelist to board and for those who have not, they will still have the opportunity to be rewarded. And we want to engage them in non term, and we really appreciate their support. And I think it appears to me that this community sale is one of the most popular ones in the recent history of current list. So we&#8217;re really happy for that, and we deeply appreciate the support from our community members.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>100%. Well said there. I mean, I&#8217;m sure you can&#8217;t tell me this, but you know, you got to shoot your shot. What&#8217;s the plan for centralized exchanges? You guys are going to do the whole Kip/Bam and Kaboodle, Binance, Coinbase, everyone. You&#8217;re going to do all the big boys, all the big gals. Is that coming up soon?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>That&#8217;s definitely our target. Yeah, we definitely want to try our best. So we&#8217;re still in the process of figuring out what&#8217;s the opportunities, what was possible. We try very hard and we try our best to get the list on the best platforms to have a stronger momentum for everything. This is like, stay tuned.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah. You know, Vince, I had to ask. I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t be doing my job if I didn&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s take a step away from zkLink and yourself, of course. And we&#8217;re going to talk about the Bitcoin ETF. I mean, this impacts everyone. Obviously, you guys aren&#8217;t involved in the Bitcoin space primarily. You guys are team ETH building an L3, of course. But did you guys expect this price action to happen? Like, you know, I want to say when the Bitcoin ETF launched at 46, 47, heck, we might have even been at 48 at the time. And then boom, we&#8217;re, you know, I think yesterday we hit 39,000. Like, what&#8217;s going on there? I know you guys have some very incredible and very switched on smart lads and lasses on the team. Like, did you guys expect this to happen? Was this a big shock to you? Do you think it&#8217;s going to increase long term? Do you think the halving will still have the effect that everyone thinks it does? What&#8217;s your sort of short term sentiment on Bitcoin?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>To start with, I have to admit that I&#8217;m not an expert in trading. So I&#8217;m really not very good at market analysis or pricing predictions. But we all care about the price of Bitcoin because of course it&#8217;s the beta of the whole market. So it&#8217;s the indicator that we all care about. I still have a lot of friends that are working in the Bitcoin space, the Bitcoin miners and also the mining companies, the mining farm companies. So I&#8217;m still pretty close to the Bitcoin community. The feeling that I&#8217;ve got from the Bitcoin community is that they really don&#8217;t care that much about the short-term price changes, whether it&#8217;s like writing from the 26K to the 48K, with the rally due to the idea of approval, the expectations, or whether it&#8217;s just the most recent, the last three days, the selling pressure coming from probably the grayscale and the liquidations. Within the zkLink team, I think everyone is very focused on building out the infra. So they don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>But you guys don&#8217;t give a shit about that. I had to ask just because again, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s real estate. It&#8217;s some of the biggest news.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>It&#8217;s not actually 100% that we are not, you know, caring much about the price changes because this will give us more time. I think if we somehow we think this is, we expect this to happen. And it&#8217;s not a totally a bad thing for the builders, for the developer teams. When the pricing is really very fast, everything is rising very fast. And then you see, there&#8217;s a feeling with the team data, okay, are we too slow? Everyone else thinks really, yeah, the big boys is really, you know, made it and they&#8217;re going so fast and everything moving so fast. We have the feeling that we&#8217;re not doing it. We&#8217;re not executing another dealer in fast enough. But when the price is stabilized or slowly going down, then we feel like, okay, there&#8217;s more time for us and we can be more focused on the coding and developing the ecosystem and everything. But as we&#8217;re doing the community, so of course we hope that the whole market is going strong and we do believe that in, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gonna happen in the next one, we got two, but we know that in this year, the overall, the market is will go strong. So there&#8217;s a lot of positive signals we&#8217;ve seen with the Bitcoin halving, which is gonna happen very soon, with the Ethereum upgrade, can go now updates. So a lot of impositives things and also with the infrastructure getting mature very quickly, new types of applications being unlocked, new doors being opened, and also with interest, a cut, is the expectation. Don&#8217;t think that this short-term dumping pressure will be a big problem with long-term. Yeah, so overall, we just do, once we&#8217;ve continued to focus on what we were building and once we ship fast, as fast as possible.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. Vince, this has been absolutely incredible. A couple more questions, mate, and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. Let&#8217;s talk 2024 trends, 2024 hot topics. Besides the solutions and pieces of infrastructure that you and the team are working on, is there anything outside of you and your guys realm that really excites you at the moment? Obviously, you guys are doing everything. ZK related, L1, L2, L3, more specifically L3. Any other areas of crypto or ecosystems that really tickle your fancy at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang</b><br />
I think for the past few weeks, we have seen interesting things happen with the modular production space. So building a Layer 3 harshly is also part of the broader modular landscape, because you have to decouple some of the key components to be flexible, to be customizable, to meet the diversity of bounds. So we work hand in hand with the modular solution providers like Celestia, EigenDA, or the Oracle, the other shared sequences. This will be a very important trend for the Rollup ecosystem. You have to decouple the components to be flexible, customizable, to meet the diversity of bounds, to have a flexibility to reduce the cost and to have some enhanced performance in certain areas using different solutions, making compromise on different parameters. So I think this is the way. But we&#8217;re also doing this within the Ethereum ecosystem. This is still the strongest developer community where most of the fundamental innovations are happening on a daily basis. So we expect that this is still we want to focus on the Ethereum community. And there are constraints coming with Ethereum for sure. And outside the Ethereum community, there are also important innovations happening on a daily basis, like within the Cosmos ecosystem. We&#8217;ve seen exciting things, like dYdX building out at their way four, is a fully decentralized margin engine implemented in the Cosmos Layer 1 chain. It&#8217;s amazing. We&#8217;re internally exploring what their building and that we find is really amazing. And also innovations happening on other ecosystems, like Solana recently just, you know, what have come back, right? So after the FTX inclusion, and the Solana ecosystem is growing so fast that it&#8217;s getting strong. And for us, from the technology perspective, we think that the most important game changer in the year 24 is account abstraction. Because this is most fundamental element related to user experience, abstraction again is so important for user experience for adoption. Account abstraction will give us, will set the grounds for us to build out everything, you know, on top of it. So they can get also working with account abstraction solution providers. And we&#8217;re more like, you know, doing some deep work on the front of chain Rollup of abstraction, trying to integrate them and, you know, abstract these and simplify these for developers and users, while account abstraction is providing solutions for all end users, including you and me. And I hope that in 2024 we&#8217;ll be able to see some amazing products using account abstraction and, you know, give us like, this product that we like to use day to day, like exchanges with social accounts, social recovery, social login, et cetera. And I&#8217;m mostly excited about the progress on abstraction. I would say this is too pretty early and there&#8217;s a huge potential there. And a lot of the infrastructures will have account abstraction embedded. And it&#8217;s not mature yet. It&#8217;s not user-ready. It&#8217;s not production ready. I hope that it will get ready very soon.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yep, well said. Vince, pleasure having you on, my man. This was a great episode, super pumped for you and the team. You guys are building something incredible and sky&#8217;s the limit and I&#8217;ll be following along. Really appreciate you coming on and can&#8217;t wait for our second round. But before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and zkLink online and on socials.</p>
<p><b>Vince Yang<br />
</b>Yes, you can find me on Twitter. My Twitter is @zkVinceReal, and it&#8217;s a verified account with a black punk. And you can find also Zekilink official Twitter accounts, @zkLink_Official. You can also visit our official website, which is zk.link. And there&#8217;s a detailed explanation on our documentation, the developer docs, explaining in detail how the solution works. And also, of course, you can also find us in Discord channel. There&#8217;s only one zkLink Discord channel, and we were happy to chat with you there and answer your question, any question related to the project or any other topic. And yeah, thank you, Matt. This is a great session. I love it. Great chatting with you. And let us know if there&#8217;s the second opportunity. When we can come back, and next time, maybe with bigger news, with more exciting progress and advancements on the tech and also the existing development. And of course, hopefully one day, when we come back, we&#8217;ll already have a token.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it. Folks, what an episode with Vince Yang, Co-Founder of zkLink. We jumped into a whole lot of stuff here. Everything, Layer 3 related, mapping ZK Proofs, DeFi, ZK Rollups. You name it, we touched a huge shout out to Vince and the team for making this happen. Vince was unreal, dropping tons of knowledge bombs left, right, and center. If you guys enjoyed this one, and I hope you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I speak to the team. Love you guys so much. Thank you for everything. Justas The gaudiest sound editor in the world. You&#8217;re the man. Appreciate you and back to listeners. Love you guys. Keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy, and happy.

<b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host Matt Zahab and we are buzzing as always. And I am super pumped to have one of the OGs. Now what I mean OG, this guy is a true original gangster, may or may not have worked on the first smart contract in the whole friggin world. And I&#8217;m not talking like you guys are probably thinking, oh, it was in 2010, a couple of years before ETH was created. No, this was before I was born. This is a very OG smart contract. We&#8217;re going to get into all this. But before we do the show, the star of the show today we have Dean Tribble, the CEO of Agoric Opco, the software dev company supporting Agoric, the JavaScript smart contract platform and proof of stake Blockchain. Dean drives the vision to build a safe and composable JavaScript smart contract platform to onboard the next 14 million developers into Web3. As discussed, Dean is a literal OG cypherpunk and pioneer in distributed systems and smart contract technology as he may have literally worked and built on the first smart contract ever. Also had another company called Agorics where he was CTO and it got acquired by Microsoft. Ever heard of him? He was also CTO of VerifyValid and VP of Deluxe where his echeck systems have carried billions of dollars. We have a true OG on the pod today and he has one of the most electric mustaches I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life. Super pumped to have him on. Dean, welcome to the show my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>I am doing great. Thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m excited to be here. I occasionally say yes and this mustache is older than Vitalik but.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it. Dean, super pumped to have you on here my man. You have an incredible background and sometimes we get the term OG thrown around on the podcast and I usually refer to those as like OGs in the crypto space where they got in between 2010 to 2013, 2014. They&#8217;ve been in the space for a decade. In the crypto space that would usually quantify you as an OG. But when we talk about smart contracts here, you told me before the show that you worked on the first smart contract in 1989. That is friggin bananas. Dean I was born in 1995.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>I was young, I was like three years old. No, the first production smart contract. I don&#8217;t know what people were doing in labs, but this was deployed to production with paying customers running pre-Internet, pre-web. You dial up on your, whatever it is, 1200 bod modem to connect to this thing in order to orchestrate. What&#8217;s a smart contract is sort of the heart of this software that is enforcing the terms of a contract like arrangement between third parties, right? So it&#8217;s so eBay, PayPal, Venmo, Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, those are all smart contract businesses. So smart contract was trillion dollar market cap before Blockchain came along, right? It&#8217;s about the role of the software to the customers. And so it enables strangers to cooperate. And that&#8217;s really been our vision, our mission for now, literally decades, is software enabling strangers to cooperate. Right? Millions of people buy things from strangers that they probably wouldn&#8217;t like if they met them in person. And it works every day, all the time, because software is orchestrating and enforcing the terms of the exchange, the delivery, the monies, all these kinds of things. There used to be a comedian that would do an act of, okay, so I&#8217;m going to summon a stranger to my house, climb into the stranger&#8217;s car, and have them take me someplace that I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going. And I&#8217;ve never met this person. And if you told someone 20 years ago that people were going to be doing this all the time, every day, they would look at you like you were crazy. And yet, because you could build software in the middle that could orchestrate and add safety and security and investigation and background and all these things. Now, people do that routinely, all the time, orchestrated by software, enforcing the terms of that engagement. And so it&#8217;s huge value. It&#8217;s really changed the face of the world and how we do business. And the first production, one of those that was really thought of itself as smart contract logic that was doing this sort of thing was the Amex in 1989, and I helped help get the smart contract part of it. Right?</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>That&#8217;s wild. How does building present day smart contracts on Ethereum and Solidity differ from the first one you ever built back in 1989? I mean, I&#8217;m sure absolutely every component is different, but I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through some of the biggest differences here, Dean.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>So first there&#8217;s, what&#8217;s the big difference of having Blockchain? So forget any of those things, right? Blockchain, we&#8217;ve got replicated execution on machines that are in different jurisdictions and different, administered by different independent parties, and they&#8217;re all checking each other&#8217;s work and coming to consensus about what happened. And that difference means that now you can run software with a level of integrity that did not exist before Blockchain. Right? You&#8217;re not trusting any one party, you&#8217;re not giving a backdoor if you do it, right. If you really decentralize, you&#8217;ve got this environment where you really can rely on the software. So now you can have smart contract businesses without a trusted intermediary like eBay or PayPal or Venmo, Airbnb or StubHub. Sometimes they take huge chunks, 35% of your ticket sales. Sometimes they do illegal things like Enron did, where they were a trusted intermediary for electricity trading. And it was a huge value potentially to the world. And they got greedy and started slipping in trades after, in theory, businesses closed and they were manipulating the market and all these things that a decentralized, transparent system they would not have been able to do, right? And so being able to eliminate the trusted intermediary by having software itself be what you rely on to enforce the terms of a contract like arrangement is what enables the Uniswaps and everything from sort of smart contracts on Ethereum to rich and more programmable environments like Gork. All of those are enabled by being able to run software with high integrity, which we weren&#8217;t able to do anywhere near this safely before. So that&#8217;s the first thing is Blockchain makes a difference there in terms of what you can do. Now, the thing about Solidity is it was hugely important in making that shift, right? Run software in an environment where it can&#8217;t be tampered with by any individual organization or regime. And that&#8217;s really important, right? Because at the level of scale we&#8217;re talking about reengineering how humans cooperate, regimes do intervene, right? And  it&#8217;s Venezuela or the US government doesn&#8217;t matter, right? If you&#8217;re on the other side of it, it&#8217;s not a comfortable place to be. And them being able to backdoor stuff so that you cannot rely on the software that&#8217;s executing would mean that software cannot provide us the kind of safe environment that if I physically meet you at a swap meet and trade something with you, I&#8217;ve got control of what&#8217;s going on. And it doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily that I&#8217;ve got necessarily the Tim May Cypherpunk world, but it&#8217;s got to be higher assurance than what regimes tend to want to have happen. Okay, so that&#8217;s the first. Then there&#8217;s the programming environment. Now, I compare ETH with Flash, right? If you remember Flash, you were just barely old enough. No, sorry, you remember Flash. All the marketing sites were Flash, all the Internet games, Flash, right? That was how people built interactive WYSI things right? One of the things that a prior company that was inspired by the same papers, right? So Agoric, by the way, comes from the greek word Agara, which means the open marketplace and so in 1986.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I like that.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Mark Miller. Yeah, it&#8217;s lovely. We&#8217;ve tried various grecian pillars as logos and stuff like that. So Mark Miller and Eric Drexler wrote a paper called the Agoric Open Systems paper that really shared a vision of software agents creating and participating in markets. And that was a big early piece that shows up on a16z cryptocanon. It&#8217;s one of the real inspirations for Nick Zabo, who worked with us at the time, and various others, Hal Finney and so forth, for how to build software, how to build large scale distributed systems. And so we had a prior company called Agoric that was building smart contracts at Sun Labs for doing control of network systems, control of network resources, compute resources and memory and satellite dish time, and all these kinds of things, right? So it&#8217;s an early smart contract environment. And so that was an area of getting software to enforce the terms of contract, like arrangement between third parties, where those third parties might be software agents, they might be AIs, or they might be people, right? Or they might be businesses, they might be any of these kinds of things. But you really want to be able to have a level, smooth playing field where all them could work again. So one of the things we did, because the macromedia Flash was trying to be able to do this desktop thing where you could pull in software from lots of third parties and run it, and they were having problems from a security point of view. So they brought us in to audit their computational model and how you do that. And one of the things we discovered was, yeah, synchronous reentrant call and message sender as a security model were both really problematic, real security hazards that humans could not get their head around, right? And so we saw this in Flash, which was the dominant programming language for large scale interactive experiences on the web. We saw this in Flash, and it was really harming the ability of Flash to grow. It was the brick wall that Flash programming is running into. And EVM has all those same properties. It was inspired by that work. It built along the same properties because they make simple things simple. They just make hard things essentially impossible. And so we&#8217;re now very early in the world of programming, right? I mean, there&#8217;s a lot of money in Blockchain, but we&#8217;re very mean, you know, AMM, you know, Uniswap. That&#8217;s huge. It&#8217;s a lot of money. It&#8217;s a really simple program. It&#8217;s a few thousand lines, right? I mean, it&#8217;s just, we&#8217;re not really doing yet large scale distributed applications on Blockchain. There&#8217;s an economy there and that&#8217;s really important and valuable. And I don&#8217;t mean to deride that at all, but it&#8217;s all very transactional. It&#8217;s all, I do one transaction, I can figure out what that looks like and then we&#8217;re done. Right? But most software doesn&#8217;t work that way. You don&#8217;t do large scale collaboration on a whiteboard using transactions. Right? You do it using long lived experiences, long lived software activities and that sort of thing that just don&#8217;t work well on current Blockchain. So back to your current question. So the programming model is pretty weak. It has fundamental security hazards that are very dangerous. The biggest difference in Blockchain world in some sense versus Web2 smart contracts is Web2 smart contracts. I&#8217;m hosting my environment, running my program, provide a service to my customers that is a smart contract service, but I&#8217;m in control of all the software I run in my environment. Right? And that means that I don&#8217;t have a lot of security hazards of running third party code and having third party code all cooperate with each other and attack each other. So the developer deploying to a Cloud service, they&#8217;re generally not deploying, where they&#8217;re also embedding third party code. Or at least that&#8217;s the theory, and let&#8217;s come back to that in a moment. But in the cryptoverse in Blockchain, you&#8217;re deploying in a hostile environment where because of pseudonymity and anonymity, it is very easy for attackers if there&#8217;s a hole in you, in your code to exploit it. Yeah, and because money shows up there first, and there&#8217;s good reason why money shows up in the cryptoverse first before lots of other ways we might leverage this software because money shows up there first. It&#8217;s a rich target. So you&#8217;ve got an immature market with platforms that have fundamental security hazards that are hard for humans to reason about in a hostile environment. And so that&#8217;s been an interesting adventure and breeding ground and stuff like that. We&#8217;ve got people talk about ETH as sort of the proven, battle tested. No, it&#8217;s lost $9 billion. That&#8217;s not battle tested. That&#8217;s you lost. So it&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s a hostile environment, it&#8217;s dangerous environment. We have much better techniques that have been deployed there that are one of the reasons why we built Agoric and other people have built other technologies to solve other parts of that hard problem. But that&#8217;s one of the ways in which it is a different environment is that you&#8217;re going out into a target rich environment, as it were.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>100%. Great spiel there, Dean. Speaking of Agoric, let&#8217;s jump right into it. Give me the elevator pitch. Give me the 32nd TLDR too long didn&#8217;t read elevator pitch on Agoric. And then we&#8217;ll get into all the fun stuff because we have  snaps to talk about. We have your Mainnet One B partnership with BitGo, IST, ShadeSwap. You guys have been absolutely launching stuff left, right and center. Before we get into all the cool launches, though. Give me the elevator pitch, then we&#8217;ll get into it.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Sure. And then ask me in a month the elevator pitch will change just a little bit. So let me tease that. So the hardest thing to scale is developers, right? You can&#8217;t sort of scale users with one app that lots of people want to use, but that doesn&#8217;t scale the platform or the economy. For that, you need to scale developers. You need millions of developers if you&#8217;re going to get where a business that wants to roll out a website also wants to update the smart contracts or do something a little bit custom for their special business. And you don&#8217;t take over the world, you don&#8217;t take over the economy, you don&#8217;t take over how people do business unless all the developers on the planet can build this stuff, right? Web2 is all over the world because millions of developers can program it. And so to do that, you have to meet developers where they&#8217;re at, and you have to meet them with an abstract enough model they can program to it. They don&#8217;t care in the mainstream about wether it&#8217;s ETH or Solana or Agoric or Cosmos or whatever. What they care, what users care about is the experience they can get, and they care about it being safe and they care about it being usable, and they care about all the things that they care about in Web2. There&#8217;s nothing magical about Web3, except that you have early adopters that care to make sure it&#8217;s decentralized and private and enables them to do things that they weren&#8217;t able to do before. But as you start expanding that out, these fundamental basics of it&#8217;s got to be usable, it&#8217;s got to be focused on. My benefits are fundamental. So we enable the world&#8217;s developers to be able to approach Web3. And we enable it in a way that through our system, they can orchestrate, they can coordinate activity across lots of assets, across lots of chains without it being something they have to think about very hard. That ability to rapidly build rich, complex, interesting applications is something that has not been available to Web3 before. And that&#8217;s what we bring to the table.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Super interesting there. And the name, I love the name, too. What is it about everyone stealing names from the old greek language? They all slap, too, though. You know what I mean, Dean? I love it. But anyway.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Okay, so Agoric came was one of the early ones, right? That was 85, 86.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>No, that&#8217;s very true.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Originally inspired by software. Sorry. Using markets to control resource allocation in software. Right? That computers were crossing the threshold where instead of talking about tens of bytes or hundreds of bytes or maybe 600 and 40k was a big machine at the time. Right? Instead of talking about that, you&#8217;re talking about gigabytes and terabytes, and now you can&#8217;t manage all of that yourself. How do you do that? And that&#8217;s where Agoric came from, was use markets to bid for compute cycles and memory and network space.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>A little off topic here, Dean? But is that sort of similar to what we&#8217;re seeing in the AI space with all the race for GPU power?</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Yes, actually, very much. And it&#8217;s another one of those things where there&#8217;s demand for a resource, there&#8217;s a lot of it. You&#8217;re not going to manage individual GPUs. You want to manage them by large swaths, and you want to allocate them to where they&#8217;re valuable for. You would like to do that in a way so that people can get large volume, but small players can still come in and get high value volume. Microeconomics and markets are great for that, and they&#8217;re better than all the central planning fallacies that governments across the world want to use for how to allocate resources. Markets are just great. And so using them for allocating compute resources for high demand is really valuable. And that&#8217;s why. EIP, what is it? 1557. The market based allocation of block space. One of the contenders was an algorithm from the original Agoric open systems papers. The escalator algorithm was designed to show how you could do incentive analysis and mechanism design for using auctions to do compute resource allocation. And we now see that showing up for blockspace auctions in Blockchain.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>So cool, Dean, let&#8217;s jump into  Snaps here. MetaMask has introduced Snaps, which is an application built to add extended features and functionality to MetaMask. MetaMask is one of the most popular and important apps to the Blockchain space as a whole, minus the whole seed phrase part. It&#8217;s pretty darn easy to use. It&#8217;s pretty darn efficient to use. I personally think we need something a little bit better to onboard the masses, but in regards to MetaMask as a whole, it is a pretty friggin darn good app, and I&#8217;m sure a lot of us are very grateful to have it. You and the team worked your tails off to help launch MetaMask Snaps, and I&#8217;d love for you to talk about it.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>So remember earlier I mentioned deploying Web2 apps is not the same hostile environment, right? You&#8217;re running third party code in your application. But in fact you are right, because the study of all these apps says that only 3% of the code in some large scale deployed web apps, and typical across GitHub, only 3% is actually application code you wrote, and 97% is libraries you got from somewhere else. So there&#8217;s this big supply chain of how do you trust those libraries? How much authority do those libraries have? And in typical web architecture they have all the authority of your application running, and you&#8217;ve got complete exposure to all of that code. You know, Aaron Davis, one of the founders of MetaMask, was concerned about that. He was concerned about their software supply chain. And so he and Dan Finley searched around and they saw what Agoric was doing for hardened JavaScript. It was called SES at the time, and that&#8217;s been an effort. That was one of the things that led to Agoric is it&#8217;s been an effort over the last 15 years, Mark Miller, our Chief Scientist, has been driving into the JavaScript standards, the elements to be able to do large scale safe programming where you&#8217;re not completely exposed to every library you try to use, where you can grab something and say, here&#8217;s the authority you have and no more. And it&#8217;s easy to program that. When I load a clock, it needs access to the timer, but it does not need access to Unix Exec, it does not need access to my password file, it does not need access to my keys, it doesn&#8217;t have to encrypt anything, it just needs to read the damn time, right? And so when I created, I want it to be trivial programming behaviorally, so it gets the authority to read the clock and that&#8217;s it. And now I can ask it the time and it could lie about the time, right? It could be a bad clock, but it can&#8217;t lie about the time. And oh by the way, send my password file to another country, right? Because it just launched loads with just the authority it needs in a natural programming style, and it does not check that the guy asking for the time is one of those people that&#8217;s allowed to ask for the time, like the message sender silliness that you get from Flash and Solidity and so forth, because that&#8217;s just a terrible model for composing libraries into larger applications. The model is I launch you, I give you the time thing, and now you can tell me the time I want, you can format, oh, I want to give you my location, my locale, so you can format it in international form, that&#8217;s great too. You don&#8217;t get to sniff around my disc and decide what area I&#8217;m on, you don&#8217;t get to look at the geo, and I give it to you to decide what physical location I&#8217;m in. It&#8217;s like, I&#8217;ll tell you where I&#8217;m at, you just give me the render. So they reach out to us and we connected on that. And that was the basis of the JavaScript execution model that we&#8217;re running on a Blockchain where we natively execute standard JavaScript just in a deterministic fashion. So you can run on 100 machines and come to the same answer, even though you&#8217;re running it at different times in different locations. So hardly JavaScript is the way I refer to it. And the way to think about it is it&#8217;s the JavaScript you thought you were programming in already. It is the version of JavaScript that does what you expect when you&#8217;re doing things. JavaScript starts out very malleable, right? You can change what it means to iterate an array, to walk through all the elements of an array and print them out, or format them, or do something with them. And the problem is you can change that to oh, by the way, read the file system, copy a file and send it to another country, right? And that is not what I expect when I iterate an array. That is not what I expect when I print a message to the user. And so what hardened JavaScript does is it locks down the world, so that the array iteration or printing a message to the user does what I expect, it does what the standard says. So JavaScript starts out very malleable, which is useful for certain kinds of things, but almost no application actually needs that or wants that. What it wants is the JavaScript programming language that they are all programming in. And so that&#8217;s what hardened JavaScript is. And in that process we lock down all of the security hazards that people sort of think of historically associated with JavaScript, but they&#8217;ve been locked down for a long time. It&#8217;s just people sort of still have this racial memory of early days of JavaScript, but JavaScript every day controls trillions of dollars in transactions across every facet of human existence. If it had big security hazards, people would not be doing that and they&#8217;d know by now.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Well said there Dean. We got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor the show. But when we get back we have to discuss your guys&#8217; massive partnership with BitGo and of course BLD staking, which is pretty freaking cool. Until then, huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, that is PrimeXBT. We love the team at PrimeXBT as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. PrimeXBT is also running an exclusive promotion for listeners of the Cryptonews Podcast. Use the promo code <b>CRYPTONEWS50</b> that is CRYPTONEWS50 all one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Dean. Let&#8217;s jump right into the partnership with BitGo and you guys integrating BLD. This is massive for institutional adoption of DeFi, tons of financial institutions want access to creme de la creme grade smart contracts. They don&#8217;t have the wherewithal or the know how and the resources to do it themselves. So they piggyback off of people like yourselves and your team. You gotta love to see that shit. Walk me through the partnership here. What is the importance of partnering with BitGo? And walk me through a little bit more because full disclosure, Dean, I don&#8217;t  fully understand the whole BLD staking and how that helps. But I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through why the partnership with Bitco and the importance of the BLD staking as well.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>So first, BLD is the native token of the Agoric chain. It&#8217;s, if you will, the foundation on which the economy is built. So it provides governance. It&#8217;s how you can get an account abstraction wallet set up, which we&#8217;ve had forever. It is an element that is used for getting rewards from the system. And the design of the Agoric system is a two token world where BLD is at the bottom and that&#8217;s the foundation on which things are built. And IST Interstable Token is a stable token natively built in JavaScript using all the best practices of overcollateralized, backed by crypto assets and other stables. But it&#8217;s all designed, the infrastructure and platform is all designed natively to include async network access, async secure access to assets on other chains. And so the IST stable token, for example, can you pull over Atom or staked Atom, some of the staking derivatives or Osmo or various other things, assets that the community will decide are appropriate backing, use those as collateral and mint the stable token IST and then you can take it to other chains across the ecosystem. Not just use it on Agoric to pay gas fees or pay for network services, but buy NFTs on Stargaze and OmniFlix, or buy assets in Osmosis or ShadeSwap or other places. And so it&#8217;s a stable token that is starting out on Agoric, starting out designed for the connected interchange, bridging across. It just went live on StellaSwap, on Polkadot, I think. And so it&#8217;s sort of appearing and spreading outwards because it&#8217;s very focused on being about sort of the chain abstract world, the world where, I&#8217;ve just got robust stuff that&#8217;s running on robust systems providing services to users. I don&#8217;t care where it&#8217;s running, I want to be able to pay for it with the same kinds of mechanisms. I want to be able to access assets on Aave or Solana or wherever it is and roll them up into complex, interesting interactions that needs to be programmed in sort of the Agoric nice async smart contracting model and so forth. So build is the fundamental token that lets institutions and whales and others participate in that new foundation that will be rolling out and ramping up this year. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s exciting for them to have access to build is that something that as we start connecting to Web2 and getting some of these Web2 interested parties able to now start participating in Web3, start to build in Web3, that interesting to institutions, that here&#8217;s the place that they&#8217;ll be able to participate, they&#8217;ll understand how to do so, and that lets them participate economically as well. And the economy that grows with ISD, the economy that grows with functionality on the Agoric chain and with being able to coordinate access to assets on other chains, that economy, it pays rewards to build holders that stake. So that&#8217;s where the staking comes in is the way you really participate. You get build, you stake it, and now you go deploy your thing and you&#8217;re going to get rewards from the overall ecosystem based on the ongoing usage and growth of the platform. And we&#8217;re very focused on it tying to usage and growth. Right? The important thing is that participation be aligned with growing the economy, with growing participation, with growing activity, as opposed to aligned with charging rents for people coming on board, right? One of the things you see in a lot of these chains, there&#8217;ll be an underlying token. ETH is the canonical example, but it&#8217;s common and it&#8217;s useful for starters, where you pay gas fees on Ethereum in ETH, right? ETH is a volatile commodity. It&#8217;s different yesterday from tomorrow. It&#8217;s subject to lots of market fluctuations. And yet you&#8217;re paying effectively your postage bill or your rent using these volatile assets. I mean, that&#8217;s like paying for your rent with gold or with Apple shares. You can do it. But a few thousand years ago, we realized that an economy that used stable units of account and stable currencies for paying for services and long lived contracts was a better economy. Right? It had less friction. It made it much more plausible to do some of the kinds of things I talked about that you can&#8217;t easily do in crypto right now, like long term contracts, subscriptions, mortgages, these things where I&#8217;m not going to cut a mortgage in ETH, that I&#8217;m going to be owing a certain amount of ETH in 40 years. That would be crazy. I have no idea what ETH will be worth in 40 years. Right? But I kind of have an idea of what the dollar will be worth, or the euro, or anything that&#8217;s designed to be low volatility. Yeah, it&#8217;ll go up smoothly, but it&#8217;ll still be sort of a predictable thing so I can write a long term contract, I can hedge a long term contract, I can trade off different things. You really want your economy to be in terms of stable units of account of things with low volatility. And so we want that to grow. So the reward to the build stakers where build is this token that is intended to be able to grow with the size of the economy. It provides rewards for the economy growing the amount of IST transacting the amount of economic activity, not just the amount of thrashing of computers happening. And so that means it&#8217;s the equivalent of paying your rent in dollars, not paying your rent.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Huge.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Okay, so back to BitGo. So the thing that BitGo brings is they bring a network of 1500 institutions, make whales and exchanges. And so that provides much better, much richer, much easier access to build for the larger world of economic participants in crypto and growing. They also work with, and this is one of the places where it&#8217;s just so exciting to find this alignment where they work with major brands and sort of enterprises and small and medium companies as well, but they work with Web2 companies, they work with traditional companies that are trying to find their way into how can we work safely with crypto in a way that brings its value but keeps us in our lane, producing value that we need to for our customers. And wether that&#8217;s the Nikes of the world that are dipping their toe into NFTs to celebrate activity, or NFTs to provide access to events and access to private content, those are really valuable. But that&#8217;s not something that they should dive directly in and expose themselves to the kinds of regulatory thing that BitGo is already expert at and a lot of us are already experienced with. And so working with BitGo aligns well with we&#8217;re an ideal platform for Web2 applications to start getting to start moving over into Web3 and adding Web3 capability because you&#8217;re already programming in a language that they already know. It already works with their existing tools vs. Code and Webstorm, it uses the best in practice style of programming of libraries with components that you can reuse. And those are things that the rest of crypto just doesn&#8217;t really have. And it&#8217;s sort of the bar that Web2 programmers kind of expect. And this is one of the ways that we are one of the fundamental bridges for getting crypto access out to the mainstream world of developers and giving mainstream developers the ability to get in, try things without having to spend six months learning a language that they might never want to use again. Right? Instead, let&#8217;s just use the stuff they&#8217;ve got and meet them where they&#8217;re at. And so partnering with BitGo, we just got a bunch of opportunities there.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>100%. Dean, you&#8217;ve been on a roll here. One more question and then we will wrap up as we are getting a little tight for time. Bitcoin, absolutely massive right now. More powerful than ever with the recent ETF news. We love to see that you&#8217;re big on institutional adoption. You guys are doing a bunch for institutional adoption of DeFi. We just talked about that with Agoric&#8217;s partnership with BitGo. Let&#8217;s jump into Bitcoin in particular and something that you guys are doing, which is the Babylon integration for Bitcoin timestamping. This is a little above my pay grade. I don&#8217;t completely understand the importance of this. I&#8217;d love if you could dumb it down and explain it to a non dev guy like myself. Walk me through this integration, this partnership, and why and how Babylon integration for Bitcoin timestamping is so important.</p>
<p><b>Dean Tribble<br />
</b>Sure. So remember I said the value Blockchain brings is multiple machines in different jurisdictions running the same stuff and coming to consensus. There are lots of different mechanisms for consensus, and that&#8217;s getting faster and stronger and better. So Bitcoin has the granddaddy magic that Satoshi brought to the world, which is this proof of work Consensus, right? So the simple thing, people, when they hear about Consensus, they think voting, right? I&#8217;ve got an electorate. There&#8217;s an issue at hand. They vote. The issue might be, did Dean win the election or did he get his money back? Because in Agoric, it&#8217;s one or the other, and I can&#8217;t get rugged, right? But it&#8217;s a bunch of machines that they vote. And if I know what all those machines are, I can count the votes. Okay, now, it turns out to be much more complicated than that, because I can count the votes, but why should you trust me? So instead, there&#8217;s these weird protocols so that all of them count the votes and they come to agreement that they all agree that Dean won the auction or whatever it is, right? And so that Consensus is critical for decentralization. It means that compromising some subset of those machines, you can&#8217;t compromise the integrity of execution, because two thirds plus one will still vote that Dean won the auction. And the people that some organization compromised, well, they just end up getting voted off the island, right? Because they&#8217;re clearly out to lunch. And so that ability to, if I can name all the machines they can vote, is where proof of stake and these fast finality engines come in. But what Bitcoin came up with was, this was before we knew how to do decentralized proof of stake. And people wonder about it. It still means that people with money could do the staking. There&#8217;s always concerns, as we continue to try to push the limits of how sure can we make it that these are not subject to compromise. The thing that proof of work does in Bitcoin in particular is it has a model where machines can come to Consensus without knowing all the machines participating, right? So there could be 10,000 machines participating, none of which I&#8217;ve heard of, and yet they can come to consensus, and it sounds like magic. That&#8217;s why I refer to it as the proof of work magic that Satoshi brought to the table. It really was important and novel. That was a huge contribution to the world&#8217;s ability to do safe computation. And so it continues to exist. One of the values of Bitcoin is that it kind of is the same thing. It&#8217;s kind of stable over time. It&#8217;s not evolving rapidly to adapt to what it is we need right now. People like to refer to it as money. To my concern, to my perspective, it is not a money. It is an asset. It is like gold. Its value may change, but it is this valuable asset. At some point, they&#8217;re not making more of it. It&#8217;s clear how much it inflates all that sort of thing. So it makes a great asset on which to base things and so forth. And so it has this novel security model that is time tested, is well understood and really seems robust and will be robust going into the future. The nice thing about what Babylon brings is let&#8217;s take all these additional things that people are doing for faster performance that we all think is secure. But like any crypto algorithm, you think it&#8217;s secure until it&#8217;s not. And so one of the nice things that the Babylon chain does is it brings back all of those things and links them back to the granddaddy security model of Bitcoin. And you don&#8217;t really want a lot of proof of work chains because it&#8217;s slow. It takes a long time to be sure it&#8217;s gotten to finality. It&#8217;s power intensive and so forth. But it is uniquely powerful in the assurance that it gives you. So by being able to link all these novel things going out there back to the security of Bitcoin, you now get all the security weight, all of that assurance that Bitcoin&#8217;s expensive security model provides, you can now provide it to all these much faster, much lighter, much more expressive systems out there like Agoric. And so it&#8217;s one of those things, where did we need it now? No, you don&#8217;t need security until, oops, I wish we had had security. You need it before you need to put it in place before you need it. And since this is a year where the ability to abstract across chains, chain abstraction, right? Agoric is a key part of the future of chain abstraction, the future of making it so that people coming in, they can just experience all these assets and services without thinking very hard about where they&#8217;re at. You were a key ingredient of that. We could ramp very quickly. And having that security in the bank as it were having that underpinning there in place is really a nice thing to have, right? It&#8217;s a nice value to be able to lean on when we need it going forward. So that&#8217;s why that&#8217;s exciting. Additionally, it is an example of this broad connectivity, this ability to orchestrate across chains. And so the ability to have Bitcoin and start to access it as an asset value Babylon is a great example. One of the earliest of hey, this asset out there, we can apply it in ways that don&#8217;t compromise its integrity, but instead leverage it to do these other things. Starting to get it in where Bitcoin is the token that everybody knows already. JavaScript is the programming language that everybody knows already. The future potential of pulling those together. And I note, incidentally, that BitGo is the one that does wrap Bitcoin potential of being able to enable all the programmers in the world to program the main asset they&#8217;ve already heard of. If they&#8217;ve been hiding under a rock or hiding in an IT group somewhere, that&#8217;s the kind of thing where opportunistically that could easily become really important.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Za hab. We are buzzing, as always, still in Mexico, episode 301, what a treat. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show who also has the best name in the world and who is also rocking the off yellow shirt, the off yellow tarp. However, his looks like a beautiful traditional finance tarp, like a big old banker. And then there&#8217;s me looking like a peasant with the Uniqlo off yellow shirt. No free ads, but these Uniqlo shirts are pretty comfy. Time for the intro. Today we have Matthew Graham, managing partner of Ryze Labs and one of the key drivers of the long term strategic vision and mission of the firm. Matthew founded Ryze back in 2015. Wow, what a rip. Initially as a sell side tech investment banking platform with a focus on representing international tech companies for strategic partnership and investment in emerging markets, Matthew has been involved in the blockchain industry since 2013. A true chiseled veteran, and has supported many great entrepreneurs and companies through good and bad times. Super pumped to have you on, Matthew. Welcome to the show, my friend. How are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Great to be here. This will be a lot of fun. Thanks for that. Great intro. We got the same name. We&#8217;re dressed the same. I think we&#8217;re ready to go.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>We planned it. Yeah. If you guys are watching this and not listening, you guys are in for a treat. This is going to be a good one. Let&#8217;s jump right into it. Talk of the talk, the creme de la creme right now everyone&#8217;s talking about the Bitcoin ETF. This is going to air on Thursday, January 18, folks, we are recording one day earlier. So this episode is going to be hot and fresh. Bitcoin ETF, it popped off. Everyone thought it was going to rip. I was glued to CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap. I was glued to Twitter for those first couple of days checking all the inflows. I know we did break all the records for most inflows and highest volume for any ETF over the first couple days. We love to see that, but we don&#8217;t love to see the price action. What happened there? Was this part of this whole GPTC where everyone was selling off in order to move into the ETF. Matthew, give us the laydown. Give us the lowdown. What happened with the first week of trading with the Bitcoin ETF?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure, it did end up being a sell the news situation for sure. We actually view these ETF inflows and outflows as quite important. So we&#8217;re actually currently internally doing a real deep dive on this issue. But currently my view is that selling from GPTC was probably a significant factor. Beyond that, it may be a little hard to say, but I think the short term price action is mostly a sideshow from what I think is really substantially more important. And here&#8217;s what I think is more important. The Bitcoin ETF has been an enormous success. In fact, the aggregate trading volume of the new Bitcoin ETFs are substantially higher than the trading volume of all, approximately 500 ETFs that were launched in 2023, all of them put together. So let me just repeat that, because it&#8217;s so important, you combine everything launched in 2023, all the United States ETFs, combine them all, the trading volume of all those combined, you compare it to the new Bitcoin ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs are higher in trading volume than everything done in 2023. I repeated it because I think that&#8217;s really quite extraordinary. This is a blockbuster success for the Bitcoin ETF in terms of people demonstrating that they absolutely want this product. So what that means is very quickly, Wall Street is going to become addicted to this asset class. This is only the first domino to fall. I think that&#8217;s bullish for the prospect of an Ethereum ETF in terms of these powerful Wall Street interests that will be even more determined to make this happen. I think it&#8217;s extremely positive for Wall Street in general, getting more involved in this industry. I think that is the most important takeaway for me from the Bitcoin ETF rather than short term price action, maybe influenced by GPTC outflows. Honestly, who cares? I think that small potatoes compared to this much more important thing, which is that huge success for Wall Street, they&#8217;re going to want to do this more and more in all different ways, participate in our industry.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, well said there. Speaking of the ETF, I had a buddy, it was actually yesterday, and he was at Atlanta airport, and obviously that&#8217;s one of the biggest and most popular airports in the world. He had to go to two different terminals because his flight got canceled. Long story short, in both terminals, he saw an advertisement for two different ETFs. I believe it was the Valkyrie one was one of them, and the other one, it may have even been. I think it might have been the BlackRock. But these guys, it&#8217;s a weekend and they already have ads in airport terminals like, this is bananas. What can we see from an actual pushing the ETF perspective? Like, are these guys going to go balls to the walls with advertisements and calling all the brokers and trying to get this in everyone hands as quick as possible.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Matt, this is such a great point, so I&#8217;m really glad you brought this up. We&#8217;ve actually been having a lot of conversations with people around just this issue in recent weeks. So an ETF is fundamentally a commodity product, by which I mean that there is not a huge differentiator from any one Bitcoin ETF compared to any one of the others. Mechanics may differ around the margins, at least for this class of Bitcoin ETFs. There are some nuances around if it&#8217;s cash to cash, or actually, there&#8217;s some nuances on the mechanics, but you can think of at least this class of Bitcoin ETFs as substantially all the same. So what that means is that from the provider perspective, there is a substantial risk of a war on fees, and that these fees will ultimately be driven to zero, which means not literally zero, but 0.2%. Let&#8217;s say 0.1% even effectively. Here&#8217;s what that means. The Bitcoin ETF providers are trying to establish beachheads through marketing, thinking that at least some of the inflows will be sticky and they can decrease the probability of competing only on price. So, as Matt, as you identified already through the example of your friend, who, God help him, is in Atlanta, I think pulling out for that guy. But at any rate, through the example of your friend, we are already seeing that there is absolutely going to be balls to the walls marketing on these ETFs. And that is enormously powerful for our industry. It&#8217;s enormously powerful in showing people that our industry, I mean, we all know this, but people outside our industry still may have question marks that our industry is here to stay, that it&#8217;s going to be a powerful asset class. I know that&#8217;s hard to imagine because we&#8217;re at one point x trillion dollars as an asset class, 1.6, or whatever it is today. Hard to imagine. But for people outside our industry, they may still have question marks, and this is going to be very powerful for demonstrating our legitimacy. The fact that this is an institutional ready asset class, and it&#8217;s going to start causing people to really think about, not if they take this industry seriously or if they should buy some Bitcoin, but rather asking questions like what percentage of my portfolio should be crypto questions like that. So I really think it&#8217;s enormously important, the marketing spent.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>So as a consumer, and I know we are buzzing on the Bitcoin ETF, it&#8217;s just such a powerful and present day topic. We&#8217;ll move on. But last question here. As a consumer or as a market manager, how do you choose what ETF to put your clients in? Is it strictly just like you said, the battle of advertising and marketing? Is it the one who has the lowest fee for the first little bit? Is it the one who&#8217;s doing the social good and giving 10% back to the Bitcoin miners? How do you choose which one to get into if it&#8217;s really all the same product at the end of the day?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So I&#8217;m not really in the business of advising on Bitcoin ETFs, but if a buddy said to me, hey, quick question which ETF should I do? I would say just sort them by fees. Go with the one with the lowest fee is probably your best bet. I would probably double check to make absolutely sure that that would be my final recommendation. But yeah, ultimately, these are commodity products, and the providers of these products do not want people to think like that. They want instead people to think emotionally, which is why they&#8217;re running expensive ad campaigns.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, well said there. Let&#8217;s jump into some, we can also get into some of you and your team&#8217;s investments. And you guys have done an incredible job, by the way, and I can&#8217;t wait to get into that. But let&#8217;s talk about some of the 2024 trends as we&#8217;re still hot and fresh, nice and early in the year. We&#8217;ve seen Solana absolutely rip its pants off and go for just an absolute ripper. Magoo it&#8217;s made a lot of people a lot of money, especially all those folks who sort of bought at the top last year. And if they did hold all the way down to the nine dollar mark and wrote it back up, good for them. We&#8217;re seeing Deepn, which is a massive trend right now, account abstraction in Ethereum. We&#8217;re seeing a lot of decentralized finance trends. A whole lot of everything. What are you most excited for? Liquid staking, I also have to mention, are there any trends in particular, Matthew, that are really tickling you and your team&#8217;s fancy right now that you guys have all eyes on?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So we&#8217;re looking at a number of different narratives, as we always do. Maybe I&#8217;ll just pick one that I spent most of my time on today. Today we&#8217;ve been looking carefully at the probability of an Ethereum ETF analyzing that very carefully. Will it be considered a commodity or a security? Maybe because of the futures product precedent that is passed. Maybe because of that, there&#8217;s precedent that it could be treated as a commodity. So we&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time looking at Ethereum ETF, if it&#8217;s going to happen or not. The first time that it could get approved is in May. Of course, it would not launch in May, but that could be substantially bullish for Ethereum. And additionally, the new Cancun upgrade and some of the new EIPs we think could be quite conducive as well to reducing congestion effectively and lowering the cost of transactions on Ethereum. On a related note, we&#8217;re also carefully looking at RWAs, and we do think that there&#8217;s a substantial probability that Ethereum will be a natural home for RWAs. So we&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time on Ethereum in recent days, and in fact, with myself specifically, I spent a lot of my time on Ethereum today.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>ETH hasn&#8217;t gone up in price as much as everyone would have liked to over the last little bit. Is there a specific reason for this? I know you guys are obviously super tied into everything in this regard. And just as a quick little follow up to this question, how could the ETH ETF, are we going to see similar buy the narrative, sell the news kind of thing by the ETF, sell the news? What&#8217;s going to go on with the ETH ETF if it does happen in May, like a lot of people think it will?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>I think that there is also a grayscale ETH product, so there could be selling pressure as a result of that. I&#8217;d have to look at the details, but that&#8217;s certainly a possibility, and I think that could be by the narrative and ultimately sell the official event. That&#8217;s a possibility, but I think there&#8217;s always high error bars around it. Your first question, or the first part of your question, was around Ethereum and perhaps why it&#8217;s underperformed a little bit in recent months. Yeah, so I gave some reasons why Ethereum possibly might have a more bullish 2024. There&#8217;s also another factor to that, which I think explains why it&#8217;s been underperforming recently. So, as I was explaining it the other day, if you have, for example, Bitcoin, which has a substantially smaller feature set, it&#8217;s robust, it&#8217;s well understood, it has a compelling narrative around it, it can do a few things very well, such as capture people that are interested in digital gold. On the other end of the spectrum, you have something like Solana, which has an enormously rich feature set that can do many, many things quite well, if you&#8217;re on those two opposite ends of the spectrum, I think those are two really interesting places to be. If you split the middle of those two things, I think that&#8217;s tough.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Good point.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>You&#8217;re going to have a lot of people who are saying, well, Bitcoin is probably better for that than Ethereum, and a lot of people who are going to say, well, Solana is really more suitable than Ethereum for this. So I think that creates a lot of difficulties. But with that said, for example, RWAs may have a natural home on Ethereum. We&#8217;ll have to see. But to the extent that narrative does take off, to the extent these Cancun and these new EIPs prove to be catalysts, there could be a more compelling 2024. But I think that there&#8217;s still this fundamental challenge of competitive positioning.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, there&#8217;s so many different narratives about ETH right now, and your team sent over an incredible little cheat sheet to help prep for this Podcast. And one thing that I was completely unaware of, Matthew, is that Celsius has approximately 300 million cited in ETH as a primary factor planning to unstake its ETH holdings. I believe it actually started a couple of weeks ago on January 4, and distribute these to creditors in Ethereum or convert them to USDC. There is also a give or take, ten day elongated ETH withdrawal queue. I still can&#8217;t believe that Celsius has this much of a pull on the market, you know what I mean? Because it happened, what, two years ago with FTX and Celsius. You don&#8217;t even want it to be front of mind because it had such a negative impact. But these things, they&#8217;re still fucking our day up. It&#8217;s like years later what&#8217;s going on with the whole Celsius and FTX?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sorry, go ahead. It&#8217;s like all those words you muted on Twitter, right? You can&#8217;t take it anymore. I&#8217;m going to just mute Celsius.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>But yeah, unfortunately, there&#8217;s still to some extent an overhang for our industry. But you know, for specific products and in specific ways, we do still have aftershocks, even today from some of the tumult that we had earlier. I truly, really look forward to never hearing some of these names again, but unfortunately, they do impact us still.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s truly wild. I&#8217;d love to jump to some VC views here, just sort of strictly from a VC perspective. Obviously, you are currently in Asia. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about some of the difference in regards to the regulatory environment in Asia versus western markets. And if you could tie that into sort of the light of the BTC ETF approval, that would be great as well.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>So I think the first thing that it strikes me as really quite important is I don&#8217;t think you can discuss it in terms of an Asia regulatory framework, for example. It&#8217;s very tempting to do that. I fully get that. But it really varies considerably from country to country. And in fact, it even varies considerably from mainland China to Hong Kong. So I really think you kind of have to go jurisdiction by jurisdiction. Mainland China, for example, is not necessarily super friendly to crypto. There are a lot of misconceptions. People think that Bitcoin is banned in mainland China, which is not true, but still, it&#8217;s not super friendly at all. Whereas Hong Kong is really quite permissive by comparison. So if it really makes sense to even differentiate between mainland China and Hong Kong, it definitely makes sense to differentiate between Vietnam and Singapore and Thailand and India and all these places throughout Asia. So that&#8217;s the first thing that I would really emphasize. I think there are a lot of dangers to treating it as a monolithic block.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Very interesting. It&#8217;s, again, for someone like me, mean the only part of Asia I&#8217;ve been to is India. I&#8217;ve unfortunately never been to China or Hong Kong or Eastern Asia. It&#8217;s on the to do list. I will get there. And we&#8217;ve had so many really incredible VCs, similar to yourself on the show, who do reside in Asia and work a lot of magic in Asia, and we don&#8217;t get to see or use any of these incredible products that are in Asia as well. That I feel like does have a lot of emphasis on how you would choose to invest. Even like the WeChat, right? These super products that us over here in, you know, we have our iPhone, we have WhatsApp. I mean, heck, unless if you&#8217;re in Canada and USA, you don&#8217;t even use WhatsApp, you use iMessage. And then you have these mega company conglomerates in Asia and China, like the WeChats where you have your bank, you have your messaging, you have your commerce, you have absolutely everything. It&#8217;s pretty freaking cool to see. Are there any crypto specific companies, Matthew, at the moment, that are really making moves in Asia because it&#8217;s such a massive friggin market? Are there any on your radar that are really getting you guys going?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Let me answer in this way. So one of the most important things actually, for my business is the fact that the information asymmetry between east and west, west and east in our industry is absolutely enormous. It&#8217;s staggering.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>For a recent example is with ordinals. Ordinals took off far faster and is still far more popular in Asia, especially in China, frankly, versus the west. So as a result of having access to boots on the ground and information both west and east, we were able to be one of the first investors anywhere in the west to actually invest in ordinals and related technologies. It is absolutely fascinating. Far more than TradFi by a factor of ten, if not 100. How little the relationship circles overlap, how little information is transmitted both ways, east and west, west and east. It absolutely blows my mind whenever I think about it. There&#8217;s just absolutely enormous differences in consumer preferences, in narratives and popular coins and things like that. For example, if I were to name the most popular meme coin in recent weeks, or one of them in China, I think with high confidence. You haven&#8217;t heard of it. RATS like the animal. One of the most popular meme coins in Asia recently. Of course you haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Big no.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Right? And so there&#8217;s just this enormous gap. No, obviously. Please. That&#8217;s a shit coin.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah. Not financial advice.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Absolutely not even like, it&#8217;s a shitty meme coin. Okay. But there&#8217;s shitcoins and meme coins and maybe there&#8217;s some overlap. This is a shitty meme coin. All right? It&#8217;s garbage. I just want to be clear. But at any rate, it has been enormously popular and there&#8217;s no visibility at all of that internationally. So again, similarly, ordinals massively earlier in Asia, massively more popular to this day. There are many narratives like that. Solana is much more popular in the west. Polygon is much more popular in India. There are a lot of geographic and community differences in our industry to an extent that really is quite staggering to me to this day.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It&#8217;s so cool and very well explained there.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>I&#8217;ve seen so many crazy you know because it&#8217;s just like in Asia, it&#8217;s one thing, same as in the west. There are funny videos and all kinds of weird jokes. I&#8217;ve seen so many RATS videos, I never want to see another one. Please do not send me RATS videos.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yes. Folks, not investment advice. He has just given us a good story to fortify the point of east versus west narratives. But huge shout out to our sponsor of Tthe show PrimeXBT.

And I&#8217;m back to the show with Matthew. Let&#8217;s jump into a couple more VC questions and VC points here. I think being a VC is an incredible job. I know it&#8217;s sort of been glorified over the last ten years, especially with someone like me who spends far too much time on Twitter. I follow a shit ton of VCs. Seems like a really cool job. Obviously, you got to work your ass off, you got to work your tail off, and it&#8217;s all about getting that little itty bit of alpha to hit a home run. It&#8217;s a volume based game. Anytime I have a VC on the show, I always need to ask, how do you and your team go about your investment strategy? Are there any queries or nuances that you really dig down on that you really look into, right? Besides the obvious, like, what is the overall market? Like, what&#8217;s the tam, what&#8217;s the moat? How good is the team? Is this the first time founder. Are there any sort of weird ones, weird pointers, nuances that you could discuss about how you and the team go about your investment strategy?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>I think ultimately, as a VC, especially in earlier stages, ultimately you are betting on people. And I think that especially in crypto, you want to have someone that you are confident will plug away. A lot of people work on projects for three months and then they say, oh, I didn&#8217;t immediately get traction. Now I&#8217;m going to work on something else, or they&#8217;ll have a huge success with their first product, and then they&#8217;ll say, well, instead of continuing to develop that, we will develop adjacent products, but we&#8217;ll do that under new tokens, which is not great for your investors. So I think one of the most important things, especially in earlier stages, is to probe and evaluate the extent to which you think that someone is likely to keep grinding away for long periods of time, basically.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>And that&#8217;s number one, of course. Give me some weird ones here, Matthew. Any super weird ones where a team came in with a new narrative, or is there something about a pitch deck, perhaps, or the way someone dresses or anything, any sort of weird hunches and follow up to that is the importance of trusting your gut. Was there ever one where your gut was just like, Matthew, you need to do this. I have to do this.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>I look for a lot of trust related signals. It&#8217;s probably one that is a good answer to your question. So I carefully observe how people treat their wife or girlfriend, their kids, if they have pets, I&#8217;m more likely to trust them. To be honest, I look for a lot of trust related signals. I&#8217;m less likely to trust someone if they don&#8217;t like animals and kids.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>100%, I love that. What about some of your biggest winners and losers that you can talk about? Did you and the team pass up any behemoths that still sort of eat you away? And I hate to ask the negative s question, but the people are going to love it. Any big winners and big losers that you can discuss on the show here Matthew?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So, of course, it&#8217;s well known that we were very early investors in Solana. Although we accumulated most of our position in the secondary market, we were extremely early out of our institutional fund. We&#8217;re thrilled about our performance with layer zero, where we came in at seed. Those are two examples that we are well known for in terms of the ones that got away. Okay, I&#8217;ll give you an example. At this point in time, I was not yet investing my own money. I was not doing angel checks at this time, and I should have made an exception because I remember getting a deck in 2015, I guess it was. And I said to my team that this is the best deck I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life. This is the most compelling thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. And I should have said to myself, well, you&#8217;re not doing angel checks. Maybe you should do your first angel checks. But I didn&#8217;t think that way. I just thought, this is absolutely fucking amazing. And I just didn&#8217;t think, any guesses as to what that was?</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>ETH?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>No, but I mean, the timing is right.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>It wasn&#8217;t. ETH. What was it?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>BitMEX best deck I&#8217;ve ever.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>What made the deck so good?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>It was absolutely crystal clear that this was the right team. An opportunity that super fucking made sense. It was just enormously compelling in terms of them demonstrating clarity of vision that they had the people to accomplish the vision demonstrating that they already had, even in the earliest iterations, something that people wanted. It was like, jaw dropping g ood. I mean, it was really astonishingly compelling.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I&#8217;m just taking notes here on the secret sauce of making a pitch deck here. So BitMEX came across. And obviously they are bloody huge. What can you and the team learn from something like this?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Well, I think what I should have learned is that you should be willing to bend your own rules if something&#8217;s that fucking good.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>If something that appealing comes across the table should be broken.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>If you&#8217;re not doing angel checks and it&#8217;s the best fucking thing you&#8217;ve ever seen, maybe you should do an angel check.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Maybe write a check. I was just going to ask you about your gut, just because this is a subject that I&#8217;m extremely passionate about and I journal myself and I look back at times when I made good or bad decisions and either did or didn&#8217;t trust my gut. What was your gut saying at the time? Are you just reiterating the points that you&#8217;ve said over the last two minutes where just everything screamed, this is going to be a home run? This is absolutely freaking incredible.</p>
<p><b>Matthew</b> <b>Graham</b><br />
Yeah, I just thought it was absolutely going to be a home run. Just like, this guy is going to fucking kill it. Which actually, I was off by a year or two because he struggled. Arthur struggled for the first year or two. In fact, he struggled to get funding. Even when he got some funding, he struggled to get substantial traction to the point where they entered an accelerator in mainland China, in Shanghai, I think it was. It&#8217;s called China accelerator. It&#8217;s owned by SOSV. So they had gotten funding. They were not getting traction. They gave away equity to an accelerator, is how badly they were struggling. So actually, it took them a good year or two of grinding. So I was wrong in the sense that I thought it was going to be an immediate fucking home run. I was wrong about that, but actually, the breakthrough moment for them is when they implemented 100X leverage was actually when they just went hockey stick.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, to the moon. Very cool. Matthew, you&#8217;ve been absolutely on fire here. We are getting a little tight for time. A couple more questions. I want to go back to 2024 investment narrative. Investment trends. I named off a couple. Is there any in particular that you and the team are super keen on right now? 2024 investment trends and investment narratives.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure, there&#8217;s a lot we&#8217;re keen on, but to give another example, we are having the most innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem that we&#8217;ve had in quite some time. So that&#8217;s really very fascinating to us, and we&#8217;re spending a lot of time looking at that. Already made some investments around that space. They aren&#8217;t public yet, but we&#8217;re very excited about them.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Anything else like Deepn or liquid staking? Are these narratives too far out for you guys to dabble, or are these actually the true thing?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>We are actively looking at both those sectors. I can&#8217;t expand on that at that time, but we are actively looking at both those sectors. You could probably assume my meaning is more than that. And then with Deepn specifically, though, I do still hold the view that with the possible exception of Helium, I think in the bullcase for Deepn. In the bullcase three years from now, if you look at a top ten Deepn list, I think it will be very different than it is today, with the possible exception of Helium. But I do think that&#8217;s a very compelling sector, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Interesting. Last question. Give me a hot take. Something super friggin spicy. Seshuan spicy. I&#8217;m talking blow your socks off spicy. Matthew, give me one hot take before we let you go today.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Gary Gensler will be gone at this time next year. He&#8217;s out of here this time next year.</p>
<p><b>Matt</b> <b>Zahab</b><br />
Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>There have been a lot of rumors swirling that he might have 1ft out the door anyway for some time. Even rumors of he was thinking of making a congressional run. A lot of different stuff, but it&#8217;s not a high confidence hot take. You want a hot take? It was the first one that came to mind.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Maybe it&#8217;s just a wish, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Me too. I would love that. I would absolutely love that. Matthew, you were an absolute treat today. Learned a ton and had a lot of fun. Can&#8217;t wait for round two. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you personally and Ryze Labs online and on socials?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So I&#8217;m on Twitter. I&#8217;m notoriously addicted to Twitter, and I can be found @mattyryze on Twitter, and Ryze Labs, ryzelabs.io . And we are on Twitter as well.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Love it. And last question. I didn&#8217;t even ask. What about the name Ryze? Where did that come from?</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>Sure. So we rebranded because our initial name reflected our China specialty, but we&#8217;ve long since had grown to having an emerging market specialty. So we wanted a name that could fit with our growth trajectory and that had some good connotations around it. We have boots on the ground everywhere from Latin America to India, China, Singapore, and a lot of different places in between. So we wanted a name that could kind of keep up with us.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love it. It&#8217;s clean and it&#8217;s got a z in it. Big fan. Matthew thank you so much. Absolute pleasure having you on and can&#8217;t wait for round two.</p>
<p><b>Matthew Graham<br />
</b>All right, thank you.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, and this is an extra special episode for a couple of reasons, folks. Episode number 300 of the Cryptonews Podcast. This thing started almost three years ago, just less than three years ago. Crazy to think here we are still buzzing. The train is still on the tracks. 300 episodes later. Love you guys so much. Thank you as always for tuning in. Without the listeners, this show would still not be on the tracks. Love you guys so much gratitude. Thank you for everything. And it truly warms my heart that we have somehow gotten to episode 300 and it&#8217;s been a ride. Hopefully we have another 300 in store. Reason number two why this episode is extra special the Bitcoin ETF got approved yesterday. Folks we are recording on Thursday, January 11th. This is going to air on Monday the 15th and we have a Bitcoin ETF locked and loaded. It has finally happened and I can&#8217;t wait to get into it with the one and only Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata. Greg has spent over a decade as a professional trader in traditional finance markets with proprietary firms such as SMB Capital, Chopper Trading and DRW, before co founding and working as CEO of Genesis Volatility, a leading crypto options insights provider. Genesis Volatility was acquired by Amberdata in 2022 to grow their options data analytics capabilities for their roster of institutional clients such as Citi, NASDAQ, Franklin Templeton. Ever heard of them? And more. Super pumped to have you on for episode 300. Greg, welcome to the show, my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Doing great. Thank you, Matt. And I&#8217;m very happy that we spoke a little French before the show. Very happy to hear that as well. That was very cool.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. Got a fellow French Canadian on the pod. We love to see that. And it&#8217;s also episode 300, which is incredible. One thing that stands out before we get into the Bitcoin ETF, obviously you and the team at Genesis Volatility, you guys were acquired, and congrats on that. That is absolutely huge by Amberdata. And as I was reading the bio, the last firm of your roster of institutional clients was Franklin Templeton. Did you see the laser eyes that they put on their profile picture yesterday?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, I think it&#8217;s pretty on point. I mean, the laser eyes and 100k Bitcoin are sort of synonymous. And it&#8217;s pretty interesting that Ben Franklin is the guy on the $100 bill. 100k Bitcoin seems very much in the cards, so it&#8217;s on point.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I believe it was Will. The classic Will. How am I forgetting his last name? Anyways, you know who I&#8217;m talking about. Will. Oh, boy. The on-chain analytics guy for Bitcoin. My apologies, Will. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m forgetting your name. You&#8217;re one of the GOATs in the space. But he was the one who tweeted out yesterday that Franklin Templeton put the laser eyes on, and he&#8217;s like 1.4 trillion AUM. So when you have firms like Franklin Templeton putting laser eyes on their logo, you know shit&#8217;s about to get spicy. Let&#8217;s jump right into it here, Greg, Bitcoin ETF got approved yesterday. Again, folks, we are recording on Thursday, January 11. When you hear this, it will be Monday the 15th. Let&#8217;s get right into it. What does this mean for us? What does this mean for TradFi? What does this mean as a whole market for all of us? Start us off and then we&#8217;ll jump into some of the nitty gritty fun stuff here.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, I think in the medium to long term, it&#8217;s definitely bullish, upside trend. The way that I like to think about it is that if I look at assets under management in, say, North America alone, there&#8217;s about $53 trillion under management. It makes a lot of sense just from like, a modern portfolio theory perspective. Allocate 1% or 2% of a portfolio to crypto as an asset class, specifically Bitcoin, which we&#8217;ll have the ETF for. And so that&#8217;s easily a trillion dollars of flows over, say, call it the next twelve to 18 months. And right now, the Bitcoin market cap is 850 billion or 900 billion, around a trillion dollars itself. So if you increase flows, purchasing flows by a trillion dollars, that doesn&#8217;t double the market cap. That does something like 5X the market cap. Buying a trillion dollars of Bitcoin is going to move the market cap along the way as you&#8217;re trying to execute. So what I expect to happen is that slowly, financial advisors, pension funds, kind of the big traditional, risk averse, protect my capital, preserve my capital sort of mindset. We&#8217;ll naturally allocate some portfolio to Bitcoin as an asset class, an uncorrelated asset class with positive expected value. It&#8217;s exactly what you want to put into a portfolio.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>So you said it might 4X to 5X the market cap as a whole. What&#8217;s this going to do to the price? And I know price predictions. Little wishy washy. I know it&#8217;s a cop out question on my end, but it&#8217;s what the listeners want. It&#8217;s what everyone wants. You got to give the people what they want. What&#8217;s this going to do to the price? Present day we&#8217;re sitting at around 47K, give or take. If this 4 to 5X is, are we really going to hit six figs Bitcoin? Will this mean that we bring this up to 200k, 100k? What&#8217;s your price prediction here in regards to Bitcoin maybe a year from now, in 2025?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, I think a year from now. The $100,000 mark is very clear. That&#8217;s sort of the obvious mark. But 4 to 5X really puts it at 200 to 250 in terms of twice. Yeah, absolutely. I think it&#8217;s totally in the cards. Another thing that&#8217;s really interesting with sort of a Bitcoin ETF, as opposed to the existing ETFs that we have that are built on top of like CME futures, I&#8217;m thinking of specifically BETO, is that as people allocate funds to these ETFs, well, all of a sudden we&#8217;re starting to get coins put into cold storage in order to sort of back up the underlying value of these ETFs. And so the trading float of Bitcoin on-chain or the active coins&nbsp; on-chain , that&#8217;s going to slowly diminish as well. So you&#8217;ll sort of see sort of a more passive holding, a new entry of passive holders in Bitcoin. So the people who are really investing for the long term or doing a portfolio allocation, they&#8217;re not trading Bitcoin, they&#8217;re putting in a portfolio for multiple years. So that&#8217;s going to reduce the float, and I think that&#8217;s going to be pretty bullish as well for prices.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>I love that. I&#8217;d love if you could give myself and the listeners a quick rundown on how the ETF actually works, because this is to my understanding, and I&#8217;ve done a fair bit of research in this regard. It differs from the traditional ETFs as most ETFs have a basket of traditional stocks and bonds, equities, you name it. Many of the ETFs here have cut their fees and have some wild cash and carry models. And I was wondering if there&#8217;s any downside to sort of the cash and carry model versus the redemption of underlying assets. Also, not being able to withdraw Bitcoin from the ETF itself is sort of wild and just sort of fortifies the point that you just brought up in regards to there&#8217;s going to be a huge supply shock when so much Bitcoin is being held in cold storage. And with institutional custodial masters like your Coinbases, so on and so forth, what, and how do sort of all of these ETFs work? How do they work? I&#8217;d love if you&#8217;d give just a quick rundown in that regard, and then we&#8217;ll keep buzzing on this subject.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so one of the things that&#8217;s really interesting is if we compare to the past products like Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, which is a closed end fund, basically they have Bitcoin that they hold and they issue shares against that. But essentially you can&#8217;t do a redemption process. So that&#8217;s why we saw at first a premium to net asset values in the Grayscale ETF or the Pink Sheets ETF closed in fund, and then a discount later on. If we look at regular ETFs like we&#8217;re finally getting now, there&#8217;s two kind of models for creation and redemption of shares. The process of creating and redeeming shares is to enable the actual price of the ETF to track the net asset value accurately. So we won&#8217;t get these types of premiums or discounts that we saw in Grayscale&#8217;s previous ETF. And then there&#8217;s in kind. So basically, like you said, creating and redeeming shares with actual Bitcoin or in cash, which is going to be like the cash equivalent value. So I think the process of doing the actual underlying for creating a redemption was sort of a new complexity, especially with digital assets that I think the SEC was not fully comfortable with. But you essentially are going to get the same monetary experience, or the same economic value in terms of experience by the cash creation and redemption scheme. So basically, people will buy and sell shares at the cash value of the theoretical underlying Bitcoin. So that&#8217;ll be a great way to have a clean ETF product. And then if we compare it to what&#8217;s existing right now in terms of BETO, which is going to be rolling to two front month contracts in CME, that&#8217;s going to be, again, a deviation of spot. So CME futures will sometimes trade at a premium to spot, sometimes they trade at a discount, and then there&#8217;s this kind of consistent contango or carry that grinds away the value of the ETFs itself. And so now, again, with the new spot ETF, that will be adjusted for as well, and we won&#8217;t have that type of persistent grind from the contango basis.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>That&#8217;s huge. How funny are the names as well? Like some of these names that are coming off like, I love the tickers, rather, not the names, but you have HODL, you have, like, do you not find it wild that again, the biggest financial institutions in the world have picked literal memes for their tickers? Who would have thought that that would ever happen?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, I think that&#8217;s really funny and it&#8217;s like, super interesting. It&#8217;s also some of the more new ETF issuers that have those crazy names like VanEck has. They&#8217;re on Twitter, they&#8217;re posting funny memes and stuff like that. They&#8217;re really engaging in sort of this younger investor culture with memes and sort of inside jokes in the industry that crypto Twitter often pings back and forth. So we&#8217;ll see if that really attracts the investor base, because right now there&#8217;s going to be a lot of competition for assets between all the various ETFs. So we&#8217;ll see who really wins. But it&#8217;s cool to see A, sort of that meme culture being included with some of these firms, and then B, some of these firms are actually sharing some of their profit splits and giving it back to the Bitcoin core foundation. So I think stuff like that is really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah, that is great. Speaking of the different ETFs, how the heck does one sort of choose which of the, I believe 11 right now perhaps 13. How does one choose which ETF to invest in? Is it as simple as whatever your financial advisor has ties to? Like, if you&#8217;re with VanEck, if you&#8217;re with BlackRock, whatever the case may be, all the fees seem pretty similar. Everyone seems to be giving back between two and a half to 10% to the Bitcoin foundation or Bitcoin developers. How does one choose which ETF to invest in?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so that&#8217;s really interesting. So there&#8217;s going to be sort of different audiences, but the way that I would make this choice, what&#8217;s really interesting to me is going to be the options market that are listed on these ETFs. I think this is the catalyst to grow crypto vault trading. 5X, 10X. So what we&#8217;re going to see is, first of all, not every ETF is going to have options listed against it. So the ones that do have options listed against it are going to be, naturally, the more popular ones will get most of the volume. And then from there, it&#8217;s going to take a little bit of time to see which ETF actually has sort of that sticky volume, and then volume begets more volume. So I think that&#8217;s really how it&#8217;s going to play out. It&#8217;s going to be the ones with the options market. And then within the options market, who has the most liquidity and where are most people playing? And then I think once that&#8217;s settled, it&#8217;s going to be really hard to dislodge the winner from that.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>And what about the price of these ETFs? Because again, a lot of people online, I had two friends called me yesterday TradFi friends who were like, oh, should I just buy the ETF at 47,000? And I&#8217;m like, look, I could be wrong here, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the ETF is not going to replicate the price of Bitcoin. This isn&#8217;t just a way into Bitcoin. They&#8217;re going to be priced how the owners of the ETF choose to price them. Is there going to be different pricing between everyone? Are they all going to be priced the same at the start and then sort of rise and fall in a correlative value? I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through sort of the process of how it gets priced and some of the price action we&#8217;re going to see when the ETFs do go for a rip and then fall down as well.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so pricing is going to be another one of those levers where people are going to try to bet, or these companies are going to best try to estimate what&#8217;s the most attractive trading price. I expect most of the ETFs to be between $20 and $100, what the price will be. And we saw something similar back when CME launches futures. So you saw the same type of scheme in terms of contract multipliers. CME had a 5X contract, whereas Sibo was able to secure the 1X contract. And so theoretically, the 1X contract is a lot cleaner product. You&#8217;re trading one contract for one Bitcoin. But in the end, that wasn&#8217;t enough of a differentiator to win over the volume that CME was able to capture. So I think, again, it&#8217;s one of those levers, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the main thing that will drive adoption for a particular ETF.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Well said there. Last question on the ETF, Greg, unless there&#8217;s anything else that you&#8217;d love to divulge into, but the difference in Volatility and Implied Volatility in the crypto market and the effect on BTC price, I&#8217;d love if you could tie this into the Bitcoin ETF. What is this going to do to Volatility and Implied Volatility in crypto markets? As a whole in relation to the ETF finally being approved.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah. So Implied Volatility is the options market&#8217;s best estimate or the pricing estimate of future Realized Volatility. And Realized Volatility is historically, how has this asset moved around? So if we look at the past four years of ball markets, we&#8217;ve had a consistent trend lower in Realized Volatility as Bitcoin has matured as an asset class. And I expect that that structural trend stays intact, but we have cyclical moments of higher Volatility. And so from mid October, the rally, as we broke above 30K with the sort of geopolitical conflicts going on in the Middle East, that was a catalyst for Cyclical Volatility that was quickly followed through by the ETF deadline and a narrative around the ETF decision. So we saw a nice pump in Realized Volatility and Implied Volatility as the options market was betting that we&#8217;d have a big vol event with this announcement. Turns out that the announcement itself had almost no Realized Volatility. So the options market overpriced the future movement. And I think that&#8217;s really one of the interesting things about crypto Volatility. I mean, crypto Volatility is really what I&#8217;m passionate about. And it&#8217;s one of these markets that not only do we not know the true value of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, but we even know less about the path of that valuation or the wiggles along the way, aka the Volatility of this asset class. So everyone&#8217;s trying to kind of figure this out on the fly. So it&#8217;s a really even playing field. And a lot of the most knowledgeable people will be people who are retail by definition, who&#8217;ve been around crypto for a long time and have a really good feel for it. So what we&#8217;re going to see here in terms of the path of future Volatility, I expect well capitalized investors to start maturing this market and making Volatility go down overall. But we&#8217;ll have some good episodes of interesting moments. And I think this is really when people who&#8217;ve been around for a while in the crypto space can really outperform.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Yeah. Take advantage of that. And that is exactly what you and the team do at Amberdata, and we are going to get into that in one quick second. But until then, Greg, we have to give a massive shout out to our sponsor of the show.

Let&#8217;s jump right into Amberdata. Give us the elevator pitch on what you and the team do, and then we&#8217;ll get into the nitty gritty here.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so Amberdata is a diversified digital assets data company. So we have blockchain data, we have DeFi data, we have spot market data, and then we have futures, perpetuals, and options data. So my role is really being in charge of the derivatives data, futures, perps, and options. But what&#8217;s really interesting about Amberdata is that we have the whole data suite, and again, crypto is a new asset class. We don&#8217;t know how to value it. We don&#8217;t know how to figure out how to trade the ball yet. We&#8217;re still figuring all that out as a community. But what&#8217;s even more interesting is that there&#8217;s new data assets. So on-chain&nbsp; data is a very interesting aspect, and there&#8217;s a lot of hidden treasures there that haven&#8217;t been figured out. And then combining that on-chain&nbsp; data with derivatives data with spot data, especially in a fragmented market where there&#8217;s exchanges all over the place, say, in Korea and Japan and in North America and Europe, that often trade at different prices or have different sort of investor bases, it&#8217;s a great way to essentially find patterns in the market that haven&#8217;t been discovered yet.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Greg, you and the team at Amberdata compile so much data from absolutely everywhere, especially from CEXs. And no, we&#8217;re not talking about porn sex, or wild sex. We&#8217;re talking about centralized exchanges here, CEXs. We&#8217;re talking about data directly from the CME Dex pool data, decentralized exchanges, and offshore exchanges. How do you guys sort of pick and choose which data to pull? What data moves the needle, what doesn&#8217;t? And then how do you sort of pile it all together to actually build out futures markets, derivatives markets, options trading markets, how does that whole process work?</p>
<p><b>Greg</b> <b>Magadini</b><br />
Yeah, so, typically, especially speaking for the derivatives element, if we&#8217;re looking at DeFi derivatives or centralized exchange derivatives, or TradFi derivatives, the number one thing that we start looking at, especially with the DeFi space, is how much adoption and engagement is occurring for a particular protocol. And so once we see that a particular protocol or a certain exchange has a lot of sort of volume and tight spreads and is trustworthy, then it becomes a real good candidate for us to include the data sets. Obviously, everyone&#8217;s limited resources, so we have to pick and choose sort of the best candidates for our developers to incorporate the data sets. And then we often create relationships with these exchanges or these protocols as well. And so chatting with the people who run these exchanges or run these protocols is a great way for us to understand sort of the quality behind the team and the product itself. And then from there, we will build features around it. We&#8217;ll consume the raw data, and then build derived data, works around that raw data, and really create actionable insights for our customers.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>And derivatives as a whole. I&#8217;d love if you could just give a quick sort of TLDR on derivatives trading in crypto differs a little from traditional derivatives. I get asked this all the time. I never have a good answer for it, as I rarely dabble with any type of future options or derivative trading. But how exactly does a derivative trading platform work? And what advice would you sort of give to, maybe not a rookie, because I would never, ever advise a rookie to dabble with derivatives, but perhaps a crypto trader who is becoming more seasoned and wants to dabble with derivatives. How would you explain it to them? And what advice would you give them if they wanted to get into the space?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so there&#8217;s kind of two core derivatives. There&#8217;s Delta One products and then nonlinear products. So delta one products are essentially linear, but they&#8217;re leveraged. So that&#8217;s really the futures and perpetuals of the world. You can think of being long or perpetual as a magnified position on the price going up or down, and you pay some sort of carry for that privilege. And so in a perpetual, the carry is periodic, say, every 8 hours in a future. It&#8217;s implicit in the future&#8217;s expiration. So a future that expires in three months might trade at a premium of $1,000 to the current Bitcoin price. And that is essentially the implied interest rate for being long that future, or what you would collect for being short that future. There&#8217;s really interesting cash and carry strategies you can do there, which are low risk as opposed to just betting on a magnified percentage move in the underlying. On the nonlinear side, which is Options, you have these payouts that are convex. And so you&#8217;re either taking convexity risk or you&#8217;re selling convexity risk. And that really comes down to what we analyze in the Implied Volatility markets. Convex payments essentially have a non symmetrical payout. So it&#8217;s sort of one of those things where if I win, I might win a much larger amount from long options than what I&#8217;m risking. But on the flip side, I sort of have a time decay component there. And so for that asymmetry, you pay a huge premium. And so you want to understand how that is being priced. And you do that by looking at the Options market. In terms of venues to trade these things, Deribit is sort of the most trusted and the largest venue in terms of nonlinear products. In terms of linear products, CME has now become number one space. So we can see the greatest open interest in CME futures as of today. And then again, the spot Bitcoin ETF is really going to be a nice place to expand the venues for North American traders, especially, who want to trade options on a product like Bitcoin.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Well said there. One of the things that I&#8217;m always curious about, how does options trading, because again, it&#8217;s still not massive, massive in crypto, but I feel like after the ETF is approved and it has been approved, I feel like it will become and continue to get bigger and bigger. How will this impact just traditional trading and pricing as a whole? Because if we have, let&#8217;s say, hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in interest, in forward interest, where you have tons of people and traders and institutions who all have levered longs, let&#8217;s just use Bitcoin, for example, and everyone thinks Bitcoin is going to rip, and they all have levered longs open. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about some of the network effects, like how does that affect the average Joe like myself, who doesn&#8217;t dabble in those types of products too often, what are the implications? What are the network effects of that?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so that&#8217;s actually a really interesting perspective, and I actually think it&#8217;s a counterintuitive answer. So although options enable traders to take more speculative risk if they choose to, truly what options do is that they&#8217;re like insurance, and they allow you to isolate the risk you want to take and defer the risk you don&#8217;t want to take. So in a lot of ways, what happens is that big investors, what they&#8217;ll do is they&#8217;ll derisk their Bitcoin exposure or their stock exposure. You see this in equity indexes a lot, and what they&#8217;ll do is that they&#8217;ll sell calls and buy puts and essentially reduce the Volatility of their exposure in one place and then transfer that risk to a market participant who&#8217;s willing to take that risk. So that&#8217;s typically like a market maker or a speculator on the other side. So what you could actually see is that it&#8217;s going to be part of the maturing process that should theoretically, over time, bring Volatility down. Now, one caveat here is that, again, with leveraged products, although most of the time I do think it&#8217;s going to be a derisking event because it allows people to derisk, in certain scenarios, the variance of variance, meaning there&#8217;ll be episodes where Volatility will be increased if everyone&#8217;s leaning on the same side and we get some sort of like magnified event that could bring Volatility of Volatility higher. So most of the time Volatility is low, but all of a sudden it can flip on a dime. And so that&#8217;s one of those things to keep in mind, but that&#8217;s how I think about it.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Interesting, very interesting. Let&#8217;s get into some hot takes here, Greg, you&#8217;ve been on fire. You&#8217;ve been on an absolute roll. Doesn&#8217;t have to be price predictions, but will we continue to see sort of the present day narratives and trends keep ripping? Like the Solana ecosystem being on fire, Bitcoin going to 100k, ETH struggling with its sort of OG narrative being sort of digital gas for the ecosystem. What trends and hot takes do you have for crypto and 2024?</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>Yeah, so I think ETH the big sort of headwind there is, what is going to be the regulatory landscape for Ethereum? Again, EIP 1559 is really bullish in the sense that it can actively reduce the supply of Ethereum if transaction fees are high enough and frequent enough but Ethereum is still not still ambiguous. Is it a commodity or is it a security? And then all the protocols or the ERC-20 projects built on top of Ethereum are sort of falling into the security bucket. And so I kind of wonder out loud if there&#8217;s less activity on Ethereum because DeFi protocols are being sort of scrutinized in the regulatory landscape. Well, does that change the value proposition of EIP 1559? And then does that flip Ethereum from a deflationary asset to an inflationary asset? So that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s kind of interesting to me. I do think Ethereum has been a laggard, and I do expect it to catch up like we&#8217;ve been seeing recently. But again, to me, the big line there is going to be the regulatory landscape in terms of Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin has proved itself in 2023 to be a very interesting non correlated, positive expected value investable asset. What I mean by that is that Bitcoin rallied when everything else was crashing. SVB, banking crisis. Bitcoin benefited a lot from that. And then the terror attacks in Israel in mid October, Bitcoin benefited from that as well. We saw similar price action with the Ukraine and Russia crisis or Russia war a couple of years back. So it&#8217;s one of those situations that I think Bitcoin is proving itself to be a safe haven. But if we get a bull market you know, true, proper bull market, historically all coins outperform. So that&#8217;s sort of the trade off.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />
</b>Interesting. What about Solana? Any takes on Solana? Everyone talk of the town right now went from $9 to $100 in what, 6, 7, 8 months, still room to grow there.</p>
<p><b>Greg Magadini<br />
</b>So Solana is actually not a crypto I&#8217;ve been following very closely. I kind of just forgot about it after FTX crashed. I know that Deribit is going to launch Solana options once again. And so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see when that option market comes back for Solana, what sort of adoption we see there in the derivatives market. But yeah, obviously it&#8217;s been on fire. I don&#8217;t have a good take on Solana, though, personally.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab<br />

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, and we have some big news this week, folks. By the time you are listening to this episode, we very well may have a Bitcoin ETF hot and ready, or we could not. It&#8217;s an absolute shit show right now. No one knows if it&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s looking good. Gensler just threw out a tweet a couple days ago warning people about buying and using crypto assets. I personally think that&#8217;s bullish as hell. I think that&#8217;s a good sign. I think he&#8217;s setting the stage. I think he&#8217;s laying some pavement for us. And I can&#8217;t wait to get into all of the Bitcoin ETF talk and everything back related with the star of the show today, Dan O&#8217;Prey, Chief Product Officer at Bakkt. Dan most recently served as Chief Strategy Officer as part of the executive team at Digital Asset, Creators of the Daml smart contract language. He&#8217;s a true veteran and has been in the space for over ten years. Crazy to think about that. He was responsible for defining the corporate strategy and aligning of the top level product strategy, assisted with over 300 mil of financing Wowza, and oversaw everything marketing and communications related. He was also part of the acquisition of Hyperledger, the first permissioned distributed ledger platform where he was Co-Founder and CEO. Super pumped to have you on. Dan, welcome to the show, my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Thanks so much for having me, Matt. Real pleasure to be here and excited to talk about. It&#8217;s an exciting time, as you say at the moment.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>It is. We&#8217;ve been waiting for this for a hot minute. Years and years and years. It&#8217;s finally happening. Folks, we are recording this episode two days before you will hear it on the 11th. Dan and I are recording on Tuesday, January 9th. Huge news. Everything ETF related. Is this going to happen, Dan? What is this going to do to the market? Give us your 360 degree take on the ETF. Give me the good, give me the bad, give me it all.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah. So, wow. Asking for a prediction the day before. We&#8217;re expected to hear on that the first batch of the 13 ETFs that are looking to be approved. To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure if tomorrow will be the day or not, but to me it doesn&#8217;t matter as much the particular day. I think really it&#8217;s inevitable now and we&#8217;re getting into the final stretch. So whether it&#8217;s tomorrow, weeks, or even a couple of months, the spot ETF are going to get approved in some fashion. I think, as you say, it&#8217;s far too far down the line. We&#8217;ve seen multiple revisions and tweaks that the SEC have been requesting of these ETF of the kind of details that only suggest that they&#8217;re refining prior to approval, such as the cash redemption portion and lots of changes over the last couple of days and the filings from the various ETF providers. So it may well be tomorrow or yesterday when this goes out, but I think it&#8217;s still, you never know with the SEC, given their historical stance towards these. There&#8217;s always a lot more to button up and little I&#8217;s to dot and T&#8217;s to cross. So we could well see a few more tweaks before they finally get approved. But I think it&#8217;s extremely likely in the short term at this point.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Let&#8217;s put on our bearish hat for a second. Everyone on Twitter has said if it doesn&#8217;t get approved, everything is going to get absolutely nuked. I hate to be a bear in any capacity of life, especially when it comes to Bitcoin or crypto or Blockchain. If for whatever reason, this doesn&#8217;t get approved, are we going to see an absolute nuke? Is it going to be World War III for crypto? What&#8217;s going to happen there?</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, great question. I don&#8217;t think so. It&#8217;s the short answer. I think if it doesn&#8217;t get approved, it&#8217;ll come with a caveat of why and there&#8217;ll be one or two more specific changes that they&#8217;re looking for. So I can&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;s going to be a blanket, not approved. It&#8217;ll be to the ETF providers themselves not approved, but because of x and y, and I can&#8217;t imagine those are going to be substantial roadblocks. So we may see a short term hit to the market as everyone is presuming everything is going to go ahead tomorrow. But still, I think that will be short term, if at all, as we&#8217;re still marching towards that same end state.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, no, I completely agree there and really hope it does go through. Now, let&#8217;s flip the switch here. Let&#8217;s put on our bullish hats for a second. If this goes through, what does this do for the rest of the market? Is this the parade we&#8217;ve all been waiting for when massive institutional investors come in? Is this going to pump the price of Bitcoin? Is this going to increase mass adoption as a whole, not just on Bitcoin, but as the crypto market, as a whole, let&#8217;s just say that this does go through either before this episode airs or slightly after this episode airs. What does that do for the rest of 2024 crypto markets?</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>It&#8217;s huge. I think everyone&#8217;s anticipating how large and making very large price predictions. It is massive. I don&#8217;t want to get too carried away with it because it is just a significant step towards the mainstreaming and institutionalization of Bitcoin in particular, but potentially more towards crypto generally. And it really, A, opens up, obviously a lot of potential for capital inflows from retail investing market, from pension funds and IRAs and capital that can&#8217;t go directly into spot Bitcoin or doesn&#8217;t have a vehicle for that today. And B, really gives it the credibility, like the rubber stamping that it gives to people within businesses, within institutions who maybe were a bit shy or didn&#8217;t want to say to their boss, hey, we should do something in Bitcoin now. Spot ETF with the SEC is approved. You&#8217;ve got BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, and it&#8217;s trading on national stock exchanges. So it really does change the game in terms of opening the door for capital as well as giving that stamp of approval that, hey, this is a serious asset class that you&#8217;re allowed to take seriously and you&#8217;re allowed to participate in now, given the types of players who are in the game and the quantities of money we expect to see involved.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>And what about the 13 applicants that we currently have? Full disclosure here, Dan, I&#8217;m a bit of a rookie when it comes to ETF. I invest in a couple of ETF, but I really have no clue how the approval process works. Is the SEC just going to give everyone a kick at the can? Is it going to be one or two to start? Is it just going to be one half of them? I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through if you do know about this subject and sort of give us the lay the land in regards to how the SEC is going to roll out this whole ETF approval process.</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>My guess is that it&#8217;ll be close to an all or nothing. I think it&#8217;d be very hard for the SEC to sort of pick winners and losers. And given these applications have been going for quite some time now and a lot of dialogue and feedback has been given to each of them, I&#8217;d be very surprised if they haven&#8217;t all coalesced towards something that the SEC finds acceptable or they all haven&#8217;t at this point. So maybe there&#8217;ll be one or two that doesn&#8217;t quite make the bar, but really with the ETF space, it very much is a sort of first mover advantage. The earlier, the better. The momentum, the branding. The size of the ETF really does tend to be that several winner takes all, but not far off it. So if the regulators were to approve one or two, they would essentially be blessing those two as the most likely long term winners relative to the others. And given the length of time, I&#8217;d struggle to imagine they haven&#8217;t all coalesced around something that either is or isn&#8217;t. Pretty sick at this point.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>I love some of the tickers too. I believe it&#8217;s Valkyrie. I could be wrong, but their ticker is HODL, which is just absolutely phenomenal. I just can&#8217;t wait for this. This is going to be so much fun. And let&#8217;s just segue into Bakkt as well here. I&#8217;d love if you could give us an elevator pitch on Bakkt, just so the listeners can have a bit of an idea of what we&#8217;re going to talk about when we get into the nitty gritty, and then just sort of tie that into how the ETF is going to help your business expand as well.</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Sure. Yeah. So Bakkt formed in about four years ago, so we actually spun out of the intercontinental exchange, or commonly known as ICE. So they&#8217;re one of the largest and futures exchanges in the world and own a bunch of different exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange. So we were sort of incubated within them as the crypto division and then spun out to be an independent company. And we&#8217;ve since gone public on the New York Stock Exchange as well. So one of two publicly traded qualified custodians that I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk about a lot more alongside Coinbase. And really we&#8217;re very much focused on being the infrastructure and platform plumbing behind enabling institutions to participate in this space, as well as enabling retail facing companies that aren&#8217;t crypto native necessarily, who don&#8217;t have necessarily on the license, the infrastructure, the custody, the liquidity, the banking relationships for on ramps. So we&#8217;re on the one hand, powering a lot of trading for large retail brokerages, behind the scenes for crypto trading, and on the other, enabling institutions to participate in the space initially through our custody solution. So very much behind the scenes. We&#8217;re not a direct to consumer brand. Our play is really much more horizontally looking to power multiple companies rather than be an avertly integrated end to end offer us.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>I love that. And one thing that I&#8217;m very curious about here Dan is someone who, when I first got into the space back in sort of 2019 2020, I didn&#8217;t want to put too many eggs into the just crypto basket. And I invested in a lot of companies similar to yourselves where I can use my, again I&#8217;m a Canadian, so it&#8217;s your version of the 401K kind of thing. We have an RRSP and a TFSA, just tax free investment vehicles where you can invest in stocks and ETF and so on and so forth and set it aside for a rainy day. And also, again, it&#8217;s tax free. That&#8217;s the biggest thing. I put a lot of money into stocks and publicly traded companies that have crypto on their balance sheet or are crypto custodians or do anything in the space similar to yourself. Right? A lot of infrastructure companies. As I figured, this is a good way for me to get exposure and not have to deal with all the crypto stuff. And obviously tax free. Was any of this part of your decision to go public on the best, realistically, the best stock exchange in the world? Was there ever discussion to launch a coin, an ICO, or from day one, was it always, let&#8217;s just go public, this is the right thing to do. This gives us more clout, this gives us more legitimacy, a better reputation, better branding. I&#8217;d love if you could sort of divulge the thought process behind going public as a stock.</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>So I joined two and a half years ago. So it was the same year that we went public. I wasn&#8217;t at Bakkt since day one, but I think I can pretty confidently say I don&#8217;t think an ICO. I&#8217;m sure it was someone brought it up at some point. But Bakkt positioning in the space has very much been on the conservative, dependable, reliable, responsible end of the spectrum. We&#8217;re highly regulated. We&#8217;re trying to take the slow but steady approach. We know that this market is going to have ups and downs and bad players are going to come in and exit, as we&#8217;ve seen over the last few years, and really in the long term, as we get regulatory clarity as the market matures. I say long term, but not too long from now. That really a company that is compliant and regulatory friendly and working to some extent with the regulators to ensure that this is a safe and sound market for participants to come into, and given that we took a far more a traditional approach and wanted to make sure that we had access to the capital markets that being public brings you, as well as actually, as a nice side effect of that, it&#8217;s been a very large validation of our approach. When people are looking for companies, knowing that you&#8217;re public and you&#8217;re audited and your financials are available is a very different game, especially when you&#8217;re perhaps a much more conservative institution who doesn&#8217;t want to take risks as they&#8217;re entering what&#8217;s already perceived to be, or has been perceived to be a risky space.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, well said there. I hate to get into anything stock price related or coin price related, but one of the really interesting things with all publicly traded companies that have crypto exposure, whether they hold crypto assets or directly deal with crypto similar to yourselves, there&#8217;s almost always a correlative price action to Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole. You guys are pretty similar in that regard as well. You&#8217;ve had a great couple months. Stock is looking super nice right now. It&#8217;s gone up a considerable amount. Is this going to change and will the Bitcoin ETF impact this in any capacity? Like me personally, Dan, I think if and when it gets approved, hopefully when it gets approved, I think all the Hut 8, the Marathon, the Michael Saylor MicroStrategy, the Coinbase, I feel like every company that&#8217;s publicly traded and has crypto exposure is going to take a little jump. And as more institutional money comes in, I feel like a lot of people are going to be like, okay, how can I get more exposure besides ETF? And they won&#8217;t want to invest in actual crypto coins themselves, but will want to invest in publicly traded vehicles that give exposure to crypto assets. Am I completely out the lunch there? What&#8217;s the deal with that?</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, I think it would be really interesting to see what the knock on effects are, as you say. Right? There is very much the bullcase, as you described, as it being sort of an entry point or a gateway into the wider ecosystem for those who wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have gone and signed up to a crypto exchange, transferred money across and put their cold, hard cash into crypto directly. But now their brokers and their IRAs are going to be making this available, in some cases promoting it to as a potential investment to people who hadn&#8217;t even considered it before. And that really will be their first step for a lot of people. And once they take that first step, obviously, depending on how well it performs, but assuming that the market continues to trend in this direction, as you say, people, I imagine, will look for other ways to get exposure. You mentioned mining companies, which have always been an interesting way to in some extent get leverage position. It&#8217;ll be interesting for companies like microstrategy as well who are holding large amounts of Bitcoin in addition to their software business, how a spot ETF impacts the investment around those as well. Then hopefully this will also be a stepping point down the road to people looking to buy Bitcoin directly and get direct exposure once they become comfortable with it as a regulated security trading on a stock exchange. I know the fees are looking very competitive. Over the last few days, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of compression there, as everyone sees, for a land grab to get that initial volume and the ball rolling. But I think it would also be quite positive for those that trade in spot commodity Bitcoin, as over time people look to just, I can just buy this directly as well and maybe even learn about self custody down the line too. Overall think it&#8217;s going to be a huge, just gateway into the wider ecosystem and massively positive from that regard.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, let&#8217;s hope the floodgates open there. You just brought up custody. Let&#8217;s jump into it. You guys have literally best in class infrastructure and the market has resonated with that and understands that you guys, multilayer technology, MPC, cryptography. I could go on and on, but you can explain this much better than I can. I&#8217;d love if you could talk about how world class your guys custody is and just sort of if you could segue into when you&#8217;re speaking with institutions who do choose you guys to hold their coins, what kind of questions did they ask where they&#8217;re like, hey, why should we go with you over Coinbase? Or why should we go with you over whoever else may also have a world class custody solution. I&#8217;ve never dealt with this again, I&#8217;m not a whale. There&#8217;s no point for me to be going to a massive institution like you guys for custody related, but when there is a massive institution, what kind of conversations do they have? What kind of questions do they ask you in regards to why should we go with you guys? I&#8217;d love if you could touch on your custody solution and why people end up going with you after the whole qubit and shabam is all said and done.</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, and in some ways it&#8217;s a very competitive space and in some ways it&#8217;s a very differentiated space still. So I think, again, sort of given that the last couple of years, quality custody has really been highlighted as something to take extremely seriously, not that people, but even another reminders of how critical that is. And I think generally, the crypto industry is a little immature in terms of the market structure for how the different entities within the crypto space enable institutions to participate. And by that, I mean you have companies where they do everything right. They&#8217;re the custodian, they&#8217;re the exchange, they&#8217;re the clearinghouse, essentially. They&#8217;re broker, in some cases have a prop trading company, and they&#8217;re all in one single legal entity. Whereas if you look at, like, say, US equities market, all these different things are broken out into deliberately different legal entities, so that if an exchange like FTX goes bankrupt, the funds aren&#8217;t at risk because the assets are held at a bankrupt remote custodian. And so that segregation of duties and roles is really important. And given our institutional heritage, that&#8217;s where we were born and where we started and where the original custody solution was designed to meet. And that sort of really shone through over the last year, several years, as we&#8217;ve massively reinvested in our custody solution. But also the market started to appreciate some of the approaches that we took and why those are so important. So to your question, we&#8217;re a New York Department of Financial Services trust chartered company, and why DFS are considered kind of the gold standard and creme de la creme of the strictest regulators in this space. I mean, they issued the bit license multiple years ago. And so we have a separate legal entity, a trust that&#8217;s regulated by New York, where all the assets are held, that has an independent board of managers, it&#8217;s chaired by the chairwoman of New York Stock Exchange, very much a legally, completely separate company. We&#8217;re not an exchange ourselves. We don&#8217;t take proprietary positions. We don&#8217;t take risk. So if, God forbid, anything happened to the remainder of Bakkt, that trust company is remote from anything in that. And the remainder of the company doesn&#8217;t take the certain kinds of risks that exchanges or prop trading companies have. So being a trust company being independent, as mentioned, being a public company, audited, and financials being public is super valuable and helpful. And, you know, if you look at the number of companies that even just tick those boxes, it&#8217;s very few.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, few and far. Well said there. Dan, we got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. But when we get back, we are going to talk about how bananas the last half of 2023 has been versus the second half of 2022. You guys saw up to ten times qualified sales opportunities. The market is, for a lack of better terms, horny for Bitcoin and crypto, and we are going to get into that. But until that huge shout out to our sponsor of the show. You guys know who this is. This is PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast. We love them as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders.

You guys said that qualified sales opportunities were up ten times in the first half of 2023 versus the second half of 2022. This is just the first half of 2023. Not even talking about the second half. How horny is the market right now? You guys have a good gauge on the horniness better than most, as people are coming to you for custody to hold their coins for everything. How horny are people right now Dan?</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>It&#8217;s a great metric I&#8217;m going to have to take back and start to measure as a key KPI internally. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a complete 180 from this time last year. Obviously the bar was somewhat low then, with multiple very high profile examples and money being lost and bad actors to say the least. But that said, it has been extremely encouraging how quickly the market has rebounded. I&#8217;ve always thought it&#8217;s mentioned I&#8217;ve been in the Blockchain space for ten years now, seen a few bears, and the market does tend to have a fairly short memory and is here for the long term, tends to come back pretty rapidly. This was quite a long bear market. But yeah, really the level of credibility that&#8217;s sort of come back. How quickly the market has rebounded from what were some of the biggest scandals, not just in crypto, but in business financial market history. To now be where we are talking about a spot ETF potentially being improved tomorrow is an incredible sort of turnaround and really a sign if anyone still needed one, that misses here to stay and that actually the fundamentals are unchanged by some actors on the bad actors on the edges. So yeah, it&#8217;s been fantastic for us. I mean, both actually, selfishly, as the product guy, having a bit of a breather and having six months to sort of focus and build and determine where we&#8217;re going to go next. Bear markets are for builders and it was nice in a way, in a sense, to not have all the hype and buzz and fads that were sort of coming and going when the market was as fought as it was, and every day there was a new shiny toy and distraction and potential products we could build and interest in this and that and that fuzzy buzzy interest has since faded and gone back to really, what are the core pieces, which are custody, trading and then also starting to invest in the payment space as well. So it was nice for me to have that focus time, and then it&#8217;s been amazing for us and everyone in the space to see how quickly everything has returned. And the interest in crypto remakes extremely high and only growing and hopefully soon to be taken to the next level.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>It is crazy how quickly the sentiment changes. I&#8217;m sure. Of course, you remember literally a year and a half ago, like mid 2022, when it was just like, what are we doing? Like, even the sentiment on the podcast was much different. I don&#8217;t want to say not as fun, because it was still fun speaking to really intelligent people like yourselves, but the whole sentiment was just different. Twitter wasn&#8217;t the best kind of dumpster fire ever. All type of crypto communities were buzzing. There was no buzz in the air, no positivity. Extremely negative, you know, the SBF trickle effects, the network effects were still extremely present. And now it just seems like the party, it still hasn&#8217;t seemed like the party is fully started, but it&#8217;s just so much fun. And one thing I would love, someone has to make a movie about this. Like just the whole process of the last three, four years. Heck, even maybe the whole crypto cycle as a whole. But I would love to watch a good documentary or a good series on all this banana lands. I think it&#8217;d be a hoop.</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>I think there&#8217;s definitely a series in there and then not just the movie. I agree. It&#8217;s been a fascinating time, crazy to be part of and watch unfold and even things that no one could have predicted quite the level of what was going on. So it&#8217;s been incredible. And I think while, as you say, it was bad for the industry and less fun, I think it is also positive for the market to have had the clear out and have had that reminder that not everything is a good investment and you should do your due diligence and you should invest in companies that have bought that crazy concept of. So that was the level that tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars being thrown around with very little oversight and due diligence being performed. And that meant that capital was going where it shouldn&#8217;t have and maybe not to where it should have. And so it&#8217;s a great reminder, I think, to the space to not everything is going to be valuable. Not every company is going to be around forever. Look for those who are doing it right, who are playing the long game, who are trying to do things by the book and not just make a quick buck, because those are the companies that are going to be the monsters in 5, 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Well said. There a couple more topics here, Dan, and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. Lightning network, you brought up payments a couple of minutes ago. This is still an aspect of Bitcoin that needs to giddy up. We need the train to leave the station for everything payments related. We&#8217;ve seen it with Ordinals, we&#8217;ve seen it with a lot of applications being built on the Bitcoin network. It&#8217;s still far too slow. It does not allow us to really crank up the mass adoption radar. You guys have dabbled in this space. You guys have more than just dabbled. You guys are building and executing and shipping a bunch of really cool things in this space. B2B settlements, instantaneous deposits, withdrawals, global trading, interoperable peer to peer trading. How has Lightning impacted your business and how are you guys building within on the Lightning Network present day?</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, I think as you mentioned at the beginning, right? We can talk about the ETF and the halvening and these kind of like big investment events, and these are fantastic for bringing money and credibility into the space, but they are still investment, right? They&#8217;re trading their investment and that is still the primary mass market use case for crypto and not pure utility. So really the investment, the speculation ultimately, I believe, is based on ultimately one day these things actually being used for a mainstream mass market use case that normal people who may not even care about Bitcoin or crypto or know it&#8217;s being used get value from. In the same way, most people today don&#8217;t know what TCP IP is and don&#8217;t need to know what it is. They can just use products which leverage it and get everyday value out of it. That&#8217;s where I see sort of the next major mainstream adoption driver being for Bitcoin in particular. And Satoshi&#8217;s white paper&#8217;s title was Bitcoin, a peer to peer electronic hash system, not Bitcoin a digital gold that you hoard and hold but go know. I think not everything Satoshi said was perfect. He&#8217;s not a God, but that was what it was originally designed for and that is still the best in my opinion, by far the best use case. Having an Internet native instrument of value that no one controls in the same way that no one controls the Internet, or in fact even less so than how people control the Internet will be absolutely massive for global commerce, for remittances, for programmable payments, for streaming, right? As people can actually stream sats while they&#8217;re watching a podcast and pay instead of 99 a month or whatever it may be. It&#8217;s obviously been a use case that people talk about a lot and has had a lot of attention but still hasn&#8217;t quite happened. And I think with the Lightning Network in particular that scalability, instantaneous settlement, near zero fees has been a massive game changer and Lightning is now four or five years old and getting to the stage where it&#8217;s starting to be mature enough to operate at scale and a lot of companies are taking it very seriously and making investments there. And I think that FIAT to FIAT use case where users don&#8217;t necessarily know they&#8217;re using Lightning or Bitcoin and don&#8217;t care, they just send dollars. Someone receives dollars or someone receives pesos. And behind the scenes that&#8217;s going in and out of Bitcoin and Lightning, I think is still going to be the killer app which really drives the person on the street who doesn&#8217;t care about Bitcoin to actually use it.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Well said there. Dan last question here before we wrap up, mate. 2024 outlook. Besides Bitcoin, we&#8217;ve discussed a lot about Bitcoin. It&#8217;s been the bread and butter of the show along with yourself and Bakkt any other non Bitcoin crypto related topics. Any hot takes you have for 2024 can be good, can be bad. What do you got for hot takes in the crypto market for this coming year?</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>I&#8217;ll answer in the reverse in that I think the hot take is that Bitcoin is going to start to really stand out from the rest of the market for the remainder of the year, not just with the spot ETF, but the understanding and appreciation that Bitcoin is unique as an asset within the crypto space. And really there is no crypto space in the same way there&#8217;s no Internet space. There&#8217;s a bunch of different markets within that. So yeah, my hot take is that Bitcoin will not just continue to be the primary asset, but will actually start to pull further ahead in terms of institutional adoption acceptance, regulatory acceptance that we&#8217;ve already seen. It&#8217;s got a unique standing in. So I guess that would be my hottest take.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>I love it. I mean, that&#8217;d be incredible for the market. And as we&#8217;ve seen in the past, when Bitcoin rips, everything else follows. So let&#8217;s hope that&#8217;s all we can do. Dan, incredible episode. Thank you so much for coming on, man. Really appreciate it. And for the non listeners, for the viewers who are watching on YouTube or Insta or TikTok or our website, wherever it may be, Dan&#8217;s background is absolutely electric. Dan, we got to finish with that. When did you kick up that background? I believe you said it was Covid related. It&#8217;s one of the best ones I&#8217;ve seen. It looks like a very cozy home office. What&#8217;s the story behind that?</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Yeah, I&#8217;ve got a little room which sticks out the side of my house, which unfortunately in New Jersey, it&#8217;s snowing, so it&#8217;s pretty freezing in here at the moment. That&#8217;s the one downside, but nice to have a little bit of space. And what you can&#8217;t see is I&#8217;ve built out a whole bunch of stuff in front of me. So now I&#8217;ve got multiple screens and all of that. So, yeah, just during COVID you know had nothing else to do other than invest in my home office and built out a gaming pc and just started adding and adding. So took a little bit of tidying up to do for those who are watching on video. But yeah, Lightning how it&#8217;s turning out. Thanks for that.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>I love it. Dan, what an episode. Really appreciate you coming on, my man. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Bakkt online and on socials.</p>
<p><b>Dan O’Prey</b><b><br />
</b>Sure thing. Yeah. Thanks so much for having me, Matt. So it&#8217;s bakkt.com or on Twitter and @danoprey on Twitter mostly.</p>
<p><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b>Amazing. Dan, what an episode. Really appreciate it. Can&#8217;t wait to have you and the team on for round two. And as always, folks, I will include everything in the show notes, huge shout out to Dan for coming on the show. If you guys enjoyed this one, and I hope you did, please do subscribe.

<h2>Highlights Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain scalability: The naivete of the conclusion that Ethereum + L2s are the only way forward (with considerations including rising fees, lack of connectivity, centralization, etc).</li>
<li>The case for diverse models of scalability, including scalable L1s (Solana, Sui, Aptos, etc.) and parachain-type solutions.</li>
<li>Decentralization / Governance: Projects that have neglected decentralization during the bear market will be revealed as just more centrally controlled tech companies during the bull.</li>
<li>Apart from philosophy, there is a real business case to make for projects with decentralized control and ownership.</li>
<li>Emerging markets for blockchain: In key areas, including Latin America, there is pent-up demand for better economic solutions than have been made available by TradFi and governments. Blockchain creates major opportunities for people in these areas to leapfrog into cutting-edge tech.</li>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing, as always. Still coming in hot from Toronto, still freezing my tush off. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show coming in hot, 5 hours away from me in the capital of Canada. And I bet most of you guys, if I asked you what is the capital of Canada? I would say 80% of you would probably say Toronto. But the capital is actually Ottawa, a beautiful city 5 hours away from Toronto. And this is where our guest is coming in hot from today. We have Aaron Evans, Head of Operations at Moonbeam Foundation. Aaron is an experienced software engineer, executive, and technical leader who has been working with Moonbeam and ecosystem projects since 2021. This guy is a jack of all trades and is especially skilled in crypto people, management, and startups. He&#8217;s done it all. Super pumped to have a fellow Canadian on the show. Aaron, welcome to the show, my friend. How are you doing?</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>I&#8217;m great. Thank you very much for having me, Matt. Really appreciate it. I&#8217;m super excited to be on the show.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Pumped to have you on. Always nice to have a Canadian on board, and it&#8217;s always cool when I have someone a little close by. My last guest was in Singapore, and I was recording at night. She was in the morning, and it&#8217;s like, wow, it&#8217;s crazy how the world works. But glad to have you close by. Today, folks, we are recording on Wednesday, January 3. When you listen to this episode, it will be on Monday, January 8. We just had a multibillion dollar liquidation. The Bitcoin wick went from 45 straight down to 41, and this was on the news of I forget who the firm was, someone I&#8217;ve never even heard of before throwing out a tweet.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Matrix Port.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Yeah, Matrix Port. I&#8217;m like, how do these guys have so much pull? I&#8217;ve never even heard of them. Have you?</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>No, I hadn&#8217;t heard of them. And it&#8217;s like one guy&#8217;s opinion, I think, or something I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp;</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Exactly. It&#8217;s like the Cointelegraph intern who threw out the Bitcoin ETF approved Tweet and gave us the $4,000 wick. Now we have the bad color red, $4,000 wick. Aaron, what&#8217;s going on here? When is crypto finally going to have a little bit more legitimacy? And when are these crazy wicks going to stop? Will they ever stop? What&#8217;s your two cent on this whole massive liquidation?</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>I don&#8217;t know. Crypto is just crazy, right? And just wild swings, and I think that things will level out the more mainstream it becomes. And I think it&#8217;s just so still, so early in its history and so forth that and there&#8217;s so much sort of speculation around it. But over time, as the technology matures, becomes firmly embedded in enterprise applications and so forth under the hood, then people pay less attention to the individual technology stacks and this kind of thing. And maybe some of the wild speculation will go away. But on the other hand, you have DeFi. I think that&#8217;s just runs 24/7 unlike traditional markets. So who knows? Maybe we&#8217;ll be in for a wild ride forever. I don&#8217;t know. But I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with this latest ETF news. Who knows if this guy has the inside track? It beats me. Last I heard, it was pretty much a lock. For just like mid January or so forth. So who knows?</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Part of me also thinks this is like, again, if I&#8217;m BlackRock and I&#8217;m the biggest asset manager in the world, in the whole wide world, part of me is like, okay, if I&#8217;m going to launch this thing and I&#8217;m going to have to buy, and mind you, if it goes down, they&#8217;ve definitely already bought tens of thousands of Bitcoin. They&#8217;re definitely already accumulating. They could very well be the catalyst behind this sort of October to present day, early January rip that we&#8217;ve had. But if I&#8217;m BlackRock, I definitely want to tank the price a little bit more before we launch this thing. You know what mean, like, and if I have that much power and I know that Blackrock does have this much like, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing personally.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>I suppose I kind of got to be a little bit careful to raise the IR of the SEC by doing some market manipulation. But who knows? Maybe you&#8217;re right. I think the thing with this sort of cash versus in kind contributions, this plays a little bit of trickiness as well, because they can&#8217;t just take the Bitcoin that they have and load it into the ETF. They&#8217;ll have to do some kind of cash transaction. You kind of wonder where that runs through, who does those transactions and how that impacts the market as well.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>100%. Let&#8217;s get into the bread and butter of the show here. Two parts, first is you, second is Moonbeam. We&#8217;ll start with Moonbeam. Walk me through Moonbeam 101. Give me the TLDR, give me the elevator pitch, a little bit of the history, a little bit of the vision. You guys have your two year anniversary coming up in Jan. 2024. That&#8217;s right, present day. Love to see that you guys have quickly turned yourselves into a behemoth in the space. Just sort of connectivity 101, anything app and smart contract related with a multitude of various blockchains. You guys are just connectivity gurus, and everyone always talks about interoperability, how important it is you guys are doing that. So give us the elevator pitch, give us the intro on Moonbeam, bit of the history, bit of the vision, and then we&#8217;ll get into the fun stuff here.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Sure. Yeah, no, happy to. So, Moonbeam launched in January 2022, and as you mentioned, we have our one year anniversary coming up very shortly on the 11th, so we&#8217;re super excited about that. But the story really began way before that with the initial founding of the project and the vision. In short, I would say that Moonbeam is a smart contract platform for building decentralized applications that can access users and assets on any chain. It&#8217;s a developer oriented protocol. We&#8217;re sort of targeting builders, developers and so on. So that&#8217;s sort of the very short elevator pitch, the original vision. And this original vision continues to kind of influence what we&#8217;re working on today, I&#8217;ll add. So I think the theory was way back in 2020, 2019, the theory was that in a future world, there will be many blockchains and they&#8217;re going to specialize for specific use cases or functions. They&#8217;ll excel in certain areas and have all these things will have pluses and minuses, and some of them make it. I think some people think they&#8217;ll get very app focused or function focused. Right? So some excel at storage, some excel at transactions and smart contracts and so forth. And so the thinking was that connectivity between them will be a critical capability. And I think we&#8217;ve seen that happen. I think just look at the major GMP protocols like Axelar, Wormhole, LayerZero. Those are super important. We see Chain Lake also coming into the space. So I think that part definitely seems to have come true. I think back when the project was founded, we&#8217;re taking a look at what frameworks were available for building specialized chains. And then where&#8217;s a good home for such a chain if we&#8217;re going to launch such a chain? And so I think we&#8217;re attracted to Substrate as a modular development toolkit for building blockchains, and I think we&#8217;re seeing a lot of adoption. I think I heard even Cardano is moving to Substrate as well. So that just seemed to be a really good choice for building blockchains just because of its modularity. It&#8217;s written in rust. It&#8217;s one of the more modern then, you know, we came across Polkadot, and Polkadot was obviously an environment designed to connect Substrate chains together. So that seemed like a natural place and a natural tech stack to use. And I think one of the things that sort of became evident, and I think now it seems very obvious in hindsight, but back in 2019, 2020, that EVM, despite some of its challenges, would continue to be the preferred tech stack for application developers. And we see that obviously that&#8217;s still true today. There&#8217;s many EVM chains. There&#8217;s a lot of L2s using it. I&#8217;m going to sort of date myself here, but I see it kind of like VCRs, super old school tech. Beta was better, but like VHS had licensing with, and it became the standard. It became the standard. You could get the JVC VHS player for cheap, like beta thinks Sony tried to stay. So EVM seemed to be the natural choice. So we thought, hey, you know what we&#8217;ll do is we&#8217;ll make an Ethereum like environment in Substrate, and that would be very useful in this multi chain ecosystem of Polkadot and beyond for connecting chains together.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Very well said there.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>That&#8217;s sort of the history, and as I said, that sort of continue on that vision even today, just sort of.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>A half on, half off topic question. How do you guys choose what chains to work with? Because I feel like everyone&#8217;s knocking on your guys door being like, hey, help us connect with other chains. How do you vet which applications, protocols, companies to work with? Because there&#8217;s so many of them, and it takes a lot of back end, front end work to really work on all the pieces of the pie, to make each blockchain connect and work with each other and to make it fully interoperable. How do you guys say yes and no to people who come in and teams that come in and companies that come in and want to work with you guys? What&#8217;s that workflow look like?</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Yeah, I mean, I think that&#8217;s a great question. There&#8217;s a number of different angles from which people are coming to us, or sometimes we&#8217;re going to them. I think when it comes to the Polkadot ecosystem, it&#8217;s fairly straightforward and in fact, we let our community decide. So in order to connect chains in the Polkadot ecosystem XCM channel, so that&#8217;s the cross chain messaging consensus format that allows the chains to interoperate under a shared security umbrella. So other chains in Polkadot, they can just put forth a governance motion on Moonbeam. And if it&#8217;s voted through by the community, then the connection is established. Now there&#8217;s more sometimes to get their assets listed.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>You give that much power to the community.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Yeah, last year we&#8217;ve done a tremendous amount to empower the community and further decentralization Substrate allows us to have four close upgrades. We&#8217;ve done six major upgrades over the past year, so probably 15 or more since inception, but so just getting back to. So through the Polkadot ecosystem, they can connect to us. Now if they want to get their assets listed in our official dApp, there is more of an approval process there. There&#8217;s forms they got to fill out and kind of provide links back to things like security audits, because there&#8217;s certain disclaimers we want to highlight for people if they still have Sudo enabled or something like this. So that&#8217;s sort of the Polkadot side, I would say, for teams that want to deploy and seeking grants, we have a little grants program for people that want to work with us in that way. And then for connecting to chains outside of Polkadot, our angle there has just been to work with the major GMP protocols, as I mentioned. So we have Axelar, LayerZero, Wormhole, Hyperlane all deployed to Moonbeam. And that&#8217;s our strategy for interoperability with chains outside of Polkadot ecosystem. And I think what we found is a lot of parachains are leveraging Moonbeam. The chains in Polkadot are leveraging Moonbeam as a conduit to reach other ecosystems, which is quite interesting how that&#8217;s developed.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>You keep mentioning Polkadot. I&#8217;d love, and this is totally on me here. I need to do my research, but I&#8217;d love if you could give a quick little TLDR on the difference between Polkadot and Polkadot 2.0. The DOT unlock. And again, this is more my curiosity than anything else. I&#8217;m sure the listeners would like to learn about this as well. But what&#8217;s been going on in the Polkadot ecosystem? A lot of things have been happening. I&#8217;d love if you could just give me a quick little sort of TLDR on the difference between 1.0 and 2.0 and then segue into the DOT unlock.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Sure. Yeah, no, happy to. Gavin Wood came up with the idea of Polkadot and it really is a tremendous tech stack. Moonbeam in itself is just useful without Polkadot. I mean, it&#8217;s deployed on Polkadot but when application developers deploying to it, they may or may not be super interested in the Polkadot aspects, but it&#8217;s an amazing framework and base for us to deploy upon. Polkadot 1.0 is such that where there&#8217;s the relay chain, which is providing the Polkadot relay chain, which is providing shared security across all the quote unquote Parachains. So that&#8217;s more of sort of the LayerZero, not to be confused with the LayerZero GMP protocol. And then there are all these L-1 Parachains which deploy on Polkadot. Now, you don&#8217;t want to have a bazillion of these things. There are limits to the scale. So there are slots that you have to obtain in order to have your chain deployed in the Polkadot ecosystem. And in Polkadot 1.0, the way you would get a slot is by winning an auction. And so you would have to bid with some amount of dots. And there are so many auctions and so much time, and you have to win your slot, and then you have basically a lease for some period of time to operate. Now, each slot is then you can think of as gets a dedicated core, is what they call it. So you have a dedicated amount of transaction processing that each slot is allocated. And so I&#8217;ll come back to that in a minute. But this auction framework is one of the things that, it&#8217;s kind of a pain because we&#8217;ve renewed ours somewhat recently and we&#8217;ve done it a bunch of times with our incentivized test network, moon river, but it is a pain. It requires a lot of preparation. And if, for whatever reason, if you screw it up, your chains could be offline. So it&#8217;s not amazing. So with Polkadot 2.0, there&#8217;s a couple of major changes. So one, they would do away, and they&#8217;re kind of related. They&#8217;re going to do away with the auctions, and there&#8217;ll be a marketplace for buying core time. And in addition, the core time is more agile in the sense that instead of each parachain getting a dedicated core, it&#8217;s more adaptable where you may or may not be using. Like, they can slice and dice the cores that are available to all the chains. And so this way, because what you have right now, there are some pairachains, when they initially launch, there&#8217;s not a lot of activity. They&#8217;re just producing empty blocks, but you still need a dedicated core processing those empty blocks. So this way that wouldn&#8217;t be required. You would only use the core time that you need with actual transactions that need to be validated. So there&#8217;s sort of that marketplace for paying for core time. And so because they have that marketplace, they can also do away with the auctions and they&#8217;ll get a lot more throughput and scalability with Polkadot 2.0 across the ecosystem.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Very interesting. Another topic Aaron, I&#8217;d love to get into is DeFi on Moonbeam. DeFi has sort of had a massive resurgence. It&#8217;s almost like DeFi Winter. It was like DeFi Autumn over the last couple of months, and now we&#8217;re still sort of buzzing on DeFi Winter, you have airdrops. It is literally just airdrop city population us. If you have contributed to almost any new and more specifically Solana based DeFi platform, you have a lot of Atom and Cosmos DeFi platforms as well. Over the last little bit, you&#8217;re just getting free money, which is pretty bananas. Also on that topic, little off topic here, the IRS, I don&#8217;t know if you saw that news that came out yesterday where if you get an airdrop over $10,000, you have 15 days to report it or you&#8217;re hooped. Now, again, thankfully that doesn&#8217;t apply to us, but then again, anything that happens in the states, we usually copy. So I&#8217;m sure that will be coming our way as well. What new opportunities are you excited about for DeFi on Moonbeam as a whole?</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Yeah, so I think we have a great DeFi ecosystem. I think that macro forces what they are. DeFi, as you said, it&#8217;s gone through a bit of a winter period. There seems to be a resurgence. Definitely signs in the market. So great to see that moving again. Moonbeam being an EVM smart contract environment is just going to naturally, DeFi projects are naturally going to be attracted to something like that. And I think that was one of the first use cases to come to Moonbeam. And we have several decks and AMM solutions. We have BeamSwap and StellaSwap. We have a lending protocol, Moonwell. There&#8217;s a lot of liquid staking of DOT going on and so forth. So a lot going on there. I think what I&#8217;m really excited about, though, is to see that combined with the cross chain use cases and technology that we&#8217;ve developed. So, for example, prime protocol is a cross chain prime brokerage. They have connected to eight EVM chains, including Moonbeam, and it&#8217;s designed to function across multiple chains. And it uses Moonbeam as the central point for integrating functionalities across those chains. So it&#8217;s sort of a hub and spoke model. And so instead of the initial approach, when Moonbeam first launched all these DeFi projects would be like, oh, okay, here&#8217;s more users. There&#8217;s a venue over here, I better deploy an instance over there. But now you have these two instances. So you have fragmented liquidity, you have fragmented user bases, you have to manage them separately. So it&#8217;s kind of like going back to the old web days where before there were these major multitenanted applications, you&#8217;ve got these different standalone islands to manage and that comes with its host of problems. And so in a model like this, you actually have more of a single instance of an application that operates across multiple chains. And I think we&#8217;re just going to see a lot more of that now. It has its own complexities and security concerns and technical challenges, but in the end, it&#8217;s going to give a superior user experience, it&#8217;s going to be more manageable and it&#8217;s really going to allow teams to scale their applications to reach the most number of users and manage their liquidity in the most efficient way. So I think taking DeFi and combining that with the cross chain connected capabilities of Moonbeam is really exciting and I think we&#8217;re going to see a lot more of that.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>I love that. It&#8217;s crazy, this resurgence of DeFi. And I personally, I love to see it. I mean, the word itself, decentralized finance, it is a powerful one and I think that&#8217;s going to be one of the applications that really gets the masses on board. But right now, still, the UX is just absolutely horrendous. Setting up wallets, writing down seed phrases, it&#8217;s still nightmare fuel. And I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s really moving the needle too far in that regard. Account abstraction needs to be much better. And man, oh man, it&#8217;s got to happen sooner rather than later because I feel like we&#8217;re getting. I don&#8217;t want to say close, but I just feel like we need more mass adoption use cases sooner rather than later, or else we as a whole, speaking on behalf of the whole crypto community, will never get the chance to go mainstream. That&#8217;s just my take. But who knows? Aaron, we have to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show that is PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to keep buzzing on blockchain scalability, some governance, decentralization, emerging markets for blockchain and a super cool use case. And I can&#8217;t wait to get into this. You guys loaded Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu certificates that are on Moonbeam network. That is so friggin cool. And we&#8217;ll get into that in 1 second. But until then, huge shout out to PrimexBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50 to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And now back to the show with Aaron. Let&#8217;s get right into the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu because that is so cool, you guys. This was on your twitter on December 15. Official Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu certifications coming out of Brazil. This is the kreme de la kreme of MMA. And any type of combat like, these guys are the GOATs. All the best UFC fighters all have experience in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It separates the best from the mids. And you guys put this on chain. Walk me through the whole story. This is so frigging cool. How did you make this happen? Give us some of the goods here.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Yeah, I mean, I think it&#8217;s a super cool use case. I remember telling my kids, because they&#8217;re always kind of like, what do you do with this blockchain stuff? But it&#8217;s like, this is the coolest thing. My nieces and nephews, they&#8217;re into Jiu-Jitsu and everything, so I was super proud to show them that use case. So we&#8217;ve been making a lot of inroads in Brazil. In particular, you mentioned emergency markets and so forth, and Brazil is one of those areas of focus for us, and one of our members of the Moonbeam foundation team is from Brazil. And so we&#8217;re really working to develop relationships there. We have multiple partners. We&#8217;re working with other companies to blockchain enable their applications. And so in this case, I believe it was WeBlock who was the partner down there who connected us with the folks at the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. And yeah, I mean, I think the BD function is kind of handled by other folks in the foundation. So I wasn&#8217;t super close to the deal, but yeah, it came together relatively quickly and I think it&#8217;s just a really cool use case to say, hey, look, these are, certifications are the kind of thing that you want to be able to prove this is the kind of thing that belongs on blockchain, right? You want to be able to prove that this certification is real. And I think we&#8217;re starting to see other applications, especially in Brazil, like, for example, to concert tickets. They have a big problem with fraudulent concert tickets because you could take a picture of the barcode, even if they&#8217;re digital and so forth. So I think longer term, you&#8217;re just going to see a lot more things where people can prove that they&#8217;ve achieved or that they own something. And this is amazing because it&#8217;s just such easy to understand use case, real world use case that&#8217;s solved using blockchain. And we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to have them select Moonbeam to track those certifications.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>So cool. This is the kind of stuff we need. And again, especially in a place like Brazil, which neighbors countries like Argentina and has their own currency issues as well, these are the opportunities that I feel like, really move the needle. The Brazilian population hears about this, they go, oh, this is really cool. What else can crypto do? They get to be a little more curious. Then, you know, the trickle effect happens and the rest takes care of itself. So absolutely love this. Another thing that you guys are doing is you&#8217;re really moving the needle in emerging markets, more specifically Latin America. Is there another reason that you guys have penetrated that market, besides the obvious Venezuela and Argentina with currencies that are just an absolute joke? And my apologies to the Argentinians and Venezuelans that are listening, but your currency is horrendous to say the least. And I feel terrible for them. I spend time in Mexico and there&#8217;s a bunch of. I have Argentinian friends and they tell me about doctors making $500 a month in Argentina. Like a doctor. You come to Canada, you make a couple of hundred grand. You go to the States, you make 500 grand. They&#8217;re making 500 us a month to be a doctor. It is insane. Feel terrible for them. Hopefully this new Malay or whatever his name is, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen this guy, the new Libertarian Leader of Argentina. He&#8217;s a nutcase, but he&#8217;s sort of a beauty.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>He&#8217;s kind of wild.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>He&#8217;s wild, produces great content. But a little off topic here. Back on topic. Why crypto in Latin America? Why blockchain in Latin America in particular?</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>You know, emerging markets? I mean, I think this is probably kind of well known, but we in Canada, North America, Western Europe, we take things like banking for granted we take, you know, the fact that we can get a bank account that we can transact and we can send you know for granted, I think, you know, a real eye opener for me was over the you know, last year and a half when there were all these issues with some of these banks that were serving crypto companies. And it just was like, okay, well, there was a period of time when we didn&#8217;t have a bank account, the Moonbeam foundation. We&#8217;re just kind of like running know, trying to find a banking partner. And so you really start to feel it then. But these emerging markets, it goes beyond that. As we said, they&#8217;re currency that can&#8217;t be relied upon and so forth. And so they really get it. And I think this is an analogy I would look at is like, in Canada and North America, United States back in, I don&#8217;t know, the early two thousands, we had excellent telecommunication infrastructure deployed everywhere with all these wires. And we were way ahead of Europe and definitely ahead of Africa and other areas like that. And then out of necessity, Europe deployed much better mobile technology very quickly, and they just sort of jumped over and they leapfrogged, having to deploy all these lines everywhere to people&#8217;s houses. They just went straight to wireless. And so I think in that sense, you&#8217;re going to see the same with these emerging markets. They&#8217;re going to be quick to adopt blockchain technology and crypto because their current financial rails are terrible. And so instead of spending all this time, money with probably in some cases, not the most on the level governments, and instead of spending the time doing all that and trying to fix all that, just jump straight you know, crypto and blockchain. And so emerging markets are where there is a tremendous amount of interest in solving real world problems that goes beyond just sort of speculation on tokens and so forth. And Brazil is one of those. And as I mentioned, we have a key member of the team that&#8217;s from Brazil. So that certainly helped. But it just seemed like there was a lot of teams coming to us for grants and interested in working with Moonbeam. I think they had heard of us. We have an ambassador program as well that&#8217;s very active in various communities, and there was just a lot of inbound interest. And we said, well, let&#8217;s pull on this thread. And it&#8217;s been going very well, and I think hasn&#8217;t sort of been dominated already by one of the other players in the space. But we&#8217;re looking at others, too. We&#8217;re spending a bunch of time exploring Vietnam right now, and we&#8217;ll probably look at some other markets as well. But right know, we&#8217;re having a lot of success in Brazil, and we want to keep building on that moment.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>I love the phone connectivity analogy. That is just straight gold. Just a little antidote here. Again, as I spend a decent amount of time every year in Mexico, don&#8217;t meet too many Brazilians, but meet tons of Argentinians. Again, they just come up so they can participate in an economy that&#8217;s doing decent. The Mexican peso isn&#8217;t too bad, and that&#8217;s what they do. And then they send it back to their own bank accounts or their families. Every single one of the Argentinians I meet, girls and guys, they all have a Binance or another crypto account. My friends in Toronto, I would say maybe 20%, 30% of my network outside of crypto has a crypto account. And it&#8217;s strictly for usually aping into shitcoins or HODLing a bit of Bitcoin or ETH or Solana, right? Otherwise it&#8217;s strictly like, I get texts, Matt, when&#8217;s the next bonk? When&#8217;s the next Doge? When&#8217;s the next Shiba Inu? That&#8217;s all it is. It&#8217;s just like, how can I throw a couple hundred bucks and hit a Moon kind of thing. And then you have the Argentinians who are actually using crypto for real world use cases. They don&#8217;t ape into shitcoins. They take money from Mexico, they transact it into their account, and they send it back to Argentina. And it&#8217;s just like, I love seeing that. It warms my heart, and that&#8217;s what we need more of. So love the work you guys are doing in Latin. Another thing I&#8217;d love to get into is blockchain scalability. We have seen Solana really sort of take the cake on this one. SUI as well. We had SUI on the podcast as well. That was a treat. Aptos. A lot of parachain type solutions, literally even earlier this year or last year excuse me. Jan, Feb, March, even April. I would say all the way up until late summer of 2023, the narrative was simply Ethereum and L-2s are the only way forward connectivity. You have the fees, which are a shit show. And now all of the other parachain type solutions are running the show. We love to see this. What are you guys doing to work on these? And I&#8217;d love your personal take as well. Is this the way forward? Is Solana going to turn into the next ETH? Does ETH have a chance for resurgence? The volumes haven&#8217;t dropped off a cliff per se, but all other pair chains are literally going like this. They&#8217;re going up into the right, and ETH is very slow, even on NFTs. Solana passed ETH for NFT volume last month as well. What&#8217;s your two cent on that? Are we going to see parachain type solutions keep buzzing, or is ETH going to have a resurgence?</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Look, I think Ethereum is like a mainstay for sure. And I think what&#8217;s interesting to me is that it looks as though Ethereum will become a bit like the Polkadot relay chain in the sense that it&#8217;s about the consensus. And I think the Layer 2s will continue to proliferate and show success. But I think at the end of the day, to get Web2, like scalability, there&#8217;s not, no one chain can do that, right? That&#8217;s just not possible. The number of users in the world, even if they&#8217;re not transacting very much just to handle that kind of load and that number of accounts, there&#8217;s no one chain that&#8217;s going to be able to do it. And so you have to have these stacks that work together in these sort of networks. I think Polkadot and Cosmos were early examples of those. And then Ethereum had this idea about sharding, and then it turned into the L-2 thing, and now you&#8217;ve got all these other chains doing similar strategies. Avalanche has got their subnets and so forth. So I think what we&#8217;re going to see over the next little while is some tech stack consolidation. And I think it&#8217;s likely that EVM will continue to play a major part there. I think a lot of the L2s continue to be EVM based and so forth. But what&#8217;s going to emerge is going to have kind of these islands of interoperability. And so people running the op stack, they&#8217;ll sort of have some level of interoperability with each other. ZKSync, they have their strategy, and as I mentioned, Avalanche and things like that. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to see in the next two to three years. But then there&#8217;ll probably be some kind of shakeout where certain ones will become winners. And I think one of the things that I like about Polkadot, for example, is that it&#8217;s a little top down where gabs kind of said, okay, this is kind of how it works, like the shared security model, but everyone understands it and has adopted it. Whereas these other say, take for example, the op stack for Optimism. People are launching all these chains with the op stack, but then they got to figure out how to glue them together, and they&#8217;re only figuring that out now. And it is a bottoms up approach, which I like. It&#8217;s kind of like grassroots, and they&#8217;re going to figure it out together. But I think that that&#8217;s going to cost valuable time. I think that over the next few years, getting that right and secure could prove difficult because it&#8217;s not only just having secure messaging between them and so forth, but just the security of those assets and consensus among those chains will be difficult. So I do think some form of Ethereum L-2 will exist for the foreseeable future and probably play a major part in the world, but there&#8217;s a lot of room for a lot of different stacks. I mean, if you look at the Web2 world, you have a lot of different industry players beyond just the Amazon, Google and Microsoft cloud. You have a lot of other key pieces of infrastructure that have emerged as pillars of that. And I think we&#8217;re going to see the same thing play out over the next five to ten years in blockchain. And I think there&#8217;s a lot of room, but I think tech will matter in the coming five to ten years. And I think that&#8217;s when Polkadot and Substrate based chains will have their time in the sun because people will realize the capabilities that are there and that they&#8217;re built for long term scalability.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Well said. Last question here Aaron. 2024 trends, predictions. We don&#8217;t have to get into any price prediction nonsense, but trends as a whole. Everyone&#8217;s still saying DeFi, everyone&#8217;s saying Deepn is going to blow up. Everyone&#8217;s still saying Solana ecosystem is going to blow up. What&#8217;s on your sort of hot take board? What is on the Aaron Evans hot take board for 2024?</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Yeah, I do think DeFi is great and I think there&#8217;s going to be a resurgence of that. But at the same time, I think the number of people in the world that will directly participate in DeFi, I think is so small, somewhat limited. It&#8217;s not as broad as social applications and this kind of thing. I think in this next cycle what we&#8217;re going to see is some meaningful enterprise adoption. And so where there are Web2 companies or traditional companies that have realized that this blockchain thing is real, there will be real use cases like the Jiu-Jitsu kind of thing, where there are certain things where users are going to start to expect more ownership and sovereignty over their data and they&#8217;re going to want it on the blockchain and these companies will start to enter and that&#8217;s really going to drive a lot of growth and I think they&#8217;re going to want to go to places where it&#8217;s easy for their developers to get going. So ecosystems with strong SDKs and really top notch developer relations teams and support and documentation, which Moonbeam has excellent. That&#8217;s, I think what we excel at. We&#8217;re well known for providing great support to developers. Our documentation is really good. So I think that&#8217;ll be a key driver. And I think a lot of these real world assets, whether those are financial instruments or actually just real world things like Jiu-Jitsu certifications, I think loyalty programs will continue to be a big thing where you have platforms where there&#8217;s more utility to those loyalty points. And that kind of thing flourishes in a blockchain kind of environment. So that&#8217;s kind of how I see. I mean, for Moonbeam ourselves, we have a lot going on. And on the scalability side, I think we&#8217;ll probably reduce block times by a half to help with speed and so forth. So that&#8217;s sort of more on our radar. We&#8217;re going to continue with real world assets and gaming and emergency markets as part of our tenets of our strategy. But yeah, in the space in general, I really think it&#8217;s going to be some form of meaningful enterprise entry into the space.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>I love that. Aaron, what an episode. Really appreciate you coming on. I had an absolute blast here and learned a ton. And you have an open invite anytime you and Moonbeam want to come on for round two. Hit me up. Because we barely scratched the surface here and we didn&#8217;t even get into all the cool shit that you do. Especially for the YouTube viewers. Aaron has an absolutely electric background of Star Wars Legos. These things are so legit. The spaceships, the monsters. So freaking cool. I&#8217;m a big Star wars guy myself. So on round two, we&#8217;ll have to get into all that. But until then, wishing you and the team all the best. Before you go, please let our listeners know where they can find you personally and Moonbeam online and on socials.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>Yeah. So on Twitter @DoubleARon2048 if you&#8217;ve seen the key and peel. So @DoubleARon2048 and Moonbeam, the best place to go is moonbeam.network. The website has all the documentation and links to all our socials and so forth.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Love it. Aaron, thank you so much for coming on. Really appreciate it and can&#8217;t wait for round two.</span><b>Aaron Evans</b><b><br />
</b><span>My pleasure. Thank you very much.</span><b>Matt Zahab</b><b><br />
</b><span>Folks what an episode with Aaron Evans, Head of Ops at Moonbeam Foundation. He was on fire all episode. We talked everything. Blockchain, scalability, scalable L-1s, Polkadot, you name it, we discussed it. Huge shout out to Aaron and the Moonbeam team for making this happen. If you guys enjoyed this one, and I hope you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I. Speaking to the team love you guys so much. Thank you for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor, you are the GOAT. Appreciate you, and back the listeners. Love you guys. Keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.</span></p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab, and we are buzzing as always. Still coming in hot from Mexico. By the time this episode airs, I believe this will be the first episode of 2024. Crazy to hear the four come out of my mouth. It&#8217;s always weird writing things down, typing things down. The first month it always takes me like two, three weeks to really just click in and be like, holy shit, it&#8217;s a new year. But cest la vie, here we are. Hope everyone had a wonderful 2023 and hope everyone has an even better 2024. I am super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, Josh Jones, the Founder of Cornucopias, the one and only blockchain game that is absolutely tearing it up right now. Josh is an experienced startup entrepreneur for the last 25 years, specializing in building marketing teams and crafting strategy to go to scale discontent with existing monetary systems. He has a huge passion for the crypto and blockchain industry and is Co-Founder and stake pool operator of Grow Your Stake, GYS. A mission driven clean water for all Cardano stake pool. He&#8217;s also half of the Cardano based YouTube Podcast Cardano Chats. I will include everything in the show notes as always, but it is time to learn a little bit more about Josh and Cornucopias. Super pumped to have you on, Josh, welcome to the show. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Doing well, man. Thanks for having me on the show. It&#8217;s good to be here. I&#8217;m Co-CEO and Co-Founder, so we&#8217;ve got four Co-Founders together. And man, I need to update that bio a little bit. But hey, it&#8217;s good. We hit the ground running, so it&#8217;s good to be on the show, man.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Pumped to have you. I will change that bio right away as well. Co-CEO and Co-Founder. You know what? That&#8217;s a cool little one. Before we get into your past, let&#8217;s start with that. I&#8217;ve had a bunch of Co-CEOs on the pod. What exactly is a Co-CEO? How do you choose who does what? Is it as cliche as it sounds, whereas you would take your strengths and your Co-CEO would take his or her strengths. How do you guys sort of divvy up which tasks and things to tackle?</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question really. The reality was we started off and I was in more of a marketing role. I was starting off as a CMO, but it turned out that a lot of what I was working on was very much related to running the company. Token stuff, et cetera. And what we ended up doing is realizing that we have so much with building the game and also building the company and having it be Web3 that we needed to divide and conquer in that way. So he took on more of the tech based roles and some of the more of the game part of it. And then I&#8217;m taking on a little bit more of the company management. But we both have a big involvement in the strategy, the vision and the direction that we&#8217;re going with not just the game, but also the company. So it&#8217;s working incredibly well for us.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I love that. Let&#8217;s get right into it. A lot of the time I will usually ask our guests for a little bit about themselves. I think for this one we&#8217;ll save this at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Your game, Cornucopias, you guys really sort of caught fire last couple weeks. Would really blowing up, especially on Twitter. You&#8217;ve had some big influencers unpaid. One who we had on the Podcast Ansem blknoiz, he was shouting you guys out as well. You&#8217;ve had a lot of organic massive shout outs. People finally realizing this is a team that is built and is building a sick and sweet game. And there aren&#8217;t many teams still in the space who are really building and actually shipping. There are a lot of those, but there aren&#8217;t a lot of those who are doing it for fun and really producing really fun games. You guys are give us the TLDR, give us the elevator pitch. What exactly is Cornucopias? And tell us a little bit about it. Then we&#8217;ll get into some of the fun stuff. The status of the game, the expansion strategy and everything else going on. But the floor is yours. Give us the TLDR on Cornucopias.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yeah, of course. Well, thanks for the compliment. And yeah, things have gone incredibly well for us lately. I think the industry has seen a little bit of an example of what might happen with gaming and Web3 gaming as a whole in this next bull cycle. So we&#8217;re getting a taste of that. We also expanded to Ethereum chain recently, so we now have liquidity on Uniswap, which has helped. So all of that working together with the fact that we are building an incredible AAA quality MMORPG game. The lore of Cornucopias is basically humanity has ascended from the earth&#8217;s surface due to a great calamity. And there are now these technologies that enable huge bubbles or domes in the sky. And each of these domes have a variety of gameplay experiences inside of them. For example, one that&#8217;s live right now, the status of our game is people are right now we&#8217;ve got about 1000 people that have access to play inside of our racing dome, which is Calido Valley Raceway. So that has a very metaverse type experience in the resort area. But then you can also leave the resort area and go into the raceway and race your NFT based vehicles. But each of these domes in the sky offer a different gaming experience. And you can use your vehicles to fly from dome to dome and explore the giant realm that is Cornucopias.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I love that the racing game is obviously, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve seen personally, what&#8217;s really taken off on Twitter. It looks absolutely electric. Before we get into a bunch of the other stuff, I want to talk about the whole sort of aspect of a MMORPG. I used to be a gamer. I would never quantify myself as a massive gamer nowhere like yourself or a lot of the loyal fans and gamers and community members that you guys have. But this is a word that is an acronym, excuse me, that is thrown around all the time. And this is massive multiplayer online role playing game.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
That&#8217;s six words strung into one. What exactly does that mean? I&#8217;d love if we could just go down a little rabbit hole on that topic. And I&#8217;d love you to explain why MMORPGs are so powerful and have such a high ceiling and such a wide spectrum of abilities for people to come in and join and have a lot of fun with.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yeah, well, massive multiplayer enables a lot of social elements that you don&#8217;t see in just a single player game. So that&#8217;s incredibly powerful in and of itself. And then when you combine that with quality graphics, so you get a lot of people into the game playing together. And then there&#8217;s quests and different things that allow you to socialize or spend time with others, with your friends inside the game. It creates an experience for people that just a single player game can&#8217;t do. And so I think that is why you see just amazing MMORPGs taken off. And there&#8217;s just a lot there in terms of experience for the player, for the gamer that makes it fun. And then when you add the Web3 element to that, it just makes it that much more powerful. Because with Web3 we&#8217;ve got the power of community. And I have to say, one of the things that is so compelling about Cornucopias, one of our differentiators, we have an amazing community. We&#8217;ve cultivated that completely organic from the very beginning. So people at our team, for example, very passionate and that has just carried down to our community and what we&#8217;ve done with community. And so now you bring this Web3 element into an MMORPG and these people are participating in the economics of the game with us. They&#8217;re participating in the token. And all of that together just creates this highly energized community. And ours happens to be a lot of fun. So we got people that get in, have a game party and go in and play together every day right now. There&#8217;s a group playing right now as we speak, I&#8217;m sure, but it&#8217;s just a lot of fun.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. We got to get into the blockchain aspect of this as well because everything you&#8217;ve really spoken about so far, and again, this is how you build a successful Web3 game, built on Web3 tech, but plays looks feels like a Web2 game. That&#8217;s exactly what you guys are doing. You guys have integrated with both Ethereum and Cardano networks and you plan to expand the access to additional blockchains and community partners as well. How the hell do you guys build a game that&#8217;s already integrated with two different networks? And I&#8217;d love you to talk about the complexities and the nightmare fuel that is present when trying to build a game that is interoperable, that allows users to play and compete and intertwine on a bunch of different blockchains. That&#8217;s got to be nightmare fuel. Walk us through it. How do you guys make this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question. So first of all, our strategy has always been start with one community in which we chose Cardano and then expand to all of Web3. And then eventually we&#8217;re going after mainstream gamers. That to us was a really wise strategy and so we were forced to build with quality the entire time because you&#8217;re not going to capture mainstream gamers without a real high quality experience. That&#8217;s just the way it works. So that being said, your question is around how do we integrate with multiple? So first of all, it was the token. So the token, we started off on Binance chain, then we expanded to Cardano when Cardano had more infrastructure. So the token is then on Cardano. Then more recently we moved some liquidity over to Ethereum as well. And so we have NFTs also. So that was fungible tokens. Now we have NFTs that are the player owned assets that empower our players to really participate in ownership and the key element of the game using these game assets throughout the world of Cornucopias. And we&#8217;re expanding to Ethereum with NFTs soon as well. And then when it comes to. So that wasn&#8217;t that complicated. But having NFTs that are dynamic, that change over time, that there&#8217;s all sorts of problems you need to solve with NFTs for games. And so that was a nightmare, to be honest. We had to look at, okay, what is the tech available for us to do on Cardano? And what is the upcoming tech on Cardano for NFTs, and what are the options there? And then what are the options on all of the different Ethereum protocols for NFTs and what is upcoming and what does it look like that is moving towards? And then we had to figure out what&#8217;s the lowest common denominator for both of those to make sure that we can have the same experience for NFTs with both as much as possible. So that was an incredible challenge. But for the most part, with the tokens, that part was easy. We had partners that helped us with that, and ChainPort played a big part of that. They&#8217;re a bridge that&#8217;s worked incredibly well. And yeah, we just deployed liquidity on various platforms, so overall it wasn&#8217;t too bad. But yeah, the NFT part was a little challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Of course, that&#8217;s got to be a little banana lands there. Another thing I want to discuss, speaking of NFTs, is how you guys continue to sell out. The drops are gonzo in minutes, every single time. What&#8217;s the secret sauce here? I know this is a genuine million dollar question that I&#8217;m asking, but you guys have what I think you&#8217;re at 45k Twitter followers, about 50k on Discord. Really good. But there&#8217;s other communities that have more that don&#8217;t sell out in minutes. What&#8217;s the secret sauce here?</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yeah, and that&#8217;s with a smaller community on Cardano. I mean, it is a top ten Layer 1 without a doubt, but in terms of community ecosystem, when you compare it to other chains. So the answer to your question is, it goes right back to people. Our strategy has always been, let&#8217;s put high quality graphics out and high quality gaming experience and high quality experience in everything that we do. Right? So the community is incredibly passionate. The team is passionate. All of those really add fuel to the fire. And when you have that and you&#8217;re delivering consistently over time. Rob and I, we have a show called COPI Cafe, where we communicate with our community every single week. We barely miss those. And it&#8217;s hard to pull off because we have to figure out around everything else we have going on. When are we going to shoot this show? But the effort of that, the point of that was this is crypto and people need to see what you&#8217;re doing. They need transparency because so many projects out there aren&#8217;t building and they keep kind of a veil of smoke and mirrors. And I don&#8217;t want to talk bad about anybody at all because a lot of projects are building and you see who&#8217;s doing that through the bear cycle. But what we&#8217;ve done with COPI Cafe is just show people over and over again what we&#8217;re building and remain transparent with the community. So when you combine a passionate community with transparency, with high quality graphics, AAA quality custom graphics, and the lore of our game, all of that pulls people into an exciting vision that&#8217;s just empowered even more by Web3.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Josh, you just brought up the word lore. This is a four letter word that is thrown around all over the place. You guys actually have done it. Every gaming team in the world, all creators in the world, want to create lore. How does one create lore, and my apologies if I&#8217;m overstepping here, but I feel like a lot of it is. There&#8217;s a shit ton of luck that goes into lore as well because you guys can&#8217;t really test the lore beforehand, you know what I mean? It&#8217;s like you have this vision of what the lore of your game is going to be, how it&#8217;s going to look, what is your messaging, what is your graphics like, what is the style, the lighting. And then you either have lore or you don&#8217;t. I feel like it&#8217;s binary, you know what I mean? How did you guys do it and what advice would you give to game studios, developers, creators who are trying to achieve and create lore in their games?</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
What advice would I give? I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m qualified for advice on lore, to be honest, because I haven&#8217;t done it enough. But I will say this, I think our lore is incredible and what we have done is we started with a vision for the game and the idea was, and the reason I&#8217;m so passionate about it is this game allows us to create in so many ways. And creating happens to be a huge one of my values personally and that&#8217;s what I want to be involved in is something where we can continually create. And so the lore ended up really empowering that vision. So we needed to find a story that made sense. And as a team we worked together and we built this foundational story. We had a guy named Jake on the team that&#8217;s a writer, and he came in and helped us with some ideas, and we bounced that back and forth. We started cultivating this story that resulted in humanity transcending, ascending above the earth&#8217;s surface into these giant domes and bubbles, which happened to be really cool looking as well. So it&#8217;s almost like we&#8217;ve created this lore that involves space travel but also encompasses the huge amount of variety that is in our vision that&#8217;s needed. And so collectively, the lore empowered our vision, and our vision empowered the lore. That&#8217;s about the best way I could answer it. And so I think you nailed it. In some ways, we got lucky with how that worked out, but it was also just creative, like creative storytelling. How do we create this story, the backbone for what it is that we&#8217;re building? And we all got in together and we iterated on it over and over. Now it&#8217;s, I think, up to, like 50 pages that we haven&#8217;t yet released, but there&#8217;s a lot more to it. We&#8217;ve only released a tiny amount of the lore. There&#8217;s so much more, which is exciting. And if you go to the Cornucopias wiki, for anybody watching, there&#8217;s a ton. There&#8217;s like 400 pages in our wiki. You can really research everything that we&#8217;re doing. We started with a white paper, and it was like 30 pages, and then we said, well, we need a lot more. So we started building out the Cornucopias wiki, and that&#8217;s just an enormous resource for everybody to find out more about us. The lore will also be in there eventually when we fully publicize it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. Lore is such an interesting topic, something I&#8217;d love to learn more about. Josh, you are buzzing, but we need to take a quick break and give a massive shout out to our sponsor of the show and longtime friends of cryptonews.com. That is the one and only PrimeXBT.

Let&#8217;s keep buzzing on Cornucopias for a little bit. I would love to learn a little bit more about the status of the game. A bunch of cool things out right now. Way more cool things coming out in the near future. Again, for reference, this episode is dropping early Q1 on, I want to say Jan 2. Mighty me, Jan 1. It&#8217;s literally going to be the first two days of 2024. So with that in mind, Josh, what do we have to look forward to coming up? What is the current status of the game? And then we&#8217;ll keep buzzing on the game and what else there is to come.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yeah, man. So a lot of fun stuff happening. Number one right now, the status of the game is we&#8217;re in pre alpha. So 1000 people, or maybe a little bit more than that, already have access to play the game from the public, from our community, and we&#8217;re doing now these new things where we&#8217;re going to communities and we&#8217;re saying, hey, do you have people that want to play? We can give you 30 passes. And so we&#8217;re starting to grow with these different various alpha communities and influencer communities as well, so that we can really just empower the community to see how amazing this game is and how cool the graphics are, because you don&#8217;t really know from just watching the YouTube videos. Everyone says, wow, your YouTube videos are amazing. But then when they get in and they experience the game, they&#8217;re mind blown. So that is one thing, that&#8217;s the status. So that&#8217;s our racing game. Calido Valley Resort and Calido Valley Raceway is live. In addition to, since this is airing in 2024, Rumble Ball, which is a really cool new little tiny game that we have for people. So you&#8217;re running around the resort and you might just be able to engage in a game of Rumble Ball, which is very similar to soccer or football if you&#8217;re from the UK area. So the game is really cool. It&#8217;s a lot of fun. The physics are amazing in that. So I think people are getting, they&#8217;re having a lot of fun with that and a lot of fun with racing, but that&#8217;s only one small element of the game that&#8217;s been made live. So that&#8217;s the status. We&#8217;re also currently running a node sale. Nodes are a way to participate in adding value to our ecosystem. And the way the node sales work is, I don&#8217;t know what tier we&#8217;ll be on by the time this airs. But whatever tier you&#8217;re on, you can buy a node or you can buy ten nodes, and with our nodes you can operate up to 50, most likely from one computer. So you just buy these node license NFTs and then you participate in the rewards for that. And you&#8217;re providing us a service. By operating the node, you&#8217;re helping us to improve our game, download speeds for all the users, and you&#8217;re helping us to not have a single point of failure. So it creates more security and safety and better user experience in Cornucopias for all these tidal wave of new users that we expect to be coming from crypto in 2024. So it&#8217;s a very important piece of technology that we&#8217;ll be launching in 2024. And the node sale is active and live right now. Also, we&#8217;ve previously sold land NFTs and these land NFTs are coming available very soon. That&#8217;s going to be in our themed zones. Theme zones are the giant bubbles in the sky. Like I mentioned one of them, you might have seen this in some of our graphics, looks like Colorado. There&#8217;s streams and beautiful mountains and beautiful aspen trees and a huge landscape. 8 km by 8 km. We&#8217;re going to be opening up multiple of those domes, which each one in and of themselves takes about 2 hours to walk across on the X or the Y axis. So it&#8217;s a huge amount of land to explore. And so that&#8217;s going to be really cool. And people are going to be able to pick their properties in 2024. They&#8217;re going to be able to find out, hey, I&#8217;m taking my NFT that I&#8217;ve owned for a while now, and I get to pick my land and place that down and then start building on it, which is really exciting. So a lot of cool things coming up in 2024. We&#8217;re really going to be scaling up the team, probably more in abour March, April. And building out segmented teams for a variety of value adds to the game to speed up certain areas, which will be exciting as well. So for example, the character avatar creator should be launched early January, if not February, most likely. And that&#8217;s going to create variety in the game. But that means you can go in, create your own avatar. There&#8217;s tons of different presets that you can change, the lips, the nose, the mouth, the skin, the hair color, all that stuff, and then you create your own avatar. Well, we currently only have a few different outfits. We may be like 20 outfits for the avatars. That means we need to really ramp up our outfits team. So we&#8217;ll be ramping that up in 2024. We&#8217;ll also be ramping up the team that helps us to build out the custom domes, which is another really amazing feature of Cornucopias, which is where the community is empowered to build their own gaming experiences. So that means for those, we&#8217;re going to be building out player development kits or downloadable content kits. So you might say, hey, I&#8217;m going to start something for Cryptonews. This is for our community only. We&#8217;re going to do a PVP battle, and I want it to be a tropical landscape. And they&#8217;re going to be playing a battle like capture the flag. And you get to set that up with the kits that we provide you. So you get to create and place the trees and set the environment and all of those things, which really can be exciting because it&#8217;s going to be an incredible challenge for us. But that&#8217;s why we need to get a full team around it. So, sorry long answer, but we have a lot. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
So on top of beefing up the team and really just increasing sort of the internal and external bandwidth, main goal of every single game is to increase daily active users. Right? That&#8217;s sort of DAU. And I could be wrong here, but DAU is the most powerful metric when it comes to gaming. That just means you have the most attention. If you have the most attention, you have the most power. We live in a world of power. Everyone here gets the point. What is your guys expansion strategy to increase DAU daily active users? Interoperability, marketing, what else? What else do we have on the docket in order to really blow this up and grab a bunch of market share and attention from not only Web3 gamers, but Web2 gamers as well?</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yeah, absolutely. There&#8217;s a lot there. So you name two of them. Interoperability is important because now that&#8217;s created a marketing plan that&#8217;s around marketing to all of Web3. And eventually what I mentioned before is going mainstream and so advancing our marketing to target mainstream gamers. Of course, we&#8217;ve been grabbing some mainstream gamers already through our marketing, but when you really start to focus strategically around that, you really start to get access to a new target market of people. So that&#8217;s just one start there. Then next up you have the actual game itself and the game releases. We&#8217;re involving our community with each game release and we do that on a monthly cadence, which is very exciting. And this is counterintuitive. It&#8217;s a different paradigm than mainstream games because mainstream games typically build five to eight years and then they finally release something and then they get the community input as opposed to Web3 gaming where you build, involve the community all along the way on a regular cadence and with our team, the regular cadence is awesome. We are releasing new stuff on a monthly basis. New game releases every single month that has tons more things to get people excited about. So the community gets more excited, more people are pulled in, more people are enjoying the game, more daily active users. We also have to be able to scale with that. So we&#8217;re setting up our server ecosystem to be able to handle high amounts of volume and remain performant. So there&#8217;s that as well. But the final thing that I would say for that question is the reward system. We&#8217;ve got a reward system and we don&#8217;t like to call it play to earn because our game is fun. People are playing to have fun, but we&#8217;re going to utilize our rewards in creative ways. For example, there might be a racing tournament. We&#8217;re likely going to do something called the race of the chains, where we involve multiple different chains. And we have a racing tournament in 2024. So things like that really pull people into what you&#8217;re doing and it builds hype. And we&#8217;ll have a lot of sponsors and various people that are involved in that to bring in multiple other ecosystems and involve the crypto community and have something incredibly fun that results in finally an in person, conference style live race of the final ten of the best in the world. So that kind of thing is another deal that we will have going on next year as well. So hopefully that answered your question. Go to market strategy is always for me about people first involving strategic communities and offering them value, significant value. So hopefully my answer covered each of those elements. I think it did.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
No, that was electric. Thank you. We are getting a little tight for time. A couple more questions here. Josh, you got to give me the lowdown on COPI. COPI is your guys coin. We do not talk about a lot of price action on the pod ever. However, you guys, it would be nonsensical for me to not note that COPI has absolutely ripped over the last month. I want to say $0.02 all the way up to $0.12. Quick math, 600%. That&#8217;s pretty crazy. What is the reason behind this? I know, again, like I said, we&#8217;re not going to get into speculation. We&#8217;re not going to talk about anything by my coin related, but I&#8217;d love, just as someone who&#8217;s also interested in COPI, if you could give me sort of the quick value prop. What exactly is it used for? If I was perhaps interested in buying COPI, why would I buy it? And if you could just give us a little bit of TLDR on why COPI ripped so hard over the last couple of weeks, that would be lovely.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
Yeah, absolutely. Well, COPI, it gives you utility in our ecosystem, and so we&#8217;re going to have governance around COPI holders. We&#8217;re also going to have the ability to use COPI for in game assets and things of that nature, so you can participate in buying a special vehicle utilizing your COPI. So governance and in game assets and participating in the in game economy, which makes it a lot of fun. The TLDR on why the growth? I think there&#8217;s been a large amount of interest. We&#8217;re heading into the next bull cycle for crypto. So the bitcoin halving is in 2024. I think it&#8217;s like April 24 or something like that. March 24, somewhere around there. Anyway, that creates some anticipation with the OG crypto community. And so I think there&#8217;s a little bit just happening just from that because you see this new momentum with Bitcoin and many of the other coins are correlated. But we also, like you said, have started to get some attention based upon the quality of what we&#8217;re putting out there. And I think that&#8217;s the most important reason, is people are seeing that Cornucopias has been delivering. These guys have been working their asses off in the bear cycle, and they&#8217;ve been producing, delivering. So we have been building a quality game and a quality community, and people are finally starting to see it. Furthermore, we expanded, as mentioned before, liquidity to the Ethereum ecosystem on Uniswap. And there&#8217;s a lot of new users that are holding COPI from Ethereum. So I think it&#8217;s a combination of all of those, and there&#8217;s probably some other factors I haven&#8217;t even considered. But most importantly, people see what we&#8217;re doing and they get excited. Wow, this is a solid project. At least that&#8217;s what I would say.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I love that. Josh, give me a couple of hot takes before we let you go here today. It doesn&#8217;t have to be Web3 gaming related can be anything that tickles your fancy, can be health, wealth, happiness, space, AI, you name it. Give me a couple of hot takes or things that you are passionate about current day before we wrap up and let you go.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />
All right. That&#8217;s a good question, hot takes. Well, I think, number one, I&#8217;m incredibly excited about, and this is kind of on topic, but Web3 gaming, I think we&#8217;re going to see a totally new crypto this time around because you have legitimate gaming projects in Web3 that are bringing in a new wave of users, and I think that&#8217;s bringing powerful utility for the crypto industry, and I think it&#8217;s an amazing thing and I&#8217;m excited to see that happening because I believe the crypto industry is very important for tons of reasons, read earlier in my bio, but also just empowering people and transparency and all the things that come with it. I also think that aside from the Web3 gaming and that tidal wave that we would likely see coming up this next cycle, I think AI is going to have a pretty cool implication in regards to how it combines with gaming and also crypto. So some powerful new storylines might be coming out this next year. I know for one, at Cornucopias we are looking to have AI powered NPC NFTs. So for anyone that&#8217;s noticing the mouthful of acronyms there, that&#8217;s basically you take an NPCA non player character that&#8217;s in the game. So maybe you and I are in Cornucopias playing and another character walks up to us. It&#8217;s not powered by an actual player, but it&#8217;s programmed in the system to add some sort of value, right? Well, if you empower that player with AI, like LLM, like a large language model like ChatGPT or something like that, but it&#8217;s refined to the Cornucopias lore and data set, you now have a player that you can have a conversation with, provided it&#8217;s performant enough and fast enough with the data. So now you have an AI powered NPC. We&#8217;ll take that a step further and turn it into an NFT and the player can own their own Ai NFT NPC. It&#8217;s hard to talk about that because there&#8217;s so many acronyms, but it&#8217;s just one little example of what I think could happen with AI and gaming. There&#8217;s so much more. And I think that I&#8217;m intimidated by what AI can do, by the power, because I think we don&#8217;t really know where it&#8217;s going to go just yet, and I think we do need to be mindful of it. But I also think it can add a lot of value as well. So it&#8217;s something that we intend to utilize and it&#8217;s something that we also want to remain cautious of. That&#8217;s from our team at Cornucopias. That&#8217;s kind of our approach to it. So yeah, those are my hot takes. Hopefully that covered it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
AI is going to be wild, especially in gaming, especially three, four years down the road when the best Cornucopias player is probably going to be some AI bot. That&#8217;s just all how it&#8217;s going to go. Is he or she or it is going to read the script a bajillion quadrillion times and it&#8217;s going to know all the best moves, how to dominate and boom. I&#8217;m excited for that. That&#8217;ll be a fun time, as always. We&#8217;re humans. We are the top dogs for a reason. We&#8217;ll adapt and iterate and we&#8217;ll continue to run the show. So I&#8217;m not worried. I&#8217;m excited for that. Josh, incredible episode. Thank you so much for coming on. Really appreciate it. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Cornucopias online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Jones </strong><br />

<strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, still coming in hot from Mexico. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show coming in hot from Boulder, Deion Nation. We have someone with the best name in the world. We have another Mathew coming on the show. Today we have Mathew Sweezey, the Chief Strategy Officer of Smart Token Labs and former Co-Founder of the Salesforce ever heard of him, Web3 Studio where he helped create Salesforces, first commercial Web3 products and worked with the world&#8217;s largest brands on their Web3 strategy. A 2X author, his last book, The Context Marketing Revolution was published by HBR in 2020. I am super pumped for this one. We are going to get into a whole lot of stuff, including the Smart Cat proof of concept. And as a Cool Cat holder, this is going to be an absolute treat. Mathew, welcome to show my friend. How you doing? Pump to have you on.</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
Great to be here Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Great name, dude. Also, your flow is electric as well. You and I were talking before the show. You have like this crazy combo of tech guy and like surfer dude vibes. What&#8217;s that from? You got to walk me through your past. Like, where do you get this vibe from? Where do you get this like level of chillness from?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
I live in Colorado, so take that for what it is. But just always been an outdoor athlete. Since I was a kid, I wanted to be a professional mountain biker when I was like 10 before they had youth racing. And then just always stayed in the outdoors. Was an outdoor guy. Was a backpacking guy for a while and was in college and put in like 220 days a year of outdoor sports. I guess just being outside keeps me happy. And then when I&#8217;m not outside, I&#8217;m playing on the crypto world.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Pretty good life, eh? I love that. Let&#8217;s jump right into the Salesforce stuff. That obviously stands out when reading the bio. Everyone knows who Salesforce is. I have a sales background myself. If you have been in sales, you&#8217;ve definitely heard of Salesforce, the World&#8217;s Best CRM. I don&#8217;t even think there&#8217;s a close second and just a myriad of products on top of that. Walk me through this whole, boom, what the hell happened there? You, like, did they just hit you up and they&#8217;re like, hey, we are launching a Web3 studio. We need someone to run the show here. Walk me through the whole process, how you got on boarded, some of the brands you worked with, some of the products you helped create. This is so cool. I want to hear everything about it.</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
Yeah, so originally back in the day was a very early employee of a product called Part-O. We were a marketing automation platform. So I was employee 12, helped grow that company up and created the marketing automation space and then we sold that company off. And then we&#8217;re acquired by Salesforce and we became then part of Salesforce&#8217;s marketing cloud. During that transition, I focused on what we know as thought leadership. So I owned the future of marketing narrative for Salesforce. So worked on the future program and the FutureLab was a part of the FutureLab. So always focused on Future technology and how technology would change the interaction between brands and consumers. Got introduced to Web3 early on through just regular blockchain, Bitcoin. Didn&#8217;t really see how that would change the dynamic between brand and consumer other than just a financial transaction. And then till the NFT craze. And then I started to be able to see a new type of digital experience, a new type of digital primitive that could actually change the dynamics. And that&#8217;s what got me interested. So started poking around and then started interacting with the emerging technology team. And then just connected and said, here&#8217;s what I want to do. And they said, great, let&#8217;s go do that. And then we co-founded the Web3 studio. So then help bring up Web3 products to Salesforce. Talking with some of our biggest customers, they were wanting to do some of these things, right? Companies like Adidas, companies like Sony, companies like Unilever, companies like Starbucks. So started to work with them on what does this mean for them? What tools did they need? And then that we brought out the world&#8217;s first Web3 CRM enterprise CRM so that if you sold physical products and digital products, you could keep both those two things together inside the CRM. And that was kind of the first foray for Salesforce into that world.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
That is sick. What about some of the combos you had with the BOD, the Board of Directors? Like again, you get brought in. I feel like there must have been some people like what the hell are we doing here? Right? Like this is Fugazi. What was that all like?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
There&#8217;s a lot of that. The good part is, we had some of the biggest executives, Mark Benioff, as well as the president, Alex Dayum, both on our side. So they were always in conversations with a lot of these brands. And the interesting thing during the NFT craze was every CEO wanted to know what Web3 meant, right? So no one really knew what it meant, but everyone wanted to know what it meant. So it was a hot topic conversation all the way up until ChatGPT came out. So you had this interesting conversation and people just trying to figure out what this means for their world and their future. Not to mention it dominated the news cycle. So there&#8217;s a lot of conversations. Not everyone knew what it meant, but we were just gonna go try to figure it out, see what it meant.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
When you&#8217;re speaking with these brands, walk me through some of the conversations, when you&#8217;re getting on with Starbucks or Adidas or McDonald&#8217;s or some of these Fortune 500, very recognizable brands where everyone in the world, but not everyone, 95% of people in the world, see their logo and have some sort of affinity to it, have used their products, consume their products one time or another, how would you speak to them? What kind of utility would you throw their way and be like, hey, this is the power of Web3, this is the power of NFT, this is how we can amplify and bring your brand to the next level? What did those combos sound like?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
Yeah, that&#8217;s a really good question. Most of the time the conversations were led by their desire to have better experiences and deeper connection. You started to hear terms such as single casting, which is the concept that I brand. For me to engage with my customers, there&#8217;s usually intermediaries in between. I&#8217;m usually having to go through a platform like a Facebook or a TikTok or a Twitter, some type of media channel. And they see this as a direct connection. Talking with one of the world&#8217;s largest football clubs, they have this concept of, listen, I&#8217;ve got billions of fans around the world and I don&#8217;t know who they are. I only have about 2 million email addresses. But if I can put a token in everybody&#8217;s hands and directly interact with them through the token, that can create a totally new dynamic for me through that interaction. So you had lots of different ideas, different brands, saw different things. Some brands wanted the concept of technical innovation, such as car companies might want to tokenize the car and say, now, how do we keep up with service records better? How do we keep up with assets and ownership better? You had luxury brands such as Gucci wanting to be able to do, see Web3 as in a way that they can do proof. So how can I verify that this is a Gucci bag? And so they can start to use Web3 technology for verification. You also then had the concept of exclusivity, really kind of played in heavy with a lot of luxury brands. They really saw this as digital ownership. You then got into a wide array and then you get into the concept of future-proofing. And every brand believes that Gen Z and Gen Alpha are really game native. And they&#8217;re native to these worlds that are digital ownership worlds. So if I go and talk to a niece or a cousin of mine that&#8217;s younger and ask them a simple question about how many digital t-shirts do you own in Fortnite? They own 100 and how many t-shirts they have in their physical drawer, they might have 10. And so when you start to then walk down these paths, brands really see these digital worlds and this concept of digital ownership of how they can future-proof, how they can relate and how they then connect to the future audiences, as well as a wide array. And just depending on the industry of what they might have wanted to do with Web3. So it was pretty wide and broad, but really it all came back to innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love the term future-proofing. I&#8217;d love to buzz on this for a little bit here. In your definition, and I guess in the actual, theoretical and practical definition of that term, it&#8217;s really just making sure that a product or service or entity has a runway for the future. It makes sure that it won&#8217;t fade away like, you know, taxis. Well, I mean, taxis aren&#8217;t completely gone, but you know what I mean. Or hotel is another bad example, Airbnb. But is that exactly what you&#8217;re trying to get at with that term future-proofing?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, future, exactly right. So if you just look at the basic, you know, look at the Fortune 500, right? How many companies stay on the Fortune 500 now for more than a decade? It&#8217;s very few, right? So this concept of how do we stay relevant as a company and a business in the future? That&#8217;s really what future-proofing means. And so if you look at, you know, if you take the sports team example, future-proofing means if I&#8217;m not connecting with kids before they turn 18, the statistic is if the kid is not a fan of your brand, of your sports team before they age of 18, they will not be a lifelong fan. That&#8217;s the time that you develop lifelong fandom. So future-proofing means that we need to actually be in 10 years ahead, engaging with people in a very specific way so that in 10 years in the future, we have a lifelong fan base that&#8217;s gonna sustain our brand.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very cool. Wow, you sort of got my head spin in there. Huge sports guy myself and I&#8217;m trying to think of, yeah, I mean, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever flip flopped any teams since I&#8217;ve been 18. All my, you know, for the big four, for my hockey, baseball, football, basketball, it&#8217;s the exact same. That&#8217;s crazy. Good point there. Never really thought about that. I mean, I do have a couple buddies who are bandwagoners who jump ship at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey</strong><br />
That&#8217;s the bandwagoners. They&#8217;re just gonna do whatever&#8217;s trendy. That&#8217;s just all know the demographic.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Whatever is hot, I love that. Let&#8217;s jump into Smart Layer, which is the tech used for the Smart Cat proof of concept. Before we get into that, give me the TLDR at Smart Token Labs, you are Chief Strategy Officer there. What exactly do you do there? What exactly is Smart Token Labs? And then we&#8217;ll get into Smart Layer and Smart Cat proof of concept, which is something that I&#8217;m incredibly interested in. But before that, walk me through your Rollish Chief Strategy Officer at Smart Token Labs.</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey</strong><br />
Yeah, so Smart Token Labs is a team that&#8217;s behind ERC-5169 and a technology called Token Script really focused on this idea of token centric architecture. My role as Chief Strategy Officer is I help lead go to market efforts as well as help lead a lot of brand and partnership efforts. Really trying to walk us through, you know, taking this technology to market. It&#8217;s really kind of my role as Chief Strategy Officer. And that technology really is kind of focused on this concept of what we call token centric architecture, but the reason I joined and left Salesforce was in the conversations at Salesforce with all the brand leaders. There&#8217;s three major problems that kept brands from adopting Web3. Number one was the regulations around tokens. Number two was the UX of Web3. It was very difficult. And number three was the utility. What can you do with these things once you have them? And Smart Token Labs is focused on solving all three of those issues. And so when I saw the technology and I saw what it could do that then allowed us to then say, hey, we can solve those problems. And now we can then start to see a very different future for Web3 with these brands. So that&#8217;s my role. That&#8217;s what Smart Token Labs does. And we are bringing to market this technology under the moniker of Smart Layer.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And Smart Layer is the tech that is powering the first xNFT game on EVM. You guys passed a million transactions in a couple of weeks. That is absolutely bonkers. Walk me through Smart Cat game. What exactly is it? Is it a derivative of Cool Cat? Well, it is. It looks like it, but walk me through the whole process and like elongate this. Like, don&#8217;t just give me the TLDR. Give me the good D tier.</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey</strong><br />
So Smart Layer is all about executable tokens and NFTs. It&#8217;s executable tokens and NFTs for EVM. So step one is what is an executable token? An executable token is really this concept of moving tokens and NFTs beyond just being currencies and collectibles to becoming applications. It&#8217;s really solving this questions of what can we do with these things beyond just being an asset class? And that&#8217;s really when we move from assets to experiences. And that&#8217;s what we start to unlock is this is a new digital primitive for new types of experiences for consumers, not just a new asset class. And that&#8217;s really kind of what we work on and focus on. Now we brought out Smart Layer back and announced that we&#8217;d be doing Smart Layer at about the middle of the year. And then we built a community around it. And that community is now about three and a half million people inside that community who have executable tokens in their hands as a membership pass. And there&#8217;s a whole another piece of tech that we can talk about there. So we&#8217;ve got this community. What we then wanted to do with this community is give them some type of reward for being in the community. So we have a derivative NFT product. So if you ever minted, if you remember Nifty Taylor with Board Apes and Mutant Apes where you could take your ape and that was our technology, the derivative technology that allowed you to create a derivative of any NFT. So we did that for Nifty Taylor. We used that same technology for ourselves, took one of our Cool Cats and allowed you to then create a derivative of that Cool Cat. We didn&#8217;t tell the community anything other than this is just gonna be a derivative mint. They minted out 940 ,000 of those in a few days. And then we released the game very shortly after. The game is based on our technology, which takes any token and allows it to become an executable token or an application or a mini-dap in and of itself. So to showcase this technology, what we did is we made that a game. It&#8217;s a very simple Tamagotchi style game where you get your token, you can either play it in a web two environment or you can play it inside of a wallet. Joy ID is the wallet of choice that we currently integrate with. And that allows the token to become a game. Now that&#8217;s revolutionary in a couple of ways. Number one, this is the first xNFT on Polygon. Because of this, we were able to then put a massive amount of transactions on chain. It&#8217;s the number one game on Polygon right now by transactions. We&#8217;ve put over 2 million transactions in the last 30 days on Polygon. It&#8217;s one of the top tokens just in the world right now. It&#8217;s one of the top collectibles, I believe it&#8217;s number 14, based on lots of different metrics. And the community just loves it, they play it. And they&#8217;re playing this game. Now the other interesting thing is why do they play the game? Well, they&#8217;re playing the game to earn points. So if we start to think about this concept of questing, we start to think about these ideas of engagement. That&#8217;s exactly what you can do through the token is you can make the token an experience. And so by playing this game, our community are earning points inside of our community and leveling up, right? So there&#8217;s a whole ecosystem and world here, but it&#8217;s extremely powerful because we can take this xNFT, put it in anybody&#8217;s hands and inside of this wallet, you now play the game inside of the wallet. The token is the game and that&#8217;s a very big revolutionary step. For how we start to think about what happens next with tokens and NFTs. This allows us to see that they can move beyond an asset class and actually become applications and experiences in and of themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So this is very complex here. So walking through xNFTs. xNFTs are apps and this is driven by ERC-5169. I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through the UX, the user experience of actually playing a game within a wallet. Because this is something as someone who messes around with Web3 for hours every single day. This is something that I&#8217;ve never messed around with. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever played. In fact, I haven&#8217;t played a game within a wallet before. I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through the actual process, the user experience. How does this look like? Is this like MetaMask where I have a Chrome extension? I open it up and I can play a game within a tab. Like walking through the whole experience. They&#8217;re very intrigued by this.</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey</strong><br />
So first, Matt, you&#8217;re gonna go get a Joy ID wallet when we get off this and you&#8217;re gonna send me your wallet address and I&#8217;m gonna send you one of these cats and send that at the play with. So you can experience this firsthand. So let&#8217;s just kind of step by step. So first off, an xNFT or an executable NFT is gonna be any NFT enabled by ERC-5169, which allows that NFT to then point to an external URI. So it can then carry script beyond what&#8217;s inside the smart contract. That then allows, we then have a language called Token Script that we&#8217;ve created that then allows you to then program and then have an interface and then have a full application suite behind this token. So that&#8217;s kind of what you have. As you have smart contract controlling the ownership aspects and you have the ERC-5169 Token Script controlling the visual front end aspects, the application, whatever it does. So you&#8217;ve got a Web3 component and a Web2 component combined together inside of a token. Then inside of that token, you then can open this token into multiple different environments. Any wallet that is enabled to read Token Script can then open this token and then play that token directly. So let me give you a couple of examples. So inside the Smart Cat game, it&#8217;s a very simple Tomagachi style game, right? If you remember the Tomagachi is the little key chain games that you feed a cat, keep the cat alive. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing here, right? So you&#8217;ve got multiple actions that you can take per day. You can feed your cat, you can set up play dates with other cats. You can talk to other cats. You have token to token messaging inside of this cat. So you can talk to other cats and organize and collaborate. And it&#8217;s a very simple game. So you open the token, you then see all of the buttons, the actions and functions, and you can engage with those functions directly. Some are on chain functions and some are off chain functions. So you&#8217;ve got all of that capability in there. But I just wanna give you like an idea of what we&#8217;ve also done with xNFTs in this concept of executable NFTs and where this can go. So a few years ago, one of the world&#8217;s largest car companies asked us to help them innovate the future of cars. And so what we did is we created an xNFT for them for that car ownership. Now, what that meant was when you got the car, you were given this token. And then when you open that token in your wallet, there&#8217;s a button to start the car on the token. There&#8217;s a button to rent the car on the token. There&#8217;s a button to sell the car on the token because that token is always gonna have that information and it&#8217;s gonna always be public facing. It allows an individual to have a very different type of experience. So then when you go to a service station, you simply connect your token. All that information is automatically added to the car record. So you&#8217;re not having to then manually keep up with things. So it&#8217;s a combination of essentially allowing any functionality that we can imagine to take place directly inside of the wallet and it happened directly on the token itself. So we don&#8217;t need to go to another dAPP. We don&#8217;t need to download another application. I literally give you the entire experience in a package.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Wow. Then this is exactly what we need right now. This is literally account abstraction 101, which is one of the biggest issues with crypto as a whole. We, there&#8217;s just so much friction. We live in crypto is literally like the capital city of friction bill. Like we, you know what I mean? Like it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s terrible. In your eyes, how can we use this tech? How can we use ERC-5169 in other aspects of utility, in other forms of utility, not just Smart Cat, but in other options. I know you just spoke with the car one as well, but like if you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re back at your job at Salesforce or in your current job right now as chief strategy officer and you&#8217;re working with Fortune 500 brands, how would you pitch them on the use of ERC-5169 dynamic NFTs, executable NFTs and how it can help their brand with loyalty, future-proofing.</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey</strong><br />
Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of different applications. So there&#8217;s Web3 and Web2, right? So if we go to the Web3 world, let&#8217;s just look at gaming really quickly. If you&#8217;re familiar with gaming and you may not be, it takes about four years to go from an idea to a game that you can play. It&#8217;s a very long time when they announce a game to when they play a game. So what you have the ability to do is a lot of games will create games before games. What you can do with xNFT is you can actually create all of your IP and your assets and launch them as xNFT&#8217;s that are all playable. So people can then start to play and engage with the game assets and become invested in the game and the game assets in a very lightweight way. Cause you can create these assets very quickly. You can change them over time. They can become questing. They can have all different types of aspects, but you now have a game before the game to really allow people to invest inside the game, build up assets inside the game well before when the game launches. So we see this as a new dynamic for how we think about engaging communities between those two time frames of I&#8217;ve announced my game and when the game is actually going to be launched. So that&#8217;s a concept you can use inside of gaming. Let&#8217;s just go and look at the example of what happens when McDonald&#8217;s has the monopoly game. You can scan the QR code on the back of your cup and that automatically then gives you a token. Then you open that token and then it&#8217;s got all of the action that you need to do. So combine a bunch of the things that we&#8217;ve done really well in Web3 that the Web2 world hasn&#8217;t adopted yet. Questing is one of those. These the ability for us to use humans to drive human actions that drive flywheels. Whether that be take this action on my behalf, do this thing, it&#8217;s the next evolution of user generated content. And when you can then put that on a token itself and then that token can then accrue value, you then start to really combine lots of these ideas where now we can say anybody can have one of these tokens, you&#8217;ve already bought out, you know, you get your cup, scan the token, now you&#8217;ve got the token. If you want to up level that token, here are the actions you take, you do those directly on the token and then that value is transferable or you can hold it, it becomes interoperable. Now you start to think and interoperate with that thing inside the greater world. So there&#8217;s lots of different things that we can do here. I think the biggest concept just to keep in mind is every time that we&#8217;ve talked to brands, the question always comes back to, there needs to be more than just being an asset or a collectible. There has to be things that this does in experience. We can now literally infuse any experience possible inside of a token. And that&#8217;s kind of the big aha, the big unlock, is now that there&#8217;s a reason to own these things because they can now do things and we can do things within them. I&#8217;m just like the example of a game instead of a game, I love old tokens, you can even take this to DeFi. If I now have a DeFi token and I open that token in my wallet, why should I have to go other places to find out information about that token? Why can&#8217;t that automatically happen through the token? Why can&#8217;t that be a part of the service of that token? Of here&#8217;s all the information about this company. Here&#8217;s all the different things that you can do. Like why isn&#8217;t it packed with information and an experience of this is where you need to go to vote. This is what you need to do and have all those things right there on the token itself. So that&#8217;s when we start to then see assets and experiences combined. And that&#8217;s when we see the power and the utility in the future of NFTs.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Mathew, you&#8217;ve been on a roll. We got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor, PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to keep buzzing and we are going to jump into token-to-token messaging, which is something that is super friggin cool and I can&#8217;t wait to get into.

All one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with Mathew. Let&#8217;s jump into token-to-token messaging. When I was doing a bit of prep for the show, I was like, this is wild. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen this before in crypto. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s another team, there&#8217;s hundreds and thousands of incredible teams building incredible things in crypto. Token-to-token messaging using xNFTs, of course, driven by ERC-5169. You can open up direct channels for holders to communicate via tokens rather than wallets, even if the token changes hands. This is bonkers. I&#8217;m like, as reading that, I should have done more prep and I should have watched a video or something so I could better understand this. But we have you on the show, so I can ask you now. So I&#8217;m throwing the ball over to your court. How the hell does this work? This seems absolutely brilliant and takes away a lot of friction. How did you guys make this happen and give us some other use cases besides just the Smart Cats game here?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
Yeah, sure. So first off, what is it? So token to token messaging allows one token to talk to another token, right? This is gonna then stay with the token, it&#8217;s gonna be secure, it&#8217;s gonna be private. So if that token transfers, that messaging is not going to then transfer. It&#8217;s gonna be tied to the wallet and to the token. So it&#8217;s private and secure, right? So it&#8217;s not just like, if you have a chat, it just doesn&#8217;t transfer the token. Now what this unlocks is this unlocks a lot of really powerful methodologies. If we go back to that concept that big football club has that they want a one to one communication channel with every token holder, they now have that. So every token now has its own communication that it can have that can go from the parent, whoever issues the token to all the token holders. This can also allow token to token. So I can then talk to anybody else that has this token. So we can have our own private back channels inside of the tokens as well. How we&#8217;ve used this in the game is as part of the game, you have to set up a play date. So one of the ways that you up level your cat is you find somebody else in the community. You set up a play date and your cats play together. To organize those things, they&#8217;re using token to token messaging. To then find tokens, to then engage with each other. And then they built up this network and now it&#8217;s a social channel behind the scenes where they can then engage with each other. We just created, cause we thought it would be fun. We thought it&#8217;d be amazing that if I issue a token, I can talk directly to all my token issuers directly through that token. And it&#8217;s working really well. So we&#8217;re extremely excited to see this. We&#8217;d love to see other projects that want to kind of try this out. And so yeah, that&#8217;s the basics of token to token messaging.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I mean, yeah, going back to your football example that you keep bringing up, again, I&#8217;m trying to think of which club it might be, but regardless, Cest La Vie, that takes away their need to fire off emails. Because now you have, you know, token to token messaging, and now you have your community. Instead of everyone shit talking each other on Facebook groups or Instagram, you know, comments, or I mean, no one really uses this court except in Web3. But you know what I mean? It&#8217;s like, now you have this massive community as well. And going back to your Smart Cat point, when you&#8217;re creating a game in present day, unless that game has some social aspect, it&#8217;s almost impossible for that game to go viral. Like you need to, that game must also be a town square. And this is just sort of checking off all those boxes, one by one. That&#8217;s wild, absolutely wild. Now we are getting a little tight for time here. A couple more questions, and then we&#8217;ll wrap up here, Mathew. The, all NFTs will be xNFTs. This is in your guys report that you launched and this is, I love hot takes on the Cryptonews pod. We absolutely love this. You and the team are in the camp that xNFTs are going to power the next bull market. It&#8217;s going to drive engagement for existing projects, unlock new creative concepts in gaming, entertainment, loyalty, brand marketing, you name it. How will xNFTs be the catalyst for growth and be the thing that powers the next crypto bull market?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
That&#8217;s a great question. We saw that the last bull market was driven by speculation. We&#8217;re gonna buy these things, speculative assets. That was the big kind of, actually been the impetus of the last big, two big bull runs, 2017, 2021, was all about financial speculation. We&#8217;re now in this world where people expect to see something more. They expect to see utility, they expect to see what else can these things do? They wanna see experiences, they wanna see more than I&#8217;ve just gotten membership into a token-gated experience. And that&#8217;s what xNFT&#8217;s allow, is they allow us to then bake in anything into these NFTs, whether that be it becomes an application, whether that be we can actually then use these things to then be games inside of games. We can then use them to solve existing problems. They allow us to then put different types of information and engagements inside of those NFTs, like we said, token and token messaging. So they allow any community to really go beyond whatever we&#8217;ve done before, which was just currencies and collectibles to now really create true Web3 native digital experiences that happen inside of wallets, or they can fire inside of Web2 worlds. And so that&#8217;s why we believe that all future NFTs will be xNFT&#8217;s just because those, the utility that&#8217;s gonna be required. Token gating wasn&#8217;t a utility until Board Apes created it. After they created it, you can&#8217;t find a single NFT project that doesn&#8217;t also have token gating for a Discord channel. That&#8217;s the most basic utility we can imagine. If we then start to say that what else can we start to do, this is the palette, this is the tool set that we can then experiment and experience whatever we want. So this allows us to go beyond just token gating to really creating anything inside of that token that we want. And so with that, we fully believe that there will not just be simply NFTs in the future, because why? Why wouldn&#8217;t I want to add messaging to this community? Why wouldn&#8217;t I want to add the ability for you to interact with this inside of the wallet? Why wouldn&#8217;t I want this thing to have advanced functionality become an application and do more? So we believe that if you want to add utility, that this is the best way to add utility. And we think that any NFT in the future is going to have to have utility. Because just the simple narrative of you get access to this community is not going to be enough in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
That moved the needle during COVID when it&#8217;s like, okay, I mean, we were in front of our computers doing jack shit all day and being a part of a community made you feel a little extra special. And of course, like you said, you had the main value prop, which was financial speculation. That&#8217;s why I did it. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s why you did it. And a lot of other people did it. It was fun. It was electric. I remember buying a Cool Cat and three weeks later, I&#8217;ve 5X my money. Like, wow, I just bought a JPEG and I&#8217;m five times richer now. This is wild. This is fun. I also get to shoot the shit with 3000 other people who own collectively own 10,000 different Cool Cats. And we get to be in this community together. It was sort of fun, but those days are gone. Now I can, you know, go to the beach right now, which I couldn&#8217;t do back then. Well, I mean, in Mexico, COVID wasn&#8217;t a thing, but you know what I mean. NFTs is a whole. You are obviously an NFT guy, an NFT guru. You definitely know what you&#8217;re talking about besides your own stuff. Any of the projects that you&#8217;re very bullish on, any of the projects that are building some really cool applications that you see where you&#8217;re like, wow, these guys are doing it right. We should take an eye on them. Who do you want to shout out before we end the show here?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
Yeah, there&#8217;s two. There&#8217;s 6551 talking about accounts. Definitely see that 6551 and ERC-5169 both work really well together. So that&#8217;s a really cool combo. So like if you want to go look at that, look at OpenSea. So if you go look at the Cool Cats on OpenSea, they&#8217;re enabled by Token Script. You can actually click on the image inside of OpenSea, and then you can open the application right there inside of OpenSea and experience the experience. It&#8217;s more than just an image. So like that&#8217;s one of the big powerful things is go to a marketplace, and then imagine what you&#8217;re going to get. You have to imagine. Now with Token Script, you have the ability to literally in xNFTs see that experience directly inside. It&#8217;s not just a static image. It actually opens up and shows you the application that you&#8217;re going to be experiencing and buying. So that&#8217;s super cool. I think the other is we&#8217;ve integrated with a wallet called Joy ID, which is a passkey wallet. So the combination is super powerful. Right? So if you go and get a passkey wallet, you get it within 10 seconds, we can then pass you one of these Smart Cats and you can play in the game. So you then have a wallet within 10 seconds. You get the NFT and then you&#8217;re playing within 20 seconds. It&#8217;s super powerful in terms of frictionless experiences. Of all we can see the future of Web3 being.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I love that. And what about you guys? You got to plug yourself before we end here. What stuff do you have popping off in 2024? Again, by the time this episode airs, it will be most likely the last week of 2023. Finished year off strong with Mathew and the Smart Token Labs team. What is Smart Token Labs launching in 2024? I mean, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s tons of stuff. What can you tell me that you guys are launching in 2024? What do we have to look forward to?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
Yes, so the biggest thing is Smart Layer Network is we&#8217;ll be releasing the network, which is essentially the hosting of Token Script, right? So if we think about xNFTs, you&#8217;re going to be hosting files. And so we have the ability to then have a decentralized service network to host those files to allow xNFTs to scale. And so it&#8217;s really this token centric architecture. And we also have some really big news that just check out our Twitter by this time. And I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be announcing this news sometime soon. So follow along, but it should be something really big happening in Q1 of 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I love that. Mathew, you were an incredible man. Really pumped to meet you. Love your energy. Just you&#8217;re the Mayor of Good Vibes Town. So love to see that. And you definitely know what you&#8217;re talking about. And would truly love to have you on for round two until then wishing you and the team all the best. Before you go, please let us know where our listeners can find. You, Smart Token Labs, and of course, the one and only Smart Cat. And is it Smart Cat, Smart Cat Game, the Smart Cat game? What&#8217;s the branding on that, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>Mathew</strong> <strong>Sweezey</strong><br />
Just Smart Cats.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Smart cats.</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Sweezey </strong><br />
Yeah, so I&#8217;m @msweezey on Twitter. We are @SmartLayer on Twitter. If you wanna check out and get a pass and experience some of our technology firsthand and start to join our community and start to earn points, you can go to smartlayer.network. And you can learn a little bit more about the technology and join the community. As well as if you wanna pick up a Smart Cat, you can do that on OpenSea. And if you wanna experience the Smart Cat inside of a wallet, I suggest getting a Joy ID wallet and then putting your Smart Cat in there and playing directly inside the wallet. So there&#8217;s a couple of things you can do.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Mathew, incredible episode. Thank you so much for coming on, wishing you and the team an incredible new year and can&#8217;t wait for round two. Folks, what&#8217;s an episode with Mathew Sweezey, Chief Strategy Officer at the one and only Smart Token Labs. Also the creators of Smart Cat game. Go check them out. Tons of incredible stuff popping off. We talked about everything, ERC-5169 related, dynamic executable NFTs, future-proofing Smart Cats. We covered it. Huge shout out to Mathew and the team for making this happen. If you guys enjoyed this one and I hope you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to the team and I. Speaking of my team, love you guys. Thank you so much for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor. You are the GOAT. And back to the listeners. Love you guys, keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.</p>

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, still coming in hot from Mexico. By the time this episode airs, it will be Boxing Day. Wanna wish you all a Merry Christmas and hope you had a lovely time with your family. Super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show today. We have Arjun Bhuptani, the Co-Founder of Connext. This is a lad who truly understands the value of a truly universal interoperability protocol for the Web3 industry. He is a pioneer in the space and was previously a Lead Developer in scaling infrastructure for Ethereum, ever heard of it, and Co-Creator of the Moloch DAO, one of the earliest decentralized Autonomous Organization frameworks developed back in 2018. He&#8217;s coming in hot from Lisbon, what a treat as well. Super pumped to have you. Arjun, how are you my friend? Great to have you on.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
Doing well. Thank you so much for having me. Excited to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Super pumped to have you. We got to go back to the ETH days. Working on ETH, that must have been absolutely incredible. Before the show started, you and I were shooting a shift for a bit. You mentioned that you were close to Canada where ETH sort of all went down in Toronto and Waterloo, Vitalik and all the other lads and lasses who developed ETH there. Is crazy how it was right in my backyard. And really when it was being built, like I don&#8217;t ever remember hearing anything about this, not until I even really got into crypto end of 2019, 2020. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re like, holy shit, ETH was built in my backyard, which is sort of cool. Story for another day. You are the star of the show here. Give us some good stories from your time building, ETH. What was it like working with Vitalik? What was it like working with the rest of the team? Did you work on anything in particular that was super cool on ETH? Give us some good stories and then we&#8217;ll jump into Connext and everything else we have on the docket for today.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
Yeah. So to clarify, I didn&#8217;t actually work on Ethereum itself. I built a bunch of infrastructure on top of Ethereum, starting in, I guess, 2016. And that said, I think everything in that time was quite early and the community was quite small. And so it was a little bit nebulous as to who was actually working on the core protocol and who wasn&#8217;t. And I think a lot of people were just contributing in a bunch of different ways, which is really awesome. I did build a bunch of early infrastructure, helped build a bunch of early infrastructure, and also just sort of was around a lot in the early days, amongst the developer ecosystem. So I started the San Francisco Ethereum Developers Meetup with a bunch of other people. And I believe that ended up becoming one of the largest Ethereum Meetups, and really it was like this, the starting point for a bunch of projects that then launched out of there. So I think the early, a lot of the 2017 ICO era kind of came out of that specific meetup, which is really cool. Some of the early infrastructure I worked on back in 2016, I was working with a couple of people trying to abstract away gas and the complexity of dealing with gas. And we were trying to find good ways to make it so that you could hook up a card or hook up payment in some other asset. And then that way as a developer, you didn&#8217;t need to have to actually get your users to pay gas for every transaction. It was awesome because this was obviously even then was such a huge problem. And now today we&#8217;re still talking about things like account abstraction. And so it&#8217;s cool that there was a really relevant problem. It&#8217;s slightly less cool that now almost, I guess, eight years later, we&#8217;re still working on it. I think other cool stories from that time, people always talk about how crypto is the Wild West, but it was truly the Wild West at this time. Even the infrastructure itself was kind of ludicrous. I think a lot of people forget how extraordinarily unstable Ethereum was in the ICO era, because the whole chain was just being taken down by coin launches every week. It was just kind of funny to watch how everybody was just sort of panicking all the time. Every time there was an ICO, projects that were trying to build businesses on top of the chain would have to tell their users, oh, by the way, we&#8217;re just not going to be available for the next six hours. I&#8217;m sorry, we can&#8217;t do anything about it. It was pretty funny. I like the thing that we&#8217;ve come a long way since then. Things might get really expensive now, but at the very least, it&#8217;s a bit of a smoother curve where you&#8217;re not just like, oh, wow, I can&#8217;t get any transactions to the chain for hours and hours on it. So we started Connexts in 2017 at the time. And I think this is still the thesis. The thesis was just, I really believe in the technology a lot. I think Ethereum represents the best hope that humanity has to be able to build ways to coordinate with each other at a scale that is completely unprecedented. And I think a lot of the problems that we face today are fundamentally at their core, just coordination failures. We failed to effectively capture the longer term financial risks of things like global warming. And as a result of that, the incentives today to hedge against those longer term financial risks don&#8217;t exist. And as a result of that, we&#8217;re in this broken economic system where we failed to coordinate and continue to deplete resources today at the expense of tomorrow. And run similar mental arguments around things like income inequality, access to food, really just about every problem that we face to scale in the world right now. And Ethereum, and this is really the reason that I became really interested in this space, Ethereum really feels like not the solution to it, but basically how you could build the solution. It&#8217;s a platform on top of which you could build these new public goods, it&#8217;s like a new market category of things that is not corporations, it&#8217;s not governments, it&#8217;s now this other thing that looks more like the internet, right? A global public good that is just truly neutral, is non sovereign, is non corporate, exists everywhere. And we&#8217;ve all seen the enormous benefit that the internet has had for the world. I mean, obviously there&#8217;s a lot of bad things that have happened as a result of it, but I think everyone would say that it&#8217;s really pushed him. So our thesis back then and still now is, how can we figure out how to make this technology actually usable? And as it turns out, that was quite difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Still working on it.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
Exactly. So 2017 when we started, we kind of initially started with some hypotheses around things like user onboarding with cards and things like that. And we started on like talking to users and working with a bunch of projects at the time. You know, a lot of projects were focused on just like just recently raised money in their ICOs. And what we learned time and time again was that even though we, you know, a lot of these projects were saying, okay, yeah, we need a way to like onboard users to be able to purchase our token or to be able to use like stable coins in our system. What we found time and time again was that when push came to shove, they really all had one core problem, which was just that their applications were just way too expensive to use because the Ethereum wasn&#8217;t scalable. And this is when we kind of realized, okay, there&#8217;s this Ethereum scalability problem. Initially, we didn&#8217;t realize how big of a problem it was. So we started to, you know, we kind of knew that people had been talking about it. So we were like, okay, we&#8217;ll just build a scalability solution and then upsell them on a card payment API. Obviously terrible idea. We got about like a few weeks into that before realizing, oh, actually the scalability thing is like, you know, a much bigger, much more interesting problem than like card payments. And that was when we kind of made a full pivot. And Connexts became one of the first organizations that was working in the space building scalability systems on top of Ethereum. We, at the time, I think it was like just a handful of orgs. Raiden was the one that was like most well known because they just done their ICO. And of course, everybody was making correlators to like the Lightning Network there. And then there was us, we were very small fish, not a ton of people knew about us at the time atleast. And then there was a few others. So there was things like xDAI, which is a side chain. And then a few people trying to like build plasma systems. So Matic, which of course became Polygon. Loom, which unfortunately shut down, but one of the one of the co-founders, George is pretty well known in the space now. It works a Paradigm. And then a few other kind of teams that were like us, like just sort of longer tail looking to research these things. We started working, again, it truly was the Wild West. And we started trying to find users wherever we could get them. The main project that we found that actually had traction at the time was Spankchain, an adult payment network, really the only people doing any consistent marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
You said Spankchain? Come on. Sorry, keep going there.</p>
<p>Arjun Bhuptani<br />
Yeah, 2018 era, Ethereum, there was, I guess like, I sorry, 2017 era Ethereum, there was really nothing, nobody with any, any, any traction. And Spankchain was doing like, I think it was like 20K to 30K monthly volume. And that was like one of the most huge applications that we&#8217;d found at the time. And so we partnered really closely with them. They were actually had their own in house scaling team, research team. We like worked really closely with them and together with them built the first kind of real like L-2 on top of Ethereum, like the first general purpose L-2 that could be used by any project. And this was in 2018. Now, largely at the time we were focused around payments, payments as a vertical just didn&#8217;t really take off as much as we expected for Spankchain or really for anybody. I think it was just, it was like one of those really interesting red herrings where everyone was convinced that payments was going to be the thing that got PMF first, but it ended up being DeFi. And even to this day, payments is still like happening now, but it&#8217;s still like in the earliest days. So we kind of saw that there was this like shift in the market towards DeFi. And we also saw that there was a, the research was going in the direction of rollups. And we had been working on a different type of technology called state channels. And a lot of our really awesome, smart, talented friends, folks like Plasma group, like formerly OmiseGo people that then spun out and became Optimism, or like the off chain labs team that then went on to develop Arbitrum. We just realized that there was all these really awesome people that were working on rollup frameworks. And we were like, okay, maybe it&#8217;s better for us to focus on actually solving some of the more critical problems in rollups than to like double down on this other scalability technology, which is not really as interesting right now. And in the process of asking that question, we realized all of those projects had a single shared problem, which was how do you get into and out of their ecosystems? And how do you even get between their ecosystems? Everyone was gunning to be like the Ethereum L-2. And it was very unclear whether, like that, it was very clear that that wasn&#8217;t really going to happen, right? There was just too many people that are too interested in that problem. And so we in 2020 ended up building the first bridge. We built the first kind of like system to transfer tokens non custodially between rollups on Testnet and then took it to Mainnet in 2021. And that was really like the entry point to kind of get into getting into this like whole interoperability world. Now the interesting thing about interop and I think a lot of people don&#8217;t really realize this is that like bridging and scalability are actually the same problem fundamentally. A rollup is actually just a construction for how you can bridge to another chain, where if you make some like you basically make some compromises on how you define another chain as a chain. And instead of defining it as a chain, you define it as a sort of like sub chain of something else. If you do that, then you can make it trustless to a bridge to and from that chain. This was kind of like the big realization that led us to developing rollups. And so for us, making the jump from like, hey, we&#8217;re thinking about this technology related to scaling to like now we&#8217;re working on interop was actually just we didn&#8217;t even need to change our code. We actually just took the exact same code and reused it elsewhere, which is pretty interesting. It&#8217;s kind of interesting to see that the spaces has of course progressed a lot. A lot has been built and it&#8217;s grown so much over the course of the last, I would say almost decade now, but a lot of the problems, a lot of the core questions are almost exactly the same. It&#8217;s the same things we were asking each other back in 2017,2018 that are the things that people are asking today.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Yeah, exactly. That was a great little spiel there. What a way to kick off the pod. I think we have to go back to sort of first base here, which is Ethereum scalability problem. This is something even the team are working on. Is there like one specific issue? Do you think it is interoperability? Like you mentioned payments, but now you also mentioned that payments isn&#8217;t as big of an issue as we think as many teams started to work on it and then said, shit, there&#8217;s bigger fish to fry. We&#8217;re going to go somewhere else. Like again, I know you and the team are working on it. So I&#8217;m asking you a bit of a cop out question, but like what is Ethereum&#8217;s biggest scalability problem right now? And like what is the sort of most front of mind solution to that problem?</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
For sure. I guess, define what the scalability problem is, because I think you&#8217;re right, it did jump the gun a little bit there. We all know blockchains don&#8217;t scale at this point. It&#8217;s something that ends up getting talked about a lot, and it manifests itself in a bunch of different ways for users, right? So for users, blockchains not scaling means like really high gas costs, really high low transaction times, things like that. The process of simply making costs cheaper is not actually very difficult. You can increase block sizes, you can basically increase the requirements needed for people to run the chain, and run a chain on a supercomputer, and all of a sudden the whole chain is operating faster. The thing with blockchains is that the way that they&#8217;re designed is that there&#8217;s like a minimum threshold of infrastructure requirements needed to run a node, and like the whole chain runs as fast as this lowest node, really. And so if you&#8217;re willing to make compromises on what is going to go into a node, and you&#8217;re willing to kind of run those nodes on like AWS clusters or on a supercomputer, then your chain can be extremely fast and extremely cheap. The challenge is of course that then it&#8217;s not decentralized, and this is the big trade-off space that people are trying to explore. It&#8217;s like, okay, how do we come up with a system where you can have people running any kind of application they want, they can be cheap and fast, and on top of that, it can still be validated by people at home, right? You don&#8217;t necessarily need it to only be in the hands of a few small corporations or like Amazon, basically.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
100%. One quick point, if I may, would you say that sort of just as a sexy one line framework would the problem, could it be distilled to like speed versus decentralization? Is that like one of the main sort of questions that&#8217;s being asked?</p>
<p>Arjun Bhuptani<br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s this thing that Vitalik had posted a while back called the scalability trial and effectively it&#8217;s just that. It&#8217;s like speed versus decentralization.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Okay, sorry to interrupt there. Keep going. You&#8217;re on a roll. All you.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
So the question then comes like, okay, well, if you&#8217;re not willing to make compromises on one or the other, how can we get to some other option? Initially back in 2017, 2018, the thought process was like, well, why don&#8217;t we try to build more tailored things on top of? So why don&#8217;t we batch up a bunch of transactions off chain and post only those batches on chain and have that batching system be more tailored, more application specific? So this was the reason for our payments focused L-2, was we were like, instead of making one payment every minute on off chain or on chain, why don&#8217;t we just make one payment every 10 minutes and then have a coordination game off chain where you can be sure that every individual payment is not getting lost. That&#8217;s not particularly challenging to do, but the problem that we inevitably ran into was just like, you want to create this very general compute system. So ideally, the scalability system should also be more general. And I think that this is kind of the direction that the whole space started to go was like, well, why don&#8217;t we instead of trying to really specialize on creating this payment-specific scalability system that people have to do a custom integration into, everybody at the time was just like, I just want to build contracts. I don&#8217;t have to go and do a bunch of extra work. So that created this whole EVM compatible narrative of let&#8217;s find ways to build EVM compatible scalability system. So let&#8217;s literally just have something that looks like a chain just way faster. And that way people don&#8217;t ever really need to know that they&#8217;re not operating on chain. They&#8217;re just, like it&#8217;s just effectively the same developer experience. And rollups is kind of how we accomplish that. And so the rollup thesis is actually very, it&#8217;s similar. You are taking a bunch of transactions, batching them up off chain and then putting them, putting only like one batch on chain. But it&#8217;s different in the sense of like, instead of running something that&#8217;s like very specific to do that, atleast in the past, now, of course, the narrative is changing. So people are creating like application specific rollups and like rollups and whatever languages and things like that. These things just always go in loops. But at the time, the thinking was like, okay, well, what we can do is just split up Ethereum&#8217;s execution, like the things that people are doing on chain and run a bunch of those things in parallel to each other and have them only posted to Ethereum every now and then. And by doing that, you can have node operators validating one part of the execution without having to validate all of it. And that means now you improve scalability, because you&#8217;re effectively like parallel processing things on chain, right? Not everybody doesn&#8217;t need to process every transaction anymore. You can process a some subset of transactions and still have the same security, which is awesome. That is really the core scalability thesis is just like make it so that there is more optionality around what transactions are being processed by nodes. So how do, why is it hard? Now, of course, I think in general, one of the answers to that question is that building any kind of distributed system technology in general is really difficult. It&#8217;s insane. And it just, it always takes so much longer than you&#8217;d expect. Like I remember I had gotten into a disagreement at a conference once with Dan Robinson about this, where he and I were like kind of talking about like, well, does it make more sense to have like something that&#8217;s application specific, like what we were doing where that is hyper optimized and can do like 10,000, 100,000X scalability out of the box? Or is it doesn&#8217;t make more sense to like do a rollup, which at the time was just giving like a 10X scalability improvement and then iterate on it in the future. And his, and you know, for what it&#8217;s worth, I do agree that the latter now that the latter is actually a better option, but for different reasons. And his argument was like, well, we should do the rollup because optimistic rollups, like they&#8217;re really simple constructions. We can ship an optimistic rollup and have it be like with fraud proofs and everything within like a few months. Like we, like it&#8217;s a, the timeline is months, not many years. And this was like, I think this was 2019 or 2020, start of 2020. So obviously like, despite the fact that it, you know, optimistics or ellipse, they&#8217;re supposed to be like a relatively simple construction that, you know, were, was something that people really thought was going to be like the stepping stone to get to something else. It&#8217;s still now years later, you know, we&#8217;re still working on fraud proofs. We&#8217;re still working on like answering some of these like basic infrastructure questions. If I&#8217;m being totally honest, I think Ethereum has solved scalability. Like I think the question of like, can you do fast and cheap transactions is now answered, right? You can just go to Arbitrum or Optimism or Polygon as you can think and do very fast and very cheap transactions. I think the, the secondary question though now is like, how do you do that in a way where users are not having to think about going to Optimism or Arbitrum.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
There&#8217;s so much friction. Arjun, I did a transaction literally last week. I opened up MetaMask. It was 49 bucks. I was like, are you effing kidding me right now? Boom, like, you know what I mean? Like, again, I always use the example of my parents or even someone perhaps a little bit older than us who isn&#8217;t as crypto centric and tech savvy as we are. I mean, you and I are, it&#8217;s a complete diss to you to put us in the same boat. So my apologies for that, but you get the point here. It&#8217;s like, it just can&#8217;t happen, candidly. Like, there needs to be, it needs to be as simple as sending a transaction on MetaMask in a Chrome extension, couple clicks, but it can&#8217;t be $49 to send a three, four figure value. You know what I mean? Like, what&#8217;s the solution for this right now? Like, what is the easiest way to use ARB or something else, you know, or OP to like actually make it happen?</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s still not solved, right? Like the way that the last market, so this became a problem in the last bull market when we suddenly had this like big expansion of chains all of a sudden. And why did we have the big expansion of chains? Because Ethereum just became way too expensive to use. And we were onboarding all of these users coming in from Southeast Asia and like India and like, you know, like Korea and other places where like a $150 bridge transaction was just not going to make any sense ever. And what we saw, and this is actually where Connext&#8217;s got a lot of early traction was that we just saw everybody was playing the like ETH Floor Lava game. Nobody wanted to touch Ethereum. Everyone is like onboarding directly into like Binance chain because that was really the main chain that had a centralized exchange integration that was not Ethereum. And we saw like everybody, like we could kind of see this in our own like stats and analytics. Like everybody was basically onboarding to Binance chain and then going from there to go farm tokens on like on every other chain. And then once they were done farming, going back to Binance chain to catch out and no one was touching Ethereum if they could help it. And so that was like, that was kind of like the first step which is like, let&#8217;s solve the like the absolutely awful cost pain point by just not ever onboarding to Ethereum ever. But then the second step of that is like, well, there was still this really awful experience where despite all of this, like, you know, users were because we were in this bull market because you know, everybody was incentive mining. Like if you&#8217;re paying users a ton of potentially, you know if thousands of dollars, they&#8217;re going to claw over each other to get to your product. Like they will figure it out. But like in practice, that&#8217;s not, that&#8217;s not in any way sustainable, right? So what we found when talking to these users was like, they were extraordinarily confused. You know, they had already gone to the extremely painful process of learning how to like download, MetaMask and set up a wallet and manage wallet recovery and like then get gas fees and like basically onboard to Binance chain and have like their wallet set up. And now you were telling them, hey, okay, so now by the way, there&#8217;s not just one chain. There&#8217;s many different chains. The application you&#8217;re on could be on any one of these chains. And if you go to the application UI, it&#8217;s not going to tell you how to get to the app. You can&#8217;t just use it. You have to figure out what chain it&#8217;s on. You have to figure out, find a bridge that works with that chain and has liquidity on it. You have to go bridge your funds. Then you have to figure out how to get gas for the new chain. And then you have to go and use, and then you go and use the app. And so that&#8217;s obviously, absolutely. I mean, it&#8217;s just crazy to expect a user to do that. And so that&#8217;s really fundamentally the problem that we kind of set out to fix. It&#8217;s like, we were like, okay, ideally what should happen is that it should just be like when you use YouTube today. You know, when you use YouTube, you just look up videos of cats and you just get videos of cats and you watch the videos of cats and that&#8217;s it. But there&#8217;s not anything else. You don&#8217;t need to know that like, when you&#8217;re actually searching for videos of cats, Google is like searching through their extremely complex distributed data system like behind the scenes. Like you don&#8217;t need to know that where that specific video is like backed up in their server cluster and how to get there. That&#8217;s insane, right? That&#8217;s like not, like we moved past this point of the internet in the 1980s. And it&#8217;s really good that we did because like if we hadn&#8217;t, we would have never, nobody would have ever used it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
You just brought up a great point there. And this is something that I&#8217;ve thought about many times. Even again, the other day I&#8217;ll use an example, sending a transaction a couple of weeks ago, opened up a new wallet for Reason XYZ. Heck, I forget what it was. This happens so often. And there&#8217;s no ETH in the wallet. So I can&#8217;t send the next transaction because I&#8217;m just sending Tether over. Even though I have Tether on ERC, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I still need ETH. Using your analogy about YouTube, I&#8217;m a YouTube premium guy. For all the listeners at home, I think, and my apologies, might lose some subs here. You&#8217;re bonkers if you don&#8217;t know YouTube premium. Ads are the worst. It&#8217;s like the easiest, you know, for me, Canadian like 14 bucks a month, probably the best subscription I own, like dead ass. Anyways, what would be the equivalent if having gas in your wallet is the equivalent of having YouTube premium? What would be the equivalent of just having a regular YouTube where you can still fulfill and execute transactions, but you don&#8217;t have gas in your wallet? Is there a way that we can like have ads in wallets? Like what the heck can we do so people don&#8217;t have to get through this, having initial gas problem? Because that&#8217;s something that I think is absolutely fucked with a capital F and something that needs to be fixed pronto.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
For sure. Yeah. I think the real solution to that is like, is like account abstraction. Really, the thing that the problem that you&#8217;re talking about here is exactly the problem that we were trying to fix in like 2016. Unfortunately, the infrastructure just didn&#8217;t exist to fix it. And it&#8217;s exactly what you were saying. We were basically like, well, this is kind of awful. Like, so either developers should be able to hook up their cards to pay for gas for users or users should be able to just hook up their cards. And then, and then like, you should just be able to add your credit card to better MetaMask and then like go into a bunch of things on chain. And then like later, once you&#8217;re done doing things on chain, like once a month, it just like it just debits you. That actually, people are now building that experience. Like that actually is starting to exist now, which is kind of cool. I think it&#8217;ll be some time before it becomes like really well adopted. Because of course, there&#8217;s there&#8217;s just sort of adoption hurdles associated with accounts. So what? Okay. Let&#8217;s take a step back. So what is account abstraction? You&#8217;ll hear a lot of abstraction related terms. And I think it&#8217;s important because abstraction basically means getting rid of the need for the user to have to think about XYZ. So account abstraction is getting rid of the user need for the user to actually have to deal with the account, like the wallet that you&#8217;re using. So the wallet that you&#8217;re using most of the time is just like the end address, the end account. And the accounts are great and that they&#8217;re really simple. Like it&#8217;s just an address. So you can write down like some words on a piece of paper and that actually represents your account. Like you have everything you need. But they&#8217;re also not great because if you lose that piece of paper, you&#8217;ve lost the account and you&#8217;ve also lost all of your money. And similarly, because the account itself is is an end address, the only way to actually do things from it is for you to submit transactions chain and pay gas. And that&#8217;s really like one of the big hurdles here is like having to deal with gas payments. So account abstraction removes a lot of that. It just moves to you move to a new model where you have a smart account, which is a contract and not not just like an end address. That smart account can be associated with many different addresses. So you can do things like have recovery. And the other thing that you can do is you can one of those addresses could be a relayer or like, you know, in I think account abstraction later account abstraction turns is called a pay master. And basically is the service writer that just when you sign transactions and you send them to to the service writer and you just tell them, hey, I&#8217;m gonna like pay you at the end of the month using my credit card. I&#8217;m gonna pay you using some other asset. And they do it on your behalf. And that I think is just a way better experience is starting to happen. It will happen as like more and more of the wallets start to like adopt a contract, basically smart contract, while smart accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I just, I don&#8217;t know how much money&#8217;s in that, you know? Cause like, I feel like maybe I&#8217;m completely wrong there, but I don&#8217;t know if the user would sign up if the fee would be over, call it 3%. I also feel like with 20% traditional credit card interest, like I feel like that&#8217;d be too spooky on crypto, especially if like that bill gets racked up quick and things go the other way. And then you&#8217;re like no longer just minus 20 or minus 120 in the whole. That&#8217;s my, and again, I thought about this, maybe I&#8217;m way off, but you may be in an obstacle.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
To be honest t may actually be cheaper. And the reason is that as a user, when you&#8217;re sending your transaction, you&#8217;re basically individually sending one transaction at a time to chain. You&#8217;re probably overpaying for those transactions because you just want it to go and get mine, right? You&#8217;re not optimizing on the process of like, I&#8217;m going to like monitor exactly how this transaction is happening and submit it most efficiently as possible. Whereas if you are a service provider whose job it is to process millions of transactions a day, there&#8217;s a bunch of things that you can do. You can, for example, like batch those transactions and send them to chain in like lumps. You can work directly with block builders on chain. And so then that way you&#8217;re submitting the transactions directly to them, like going around the mempool. So that can get rid of front running, for example. There&#8217;s like a bunch of other constructions that people have talked about. So like there&#8217;s folks that are creating like block space derivatives. So you can basically like purchase space in blocks at times when gas is cheaper and then like hold it for times when gas is more expensive. And then use it then to like decrease your gas costs. It&#8217;s like the moment that you turn it into this like competitive thing where now there&#8217;s like a bunch of service riders that are competing with each other to like give the best possible experience or how you submit your transactions, all of a sudden the transaction experience just gets a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I love that. Arjun, you have been absolutely on fire. We have to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to the sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to get into a bit of a spicy topic. And that is the SOL vs. ETH narrative. I&#8217;ve had a couple SOL Maxis on this show over the last couple of weeks. One, I&#8217;m sure you follow him on Twitter, Ansem, BLKNoiz, had him on the pod. He is the king of the Solana right now. This guy is literally deriving the SOL Train. You are an ETH guy. We got to get into debate mode. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends, and sponsors of the cryptonews.com podcast. We love these guys as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. PrimeXBT is also running an exclusive promotion for listeners of the Cryptonews Podcast. The promo code is CRYPTONEWS50 to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Again, that is <strong>CRYPTONEWS50</strong> to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And now back to the show. Let&#8217;s get right into it. SOL vs. ETH. Everyone has been shitting on ETH recently. And I mean everyone. Your Twitter guy, you know it too. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s deserved personally. Obviously, the reason why ETH is getting shot on is because SOL went from what, like, $9 to $60 in three months. When a lot of people get rich, they&#8217;re going to wear that ticker with pride. That&#8217;s just how it works. What&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s favorite thing about crypto? It&#8217;s easy money, right? It&#8217;s also very easy to get rinsed, but it&#8217;s also the easiest money. This is why, in my opinion, so many people are on the SOL train right now. You have Bonk, you have dog with a hat, you have just absolute shit coins that have no utility that have made people millions and millions of dollars. And everyone&#8217;s on the train. Enough talking on my end. Give us the lowdown. What is good with the SOL vs. ETH narrative? Do the SOL train people? Have any warrant? Do they have any actual sauce in their arguments? Or we can all see this come crashing down very shortly.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s a good question. I want to say in general, it&#8217;s really funny to see. There is like a, it&#8217;s like once you&#8217;re in the space for long enough, you see that there is literally a cycle, right? Like people will shit on ETH and then things will happen and they will shit on something else. And it just comes back around. It&#8217;s just really funny. And it&#8217;s just a testament to where we are in the market cycle that that&#8217;s happening. I have never been as hostile towards Solana, I think, as a lot of other ETH people. And to be honest, I don&#8217;t think anybody that&#8217;s a really serious, like anybody that&#8217;s like deeply involved in technical research is necessarily hostile towards it. I think everybody understands that all of this stuff has a lot of tradeoffs. And so like Ethereum&#8217;s thesis is basically like, let&#8217;s build the future of the internet, right? And like, let&#8217;s build this global platform for creating decentralized public goods that is intended to be truly unsensable and is intended to be truly incorruptible. And a core part of Ethereum&#8217;s success criteria is if World War III happens, and I&#8217;ve literally heard Vitalik say this, by the way, like it&#8217;s like the whole big part of the goal and the design is like, if and when World War III happens, ETH will survive it. It will survive it because there will be enough people, like ETH and Bitcoin will survive World War III because there will be enough people at home running ETH nodes that like you would need to like, there&#8217;s enough failover, there&#8217;s enough backup happening. And that&#8217;s kind of the goal, right? It&#8217;s like, you want to allow enough people individually at home to be able to like validate this thing, that if you go and blow up a bunch of data centers around the world, you know, you&#8217;re not going to get rid of the chain. The Solana thesis is slightly different. Solana&#8217;s thesis is making, is basically making that on two things. One, that there are intrinsically a bunch of use cases for blockchains that are not necessarily going to be like, let&#8217;s make this thing as resilient as possible, right? There&#8217;s like a bunch of use cases for, you know, distributed systems that achieve consensus out there today, and ones that have like an economic mechanism within it that are very performant or obviously very highly desirable. There&#8217;s a lot of places where this has come up in the past, even before crypto existed, like gaming for instance, where like, people have been trying to build like, infrastructure for gaming that solves a lot of the same problems that blockchains are trying to solve today. And they&#8217;ve been trying to do that for decades. So Solana&#8217;s first bet is that there are intrinsically valuable applications of blockchains that are not necessarily going to be the applications that require you to have like, World War III grade resilience. And then, and then bet number two is the pace at which computing is improving is going to be faster, is going to be fast enough that by the time, you know, we get to the point where we figured out a lot of these like scalability questions at some point in the future, computing will have caught up and we will at home be able to be running infrastructure that is so much more performant that we can then validate Solana nodes more easily in like, basically like the pace of the improvements in computing is going to bring down the threshold at which you can start validating this stuff more easily as an individual rather than honestly per computer. I don&#8217;t think either of those DCs are flawed. I think they&#8217;re totally valid. I think that Solana is basically just taking another end of that trade-off spectrum where they&#8217;re saying, OK, you know what? We&#8217;re willing to sacrifice some decentralization to get performance. And in doing that, we&#8217;re not having to deal with the complexity of a scalability roadmap. We&#8217;re not having to deal with the fragmentation of many different chains. And I think all of that is really valid and very true. The limitation here is that we, of course, don&#8217;t yet know what use cases fall into category one. So we live in a time today where we&#8217;re basically in crypto summertime. There&#8217;s a couple of nation states that are attempting to attack projects building on Ethereum. And it&#8217;s like North Korea basically trying to hack people. Not trying to, very successfully hacking a lot of projects. I think there&#8217;s a tailor from my crypto did the analysis, I think. And I saw her post a tweet where she found that on average, Lazarus, which is like the North Korean hacking group, had stolen $2 million per day last year from each project. Which is insane. Two per day. Absolutely insane. So I think there is something to be said about, yeah, OK, we need to be conscious of the fact that rogue nation states can and will attempt to attack these chains. But aside from that, we&#8217;re still in a summertime situation where major governments have not actively banned crypto. Most governments are still willing to entertain the conversations around it. Their regulators are very interested in talking about it. Like people are, there&#8217;s pushback. And of course, there&#8217;s hostility coming from certain types of organizations. And there&#8217;s a lot of confusion and lack of clarity. But we&#8217;re not in a situation where people have actually initiated a war on crypto. In the 1980s, 1990s, there was actually a war on crypto. And like that, there was very explicit attempts to find ways to shut down anything related to the technology that we&#8217;re working on at the time of the Zaran cryptography. But right now, we&#8217;re not in that situation. And so to that extent, I think Solana is right in that like going for gold with like making this the most decentralized system possible is probably anti-productive to like focusing on adoption. But the flip side of it is that it&#8217;s really hard to put it back in the box once you&#8217;ve already done it. So like if Solana goes and does get a ton of adoption and then at some point in the future, World War III happens, they&#8217;re just going to be in a like not as good of a position.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Well, I mean, isn&#8217;t the position literally just like turn off the light switch? Like wouldn&#8217;t it be pretty easy to turn off SOL? Would not?</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
I think so. It&#8217;s basically the way that Solana stands right now, I think it would basically be like blowing up AWS center, server stacks and things like that. As long as you got rid of some of the key infrastructure that is powering Solana, it would be easier to take down than something like Ethereum, which is running validators all over the world. Again, this is a little bit of a horseshoes and hand grenades conversation because of course we&#8217;re going to take away here is it ultimately comes down to what you believe the value of this infrastructure is and what do you believe the threat model is. From an adoption perspective, it is absolutely valid to take the position that you&#8217;re like, no, you know what, this technology is really important and we need to get it into as many people&#8217;s hands as fast as possible and we need to just onboard them into the space. Let&#8217;s just make the compromises now and hope that the technology catches up to the point where it can become democratized in the future. Whereas there&#8217;s another argument that also to be made, which is just that like for all of these kinds of systems, power corrupts and so like doing it right from the get go, focusing more on decentralization, focusing more on like making sure that this is out of the gala tair and as possible, even if it comes to the cost of adoption, while it means moving slower, will ensure more resilience in the future and resilience is fundamentally the thing that determines what will survive longer term.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
I love that. Arjun, you&#8217;ve been on fire, as I&#8217;ve said many times, this pod&#8217;s been a treat. This is definitely one that I will have to listen to on a nice walk as well. Just very refreshing. We do have a couple more questions and we got to wrap up. We are getting tight for time. 2024 outlook, give us a couple hot takes preferably. If you don&#8217;t have hot takes, just regular good old Luke Warm takes will do as well. Anything ETH related, anything sort of macro narrative related. Again, the hotter the better. I&#8217;d love some stuff that not everyone is saying. If you have any of that, lock and loaded that will be a treat.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, I think there&#8217;s a bunch of tech trends. I think bridging is going to get quite interesting. So I&#8217;m seeing, we&#8217;re sort of seeing that there was just way too many projects that were kind of funded to try to solve this problem in the last couple of years. Way too many. Like 50 to 100 that&#8217;s insane.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Five mil for you. And it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s your bridges shit. I&#8217;m being rude. I&#8217;m not working on bridges, but like, come on. Yeah, it&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
And it makes sense. It&#8217;s a huge problem. It&#8217;s all going to be chains and bridges. There&#8217;s not going to be anything else. That is the inner chain. It&#8217;s at least as valuable as all of the chains combined, at least. And I think people are really underestimating that. But the flip side of it is that, again, similar to chains, just having copy paste chains is not going to make a difference. It&#8217;s not fundamentally doing anything new. The thing that really changes what is valuable is going to be specializing. And so I think with what we&#8217;ve been seeing with the modular narrative for chains and people specializing into becoming rollups or DA layers or sediment layers, we&#8217;re starting to see the same thing with bridging as well, where projects are going to start specializing into transport layers, security layers, or intense slash execution layers. Connext is focusing on ladder, and we&#8217;ve always focused on ladder. So we don&#8217;t roll our own security for bridging. We actually plug into the rollup bridges. We plug into other canonical bridges. And what we do is we run a layer on top of everything. It&#8217;s kind of a Layer 2, on top of bridges, where our network just guarantees transactions go through as quickly as possible. We have an off chain network of what we call routers. Now, in the new terminology, we call it intent fillers. And those are the people that make all these transactions happen. I think that pattern is going to become very popular in 2024. So I would say 2024 is going to be the year of modularization of bridging, and then specifically the massive expansion of this intent layer. Because that is really what&#8217;s needed to do what we talked about on this call today, which is like abstract away all of the user experience hurdles and get to the point where this stuff actually makes sense. So that&#8217;s point number one. I think we&#8217;re going to continue seeing the expansion of many more rollups. I think next year we&#8217;re going to start seeing people actually selling rollups to legacy organizations. My hot take here is that I know every VC that I&#8217;ve talked to, or not every VC, but a lot of VCs are very interested in consumer applications because they&#8217;re like, oh, where are the users? Who&#8217;s going to bring the users? And from my perspective, I&#8217;m like, yeah, I think there&#8217;s going to be a few big consumer hits this cycle. But I think the vast majority of the actual usage is not going to come from people building new applications because it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re building a new social app. You have to grow to become the size of Facebook. That&#8217;s going to take like half a decade, at least even in an optimistic case. If you&#8217;re lucky enough to make it. Whereas the flip side of that is like, you know, we know Reddit wants to build, you know, onto on chain. We know that like a lot of these other ecosystems have like made very conscious efforts to try to build on chain constructions they&#8217;ve failed to in the past because they&#8217;ve had to like go and build a bunch of customers. Basically build an entirely new blockchain. Whereas now you can give them a system, a rollup that runs in their server stack that you can actually build like a data model for it that looks exactly almost exactly like their existing databases and you can then connect that. You can have them like connected to the actual rest of the blockchain ecosystem at will. I think that&#8217;s going to be how we like Trojan Horse this stuff into like, like Web2 organizations and that&#8217;s where the users will come from. I mean, new applications obviously important, but I think a lot of it is just going to be like older applications being like, oh, we could just do this one simple thing and then now suddenly have stuff on chain. And then I think lastly, I think we&#8217;re finally at the point now where we&#8217;re really having those hard conversations around user experience. You know, after all of these years, I&#8217;m now finally at the point where I&#8217;m like, this is the year I&#8217;m really hoping that account abstraction takes off. This is the year I really hoping that&#8217;s the case because even I&#8217;m really tired of having to deal with like gas and sites. It&#8217;s awful for everybody, even if you&#8217;re a person in this space.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Absolutely nightmare. I love this. This was an incredible episode. Thank you so much for coming on and definitely an open invite for round 2. We have to have you on for round 2. I mean, I wish we weren&#8217;t tight for time here, but cest la vie. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Connext online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
Awesome. Yeah. You can find me on Twitter at @arjunbhuptani. I guess my name will be in the thing, in case you need help spelling it. And then Connext is Twitter is @ConnextNetwork. I&#8217;d also recommend joining our Discord to discord.gg/connext or checking out our landing page, which is connext.network.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />
Amazing. Arjun, you were absolutely on fire today. Really appreciate you coming on. Can&#8217;t wait for round two and wishing you and the team a wonderful new year. And can&#8217;t wait to see what you guys are cooking up in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun Bhuptani </strong><br />
Thanks so much, Matt. Really appreciate you having me here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab </strong><br />

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always. Still coming in hot from lovely, Mexico, and super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show to take a massively deep dive into everything Web3 gaming related. Today we have George Isichos, a Core Contributor at Game7, recently spearheading Game7&#8217;s all inclusive report on the state of Web3 gaming for 2023. Folks, if you&#8217;ve not read this, you must. It is an absolute treat and a half. It is Alpha City, and George was the creator of this. We will obviously plug this in the show notes, but first we got to continue the intro. Before joining Game7, George was a product strategist for R3, as well as a strategy consultant for PWC, and is now a guru of the Web3 gaming sector. Super pumped to have you on the show, George. Welcome to the show, my friend. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Very good. Thanks for having me Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Pumped to have you on. We&#8217;re praying that the WiFi continues to buzz here. As we all know, I&#8217;m still in Mexico, and over the last couple of weeks, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s been going on, but the WiFi turned from mucho bueno to no bueno, and I&#8217;m hoping that we can keep the WiFi rails on the track here. It&#8217;s been a bit of a grind, but, George, before we get into everything Web3 gaming related, let&#8217;s set the table for myself and the listeners. Let us know and hear a little bit about yourself, your past, your whole gig at PWC, obviously working for eight big four consulting firm, what you did there, and then tell us about your jump and foray into the Web3 gaming sector, and then we&#8217;ll get into Game7, your report and all the fun stuff. But the floor is yours, my friend. Let&#8217;s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Sure. Yeah. So, a few years back, before my crypto times, I guess, I used to work as a consultant for PWC, primarily working with banks, energy institutions. Around five, six years ago, I had the chance to get into the space of blockchain gaming very early. Of course, it was a tremendously different world back then. Different companies, different cool things, different assumptions, different. Yeah, everything was different. But, yeah, this was definitely a very interesting experience for me, starting early, seeing what works, seeing all the things that we were super excited about and never turned out to be the things we expected in the blockchain world. I started in a startup experience with the Web3 gaming space in 2018. Then I had a pass to the more enterprise corporate world trying to help Wall street understand and make use of blockchain use cases in a more controlled, regulated setting, of course. And close to two years back, I had a fantastic opportunity to join Game7 and join this effort to really support the future of Web3 gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I love that. And before we get into the bread and butter of the show, which will be the all inclusive report, give us the laydown on Game7. What exactly did you guys do? You guys are a DAO, if I understand correctly. And you do everything Web3 gaming related, from educating and investing, teaching people about everything. It&#8217;s just a sort of a myriad 360 degree company that does everything Web3 gaming related. But give us the elevator pitch and then we&#8217;ll get into the report and the current state of Web3 gaming and 2024 Web3 gaming trends.</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Absolutely, yes. So, yeah, Game7 is a community comprised of both game developers and gamers that they want to definitely help accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology within gaming. We&#8217;re doing this in a number of ways by incubating projects that we do think they have strategic value to the Web3 gaming stack. We do invest and give grants to a number of projects based on different criteria, of course. And we are also engaging in a number of community led initiatives, including events, including the report you just saw, and any other initiatives that we think they might have value based on the feedback of our community.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>How was Game7 formed? So just a bunch of really high level Web3 gaming gurus and experts who are like, damn, let&#8217;s create a DAO and let&#8217;s pool all our minds, capital resources together to create this 360 degree company that can really help move the needle. Is that sort of how it all went down?</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Yeah, I mean, there are many versions of the story. Of course there are people that started with the idea, okay, there&#8217;s something there. Let&#8217;s try to rally people around this concept of having an inclusive enough environment for virus initiatives to grow with a clear focus support Web3 gaming close to two years ago, then there was a proposal to important companies and ecosystem stakeholders to support this initiative about Game7. And from that point onwards, Game7 has been a very dynamic thing in a sense, because, yes, the ambition is a DAO, and we definitely try to grow in a way that wears different hats. So we have different incubated projects, we do have the investments that we do. We do have community led initiatives. So, yeah, Game7 is, for me, that&#8217;s something I really enjoy. It&#8217;s a unique and very diverse community with a clear focus to support Web3 gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Let&#8217;s jump into a couple trends that we saw for 2023. Obviously I&#8217;d love to get into 2024 as well, but walk me through your report, some of the biggest trends you saw from 2023 and just sort of the current state of Web3 gaming as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s a great and tough question at the same time, because as you can see from the report, it took us close to 55 60 slides to try to capture a part of the truth in a sense. And there are many things to talk about before we do this, I want to give some context on what the report is all about because yeah, we say instead of Web3 gaming, but there are different reports with a different focus. So this time, for a few reasons, which I&#8217;m happy to also analyze a bit, we decided to analyze the decisions of Web3 game developers. So this report does not talk about gamers, does not talk about adoption, does not talk about traction. It&#8217;s more about analyzing why game developers took specific decisions and what is attraction between among key parts of the Web3 gaming tech stack. So it does not talk about token prices, it doesn&#8217;t talk about active wallets. We do talk about the tech stack of Web3 games and their decisions of Web3 game developers. So yeah, coming back to the original question about trends, I think we can summarize the full picture into a few sentences. Number one would be that the space, despite the sock, the macro sock that the wider crypto space experienced last year, the space is still growing. And as we saw, it only takes, I don&#8217;t know, a few weeks of market euphoria to make people again, forget everything and talk about the future. So yeah, the market is definitely still growing. Yes, slower, but definitely growing. There is a very strong focus towards the network layer of the gaming tech stack for a number of reasons. Again, that&#8217;s why we saw so many new networks or the popularity of frameworks that allow game developers to deploy their own chains. From an investment perspective, things have been impacted again from the wider macro environment within crypto and beyond. But we have seen investors definitely backing teams with existing experience or with very solid projects. So definitely the market has been super competitive and fundraising was very challenging over the past year. But we saw definitely key investors to back teams with clear focus and often bringing some experience from the Web2 world in the Web3 space. Yeah, on a high level, I would give it to this again, I&#8217;m happy to cover all the different parts of the report. Hopefully we will have enough time to talk about all that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>George, thank you for that. Much appreciated. Let&#8217;s jump into regions. Regions play such a powerful part in all aspects of Web3. I just remember specifically in the good old days of 2021 when everything was absolutely ripping and me over here in north american time, I&#8217;d be checking CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap all the other websites way too often and doing my job, having people on the Podcast. And then I&#8217;d go to bed and I&#8217;d wake up and a terrible habit that no one should ever do is I would check my phone first thing when I wake up and I look at the coins and everything rips. And why? Because that&#8217;s China and APAC moving the needle. And that sort of leads me into this question, what regions are really moving the needle when it comes to present day Web3? I understand that APAC still realistically leads the way. USA has maintained momentum, as per your guys report. What else is going on in regards to what different parts of the world are moving the needle in different capacities when it comes to Web3 gaming?</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Sure. I mean, we had the chance to really deep dive to get some new insights. We all have feeling about what&#8217;s going on. But through this report, we finally had the chance to validate our assumptions. So arguing that the APAC region in Asia overall is a ridiculously important market for gaming is not a surprise. I mean, if you see that the mainstream gaming space, Asia is for many the most important market. But this wasn&#8217;t the case for Web3 all the time. I mean, Web3 gaming is like close to five, six years old now. So we have seen a few trends. So let&#8217;s start with the US. On a country level, the US remains the biggest market when it comes to hosting most game development teams. So most Web3 games right now, they are located in the US. But over the past two years, we saw a very interesting trend of both. I mean, the APAC region growing and specifically, or let&#8217;s say driven primarily from South Korea and Japan. So for me, that&#8217;s a very interesting movement, a healthy one as well, for a number of reasons. Number one, traction across APAC usually means more existing game developers and existing giants are not trying to entering and play with Web3 exploring in different ways. That&#8217;s number one. Number two, I think having, quote unquote, some competition to the US dominance across Web3. I think that&#8217;s also a very interesting development. We&#8217;re still very early, so it definitely makes sense to have different perspectives expressed by different growth models of different parts of the world. And not sure how familiar audience might be with traditional game developers. But for example, it&#8217;s different to develop a game for the Asian market, for Japan, North Korea, or to be a Nordics game developer trying to develop a game for either Europe or the US. And the difference are cultural, economical when it comes to regulation, these are very important considerations for game developers. So all in all, Asia as a space, as a region, definitely drives most of the new stuff happening across Web3. The US definitely is a strategic market, arguably again the largest country in Web3 gaming. We can see this both when it comes to the number of game development teams, but also the funding that massively went to US based teams. And again, many ways to explain this, but just wanted to put this now to the big picture. We haven&#8217;t seen enough traction yet from. Or I mean, it&#8217;s unfair to say not enough, but when it comes to EMEA, a few people talk to me about, okay, what&#8217;s happening across Europe? Is Europe losing its traction? I think the answer is no. It&#8217;s just like we just had a few years where Asia definitely grew faster and this created this difference between the number of game developers hosted in Europe compared to North America and APAC. But yeah, on a high level. Again, APAC definitely the most strategic market for Web3 gaming right now, but the US is the largest single country market.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Yeah, no surprise there. Before we get on to the next point, investing any hidden pockets, like is there a specific city in a country, for example, that just has a crazy high pocket of Web3 gamers developers investments? Besides the obvious, like the Hong Kongs or the Dubai&#8217;s or the Miami&#8217;s, are there any sort of hidden gems out there that are worth noting?</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>I can answer this based on the database of the report because we don&#8217;t track this. I mean, this could be a fantastic idea when we consider doing a revision of the report. In my experience, Vietnam, definitely Philippines, they have fantastic game developer communities. Poland in Europe, since you ask about hidden gems, not the obvious ones in a sense. And of course the Nordics area across Europe, like Finland, Sweden, yes, these are markets that definitely have fantastic talent. Whether we&#8217;re going to see something like this translating to new games or new game studios from these areas, that&#8217;s another question. But yeah, these are definitely areas with very high quality game developers.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Very interesting. Let&#8217;s jump into the investing side of things. This is obviously a topic that gets people going like crazy. Web3 gaming sector saw just an absolutely absurd surge in 2021. Since 2018, $19 billion has been funneled into Web3 gaming related projects, which is truly staggering and truly wild. 2022, I guess in h2 in the first half of 2022, if you were fortunate enough to get some funding, that happened for very few teams. And then last half, the latter half of 2022 and the early half of 2023 didn&#8217;t fall off a cliff per se, but very, a lot slower and less prominent than the 2021 days. What&#8217;s going on right now in the investment sector? I&#8217;d love if you could talk about some of the different gaming sectors within the sector as a whole, whether it&#8217;s sports, whether it&#8217;s MMOS, RPGs, action. Where are investors throwing their money right now? And do you think this trend is going to pick back up in 2024 if we do indeed have a bull market?</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Yeah, so fundraising was super competitive last year, driven by a number of things that are not related to Web3 gaming honestly, there were a few models that didn&#8217;t never picked up, like the play to earn, which was super exciting in the beginning, and then it was super also challenging for those builders to find a sustainable business model moving forward. But I just want to say mostly this reaction of the market to all those macro events. I don&#8217;t think this is a reaction of investors to the prospects of Web3 gaming, but rather the macro environment and the risks related to investing to gaming when parts of the world are moving, literally. So this made the situation super competitive for many teams with often great talent, existing titles, existing user bases, but they still had a rough time raising. What we also saw was that investors, while they weren&#8217;t super excited about lacing too many bets or over diversifying, investors were more than happy to support, even in larger rounds, more strategic projects. How can we classify something as strategic? You can consider this either as, let&#8217;s say, some very popular IP, or the developer of very popular IP from the Web2 world deciding to do some Web3 experiment, or maybe part of the infrastructure that they have massive potential to power the Web3 gaming tech stack. So in a summary, there was a big correction. Yes, but investors even today are more than happy to support teams that have. They bring some expertise either on the game development or the content front when it comes to new year. I think that&#8217;s an interesting question, and a tricky one as well. We will continue to monitor a number of metrics, even in the first quarter. I think we will get a very good sense on the reaction of investors. In my personal experience, investors are more than happy to listen today and more open to discuss, but we haven&#8217;t yet seen strong commitment to validate the assumption that this recent positive market activity will lead to, let&#8217;s say, another wave of fundraising grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>George, thank you for that. We have to take a quick break, my friend, and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to jump into the reality of AAA Web3 games and how there is such a scarcity of them. We are going to jump into the unfavorable market conditions and how blockchains are still targeting the gaming sector, how that&#8217;s still on the rise, the distribution, how that remains still a massive challenge and blockchain wars as a whole. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends of the Cryptonews Podcast and longtime sponsors of the cryptonews.com pod and website. We love these guys as they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders.

The promo code is <strong>CRYPTONEWS50</strong>, which will give you 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Again, that is CRYPTONEWS50, CRYPTONEWS50 all in word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with George. Let&#8217;s jump into sort of the breakdown of Web3 games in regards to how they are classified. Most Web3 games are Indie level and mid sized projects, which makes up 94% of the market, as per your guys report. That is a pretty bananas number. I knew it was high. I didn&#8217;t think it would be that high. While AA and AAA titles are incredibly scarce, contributing to only 6% of the market share, how can we move the needle to get more AAA and AA studios on board to create these games? Because at the end of the day, gaming is not 2021 anymore or late 2020 where you had play to earn. Gaming needs to be fun. It&#8217;s the sort of the bread and butter of gaming. It&#8217;s the main essence of gaming. And in order to create fun games, you need good graphics, you need good storylines, you need talented teams, you need crazy high shoot for the moon visions. And it&#8217;s tough for these Indie level and midsize projects to compete with the AA and AAA, big boys and big gals. How do we change this George? And I&#8217;d love if you could sort of just take a deep dive into the composition of AAA games versus Indie games.</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Yeah, of course. I would like to start by questioning you back. Do you think we really need many AAA? I mean, having, let&#8217;s say we have 90% of Web3 games being AAA, then we need a new definition of the even better category. So my point is, I think we have been overly obsessed with definitions for a minute and we forgot about as an ecosystem, why are we developing games in first place? So let me provide some context about the classification framework behind those figures you just shared with us. So first of all, we&#8217;re not examining the quality of the experience. I have played many hours of my life games that would be considered ceiling D small, very nice, but they have been absolutely fun for me. So I think we need to make clear that it&#8217;s one thing to talk about the production quality, the resources that each team has available that could give a good sense about whether you are AAA or Indie, versus the quality and the fun that eventually gamers can have. So we designed a framework that tried to encompass the realities of the Web3 space, but also being compatible with the assumptions of the Web2 world that bows, one is AAA case. And we realize that in the Web3 space we have this tendency to always say, if you&#8217;re not really AAA, then that&#8217;s bad. So that&#8217;s why we say, yeah, I&#8217;m using Unreal engine, so I&#8217;m AAA Web3 game. I think that&#8217;s not super productive personally. And I think we need to accept that AAA or AA or whatever always will be a top X percent of the market. If you ask leading game developers from the Web2 world, they would say it&#8217;s very hard to be AAA gaming studio unless you have already built AAA game in your life. So with all those interesting ideas, we define a framework that while by design it&#8217;s biased, everything is biased when it comes to things you don&#8217;t calculate. A well accepted methodology. We tried to analyze again what are the resources that the average Web3 game studio has available. And we realized that most of them would fit under the Indie plus, let&#8217;s say category of the mainstream space. What does this mean? Is that I think we need to have realistic expectations. There is no point of trying to build the next Fortnight if you don&#8217;t have ten years ahead of you, if you don&#8217;t have a massive team ready to support you across both development and commercialization. There&#8217;s no point of being obsessed about that. So it might make sense to think strategically where blockchain can really offer a unique experience for your gamer base. At the same time, there are definitely cases where we have Web3 native IP. So IP started from scratch as Web3. That has the characteristics of AAA experience Shrapnel. You mentioned about them before. Iluvium, Star Atlas. We have CCP doing a play test right now. We have many, of course, games doing cool things. But yeah, our methodology, I believe, contributed to the fact that we should not be obsessed about acronyms and really focus into where does it make sense. In some cases, graphics fidelity is what it takes to bring gamers in. Some others is the creative combination of gameplay, fun and the power of blockchain through asset ownership or smart contracts, decentralization, compatibility that can really move the needle. It&#8217;s not just the use of Unreal Engine 5.2.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Very well said there. I love how the Unreal Engine plug as well. A couple more questions then we will wrap up here, my friend. We also need to talk about the different blockchains that are buzzing in the sector right now. Despite the unfavorable market conditions, blockchains that are targeting the gaming sector continue to be on the rise. Obviously, most use L-1 networks with EVM side chains, but I&#8217;d love if you can walk us through sort of the breakdown between L-1s L-2s and some sort of more niche L-3s, and how a new breed of blockchain networks are sort of accounting for a much larger share of games that have been built this year.</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Absolutely, yes. To our surprise, we saw like a very high number of new networks launching in 2023 and 2022 as well, someone would expect, because of the automatic conditions for the appetite for new chains to go down, but it&#8217;s actually the opposite. We can explain this in a number of ways. The simplest one is that most of these teams have been building for years. So obviously, since they&#8217;re working on something, they definitely want to bring to the market, despite the fact that NFT or Terra happened to happen in the same year. So we see obviously again, the development progress over the past three, four years to now materialize to new chains. But I think the most important observation from seeing close to 88 or 85 new networks that they focus, they target gaming, use cases to launch in 2023 is the fact that the concept of a chain is close to a commodity. And yeah, people tend to either be excited or give me weird looks when I say that blockchains are commodities. But what it means is that a chain itself is not hard to recreate today. It&#8217;s not like 2018 or 2017, where we had three, four, five usable chains and then the rest were like random coins pumping and dumping. Today, launching a chain according to your own needs, to your own environment, to your own game, to your own gaming ecosystem, is not rocket science. What is rocket science is of course offering a great UX that ties to the architecture of your own chain, but also to all the other layers of the text, including the wallet and many other things that can make the experience for gamers great. So what is hard is to optimize for your community. The content. Again, blockchains are commodities, but the content, the ecosystem and the communities you have on top of them are absolutely not. So we saw this in 2023 again, 83 new chains. I can&#8217;t see how we&#8217;re going to see less than that next year, especially given the rise of popularity of Layer 2, Layer 3 solutions. I want my own roll up. And there are also a popularity of frameworks that allow any game developer to launch their own chain. Like the OPL Stack, the Polygon, CDK, the hyperchains of Arbitrum, Nitro, Cosmos SDK, Avalanche subnets. I can talk about this for the next ten minutes. There are many solutions, many great solutions with different merits. So yeah, creating a chain is not super hard anymore, but finding good use for this chain is what the competition is all about.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I love that. So well said there. Another point is distribution. This is something that hits close to home as I&#8217;ve been very fortunate to work with a couple of gaming companies and one of the hardest things is distribution, George, and you are obviously well aware of this. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you create the best and most fun and addicting game in the whole world. If it doesn&#8217;t get out there, you&#8217;re hooped. You&#8217;re absolutely hooped with a capital H. Distribution is the name of the game in today&#8217;s world. To quote Gary Vee, we live in the attention economy and if you can&#8217;t get attention and distribution on your game, it&#8217;s candidly never going to blow up. You&#8217;re never going to make money. One of my favorite stats from your report is that the Epic Game Store has finally embraced Web3 games. There were two games listed in June of 2022 and there are now 69 jokes. Got to love that. There are 69 in October of 2023. We love to see that the number is rising. How does Web3 as a whole, how does the Web3 gaming sector continue to take away some of this market share from Web2 and increase distribution so we can get eyes on great products?</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Yeah, I think as you said, distribution is arguably one of the biggest challenges for Web3 game developers, that they might have a fantastic game, a fantastic community, they might have perfected the whole experience, but still you need users and the distribution becomes an ecosystem wide bottleneck. So there are a few drivers in the market right now. Number one is that I think it should be clear that most big players are slightly more optimistic towards Web3 games. That&#8217;s why you saw this number with the listings on the Epic Games Store. Of course, this was partially influenced by the decision of Epic Games to be a bit more relaxed when it comes to self publishing, so game developers could go online and submit their own games. That&#8217;s something that wasn&#8217;t the case in the past. You saw Google play being Google overall, being more open to the idea of NFTs and token side games. They allowed specific use cases and they give clear guidance. We&#8217;re going to see how this will play out based on. I mean, I believe in January next month, they will also do a revision of how game developers and app developers overall can make use and refer to cryptocurrencies. We also saw the case with Epic and about the antitrust case and how this might impact the freedom that Google offers to Web3 game developers. But the challenge I&#8217;m describing is that even though mainstream distribution platforms are indeed becoming more Web3 friendly, there is an underlying challenge that Web3 game developers cannot really compete by having two versions, one, the real Web3 one and the Web3 minus minus, to fit the needs of either Epic, Google, Apple or whatever. Again, in the short term, this might be a fantastic solution for game developers to access a way for their audience. But I think we need to start imagining what is the future state of distribution for Web3 games. Because as you saw from the report, close to six out of ten games, Web3 games right now are not served by any mainstream distribution platform. So they have two options. They can either do the direct distribution way. I had a website, if you find it, you&#8217;re going to play my game. Good luck with that. If you really want to make money as a game developer or to rely on Web3 native distribution, and something that is very interesting also for Game7. That&#8217;s why we supported the creation of HyperPlay, which is a native distribution platform that tries to offer all the services you would expect from Steam, from Epic, Google Play and all these platforms, but also designed in a way that is friendly to the concept of a Web3 wallet of transactions. So yeah, I think solving this challenge is interesting and we&#8217;re going to see two forces. Number one, the distribution platforms becoming more and more friendly, but then the growth and rise of Web3 native tools. So it would be interesting to see what would prevail and how these two forces will play together in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I love this. George, last question here, mate. You&#8217;ve been on an absolute roll. Give me some 2024 predictions. What are we going to see here? Do you have any predictions for games or coins that are going to absolutely pop off? Do you have any macro predictions? Micro predictions? Give us the quick TLDR on the state of Web3 gaming in 2024. What trends that we can look forward to? What predictions do you think will come to fruition?</p>
<p><strong>George Isichos<br />
</strong>Yeah, so I can&#8217;t really comment on talking prices, but I think we can paint a good picture for our audience about the key developments in the space. So as I said earlier, the concept of a blockchain network will be commoditized, meaning that we will see way more people trying to be creative around their own chains. There are custom versions of that roll ups. And again, roll ups is an umbrella term. It can mean many different things. But yeah, we&#8217;re going to see way more innovation and exploration when it comes to creating chains fit for specific purposes. When it comes to scalability, which definitely remains a key challenge across the board for blockchain networks. We&#8217;re going to see some interesting developments. Again, we saw the rise of roll ups, Layer 2s, Layer 3s, the initial rise of optimistic solutions. Then now we have interesting developments on the ZK front with Polygon SDK, with zkSync with stagnant as well. We have the rise of data availability networks that they try to practically solve. The cost of having a roll up on top of Ethereum like Celestia, NEAR, Avail. Many other solutions will pop up. So scalability will wear different hats. And that&#8217;s a good thing. We&#8217;re not betting on just a single technical theme. And if it works, great. If not, then we have a problem. We do have a few options that can really push the space forward. Another observation would be that in 2024 we have the unique opportunity to stop assuming things about Web3 gaming, but actually experiencing it. Because we do have high quality, playable IP from both, let&#8217;s say teams that they started from scratch as Web3, like Shrapnel, like Illuvium, like Star Atlas, like my Frog Nations, like sorry, I&#8217;m forgetting so many great games, but you get my point. Like teams that they start a few years back to develop from scratch a Web3 game and now we have the chance to see how it plays, to see how mainstream gamers react to it, to see how Web3 gamers react to it, to validate tokenomics, business models, all these assumptions. So far in 2024 we will have the chance to actually see what it works and hopefully work towards solving the rest. And at the same time we are observing many AAA or mainstream players like Ubisoft, like Square Enix, like CCP from even online. Like we made like so many more teams doing actual experiments across different chains. So this is also very interesting to see and observe how the traditional gamers of this IP would react to Ubisoft going Web3 and trying to do things. So yeah, 2024 will be a very interesting year when it comes to token prices. As I said, I can&#8217;t really comment, but my point is that sometimes prices are tied to a macro environment that is not gaming related but outside of again, price development, I think 2024 is a fantastic opportunities for all of us to learn and start working towards mainstream adoption for Web3 gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>George, you absolutely crushed this. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I definitely have some homework to do and this was an absolute treat. My apologies for the WiFi to listeners at home. I&#8217;m sure this will turn out great because we have an incredible team helping us but my WiFi was absolutely terrible. There is a storm going on right now and when it rains here it pours and it affects the Internet. So I hope this one was definitely good enough for all you guys and I will be working on that in the near future. George, you crushed this. Thank you so much for coming on my friend.

<strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are Buzzin as always, and I am super pumped to have the one and only Bob Ras on the show today, Co-Founder of Sologenic, a sophisticated ecosystem built on top of the XRP Ledger that facilitates investing and trading between crypto and non-blockchain assets such as stocks, ETFs, commodities, and more from the top 30 plus global stock exchanges. Alongside his work at Sologenic, Bob also Co-Founded Coreum, the third generation Layer 1 smart blockchain built to serve as a core infrastructure for future blockchain appliances. A true serial entrepreneur who has established several ventures within manufacturing, tech, and blockchain industries, Bob has been a keynote speaker at many reputable blockchain summits including Malta AI, the future blockchain summit in Dubai, and he&#8217;s coming in hot from the west coast of my own country, Canada. Bob, super pumped to have you on. Welcome to the show. How you doing, my friend?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>I&#8217;m doing well. Thanks for having me today, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Pumped to have you on here. You and the team have built something absolutely electric at Sologenic, a true behemoth, and I can&#8217;t wait to get into that. But before we do, you&#8217;ve done some incredible and crazy shit in your lifetime. You are a true builder. You set an idea to something. You make it happen. You make that magic pop. We absolutely love to see that. Give us a little bit of background on yourself. What you&#8217;ve done, maybe a little bit about your childhood. What about tech tickles your fancy so much. Some of the crazy and cool things you built, and then we&#8217;ll get into Sologenic, Coreum, and some of the fun crypto stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>Thank you, Matt. Yeah, a little bit about my childhood. I was born in a family that my dad was one of the very first C++ engineer. I&#8217;m talking about probably 30, 35 years ago. He was one of the very first C++ engineer in the world. So I grew up with computer around me. I can remember the very first time that my dad brought a computer home. It was actually the sides of the room. So we had a room. It was just a computer room. So we had a room actually, and the computer was there. So the whole room, it was a massive computer. Fast forward, I actually got involved into manufacturing. It&#8217;s a little bit surprising, but I got into manufacturing around 2008. I was pretty young. So the way I&#8217;ve done that, probably many people are not really aware of that. So what I&#8217;ve done during those days actually hire a team of scientists. And they came up with a formula for me. I sent them to the lab. They came up with a formula. We patterned the formula. And then we took the formula to China. We start manufacturing that product. That&#8217;s how I really got into business. And again, I was pretty young. I was about 23, 24 years old during that time. And so after a few years, we&#8217;ve done very well. We used to export to over six to eight countries during those days, which was a success. So the factory that we used to work with, we used to use them as an outsourcing factory, they actually gave us an offer to purchase some of their shares. So we made a deal with them. So I actually acquired the majority ownership at the factory. So I started to work on that factory. I expanded the factory, the production line. And after a few years, I sold back the ownership to the original owners. And it was about 2016, 2017 and during that time, I was really involved into crypto. Crypto was pretty new. And that&#8217;s exactly how I got into technology. So around 2017, I completely changed my focus into technology. Elaborate about my background. I&#8217;m not a developer, but my major degree is marketing. So I&#8217;m very familiar with coding. During my college time, I actually passed two years program for computer science as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>And just taking a step back to the product that you manufactured in China. What was that?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>It was actually, believe it or not, it was brake pads for cars. But I realized. Everyone&#8217;s saying, oh, wow, why brake pads? Because I was actually, I realized that there is a gap, right? Actually, the way that it happened, so I was driving my car and I had to keep changing my brake pad because it was making a lot of noises, right? And then I was thinking, OK, what if I come up with a formula? Because obviously, there are not a lot of researchers on this product. So what if we do some research and come up with a formula that&#8217;s quiet and it&#8217;s actually give you a better life span, right? So that&#8217;s exactly how that idea was born. And we&#8217;ve done like about a year and a half research and development. And then we came up with that formula. We were successful to create that formula.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I mean, that&#8217;s wild. It&#8217;s just of all things getting into breakpads. So you and the team at Sologenic are creating a platform that helps institutions, integrates, and manage tokenization across their whole business. Now, saying this out loud, you can hear how useful, and obviously it&#8217;s front of mind utility, but it&#8217;s so broad. What exactly, like give us some real world examples of this. Cause when I think of this, I&#8217;m like, holy shit, this is exactly what we&#8217;re looking for. And in the real life and present day, I&#8217;ve thought of the use case many times, we&#8217;re going to the store, I&#8217;m in Mexico right now, there&#8217;s 7/11 everywhere. I go to 7/11, I wanna buy an electrolyte, or I wanna buy a bottle of tequila, and I can pay with an Apple share, or I can pay with something tokenized instead of my Amex or Mexican pesos. So I absolutely love this. I love that you guys are making it happen, but give me some use cases, some examples of how you&#8217;re helping real world companies, get into the tokenization game of their stocks, bonds, real estate, et cetera.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>I think there are a lot of benefits when you come to the tokenization of real-world assets. Let&#8217;s just focus on securities. Let&#8217;s focus on stocks because that&#8217;s the focus of Sologenic. When you are tokenizing assets, there are a couple of benefits attached to that. Number one, I would say 24/7 trading, which is the most important one because you allow people to trade 24/7 versus a traditional market average, which is usually a limited time. Not only that, I think that&#8217;s one of the greatest benefits. The other one is when you are tokenizing assets, you allow fractional trading. That&#8217;s going to bring a massive liquidity. That&#8217;s going to unlock a massive liquidity that they&#8217;re sitting outside of traditional market right now because simply they don&#8217;t really have capital to get into the traditional financial market. For example, think about how many people are in the world that they would like to purchase, for example, a portfolio of Tesla, Amazon, etc. But they don&#8217;t really have that much money. They don&#8217;t have $10,000. They don&#8217;t have $20,000. They got like $1,000. So we are unlocking, we are bringing those liquidity into the market, traditional market. And if you want to look at it from a global scale, we are talking about a massive amount of liquidity. It&#8217;s a win-win situation. You are giving micro investors the opportunity to invest into the stock. At the same time, you are adding more liquidity to the markets, the traditional financial market. That&#8217;s the other one that I really like. The 10th one is actually the 24/7 set where it says the traditional way that usually when you are purchasing any stocks, let&#8217;s say on TD platform, for example, or RBC in Canada because you&#8217;re Canadian. The way that it works, you purchase other stocks, they show you on the UI that you are owning other stocks. But in reality, the settlement between the brokerage helps and the actual bank is going to take 24 to 48 hours, sometimes even 72 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Two plus three instead of the classic, but yeah. So true.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>Versus the new one that if you&#8217;re settling on the blockchain, it&#8217;s going to happen in a second, two seconds, three seconds, right? More clear, more transparent, and everything is traceable, everything is traceable on the blockchain. And the fourth one is actually that&#8217;s what you brought up. So when you&#8217;re tokenizing assets, they become a crypto asset. So you can have the self custody of those assets. At the same time, you can actually spend those tokenized stocks. And we are actually introducing a prepaid crypto card, which the way that it&#8217;s going to work is you can actually put your asset as a collateral. And then every time that you are using your card, let&#8217;s say at 7/11, that you mentioned, or if you&#8217;re buying a tequila behind the scene, the system is going to liquidate a portion of your tokenized assets to offset your purchase amount. Yeah, a lot of this is what&#8217;s on top of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Now, and this is great. Another thing I&#8217;d love to get into just to sort of set the stage as we continue to go down the rabbit hole of Sologenic is Coreum, which is the third generation Layer 1 smart blockchain. Why did you and the team need to build, and again, it&#8217;s not easy building L1s. Building L2 is OK. You have a lot of preemptive, already built tech that you can build upon. Obviously, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called the Layer 2 and not Layer 1. Building Layer 1s, it&#8217;s a bit of nightmare fuel. It&#8217;s actually a lot of nightmare fuel, very difficult, incredibly difficult. And you and the team did that. Why did you guys build Coreum? And I&#8217;d love if you could explain its relationship to Sologenic and why the two work so well in tandem.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>Definitely. So first of all, I have to clarify that Coreum team and Sologenic team are two different teams completely separate teams. However, there are some overlaps, right? But the engineering team, which is the most important basically team at both companies, they&#8217;re completely separate. You know, the Sologenic engineering team and Coreum engineering team, they&#8217;re not the same at all. And some other team members as well. Why we created Coreum? That&#8217;s a great question. Actually, for two reasons. Reason number one, we wanted to create, you know, we actually look at the field of friend blockchain when we wanted to start to Sologenic back in 2021, right? And we decided to go with XRP Ledger because it was fast. It was, you know, it was more cost efficient. At the same time, it had some features like trust line, which allow us to stay in compliance with the regulatory framework, right? I can touch on that later on. However, XRP Ledger doesn&#8217;t have a smart contract, right? Which we believe that in order to launch, you know, in order to create a tokenized securities gateway and expand it down the road, you need a smart contract because this smart contract is going to unlock a lot of opportunities, right? Like lending, borrowing, settlement, a lot of things, right? So that was one of the reasons that we created Coreum. And we actually, we look at the market. Let me ask you a question, Matt. Have you ever seen any legit adoption of any cryptocurrency or blockchain globally? Just give me an example.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>No, I really haven&#8217;t. I mean, yeah, we have some examples in El Salvador and other parts like that. But like me personally, besides sending crypto to contractors or clients or vendors or whatever the case may be across the world, it&#8217;s much more efficient than sending a PayPal or a Wise account or a wire transfer. Besides that, transfer of monetary value.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>Exactly, but what I&#8217;m referring to is I&#8217;m referring to that government level, right? I&#8217;m talking about financial institution, Zigo. And everyone is talking about it. You know, since the inception of Bitcoin, everybody was talking about global mass adoption, but I&#8217;ve done anything to make it happen. Absolutely, you know, why? Because everyone, you know, we want to go against the government. We want to go against the authority. I&#8217;m not supporting them, you know, who don&#8217;t call me wrong. I&#8217;m not supporting them. But what I&#8217;m saying that, if you want to read the real adoption by the financial institution, maybe even by the governments, right? You need to give them some level of control, right? So first of all, Coreum is a blockchain, which is, you know, functioning exactly the same way as the other blockchain, right? So your users data, users information, everything is secured, right? Everything is going to stay confidential, right? It&#8217;s not like when you&#8217;re interacting with Coreum, your information is going to be released to the third party. No. But what you have done with Coreum, there is an optional KYC and AML feature built on Coreum, which if you are a financial institution, and if you are building on Coreum, so first of all, as a default is always on like on Coreum chain, there&#8217;s no KYC or AML. But if you are building on Coreum, your product on Coreum, and you&#8217;re a financial institution, then you have the opportunity to turn it on. So what it means, imagine there are financial institutions, both of them are regulated, right? Obviously, they need to do KYC, they need to, you know, exchange some level of data together when it comes to the transfer. So it works the same way as a swift. So some data like beneficiary name, account holder name, address, data, whatever, are going to be encrypted with every transaction between these two financial institutions. And if financial institution A is sending funds to the B, both of them, they have the customer&#8217;s information, which is required by the authorities. So that helps them to stay in compliance with the AML regulated framework. Not only that, we actually integrated ISO 222 in Coreum. As a matter of fact, we&#8217;re going to be releasing a demo probably in two weeks. So it&#8217;s a newer standard, which has been introduced by ISO. And it&#8217;s actually, it&#8217;s a mandate for every financial institution, I think by 2024 or something like that to follow that, to adopt that, right? So Coreum is already in compliance with that. You know, we actually integrated that standard using a smart token. So end of the day, why we created Coreum, first of all, you know, it was because of Sologenic. We wanted to create, our own Layer 1, which focuses tokenization. And it&#8217;s a blockchain that is going to be used by financial institutions. So it&#8217;s an enterprise-grade blockchain, which has all the regulated framework as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I love that. Bob, you are absolutely buzzing right now. You are on a roll, but we need to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the Show. And when we get back, we are going to keep buzzing on Sologenic, get into a little bit about XRP and the future of tokenization. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

You guys chose to build on XRP. Obviously, we had the Ripple hearing earlier this year, which was massive. XRP Ledger networks, everyone knows that they are absolutely huge. Why did you guys choose to build on them? With the plethora of blockchains available, there must have been a couple of reasons why you chose to build with an on ledger. I&#8217;d love to get into that and learn more about this decision.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>Yes, I actually touch on that very briefly. When we were doing research, we were doing a lot of research on blockchain that we wanted to select to create Sologenic we actually had a couple of different options during that time. Ethereum obviously was one of them, but Ethereum is costly. It was pretty slow right now. They actually resolved those problems, right? But during that time, about 2021, 2020, yes. Ethereum was costly. Ethereum was very slow. However, it had smart contract, right? So which was great. But from the other side, XRP Ledger, it actually had some features that we actually needed during that time for example, trust line. And trust line allow us to stay in compliance with the regular day framework. The way that it works, if there&#8217;s a user that they are tokenizing assets on Sologenic platform, right? Obviously, they have to go through a KYC system, it&#8217;s KYC and onboarding a step. Once that they&#8217;re successfully passed that a step, you are going to whitelist their wallet address on the XRP Ledger. So technically, a trust line is going to be created between the customer wallet and the gateway, the issuing gateway. So this allow the user to be able to trade that tokenized assets on the dex as well. So we give you the freedom of trading, 24/7 trading of tokenized assets on the dex. However, if you are interested to trade those assets on the dex, you need to pass KYC on Sologenic and whitelist your wallet. So this feature is only exists on the XRP Ledge, which is a fantastic feature. Besides that, the XRP Ledger has been around. It&#8217;s one of the oldest chains in the crypto industry. And you can see that there are a lot of financial institutions that are already practicing on the ledger or actually using the ledger, right? And that&#8217;s actually going to prove that XRP Ledger, it&#8217;s a great chain for any financial product, such as Sologenc, that is aiming to go live.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Well said there. Another interesting point about Sologenic, when you check out the website, and the website&#8217;s beautiful by the way, but when you go check out the website on the lander, not the true lander, meaning when you get on and you don&#8217;t have to scroll, but on the first page when you scroll down, there is some literature on the CBDC tool, which I absolutely love. I still don&#8217;t know how I completely feel about CBDC&#8217;s, Bob. Again, if they were to launch, I&#8217;d want a team like you guys to launch it for governments, because I trust you guys, I hold a lot more than I trust the GOVs. But I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through the ins and outs of this tool, talk to me about, you know, I know there&#8217;s a lot of use cases that you can&#8217;t tell me about, because they&#8217;re coming to fruition and these are with governments and massive financial institutions. But I&#8217;d love if you could walk me through sort of your two cents on CBDC&#8217;s and the importance of the tool and what it does and how it can help governments launch through on CBDC.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>So basically the CBDC tokenization tool, it&#8217;s a set of tools that are going to be added to the existing CBDC sandbox environment, right? I&#8217;ll give you an example. So why did we launch this solution about a year, a year and a half ago? So we actually, we have been approached by Ripple to build a tokenization tool for the existing CBDC sandbox, right? And that shows that there is a, if Ripple is reaching out to us to build that, there&#8217;s a market for that, right? So that&#8217;s why we came up with that tool, the CBDC tool. And so this is a custom-built tokenization solution that is going to be added to any CBDC sandbox environment and allow financial institution or central banks to tokenize assets while they are transferring the assets and funds between financial institutions as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>So interesting, how far away are we from seeing CBDCs actually get launched? And I mean, obviously China has one that&#8217;s sort of in beta mode right now, but like how far away are we Bob? Do you think this is actually going to happen? You think in 10 years like currency is going to be just a joke and the good old days of cold hard cash are going to be gone. Like what&#8217;s your two cents on that?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>Definitely, CBDC is going to happen for sure, but I have to be very clear. Governments, they&#8217;re not going to be using XRP Ledger. They&#8217;re not going to be using Coreum. They&#8217;re not going to be using Ethereum. They&#8217;re not going to be using any blockchain for CBDC. So, mainly CBDCs are being run at this moment on the private ledgers, right? Which, that makes sense. You know, if you central banks are launching their crypto assets, like a stable cool or any other crypto assets, they want to have the control. So, they&#8217;re not going to be launching on any third party. They&#8217;re going to be launching it on their own. A lot of people, they get really excited. So, oh, CBDC is going up on XRP Ledger. CBDC is going up on Ethereum and so on. And no, that&#8217;s not the reality. The reality is it&#8217;s going to be private ledger. So, I have to clarify that. But the good news is this is going to happen for sure, 100%. It&#8217;s really hard for me to think about the way that people are actually transferring funds at this moment, right? Think about it in 10 years. It&#8217;s really hard for me to believe that it&#8217;s going to stay the same, right? Like, it&#8217;s so outdated. You know, you should just go online, transfer your assets, your funds through Swift, from one country to another country. If you&#8217;re lucky, it&#8217;s going to be transferred in 24 hours. If you&#8217;re not lucky, it&#8217;s going to be transferred in 72 hours. And maybe you get a stop somewhere on the way. Who knows? And you have to go trace it through your bank. This is just insane, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>What about the transparency and the surveillance part though? You know, like what about the average Joe and Josephine who put the average Joe and Josephine probably don&#8217;t give a shit if the government sees every little move they make. And for me, this is honestly relatively hypocritical because I&#8217;m someone who uses credit card every single chance I get. Like if I have an opportunity to stack some points, I&#8217;m gonna stack some points. So I use my Amex or my Visa or Mastercard or whatever for absolutely every purchase unless I can&#8217;t use cash. So with that being said, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t even know why I care about this because if the government really wanted to know every little move I make, they could and very well do. But what&#8217;s your opinion on the whole surveillance aspect?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>That&#8217;s very sad, but I don&#8217;t think crypto is going to resolve that because if you want to look at it from the government perspective, they never allow any technology to come and take the control out of their hands. This is sad. So for that reason, being said, even with CBDC, even with other products that they&#8217;re going to be building on the blockchain, still government, they&#8217;re going to have the full control. They want to make sure they can freeze your wallet at any point of time. They want to make sure any transfer that you are making, they are fully aware of that. They want to make sure that anytime if they decide to cancel a transfer, they are able to do that. I think this is the way that it&#8217;s going to be. And we should be a little bit realistic about it. There is no reason that the governments, they want to basically give up from the level of control that they have.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>No, that&#8217;s totally true. Bob we are getting a little tight for time here. A couple more questions and then we&#8217;ll wrap up two more. And then we&#8217;re definitely gonna have to get you back on for round two, because we&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface here. You guys released some news not too long ago. More specifically, it was you with a great Twitter thread. Sologenic will be listing on some pretty big juicy exchanges soon. Obviously, you cannot let us know which ones, but is there anything you can tell us? Can you give us timelines? Anything of the like, anything that the Sologenic community and fans can look forward to regarding the listings on massive centralized exchanges, which is coming up pretty darn soon.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>Definitely. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not going to be able to release the name, but I can just mention that we started a new round of reach out to the tier one and top tier two exchanges. Right? And we have been very successful with that. And a couple of great exchanges, they have been confirmed, right? Which unfortunately, I&#8217;m not going to be able to release the name. However, there are going to happen, you know, some in December, some in January and some in February. And I&#8217;m talking about both assets, and they&#8217;re going to list Solo and Coreum at the same time. So these are, unfortunately, I can&#8217;t disclose the name, but yes, these are great exchanges. I&#8217;m personally very excited because it&#8217;s going to allow us to have a better reach globally.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I love that. And last question here is the future of tokenization, a very broad one. But what does the future of tokenization look like in your eyes? I&#8217;d love if you could speak on this from sort of the consumer and institutional aspect. If you are a CFO or CEO of an institution, how do you look at tokenization moving forward? And I&#8217;d love if you could also answer this from the consumer side of things. How will this affect our lives moving forward as well?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>That&#8217;s actually a great question. The short answer is, I think, I believe, everything is going to be tokenized by 2030. And if I want to dive in a little bit more into details, from the company perspective, when you are tokenizing assets, it allows you to, let&#8217;s talk about the use again, real estate. The developer can actually raise funds through tokenization. So if you have a fantastic real estate project that you are trying to sell, you can actually use blockchain and tokenize that project and raise funds. From consumer perspective, it&#8217;s actually easier. You&#8217;re helping all these investors and users in order to participate into this tokenization project as well. And yeah, I think it&#8217;s going to make everything easier for both sides.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>I love that. Bob, you absolutely crushed this. Really appreciate you coming on and can&#8217;t wait for round two. Until then, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you, Sologenic and Coreum online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>You know, if anyone wants to talk with me, you can actually come on Twitter, not Twitter, x.com. My handle is @bobrasX. I actually had that X at the end forever. So I didn&#8217;t copy Elon.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>It just worked like a charm.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>Actually, all my previous companies they had X, believe it or not, in the past. But yeah, @bobrasX, I&#8217;m available there. Tag me if you have any questions. I&#8217;m glad to answer.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Amazing. Bob, thank you so much for coming on, man. Truly a great episode. Definitely have some homework to do and can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ras<br />
</strong>I appreciate it, and thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab<br />
</strong>Folks, what&#8217;s an episode with Bob Ras, Co-Founder of Sologenic. He was dropping knowledge bombs, left, right, and center.

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We&#8217;re buzzing, as always. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab, still coming in hot from Mexico. And I am super pumped for today&#8217;s episode. Maybe a little more pumped than usual as this one hits very near and dear to my heart. Long term hockey fan, played hockey, I want to say, since age of four or five. And today I get Tom Mizzone on the show, the CEO and Founder of Sweet, to talk about not only Sweet, the premier platform for gamified digital sports collectible experiences, but also NHL Breakaway, which is the National Hockey League&#8217;s new NFT platform, which is obviously in conjunction and is built on Sweet, the one and only. Super pumped to have Tom on. He has a proven track record of launching, growing and operating successful tech organizations. Anything gamified, digital collectibles, sports leagues, teams, athletes, you name it. Super pumped. Sweet has also done collectibles programs in NHL, the NHLPA, the NHLAA, and this is going to help grow hockey across the globe and help bring on Web2 hockey users to the Web3 world. Tom, super pumped to have you on. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
I&#8217;m really well. Great to be here. Thank you so much, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you. Your background is electric. Guys for everyone who&#8217;s in their car doing the good old commute, you can&#8217;t see Tom&#8217;s background, but it is absolutely elite. Definitely cracks the top five for all backgrounds we&#8217;ve had. So we&#8217;re already off to a great start here. We got to jump right into you before we get into Sweet and of course, NHL Breakaway, as I said during my little brief intro, huge hockey fan. So this one&#8217;s a little bit more exciting than usual for me. Crypto&#8217;s fun, Blockchain&#8217;s incredible, don&#8217;t get me wrong. But when you get to tie in my favorite sport on the planet, I got a little more juice. I&#8217;m a little more fired up for this one. I want to know a little bit about Tom before we get into it. Walk me through your past, how you got into being a digital collectibles guru and obviously creating organizations that have helped launch these. Walk me through where you grew up. You must have been a sports guy, you must have been an athlete and sort of segue into some of your favorite teams and we&#8217;ll loop this all together and then get into some of the fun stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Sure absolutely and great question. So I&#8217;m from northern New Jersey. We say New York or the tri state area, but I&#8217;m a Jersey boy, coincidentally, a lot of our executive staff based here in New Jersey as well. Grew up a Yankees fan, grew up in the football world, believe it or not, a Redskins fan now Commanders, which was very brutal with a bunch of giants fans at my high school. But back then, thank God, we had some pretty good teams on the hockey side. I&#8217;ll say. One of my really good buddies in high school, and I graduated high school in 1989, was a Pittsburgh Penguins fan. And they were very easy to like back then with Mario Lemieux. Yeah. So really kind of grew up liking the Penguins. But in later years, I decided not to torture my kids by liking another sort of out of market team and did flip to the Rangers. And so I&#8217;m a Rangers fan now. I&#8217;m a big sports guy. I love to collect. I&#8217;ve always collected baseball cards. I have a piece of Yankee Stadium from when they tore down the original stadium in a spot.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
My background is building technology. Right. It was 1996. I started my first tech company, believe it or not. The joke a few years ago was like, what&#8217;s an NFT? Or what is this technology? I remember the days where it was like, well, what&#8217;s a website? Netscape navigator hit. People were browsing these graphical areas on the Internet and everyone&#8217;s like, what is this? Right? And so my first company was actually an ISP. You young guys won&#8217;t even be able to relate with this, but we had a stack of 14.4k modems that people would dial into from their phones and connect, and then we had a 1.5 megabit T1 pipe connected to that, which would serve like hundreds, even thousands of people access to the Internet. So that&#8217;s kind of how I started. Definitely a telecom guy early on, and then I&#8217;ve done a few different companies since then, fortunately was very successful with that company and a few others after. I won&#8217;t give you all the play by play, but a few years ago, I had this vision for Sweet, seeing the convergence of physical memorabilia moving into digital and the opportunities there. And we&#8217;ve been really investing in the last few years into the platform. And as we get into it, you&#8217;re going to probably see we&#8217;ve taken a little bit of a contrarian or a different approach to the space, right? And I think that set us up in a very different way as we&#8217;re now launching, like, lead level programs.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Thanks for the little intro there. Let&#8217;s jump right into NHL Breakaway. And before we do, I have a bit of a funny story for you. Back in 2021, very early Feb, end of January, early Feb 2021 NBA Topshot is en route to hitting critical mass and absolute. Just crazy velocity. Obviously big hockey fan. As I mentioned, it is probably the league that I follow the closest and I&#8217;ve always been a basketball guy as well. Love all sports. Messed around with some collectibles in NBA Topshot had an absolute blast. Also saw that Sorare was sort of being built out at the time and I was like, you know what, I&#8217;m going to bring up some of my sales background here. I&#8217;m going to fire off a bunch of cold emails. So I went on to hunter.io and I scraped also my assistant and I scraped, I want to say, about 100 emails from the NHL. And we fired off a bunch of emails. I drafted up a cold email and the title was something along the likes of when are you guys going to jump on the NFT collectible bandwagon? That didn&#8217;t work. Then change up a bunch of different titles, changed up the copy, ended up getting response from the whole team. I&#8217;m not going to name drop other names because it would be just not the right thing to do for them. But the one big name is Bill Daly. So we had a bunch of conversations with Bill Daly and the whole team and all the other svps and directors at the NHL and they didn&#8217;t want to do it. And imagine if they were doing what you guys are doing back two years ago and could have caught on that absolute craziness. That would have been bananas again. You guys are still tearing it up and doing a great job right now, but would have been cool to see. So when this opportunity came on to have you on, I was like, damn, we got to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
And just so you know, I think we beat out something like 70 companies to win this deal. Yeah, it was very competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
The tender was massive. Huge.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Yeah. They brought up a phenomenal consultant company named Shelley Palmer, who was sort of like their technical guru, vetting companies. And one quick funny story. When we finally did win the deal, I have a great relationship with Shelley. He&#8217;s a good guy, but yeah, he&#8217;s crawling all over us. And when we finally did win the deal, we presented down in DC to all the club presidents that know Gary Batman, everybody was there and Shelly was right next to me and I was Shelly, like, we&#8217;re finally on the same is. This is great. And I made a joke to the entire organization there that Shelley had done a colonoscopy level review of our technology. So to the credit of the NHL, sometimes not jumping in on the hype, but really kind of stepping back and saying, what can we learn? How do we do it? Right. We&#8217;re advocates for the fans, right. And it doesn&#8217;t sort of feel like something that&#8217;s not authentic and a little bit of a cash grab. And I think that&#8217;s really part of what attracted them to our technology. Right? We&#8217;re all about fan first gamification, creating new experiences for hockey fans in a way that&#8217;s never been done before. And my gut is if they had just done a knee jerk jump in, they could have some issues right now in terms of how things are structured right. As we&#8217;re seeing with some of the other platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, it&#8217;s very well said. And the biggest, and one of the parts I&#8217;d love for you to discuss on is the IP because that was at least back when I was having the conversations with them two years ago, almost three years ago now. Crazy to think it was really IP related was one of the biggest things. Because if you go on your guys website, well, NHL Breakaway, which obviously is in conjunction with you guys, you&#8217;re getting actual game clips owned by the NHL and the NHLPA. This isn&#8217;t like, oh, you&#8217;re pulling shit from YouTube that isn&#8217;t legal and that isn&#8217;t copyrighted and trademarked. You&#8217;re getting the creme de la creme, the real stuff. And that&#8217;s one of the biggest things where it&#8217;s like, how do we let the user have access to this NFT? What kind of things can they do with it? Can they profit? Can they not? There&#8217;s tons of stipulations. I&#8217;d love if you could walk us through some of the conversations that you had with the NHL, the NHLPA, all the directors, the owners of the teams, because they just must have some bananas questions, especially under the assumption that not a whole lot of them fully understand what NFTs are.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Yeah, no, I think that&#8217;s right. I think, number one, it starts with the content, right? At the end of the day, content is king. And users want. They want to collect and have in their possession some of the best plays that they&#8217;ve either remembered, have a visceral experience at a game with, or just sort of represent the game in a really unique way. And we really went deep on the content and it&#8217;s complicated. As you know, there&#8217;s lots of parties involved. You got the alumni, you got the PA, you&#8217;ve got the league, you&#8217;ve got things know, audio in the right, you&#8217;ve got plays being called and we had a couple sort of core tenets that we knew we would not launch without Solomon. Number one was having some sort of audio experience. I&#8217;ve told this story before. I quickly told again, you may have heard it, but there&#8217;s a funny story that George Lucas had told, and I read it in a magazine. The first screening of Star Wars had no background audio. It was just like the narrative script. And it was like crickets in the theater. We all know what happened. The audio came in, did the second screening. People were crying, cheering. And so we knew that without the audio, it would be a very sort of like, mundane and maybe uninspiring experience.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Such a good point.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Put in the cycles and to the credit of the right and the PA and the alumni, we really put in the cycles to say, okay, we&#8217;re committed to getting a visceral audio experience here. And when you see some of the highlights that we curate and we put into this program, you get angles that you&#8217;ve never seen before because we&#8217;re kind of pulling all kinds of footage. We&#8217;re kind of cutting it up in really creative waves. And the sounds of the gate, the ice, the skates, like your hair stands up on the back of your neck when you see this stuff. Right. And then even going deeper on how we curate. So one of the biggest problems I have in sort of like Web3 or the NFT world is like a false narrative around rarity, right? It&#8217;s like, oh, let&#8217;s put a willy Wonka collectible or highlight in this particular. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s a generous series or release, but it&#8217;s got no meaning other than the fact that there&#8217;s just a few of them. Right? So how do you curate things and make sure that there&#8217;s a calibration with the actual meaning to the game, right? So things like really understanding the impact that the moment has or the highlight has. How did it affect the game? How did it affect the series? How did it affect the particular team, right? And making sure that that&#8217;s aligned with the rarity. And it&#8217;s aligned with kind of like the number that are created. And fans really appreciate that because I have to tell you, nobody knows their sport more than hockey fans. Right? They are just really into it and they know every significance of every play and what it means. And if you can calibrate that well and really kind of like, stick to that narrative of, okay, this is a particular highlight that meant this. And here&#8217;s how it should sort of score in the broader ecosystem. That&#8217;s a very important part of what we do and what we do with the NHL every single day.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love the point you just brought up, Tom. How the heck do you guys do that? And again, you guys have done an incredible job so far. But what happens when we start going back to some of the crazy highlights, like the team Mussolini breaking the rookie goal record, chucking the glove in the air and shooting it? Or Sid&#8217;s first goal, or Gretzky&#8217;s point record, or OV&#8217;s on the ground behind the back stick goal. How do you decide how many of these are we going to put out? How do you decide what angles to use? Walk me through that workflow behind the scenes with you and the team, the NHL, the NHLPA. How do you guys make it from idea to execution?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s a great question. And the idea of leveling up every possible aspect of the platform is something that our team is extremely committed to. And content was no different. So we&#8217;re going to get into a little bit later how the platform itself is just a completely different approach to collectibles. But if you just stay on the content theme, leveling it up and creating a really powerful, visceral experience takes a lot of operational work. Okay. Number one, it&#8217;s with knowledge, right? Who&#8217;s better at helping curate and think through sets? We have a phenomenal product team that really know the sport extremely well. And so it starts with, okay, what are things that we want to collect, have our fans collect. How do we put them into thematic sets? How do you match those thematic sets to what the NHL wants to talk about for the next year? Right? What are key events that are happening with the teams? Right? And so all that kind of goes into the sort of the ingredients that we start to mix and then some themes start to emerge. And then from there there&#8217;s a very specific and detailed operational workflow that we have with the league where we curate. We pick things that we think are going to be really sought after and interesting from a collector&#8217;s perspective, making sure that there&#8217;s relevance to the overall sport. It then goes to the NHL. They sort of at a very high level, approve it, then they have to pull the clips. They have to pull all the different angles of those clips. And the league has built a team really just for NHL Breakaway to do that at a very high level. And there&#8217;s some back and forth. Right? Sometimes we unfortunately have to throw a play on the floor. It&#8217;s like, okay, we can&#8217;t use this one. That audio, there&#8217;s something in the background, whatever it might be, that we can&#8217;t clear. But for the most part, I think we get about 95%, 96% clearance rate on everything that we want. And then it&#8217;s like, okay, what are the different angles? How do you highlight the play? How do you show the goal in a way that&#8217;s never been seen before? Right? And so then we do the cutting up and then the audio kind of stays in there. Audio is tricky because sometimes it&#8217;s multi tracked. If it&#8217;s a newer game or a newer play, like in a recent season, there&#8217;s different audio channels that we can pull from. No problem. Like, shut that channel off, boost this channel up. Historic stuff. It&#8217;s a little bit more complicated right?A lot of thought and detail and hard work goes into that. But we are like a well oiled machine, right? In the ways that we get content selected. NHL sort of approves, comes back. The PA gets involved in that chain. Right? And also the alumni, to the extent there&#8217;s a historic player, and then eventually it comes to our production team. And I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve opened some of these packs. The pack itself is an incredible experience. Right? How you open the pack. We came up with this concept of a double reveal. So you don&#8217;t just like, yeah, block of ice, and see what you got? No, you break open the block of ice and then you see these cool circulating pucks. And those pucks give you a little hint. This could be something rare. And then you do a reveal of each puck. But then once you do that reveal, even the operational and production work that has gone into that, it opens up like a sandwich. And you see the name of the player, the game that you&#8217;re about to see, and then it kind of morphs into the actual play. And so really committed to making that a very important and fun part of the experience. Because ultimately that&#8217;s what&#8217;s in your wallet, right? That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re collecting. So a lot of work. Hopefully I&#8217;ve given you a little flavor of the amount of work that goes into it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Quick question on the rarity point, because this is something that, again, whenever I&#8217;m doing prep for a show, I obviously lurk Twitter. It&#8217;s just sort of the HQ of anything crypto related. People are always asking, what&#8217;s the algorithm behind the rarity? I guess I&#8217;d love to throw that question, throw that ball in your court. And I&#8217;m sure you can&#8217;t give me the whole sauce, but give me as much as you can. How does the algo for the rarity come to play?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Yeah, that&#8217;s a good. And we can just back up for 1 second. I&#8217;ll tell you one thing that we are really committed to as a company is not moving the goal post, right. For our collectors and for the NHL fans that have come. You know, as a product guy, I&#8217;m a product minded CEO, right? I love real products. The number one thing you do before you launch anything is you talk to the customers, right? You get feedback you want to understand. And you&#8217;ll notice we launched with a founding fan cohort, right? A group of passionate users who can help think through and steer and have a sense of ownership of what breakout ultimately was to become. Right? And one of the things that we heard consistently that was a big frustration point was the moving of the goalpost, right? So it&#8217;s like, cool. I collected this two years ago. It was a core. And core at that point in time meant this. But because the program got a lot of users or for whatever reason, or maybe somebody got greedy, right. Core now means this. And we are committed. Like we call the covenant with the fans and the covenant with the collectors that you can be assured if you go to our site right now, go to nhlbreakaway.com, scroll down, look at the counts on each rarity tier that that will never be compromised. And that is the number one thing that a fan should know, right.? That you can count on. Core being core. We&#8217;re not going to say, hey, now we can mint next year 20,000 core highlights for a given edition. We&#8217;re just not getting into that. And that was a very big frustration point that we heard with the users that we talked to that had gotten involved in other programs. So that&#8217;s like the macro level, right? As we zoom in now, what we do is we really look at what is the significance of the actual play, right? And where does that slot into that rarity matrix? Okay, so a rare highlight on NHL Breakaway is truly a rare highlight in the significance of the game, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Doesn&#8217;t grow on trees. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
So that could be someone&#8217;s first goal. Right? An epic highlight is an epic milestone. Right? So what is something that a player did that broke a record? Right? And so all that gets calibrated and it&#8217;s very important because that&#8217;s the integrity of keeping what you&#8217;re collecting sort of in alignment with what you remember about the sport. And that&#8217;s what I was talking about earlier that I don&#8217;t like what I see sometimes. And a lot of this happens, by the way, more in non officially licensed collectibles, right? Where it&#8217;s like, cool, let&#8217;s make up a cartoon character. Let&#8217;s come up with a story, right? Let&#8217;s come up with long term narrative. And then we&#8217;re going to call these guys rare or we&#8217;re going to call these guys epic just because that&#8217;s the trait we picked. So we&#8217;re not doing that here. An epic highlight on NHL Breakaway is an epic play, right? And it has epic significance in the sport of hockey. And fans really appreciate that. And particularly, like when you get to the actual hockey fan, okay, there&#8217;s Web3 collectors. There&#8217;s all kinds of people that get into these programs, but the hockey fan really appreciates it because they&#8217;re like, yeah, this is what epic should be and this is what it should be. So that&#8217;s our philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Another thing I&#8217;d love to get into is the future of NHL Breakaway. The future utility. One of the biggest differences between traditional sports collectibles like cards and the futuristic present day sort of collectibles, digital collectibles, more specifically ones built on the blockchain. The immutability, the potentiality for different types of future utility, which really does move the needle. It makes it very sexy, it makes it just fun. And it allows you to dream, which is very, almost rare and candidly sort of impossible for traditional collectible methods like figures or cards. If you have a Babe Ruth rookie card, sweet, you&#8217;re sitting on a couple mil, but you can&#8217;t really do a whole lot with it. Maybe you can take out a loan, you can show it off, put it in a museum, but you can&#8217;t really do a whole lot. With NHL Breakaway you have incredible clips that can definitely be used for a lot of different things. What do you guys have cooking up right now? And what are you going to allow fans to do in the future for ones they own? Ones they don&#8217;t own. What kind of alpha can you give us here, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
The reason I entered this space was really seeing the value that digital can bring to the memorabilia and collectible world. Right? Things like number know. You can argue that it&#8217;s easier to track authenticity. We&#8217;ve all purchased memorabilia from, I don&#8217;t know, Steiner sports or something like that. Comes with a little hologram. Is it the real know? I hope so. I hope somebody did their job right? But the idea that you can use the blockchain to tie prominence back to, okay, this is actually issued by the National Hockey League, right? That&#8217;s one and I&#8217;ll get into the future stuff. But just to kind of hit on some of the reasons why I&#8217;m so passionate about this space storage issues, I mentioned talking to the users before we launched. Another big theme that we heard was, a lot of these other platforms, even in the digital world, don&#8217;t give the utility of display, right? They don&#8217;t make that an easy thing to do. And the one quote that I remember that stuck with me, one gentleman said, I feel like the things that I own are locked in a digital box in the equivalent of my digital attic. No one knows I own any stuff. And one gentleman said he got an infinite objects frame and put one of his highlights on his desk. And he was like, he was a guidance counselor at a school. And everybody came in and was like, this is the coolest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. What is this? How do I get into it? So leaning into the fact that they&#8217;re digital, you could have virtual trophy cases displayed, right? How many calls have we been on where people have loaded their back wall, all their favorite stuff, right? Signed jerseys, memorabilia from the sports world. But you&#8217;re limited in real estate, right? And so we&#8217;re doing a lot on virtual trophy cases. Virtual display, the ability that you could say, hey, I&#8217;m the biggest and baddest collector. I love this team. I love goalies. I love saves. And you can share that with the world, right? That really breaks open the point you were making, some of the limitations that you have with physical collectibles, which is really cool. So we&#8217;re a big fan of it. And then the idea that you can kind of create consumer touch points in a much cleaner way, you don&#8217;t have to go to the comic book convention, maybe those are fun, right? So I&#8217;m not knocking that, but the idea is that we can meet up and we can do a trade, right? So sweets invested in technology that really kind of, I think, pushes the boundaries of what you can do with this stuff. And I&#8217;m going to get into specifics with breakaway, but I&#8217;ll just back up for 1 second. When this whole world was really hot a few years ago, and it was like Saturday Night lives doing skits on NFTs, right? Do you remember the day you woke up and every single contact you had on LinkedIn was now like a Web3 NFT expert? It&#8217;s like, okay, I&#8217;ve known that guy for a long time. I didn&#8217;t think he was in Web3, he was an NFT guy, right? But that whole wave hit, okay? And everybody was super enthusiastic about it and everybody was building marketplaces. Drops in marketplace drops in marketplace. We said, okay, let&#8217;s resist that temptation and let&#8217;s invest in technology. That sort of breaks down some of the core fundamental barriers of mass adoption. For example, easy onboarding, a simple wallet. Many people don&#8217;t know this, but we launched with Burger King very early on in this world, right? An NFT collection experience on the side of mailboxes, 6 million mailboxes with QR codes gamified, putting completion sets. People were winning like whoppers for a year. Mailbox, scan XQR and get a digital game piece, right? How cool is that? No one thought that could be done. And if you google that, the press was all over it. They&#8217;re like, oh, my gosh, here&#8217;s a brand finally thinking where this could go, right? Not like, hey, let&#8217;s just do a drop for an auction on a marketplace. So that&#8217;s where Sweet really kind of, I think, steered right. Whenever we&#8217;re steering left, we&#8217;re like, let&#8217;s invest. Let&#8217;s build broad scale technology. How do you engage millions of fans? How do you create incredible campaigns? We did another program with Dave and busters. I don&#8217;t know if you know that store. It&#8217;s a restaurant arcade where you can literally go to the win counter with your ticket and get a collectible, like a digital collectible. No one thought that could be done either. Right? And so these are the things that I really like about the technology. And frankly, this is what attracted the NHL. The Sweet was that we were saying, okay, how do you engage millions and millions of users into this ecosystem? How do you create really fun experiences? So some of the things you&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;ve done on breakaway was leaning into the public display. Everyone has a public profile, right? We&#8217;ve got some really cool things that are going to be developed around that already in the works. Leaning into a trading system. We launched before the marketplace, we launched the ability to trade with other users. So I can get my Conor McDavid and say, okay, I&#8217;m going to put this out on the trading block and I want a very specific highlight back, this specific number that&#8217;ll go to a single user. Hey, Matt, you got a trade request. Cool. I got to go in, wake up in the morning, have my bowl of corn checks go through my trades, make decisions, or I can put a broadcast trade up. Hey, I want to try to complete this set or complete this game with an NHL Breakaway. I don&#8217;t really care which edition number I get back. I just want to get all the highlights that I need to complete the set that was launched with glowing reviews. I&#8217;m going to see if I can find a here&#8217;s a tweet. This is very recent too, right? Probably the most fun I&#8217;ve had in the space so far. Today was nostalgic, like trading hockey cards at recess stove for NHL Breakaway in the community to be one of the first to complete the space. Let&#8217;s talk about the fact that you complete the space set. So these are the things that we like, right? How do you bring users in? Create a better experience for hockey fans, make it social, where they&#8217;re connecting with like minded fans and creating ways that they can do more with their collectibles versus holding them in a digital box in their digital wallet. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re all about. And the future is super bright for this space, right? We&#8217;re seeing numbers as high as like $50 to $60 billion collectibles market cap by 2032 in just the sports vertical, right? So you&#8217;re going to see a big shift from physical to digital and it&#8217;s being driven by these types of programs and this type of technology.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. It&#8217;s no different than really anything else present day. I mean, this world, every single day, every single minute becomes more and more digitally versed. And it&#8217;s just part of the process that our old school physical collectibles, like cards and figurines or whatever you want to call it, is now being held online. And like you said, it makes it more fun. Kids nowadays, it&#8217;s not like when you and I were at school and we&#8217;re slaying hockey cards and playing games in the schoolyard now. Everyone&#8217;s little kids are on their phone. They&#8217;re playing Fortnite, they&#8217;re playing Roblox, right? They&#8217;re playing Minecraft. So can&#8217;t wait for the future of this. But before we get into the next part here, Tom, we got to give a huge shout out to response to the show PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to keep buzzing on the future of sports collectibles and why digital collectibles will bring Web3 mainstream huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends and longtime sponsors of the Cryptonews Podcast.

Now back to the show with Tom. Tom, let&#8217;s keep buzzing on the future of sports collectibles right now. What do you see the future of this whole scenario looking like? And as sort of a segue into that question, I&#8217;d love if you could tie in the sort of big two platforms that are out right now. There&#8217;s not a doubt that you guys are going to catch them. But right now you have Topshot, which is the NBA, and you have Sorare, both of them are a little bit different. So rare is more sort of fantasy style where there are only, and this is for European football, soccer for us North Americans. Sorare is fantasy style where there&#8217;s only so many Erling Hollands, so many Messi&#8217;s, so many Ronaldo&#8217;s, so many know player, XYZ, whatever you name it, the better the player, the more expensive it is. And you actually get paid out in ETH every single week. Super cool concept. Then you have NBA Topshot. We all know what NBA Topshot is, and we have now learned what NHL Breakaway is. But how do you see the future of sports collectibles as a whole and how it&#8217;s going to help bring the masses into Web3 mainstream?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Yeah, sure. It&#8217;s a very big question, right? And I think it starts with some high level fundamentals. And one thing that I&#8217;ll say that many of my team members have heard me saying is we have to stop talking in the form of the tech itself. Right? We don&#8217;t talk about email like SMTP. We don&#8217;t talk about file transfer, FTP. I was never a fan of this big NFT narrative and explosion, right? Not only did you see a lot of companies that were sort of like just trying to jump on the bandwagon with really kind of like a hollow strategy. I made the joke about like half of LinkedIn became NFT and web experts all the time. It&#8217;s just the technology, right? And I think there&#8217;s also a big confusion point around the way blockchain works. And how that&#8217;s sort of like tied to cryptocurrency. We are not a cryptocurrency company. Blockchain technology is just a database technology that allows you, as the consumer, to have a lot of comfort in the fact that what you collected, the providence back to the leads, like, literally issued by the NHL and the PA and the alumni or whoever&#8217;s involved. Right? Number two allows you to know that it&#8217;s real and authentic. Right? And allows you to really kind of, in a transparent way, understand how many of them are out there in the world. Right? And so blockchain technology is a wonderful technology to sort of usher in the digital collectibles opportunity, particularly in sports. And I think just too many people talk about NFTs. They talk about crypto as it relates to it, or they talk about how are we going to bring more people into Web3. Right? I don&#8217;t even like that narrative. I know that might surprise you. Here&#8217;s a good example.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, I agree with you there, and that&#8217;s on me. It was a poorly framed question, and I apologize for that. I think the better question is, how are we going to get more people to use Web3 tech? And it&#8217;s exactly what you and the team are doing, which is Web2 platforms built on Web3 tech. You sign up on NHL Breakaway, you barely even know you&#8217;re getting a wallet. Besides the fact that we tell you that it is immutable and that your collectible is transparently present and shown on the blockchain, otherwise, you don&#8217;t even friggin know. This is just a beautiful Web2 platform in your eyes. That&#8217;s the kind of shit we need.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
I wasn&#8217;t trying to knock the way you phrased the question. I&#8217;m just saying it more holistically. Right? Like, I see some of the coolest, even CEOs and other people saying, like, hey, our platform is ushering in the next wave of consumers into Web3. What about flipping that? What if Web3 was so compelling, right? And the product itself was so interesting and fun for consumers that&#8217;s why they were moving in. And it&#8217;s not necessarily like, I picture a world where eventually the web is Web3, right? We&#8217;re not talking about anymore. And the example I&#8217;d like to give is, do you remember a few years ago, AWS went down in a very big way, and excuse me if I get some of these companies wrong, but when AWS went down, Netflix was down, Twitter down. It was like, oh, my gosh, the entire world is powered by AWS. How many people do you know that talked about AWS? Prior to that, it was just sort of powering the infrastructure. That&#8217;s where the blockchain needs to get. Web3 has all the things that consumers want, right? But it just needs to be ubiquitous and programs just need to build on it. But ultimately, it&#8217;s got to be the consumer experience. If the consumer experience is there, they&#8217;re going to stick around and they&#8217;re going to have a great time, right? And if the Web3 component is powering it, then all the things that give them comfort, transparency, control of their own data, all that stuff that we all want as consumers will come along for the ride, right? If you will. So anyway, to me, that&#8217;s the future. Like this ubiquitous kind of blockchain driven environment.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I completely agree with you, and I love the AWS antidote. I would literally bet the whole frigging house and some that if you asked 100 random people in any city, maybe with the exception of San Fran, and you said, hey, do you know what AWS is on the side of the street? I guarantee you 95% of them could not even tell you what it stands for, and it powers 95% of the apps they use. So I love the point you brought up there.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Cool. So I think all of these core tenets of ownership, really, truly having something that is yours, it&#8217;s not tied to a platform. You delete your account and all your stuff&#8217;s gone, right? Everyone uses, like the Fortnite skin example. My kids have spent an obscene amount of money on Fortnite skins. What happens if you delete the accounts are gone, right? So all that stuff, I think, is super powerful as like a core tenant giving power back to the consumers and their data, not having sort of a big brother company, sort of controlling what they can and cannot have access to. So all that&#8217;s got to be there. But our vision is creating deeper consumer experiences. And the other quick point I&#8217;ll say is I&#8217;ve seen so many companies almost, like, rely too much on the tech, but sort of phone it in on the fundamentals. If it&#8217;s not fun, if it&#8217;s not sticky, if you don&#8217;t want to call your friend and say you need to create an NHL Breakaway account, because it&#8217;s just sort of like a niche kind of little program, there&#8217;s something like, not happening and you can&#8217;t just say, hey, it&#8217;s got these core components, therefore you&#8217;re going to love it. The reality is consumers love it. Because it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s engaging, it&#8217;s social, it&#8217;s gamified. They can unlock value, right? All that stuff has to be part of the program. I don&#8217;t care how cool the tech is. And I think if we learned anything from Minecraft back in the day, I&#8217;ll never forget the first time my kids showed me Minecraft, right? And you can mocked me for this. I was like, this is ridiculous. They&#8217;re blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I said the same thing. I was like, this is trash.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
You&#8217;re playing with gigantic pixels this big. They&#8217;re blocks. But here&#8217;s what Minecraft got right. It was social, it was fun, it was creative, right? And it didn&#8217;t matter that your character looked like a blob because they got all the other things right. And that&#8217;s what we want to do. We want to get all those things right and create this really fun consumer experience. Leaning into fandom, not leaving out the hockey fan, making sure it&#8217;s engaging, doing things like trading, doing things like gifting, doing things like dynamic quests, right, where we can say, we know who you are as a collector. So we&#8217;re going to give you a fun challenge that is matched to you versus a one size fits all. Number one, you&#8217;re going to get a much higher take rate. Number two, you&#8217;re going to be more motivated. Because it&#8217;s tied to the things that you like. Number three, the reward that you&#8217;re going to get for completion is going to be thematically tied to what you&#8217;re into. Right? So that&#8217;s the engine that we&#8217;ve invested in that makes us very different as a platform. And I think it&#8217;s ultimately things like that and it&#8217;s thinking like that that will continue to grow like these types of communities.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Tom, you&#8217;re on a roll. Unfortunately, we are getting tight for time here. I wish we had more time because I feel like you and I could be buzzing on this for a hot minute. But we will have to have you on for round two very shortly. Just a very quickly conclude, walk me through just a couple of the features on NHL Breakaway, the trade lounge, the freezing packs, I know you discussed those, but anything coming out in the near future that you can drop on the Cryptonews pod before we let you go today?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Yeah, sure. So obviously you&#8217;ve seen second completion trade lounge. You&#8217;ve seen things like gifting, you&#8217;ve seen broadcast trades, pinpoint trades, or like addition for addition trades. I&#8217;ll tell you the next big thing. That&#8217;s imminent is the marketplace, which you&#8217;re going to find really interesting. So that&#8217;s coming very soon for fence. So the ability for the first time to sell, to keep a balance within the ecosystem that can be used across the ecosystem. And then you&#8217;re going to see a lot more details coming out on all those core features over the next like call it 30 to 60 days. So lots coming. I wish I could share more, but I think you&#8217;re going to find it extremely compelling when it launches.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love it. Tom, thanks again for coming on. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you? NHL Breakaway and Sweet online and on socials.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Mizzone</strong><br />
Sure. So Sweet is just sweet.io and you&#8217;ll see all the social links on the bottom. Most of them are @sweet. Then we&#8217;ve got nhlbreakaway.com, which is the main sort of entry point into the NHL system. It&#8217;s a common login, by the way. So the Sweet account spans all the ecosystems that we power and then all the socials are on the bottom there as well. We&#8217;ve got discord, very vibrant community. Love our founding fans and the community on Discord give us so much valuable information. Super passionate, but yeah, we&#8217;d love for you guys to jump in and see what this is all about.</p>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, it&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab, still coming in hot from the one and only Mexico, and I am a little more pumped than usual for today&#8217;s pod. I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to meet this lad in person. We have the one and only, and we&#8217;ll get to him in a second. We have the shortest man on Crypto Twitter on the show today. The king of retail trading. You might know him as the Sultan of Solana or the Chief BONK Officer. His takes are hot, and he brings the thunder, but when he parties, he&#8217;s a one beard wonder, a professional degen who pulls straight tens. Without further ado, I am very pleased to welcome the king of Crypto Twitter, Zion, aka Zee, aka Ansem, aka B-L-K-NOIZ, to the Cryptonews Podcast Zee. Welcome to the show, my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
What&#8217;s good, brody? How you doing, man? Thanks for having me on.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you, man. It was a treat meeting you back in, what was that, end of July, early August of this year at Blockchain Futurist in Toronto. Shout out Tracy La Perulo and the whole Untraceable Team. That was a banger of a conference. And I feel like one of the things you always get when people meet you in person is your height. I obviously, I just knew you from Crypto Twitter. I just knew, you know, thankfully making me some bags shout out to you, and then I meet you in person. I&#8217;m like, damn, this guy&#8217;s tall. What&#8217;s it like when people one recognize you on the streets and be like, yo, are you Ansem? Are you B-L-K-NOIZ? And what are some of the few first things they comment on every time they see you?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah, every time. They&#8217;re like, dude, you&#8217;re tall. I didn&#8217;t know you was tall. I knew you were tall, but I know you were this tall. That happens every single time. But it&#8217;s been funny, man, the past, I guess, two years now. My account before the last bull run was only, like, 3K. 3 or 5K followers. So I really didn&#8217;t have that much. But I was always posting crypto shit. And then I did well that cycle, and a lot of people that tailed me on some trades, just like, I kept getting more and more followers. And then 2022 is when I went to actually, it was the Avalanche conference. I was like, 100K followers. I was like, fuck it. I got to go somewhere. I got to go on vacation. I&#8217;ve been trading nonstop for, like, twelve months. Fucking I&#8217;m going to go to the Barcelona for the Avax conference. And that was the first time where anybody in person recognized me from Twitter and was like, you&#8217;re Ansem. I was like, this shit is weird. I&#8217;m walking around the conference and people are coming up to me like, yo, can I take a picture with you? Like, yo, you&#8217;re answering. Yo, you made me so much money. Like, yo, what&#8217;s good? So that caught me off guard. I didn&#8217;t expect that to happen. It never really translates in your head how much having followers online can actually be real people in real life. That was the first time. At that point, I was really caught off guard. But since then it&#8217;s been pretty cool. It&#8217;s getting more and more frequent now. I don&#8217;t know, because I&#8217;ve just been active on Twitter so people see my face and my abbey a lot more. You&#8217;re tall and they&#8217;re like, dude, okay, I made money off this. And they&#8217;re like, what&#8217;s the next coin to buy? What do I buy next?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Of course, everyone wants you to pad their bags. Did twelve year old Zee in? I guess you would have been grade six or grade seven, dunking on kids in the schoolyard, flirting with little young girls. Did you ever think that you&#8217;d be, one Twitter famous and two have the ability to literally move markets? That&#8217;s got to be something wild that you can tweet out a coin and after you make a tweet, the price rises. That&#8217;s got to be some crazy shit right there.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
I never even thought about trading, really. When I was younger, I was always good at math and science. That was what I was good at in school growing up. And I was like, I&#8217;m going to do engineering. So I did engineering for college. I went to Georgia Tech and I started studying computer science, but I didn&#8217;t really learn about crypto until senior year. That&#8217;s why I learned about Bitcoin. And then when I graduated is when I picked up trading. Yeah, dude, like that cycle. So a lot of people do post their public ideas on Twitter, and a lot of people do, like the blogs and everything. It&#8217;s typically the VC guys, though, that are writing all their on the market. So they&#8217;re writing out their thesis and it&#8217;s like what they think about this? What do you think about that? What they think is going to happen for the next year. But it&#8217;s not really that often that you have just like regular retail people writing out coherent long pieces on the market. And I started doing that in late 2021 because I had my trade journal, which is consumpt and it only had like 100 or so followers on there. And I was tweeting out all my trades. It was just my journal. I was like, what I&#8217;m looking at this month, what my core bags are, what I&#8217;m looking at for the next month. What did I fuck up on? What did I do wrong? What did I do right? And I would just do it every week. And a lot of people were like, yo, you need to share this with more people. This is really helping me trade. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re claiming to be right all the time, but your thought process is helping me grow as a trader. So when I was doing that, was it late 2021? That&#8217;s why I started writing Substack. Somebody was like, dude, make a blog. Like write a longer form blog.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Those were fire when those first came out. It was easy because when a lot of the VCs write their thesis, it&#8217;s long, it&#8217;s a lot of big paragraphs. Yours was like point form, almost like an elongated tweet. It was just like, it was a little bit more than a tweet. Very easily digestible.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah, because it was really an extension of my trade journal. And that was basically like point form, like a little bit of theses, but it was in tweet format, so it was easy for people to read before. And I was like, let me just make this a little bit longer. But yeah, so I shared it on consumpt and then somebody reposted it on their public Twitter and was like, yo, z just posted this on his trade journal. People read this, it blew up a ton. I was like, fuck it, I&#8217;ll just repost it for my main account. I don&#8217;t know how many followers I had then wasn&#8217;t at 100K yet, but I just reposted on Main and was like, got a ton of engagement. My substack went crazy, so I was like, fucking, I guess I got to keep going. I mean after that I wrote some more and I had some VC guys that I met just from Twitter and like, yeah, dude, our funds are reading what you write about the market. I never really expected it to happen. I was just sharing, really was just sharing my trade journal because I needed somewhere to put it. And I was like, if it&#8217;s online, I can look back at it and see where I fucked up at. And I still have that entire tweet thread. It&#8217;s like almost 18 months long where I was, like, every month. This is what I&#8217;m looking at. So that&#8217;s how that happened.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool to see, man. I mean, there&#8217;s so many different angles. We can take this. I think we have to go present day. Give the listeners some absolute gold here. And that is good old Solana. You have been pumping. The shadow is the wrong word, but I love on Twitter when people chirp you and they&#8217;re like, oh, SOL&#8217;s rising. And now, you know, telling no. When I met you for the first time in the summer, when I was like, yo, dude, pleasure to meet you. Thanks for making me a little coin. You&#8217;re in my city, right know. Let me take you out. Let me show you the good bars. We went to Paris, Texas, absolute talent factory for those in Toronto who know what I&#8217;m talking about, too. That&#8217;s when you first told me about Sol. Give us the TLDR on Sol. Why are you so bullish on it? Tell us about your thesis on it. And I&#8217;d love if you could sort of reiterate a couple of the things you told me back in late July, early August, when we first met.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah, man. So Solana has always been interesting to me, even when early last cycle. So I bought it super low. I think it was like a $1.50 or something. But the reason I was looking for that trade was because I missed the first chunk of DeFi Summer. So, like, early 2020, I was actually watching my daughter. She was, like, young, and I wasn&#8217;t really trading all that much early 2020. And then COVID happened, and I ended up. I was short Boeing into that COVID crash. Like, dude, if this shit spreads to New York. All the airlines are fucked like, I gotta get short is we&#8217;re, like, way ahead. So I made some money off that, and I was still on Crypto Twitter, but not, like, actively trading how I was. My first cycle started looking at stuff, and I started learning about DeFi Summer. I was, like, looking at the AAVE chart and I was like, what the fuck? How did I miss a fucking whatever it was 50X from the bottom, literally. Yeah. So I started trading on Uniswap. That was when Jeremy and crew trading. But, yeah, so trade on Uniswap. And I was like, that was when ETH gas fees started spiking. And I was like, how the fuck is anybody going to be able to trade on these markets if gas fees are this expensive for everybody? So in my head, I&#8217;m like, well, if these Alt L1 come up with some alternative where it&#8217;s like cheaper and faster people to trade, they&#8217;re going to fucking rip. So that&#8217;s when I found Solana, I found SBF, and I was like, well, this dude is backing this. And a ton of other people were smart on it was like, yeah, this is one of the options that could be differentiated from ETH. So that was the original thesis. It was just like something. Another L1 where Defi could be more performant. I read up on Anatoly. I was like, this dude, super smart, listened off his Podcast. His background is like an engineer at Qualcomm, I think it was. He was really good with distributed systems. I was reading up on him and so on. I was like, okay, this makes sense. So I bought it like a $1.50. I was like, whatever. And then it outperformed a ton of stuff in early 2021. And then basically for the rest of the year, it was just fucking ripping. It outperformed basically on every pullback. That and RUNE were ripping really hard, but it didn&#8217;t really have any apps on it. So back then there was just Raydium, and we had Solid the wallet and not really that many other applications. So NFTs didn&#8217;t pop off on Solana until late that year, and there weren&#8217;t really that many use cases where it made sense. It was proving what Solana was made for, why it was important. So that was back then. Tracked it from 150, like close to 200. Ended up selling it just based off of TA, somewhat close to the top, and just kept up to date with the entire ecosystem. So in late 2022 is when I went to breakpoint. And at breakpoint, I talked to a lot of the Solana founders and teams, and there was just a lot more activity in the ecosystem then than there was in early 2021. And I was like, well, if we have another cycle or next cycle, it&#8217;s probably going to be do way better than it did last cycle, because now there&#8217;s a lot more actual, real activity on chain. In 2021, they had some issues with congestion because it went down a few times because people were spamming the NFT mints when they happened, and there was no mechanism for guarding against that spam because every transaction was basically free. So after that happened, they had to make a few upgrades to the chain, and in mid 2022, they pushed those through, and that was like the priority fees. So that&#8217;s like, if you want to spam transactions on a hotspot of Solana&#8217;s state, you&#8217;re going to have to pay more to get your transactions through, which already exists on ETH by default. But the important thing on Solana is when that happens, it only happens in one area of the state. So the rest of applications on Solana aren&#8217;t affected because there&#8217;s paralyzed transactions instead of sequential transactions on Ethereum, you can have multiple things happening in parallel that aren&#8217;t touching the same area of Solana state. One of the reasons why it&#8217;s so much more performant than ETH. Yeah, generally, I was like, dude, there&#8217;s way more teams now. It&#8217;s the same thesis. They&#8217;ve upgraded the chain to get rid of some of the issues that they had prior to in 2021. And then it got crushed by FTX. It was at 38. I remember I was at Breakpoint, they announced their partnership with Google Cloud, and price was at like $38. Like $39. I was like, oh, yeah, this looks good. It&#8217;s about to break out. And then we get on a plan.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Sub ten, right?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Fucking FTX happened, and that shit SOLd off like 80% in a week. Went literally to $8. So after that happened, and then I was like, the recovery early that year, I was like, dude, this is way mispriced, because at breakpoint, nobody was talking about SBF, nobody cared about him. It was like, we are focused on building for the chain in the future. In crypto, nobody was really concerned with him. So I was like, this price dislocation is going to fix itself eventually whenever we have a bull market. So I was like, you have a combination of things where the sentiment was super low on the chain, but the progress that they&#8217;d made, technicals wise and also team wise, developer activity wise, were on the opposite side. So it was a combination of those two things. Why I thought it was like a really good trade. And then comparably, if you know what happened to DeFi Summer. I missed the first DeFi summer on ETH. I mean I still got the Uniswap airdrop because I was active enough, but I wasn&#8217;t early to, like, what was, like, the yield. Like, Wifi missed, like, that farming. Like, farming on compound. I miss.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, I missed all those too.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah, dude. Like, all those early protocols, I missed them. And I&#8217;m like, now we have on Solana all these DeFi teams that don&#8217;t have tokens. They&#8217;ve been building for the past year and a half. And very active in all the hackathons, active on Twitter, active at Breakpoint, talking to people. And I was like, well, if Solana is going to have a resurgence. I&#8217;m assuming all these DeFi teams are going to end up dropping tokens eventually, and they&#8217;re probably going to drop these tokens to all the people who have been like, die hard Solana community members the entire time. And using their protocols while everybody&#8217;s like, no, Solana is dead. So I&#8217;m like, this is obvious trade. Even if you&#8217;re sitting in Solana spot and I don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s going to take, I remember I was like, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to happen next year, six months, whatever, nine months. But in that time period, the longer that you&#8217;re farming all of these protocols, the longer that happens and nobody is paying attention. You&#8217;re so far ahead of everybody else. So if a DeFi summer happens on Solana, you&#8217;re going to fucking print.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Zee, let me jump in here. You got to give some gold to the listeners. So assume that Solana Summer is not over and you and I are in the same yacht here. I don&#8217;t think it is. We got a lot of people tuning in right now who follow you on Twitter, and they&#8217;re going to want to be like, yo, Zee, how can I actually make this happen? I&#8217;d love if you could give your workflow. We&#8217;ll use USA for an example. Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re talking about going USD, onboarding USD onto a tier one exchange like Coinbase, and then what are the best protocols, practices, exchanges, bridges, you name it. How would you tell people to go from USD to Sol to then farming on all of these different protocols, buying shit coins. Give us the workflow there.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Got you. Yeah. If you have USD. So if you have a Coinbase account or whatever other exchange that you&#8217;re on, you can buy Solana on there, and then you can set up either a Phantom Wallet or a Backpack wallet. Those are two of the main wallets on Solana. You&#8217;re going to have to write down, obviously, to write down your seed phrase. Make sure you store it somewhere or in multiple places, don&#8217;t lose that. And then you&#8217;ll get a public address with your Solana address. So you&#8217;re going to send your Solana from Coinbase to your wallet, and then once you have that, you can interact with all of the different protocols on Solana. So lending and borrowing, which is basically the equivalent of AAVE on ETH, is called marginfi. They&#8217;re currently doing a points program. It&#8217;s not confirmed whether they&#8217;ll have a token or not. But if they do, you probably will benefit from farming those points. One of the biggest liquid staking protocols, which is JTO SOL, just did their airdrop actually today. So people who farm that got a nice airdrop, it&#8217;s coming in. I think it was like close to like 1 billion FDV. So similar to Lido and flashbots on ETH, because they also do MEV. And then what else? Like Jupiter, that&#8217;s the main aggregator, so it aggregates, swaps across all the different Dexes on Solana, and they also just enabled perps. So that&#8217;s actually a pretty big one. I think Jupiter is going to be pretty significant. The first airdrop already got announced, but they&#8217;re going to do it in multiple rounds. So even if you miss the first one, you still have possibility to get the further ones. And that&#8217;s just from volume on Jupiter. The good thing about these Solana Airdrops is it doesn&#8217;t cost a lot to test out all these protocols because the chain is so cheap to use. I was trying to tell people all year, it&#8217;s just a time thing, really. If you have $100, you can&#8217;t do a ton of transactions on ETH when the chain is congested. Like right now, the chain is like $40 per swap on Uniswap. But on Solana, you can literally test out every single protocol on the chain, and all you need is time. You just have to be active and doing it before everybody else is so marginfi. Jupiter JTO just did theirs. PIF just did their airdrop. They&#8217;re like probably like the Oracle for SOL, comparable to chain link. A lot of the perp dex don&#8217;t have tokens yet also. So that&#8217;s like Drift protocol, Zeta markets. All of those also don&#8217;t have tokens. So if literally you&#8217;re just active on SOL like save like a $100, $50, maybe you put in JTO SOL, deposit that in marginfi. So now you&#8217;re getting points there. Other $50, maybe you&#8217;re trading on Drift Zeta, whatever else, it&#8217;s like the same thing, whether you have 100 or 1000 or 10,000, and you can spread across all those different protocols. And then there&#8217;s Camino, which is like yield farming with LP pools, and there&#8217;s also Meteora, which is similar like AMM and also like liquidity pools. So there&#8217;s a few different things you can do. I think the. Oh, okay, the Tensor is another good one. Tensor is the NFT exchange. So it&#8217;s like similar to BLUR on ETH, you can trade NFTs and they have these Tensorians, which is their NFT collection. You can stake them and get points and also trade on the exchange and get points. I think Tensor is actually going to be a pretty big one because BLUR is massive and they basically killed OpenSea. So if you assume that Tensor is also the number one NFT exchange on Solana, and you think Solana is going to do really well this cycle, then it&#8217;s like, OK, you&#8217;re mapping valuations between the biggest protocols on SOL and the biggest protocols on ETH, and what that&#8217;s going to look.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That was Alpha City there population us. Another thing we got to talk about on SOL is BONK. That has been insane. You called BONK a couple months ago. This has been absolute bananas. And again, folks, before we get into BONK, I&#8217;m just going to reiterate what Zee said here. Open up a Coinbase account, throw in some USD, open up a Phantom wallet. It&#8217;s similar to MetaMask. It&#8217;s a Chrome extension. It is the purple little ghost looking dude. Transfer your SOL to that. As Zee said, make sure you write down your seed phrase. Keep that in multiple places. Do not put that in your notes on your iPhone or anything else. Write that on paper. Maybe give it to one person you love and trust, and make sure you keep that very close to the heart and somewhere in some place that you trust. So that is realistically the workflow. And then check out the show notes and get on marginfi Jupiter, Drift, Zeta markets and everything else that Zee just mentioned. But let&#8217;s get into shitcoins here. How the hell did you find BONK? Was this just like a Twitter madness? Did you get tipped off? Give me the TLDR. What was the official story on BONK? And are you still bullish on it after it&#8217;s gone up like multiple thousand percent over the last couple of months?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s fucking ripping bro. BONK is a meme coin on Solana, like Doge is on ETH. But BONK is cool because it launched at the very pico lows of SOL. Like when SOL was around $10 or $8 or whatever it was. And it was Christmas of 2022. And some of the biggest guys on Solana, like developers, I don&#8217;t know if it was VCs. I think some VCs were involved. But basically a team of people on Solana launched a meme coin and they airdropped it to a lot of Solana developers, like active traders. So airdropped a good. A bit of the supply launched in December of 2022, and it fucking ripped. It went to like 400 mil, 500 mil, whatever market cap. And that was rare for Solana, but also rare because everybody thought Solana was dead at the time. So they launched BONK. And I was like, fuck. Okay, Alto and Solana aren&#8217;t fully dead, and that was December 2022. So this entire year, it&#8217;s basically been chopped down, basically sideways. But it&#8217;s the same thing that happens with Doge. So if you look at the Doge chart, it really only goes vertical for very short periods of time. And the rest of the time, it&#8217;s just chilling. But it&#8217;s like whenever retail comes back, or like, bull markets come back, people start buying Doge again. Like, oh, crypto is back. I&#8217;m going to buy Doge this cheapest coin I can get, whatever million of it, like, whatever. So doge always pumps before Altcoin cycles and last bull cycle, we had the same thing happen across all these different chains where it was like, there&#8217;s was a meme coin in every chain, just like there was a meme coin on the ETH. So last cycle was really, I think, the biggest one. We had DeFi, but then we also had this bridging meta where it was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to bridge this L1. I&#8217;m going to buy the dex, buy the meme coin, I&#8217;m going to buy whatever lending, borrowing protocol, and test everything out. So high risk, high reward type thing. But the meme coins are always funny because it&#8217;s kind of like representative of the culture of a chain similar to NFTs. People usually punt a small percentage of their core, whatever core, Ether core, whatever, SOL holdings into it. But it&#8217;s funny because this stuff can go vertical, as we saw with Doge last cycle. Nobody expected that shit to go to fucking 70 bill market cap or whatever ridiculous number it went to, but it did, because it was just like retail buying in crypto. So BONK started moving right after SOL, I think, broke out.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, BONK started moving after you started tweeting about it. No one ever even heard of that. That was 100% you. No one ever even heard of BONK.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
That wasn&#8217;t me, man. I didn&#8217;t buy the bottom of BONK. I really didn&#8217;t, because I saw it moving and I knew what it was. I was focused on the SOL breakout. I&#8217;m like, okay, farming all these DeFi protocols. I know SOL. Eventually, when it breaks that whatever, 25, 27, whatever that level range high was, I knew it was going to fly and it broke out. And then I saw BONK moving. I was like, oh, shit. Well, I know it&#8217;s going to be the beta to Solana because there&#8217;s no other alts on the chain at that point. It was like, it was just BONK and maybe like, whatever, marinade a few other ones, like hero a few other Solana alts. But really it was just BONK. And I&#8217;m like, well, how are people going to get Beta to Sol? I know what happens with the meme coins. When people bridge over, they&#8217;ll buy Solana and I&#8217;m going to buy whatever the meme coin is. You can&#8217;t buy anything else. So I know it&#8217;s going to be reflexive in that way. And then you also have that pattern matching where people saw Doge and Shib go to whatever multibillion dollar. I think Shib went to 40 billion. So, yeah. I&#8217;m like, well, if people are bridging over to Sol, they&#8217;re going to be buying Bach. And it was already listed on some major exchanges, like Bybit. So that&#8217;s just like the general thesis. The meme coins is always pump on the chain. That gets more attention and activity. But I don&#8217;t know, I think it&#8217;s going to rally into the end of the year. It&#8217;s already up a ton. I got some of my voice to buy it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s up another ten ticks today, too.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Like 25% today. But, yeah, I think it&#8217;s going to go multibillion. What I think is going to happen is probably something similar to doge. So Doge went from like 700 mil to ten bill. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to go to ten bill, but then it went sideways for like, two, three months. And then in April it pumped again and had, like, a second wind rally when people thought it was done already. So I think, similarly, if you have Solana do really well, the cycle, it breaks all time high. Maybe bank tops out this month or in January, but it goes sideways and you still see Solana doing well. So activity increases whatever TVL increases. People start using these DeFi protocols who have tokens now, and you just get more influx of attention to the chain and BONK doesn&#8217;t die out. I don&#8217;t think it will. But you&#8217;ll probably get a second rally at some point. Next year is kind of what I&#8217;m thinking. But I&#8217;m thinking sometime towards the end of this year or January is when you rotate whatever ten X you&#8217;re up on BONK back in the Sol.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah. Chill it in SOL for a bit. I love that. Let&#8217;s jump into Cosmos. You also have a really good thesis on Cosmos. I mean, I got into Cosmos. ADAM also got into near shout out, near wearing the near shirt. Shout out. The near team. Got into both of those guys. I want to say mid to late 2021. I think I got in just a little bit before you started really tweeting about it as well. But I understand you&#8217;re still very bullish on both those. We&#8217;ve had some incredible guests on the show from the Cosmos ecosystem. A lot of room to grow there. Give us the $0.02, give us the elevator pitch on Cosmos and why it has so much room to grow and why it has such a high ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah. Cosmos is interesting because they are usually first to a lot of ideas in crypto, how to do thIngs. They&#8217;re the first to proof of stake before E switched to proof of stake. The general idea on having application specific. Well, they have application specific chains with their idea, but that idea where you&#8217;re separating execution into what specific things that you need to do, kind of similarly to how we&#8217;re now, Ethan is, like, on the roll up roadmap, we&#8217;re going to have to have certain roll ups that you want to do certain things on. So we&#8217;re not congesting the main chain. Cosmos is cool because they never get a lot of attention on the BD side of things. They really only care about the tech side of things. They build out things the right way. So, like, the Cosmos SDK, which is an SDK for making your own chain on app chain, it&#8217;s very customizable to whatever the tailor needs you need specifically for your chain. Like, say, is one of the newer Cosmos chains that launched, and they were able to implement parallelized transactions, as well as tweaking Cosmos consensus in a way that time to finality is a lot quicker than a lot of the other chains. But that&#8217;s like, one of the cooler projects. Say they&#8217;re trying to be similar with the speed and cheap fees as SOL is, and not like a purely EVM chain. But I think the biggest narrative for Cosmos this cycle is going to be the modular one. So Celestia, which is, like, one of the best projects that&#8217;s launched this year, has done well. It&#8217;s like a five X up from what it launched at, like two to ten. But they&#8217;re purely focused on being the first modular data availability layer. So when you have roll ups, you need to post your data to some chain, and then you need to settle your proofs on another chain or the same chain. So what? Celestia&#8217;s goal is to be the cheapest way to post that data for roll ups, and then you&#8217;ll settle on either ETh or another settlement layer. And the guy, whatever his name is, Adler, was the dude who wrote the first paper on optimistic roll ups, and he&#8217;s like one of the founders of Celestia. So him and Mustafa, super smart guys, but are trying to do things the right way in crypto technicals wise, while also being focused on what makes the most sense long term. Because I think with the modular thesis is the reason that ETH is pivoting to being, like, a settlement and DA layer is because you literally don&#8217;t have the option of doing everything on ETH main net. Like, it&#8217;s just not possible. You only do, like, ten to 13 TPS. So you have to use roll ups to push all the execution off chain. It&#8217;s the only way it&#8217;s going to survive long term. But if you were to design a system from the ground up, you would probably do it in a way similar to how celestial is designed, where you have one chain specifically focused on DA, one chain specifically focused on settlement, and then maybe you have different roll ups that have their own application specific needs, which is really how they&#8217;re thinking about things. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re going to have a ton of different roll ups. Some are generalizable, some are application specific, but they&#8217;re going to use Celestia for DA because it&#8217;s cheaper than what it currently is on ETH and other chains, and then that&#8217;s their go to market there. So I think Cosmos is in an interesting position because similarly to Solana, where the sentiment is super poor, but you have all this technical innovation happening underneath, behind the building. Right. Everybody&#8217;s constantly building. It&#8217;s similar in that way. And injective is another team that&#8217;s done really well this year. Actually been like, leading the market. But there&#8217;s a ton of different projects in the Cosmos ecosystem that just don&#8217;t get a lot of love because it&#8217;s very hard to rally people around an ecosystem when you don&#8217;t have one coin that&#8217;s representative of the entire thing. So the ETH community is super strong because it&#8217;s just we&#8217;re trying to drive as much value back to ETH as possible. It&#8217;s very simple thesis to get people all rallied around. But with Cosmos, it&#8217;s like, is it ADAM? Is it this other Cosmos chain.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And that&#8217;s one of your thesis you had a while ago, which was because Cosmos is so B2B focused. Right. It&#8217;s a lot of back end stuff that really moves the needle. It&#8217;s different where you got a lot of forward consumer facing products on ETH. And then furthermore, I believe you also said, don&#8217;t just throw De Niro&#8217;s, don&#8217;t just throw cake at ADAM, throw it at the things that are building with ADAM. And on the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Exactly. It&#8217;s very different from ETH where it&#8217;s like, if I&#8217;m bullish ETH and roll ups, I want to buy ETH, but ADAM is not. It&#8217;s not as simple as just buy ADAM. You get exposure to all the Cosmos ecosystem. There&#8217;s a ton of different teams over there building some cool stuff, like Sommelier. There&#8217;s another cool team. They&#8217;re kind of similar to yearn on ETH, where they have these different farming strategies for yield. And they&#8217;re also cross chain. So they have some strategies on ETH and some strategies, I think, in the Cosmos, but that&#8217;s another really smart team. There&#8217;s a ton of cool stuff happening in Cosmos. There&#8217;s a lot of chains that haven&#8217;t even launched yet that are still pre mainnet that are also coming out next year. And some of those will be interesting also. But it&#8217;s definitely an area where if you&#8217;re early to it and paying attention, it&#8217;s like one of those other spots where it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re ahead of everybody.</p>

How the heck do you look forward, whether it&#8217;s a three month, six month, twelve month cycle, give us some of your workflows. Give us some of the secret sauce here. You always talk about capital allocation and how people are always rotating bags. Different trends, different hypotheses. And again, you&#8217;ve obviously had many kicks at the can. You&#8217;ve put your 10,000 hours in. I mean, when I met you in person, you were telling me you&#8217;re like a friggin ten hour a day Twitter guy. You&#8217;re always on the loop, you&#8217;re always trading. You&#8217;ve had reps, you&#8217;ve been in the trenches. But how does one become a good trader? Learn how to develop these thesis and learn how to see forward looking trends.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s a combination of things. So first, for me, I&#8217;m a TA trader. Before anything else. Fundamentals are important, but the timing of everything is based on TA. So I&#8217;ll say, if you&#8217;re trying to learn technical analysis, I would probably start with that&#8217;s called technical analysis of financial markets by John J. Murphy. And it will cover all the basics you need to know. Just if you have no clue what TA is, just read that book, and then you&#8217;ll have a foundation to build everything else off of. And that&#8217;s like where you kind of start just with learning how to trade markets. And I&#8217;ll say from there, personally, I learned how to trade from Twitter. So when I was on Twitter back in 2017, I was following dudes like Kobe, like Loomdart, like Trader Mayne, like Bitcoin, Conan Corral, FS, Crypt, a ton of really good Twitter traders who were there and sharing how their thought process was for navigating crypto markets and how TA works. Some of the different strategies that they use there. I would say typically in crypto, you have really strong trends. So the way to capitalize on them is either by positioning before these trends happening or getting really good at identifying when the trend is about to shift from bear to bull or bull to bear, and you have consolidation and then you have impulsion. That&#8217;s the two things the markets do. So either they&#8217;re going sideways or they&#8217;re trending up or they&#8217;re trending down. Simplest thing you need to know about markets, they only do three things. So in bear markets, when everybody&#8217;s like screaming, oh, my God, crypto is going to zero, she&#8217;s down 90%. And that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re going to hear on the news. If you&#8217;re just a pure retail, have no idea what you&#8217;re doing trader. So doing those when the sentiment is really poor on crypto, that&#8217;s when you typically have the low volume periods, prices going sideways, and it&#8217;s just going to stay around the same prices for several months at a time. So with Bitcoin this past year, we were at what, like, I think 17K FTX, we did like 15K, but we&#8217;re trading in the range for several months. And if you have these ranges, you can kind of like bracket them. It&#8217;s the same thing on alts. You either want to be positioned when that range high breaks out and you want to already have been like dollar cost averaging in, or you want to be able to identify when that trend is going to shift. Typically, just TA wise why I tell people you try either dollar cost averaging in bear markets when stuff is down 80, 90%, or figure out have some signal for when the breakout is going to happen. But as far as capital allocation, it depends a little bit on what size kind of you&#8217;re moving. I would say if you&#8217;re super small size, you probably want to find some really high conviction plays and focus the majority of your portfolio in those, and then try and play a lot of different airdrops. So like I said, with Solana this year, people who played the JTO airdrop, even if they only had a few Solana right now, they&#8217;re getting over 5K just from the airdrop, which is crazy, but it was because there was not a ton of people focusing on using the protocol. And then it came out at a pretty decent valuation. Once people were like, oh, this is a good team on Solana, reflective of their importance to the chain. And you have a ton of that in crypto where it&#8217;s like farm these airdrops that a lot of people are not looking at all that VC Capital that these companies raise. Some of that&#8217;s going to go to the community, and you want to be a part of the community that&#8217;s getting that capital. So if you&#8217;re small size, I would say focus on whatever your highest conviction plays and then focus on airdrops. If you&#8217;re a slightly larger size, you kind of want to separate your portfolio into two different things. So you have your long term bags. For me, that&#8217;s stuff like Solana, Coinbase, stock, Bitcoin, like I like prime, parallel the game, and just like keep 70% of your portfolio in those. So that I&#8217;m trying to buy the bottom and I&#8217;m not really trying to trade in month to month in between, and I&#8217;m trying to sell when I think the cycle is close to ending and try and scale out that way. And that&#8217;s like portfolio you keep whatever in your hardware wallet. Don&#8217;t really touch it. Keep in a separate place. And then with 30% of your portfolio, you can do all the degen shit. So it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m trying to hit every rotation. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m aping micro caps on this chain. I&#8217;m farming whatever you&#8217;re doing, your perps, whatever, all that shit. So it&#8217;s like 30% of your portfolio. That&#8217;s the part where you&#8217;re more active and searching for whatever, the flavor of the month type shit. So when we had the AI pump earlier this year, I did not see any of that coming at all. Like, dude, I saw chat GPT drop, and I was like, damn, that&#8217;s kind of cool. But everybody else in crypto was like, now we&#8217;re buying AI coins. So it&#8217;s like stuff like, like, what&#8217;s another one? Like OLAS, like an AGIX. A ton of these altcoins that were just tangentially related to AI went fucking like 5X plus. And you always want to have some of your portfolio either in cash or like, if it&#8217;s in cash ETH, SOL, whatever. But you want to have some part of your portfolio that&#8217;s like your ape stack. So it&#8217;s like, whatever, ready, deploy new. That pops up, and it&#8217;s like, yeah, I&#8217;m ready. All right, I got this. I already got this money set aside. I&#8217;m not thinking like, oh, shit, I got to sell some of this. Should I sell this? Because a lot of times when you&#8217;re in those positions, if you can move like that extremely fast before everybody else, you&#8217;re going to make way more than people. So if you have a portion of your whatever portfolio set aside to do stuff like that, it&#8217;s like, really advantageous. And also in bull markets, you&#8217;ll have these leverage wipeouts because everybody who didn&#8217;t buy the bottom is like, damn, I only got $500. I&#8217;m going to use 20X leverage, middle of a trend, and then a ton of people do that. Oh, it&#8217;s working. Stuff&#8217;s going up. And then you&#8217;ll get a flash crash of like 20%, 30%, wipe out all the longs. And if you&#8217;re one of the people who has capital aside, you&#8217;re like, oh, now I can get my entry into something. Yeah, you look for those, like, 20%, 30% dips. As far as strategies for doing that, honestly, last cycle I did a lot of it just on my own, really. So as I said before, I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m on Twitter online all the time. I have lists of all these different ecosystems, like devs traders, that I look at pretty frequently. So I&#8217;m pretty in tune with everything that&#8217;s going on in crypto on a day to day basis. And then what I try to do is journal my thoughts a lot. So I tweeted this, I think, yesterday, but I was like, you should have a list of alts for all the different sectors in crypto. And then you should have a general idea of what are the most popular alts out of those different sectors. So it&#8217;s like, okay, nobody&#8217;s talking about L2s right now, but I know ARB, Base, whatever other L2s, I know what they are. So it&#8217;s like, when I think attention is about to shift back to L2s, I&#8217;m like, okay, I can just buy these. Instead of having to think through, like, damn, what do I buy? L2s are pumping. Then you got to go look and do research on all the L2s. But if you already have that and you&#8217;re already taking notes on those different sectors and what fundamental catalysts they have coming up, you&#8217;re more ready to shift your capital around. So I think that&#8217;s generally how I like operating crypto. It&#8217;s also good to have a small group of friends that you can bounce stuff off of and really easy to find them on Twitter, even if you don&#8217;t know anybody. Just, like, be a reply guy. If you don&#8217;t know anybody in Crypto Twitter during bull markets, you can make a lot of friends simply by being a reply guy, because all the interactions happen under a lot of the bigger guys posts. And that used to be me. I would comment on people&#8217;s stuff, like, start talking to people. And that&#8217;s how I got into some group chats, just from sharing ideas. And people used to see things the same way I was seeing them. And I see that a lot with people who comment under my tweets. I&#8217;m like, oh, this dude knew what he was talking about. The last time he commented, he commented this time he knows what he&#8217;s talking about. This time he knows what he&#8217;s talking about. Let me follow this guy back. Let&#8217;s see what he says. Yeah, so it&#8217;s like in crypto, you can build your reputation really easily by just interacting with people and sharing your ideas in a way that&#8217;s not really possible in a lot of different areas, just generally in life, because you can become an expert on crypto with no background knowledge of anything else. Just by studying markets and how these cycles work, because it&#8217;s such a new asset class.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. That was a little master class. Thank you for that. We are getting a little tight for time. A couple more questions. The Coinbase thesis, I love this. Obviously, this is not an investing advice Podcast. Mind you, Zee has dropped some absolute fire. But I do have to say that I do own Coinbase as well. And guys, before I ask Zee this question, if you guys want exposure and you don&#8217;t want to open up a crypto wallet, you don&#8217;t want to open up a Coinbase account, but you own a bank account or you have a trading account, whatever the case may be, Robinhood, whatever. You can get exposure to crypto in a tax free way. And you can buy Coinbase stock, which I and Zee&#8217;s believes that there is still a lot of room for growth. Or you can buy any of the Bitcoin mining stocks. You have your Marathon, you have your Hut 8, you have Michael Saylor, the sickest puppy in all of crypto, just stacking Bitcoin with microstrategy. There&#8217;s tons of ways to do this. Zee, what are some of your favorites here if people want exposure to crypto without actually buying crypto?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah,  Coinbase is, I think, far and away the easiest bet that you can make in traditional markets if you&#8217;re trying to bet on crypto. And it&#8217;s funny because I think this is what a lot of the boomers are going to do. They&#8217;re like, I don&#8217;t want to buy. I don&#8217;t want to buy crypto. I don&#8217;t want to have to think through all these different altcoins, go to CoinGecko, and it&#8217;s like a list of 100 alts. If you don&#8217;t know crypto, you&#8217;re like, how am I supposed to know which one to buy? People telling you to buy, like Cardano and all this random shit. So I think a lot of the people who already have stocks, already have their fidelity. They got real estate, got gold, got all that shit. They&#8217;re like, oh, I want to get exposure to crypto. Coinbase is the obviously biggest company in the US to get exposure to crypto. Like, they&#8217;re the biggest retail trading venue. They&#8217;re probably going to be the custodian for these Bitcoin ETFs to get approved next year. They also do like, they have Coinbase Ventures, they have cloud. Like, they&#8217;re pretty active in a lot of different parts of the crypto ecosystem. And really, I think it&#8217;s the left curve, like, oh, I want to get exposure to crypto. I&#8217;m going to buy Coinbase. And they&#8217;ve also never had a bull market, which is a really big thing for me. It&#8217;s like the chart has been down since their IPO. So when you have those situations where it&#8217;s like the general consensus is that, oh, this stock has been down, only crypto is dead. FTX just happened. Whatever, SBF blew up the industry, this isn&#8217;t coming back and it&#8217;s just down and it goes sideways. And then when it starts going up again, you have a ton of people who are like, oh, maybe I&#8217;m wrong. I need to get exposure to this. And I think that&#8217;s going to happen a lot next year. If the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF goes through, which is likely to happen, all these people who thought crypto was dead are going to be like, okay, how do I get exposure to crypto? And Coinbase is going to be one of the easiest ways, I think. But also, miners are interesting, the companies who mine Bitcoin. And the reason they&#8217;re interesting this cycle is because a lot of the discourse around Bitcoin&#8217;s block space the past few years, it&#8217;s been concerning because there&#8217;s not a ton of activity with transaction volume, and miners get paid, the more activity that&#8217;s going on on chain. So this year we&#8217;ve had Ordinals. And Ordinals are like when people are, they call them inscriptions, but they&#8217;re basically similar to NFTs, but they&#8217;re directly inscribed with the number Satoshi in each block on Bitcoin. So that&#8217;s been a ton of a huge increase in activity that people are paying transaction fees on Bitcoin this year. And I know for a fact none of these TradFi analysts expected that to happen and are pricing that into any of their models for how much money these Bitcoin miners are going to be making. Because every time the halving happens, Bitcoin miners are going to make more money because the emissions are less than they were previously. So if you have that counterbalanced by all this Ordinals activity, it&#8217;s going to be like, wait. The whole pricing situation for these companies changes, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s priced in. So stuff like, what&#8217;s one like CLSK.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Marathon, Hut 8.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Mara, Riot, those different miners could also do well. And it&#8217;s probably another way people are going to get exposure without having to buy crypto directly.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And it&#8217;s tax free. That&#8217;s like a huge, you throw that in your IRA, your Roth account for us Canadians, TFSA, the home run as well, RSP, you name it. So, Ansem, you&#8217;ve absolutely crushed this, man. Last question, and I know that you tweeted this out a couple of days ago. This episode is going to air on Monday the 11th, and we are getting close to that. But Monday the 12th, Monday the 11th, you and DFK, that was one of your biggest takes back in the day, baby bro. JEWEL, that was one of your big takes. I remember the heydays. I would wake up in the morning, literally before I would take a pee or wash my face or even do anything. I would whip open the phone and I would check the price, and I&#8217;d be like, I just made $500 today. I was making $500 a day doing nothing. You were probably making like 5K a day. You&#8217;re back on it. Do we have room to grow here? Is it going to get back to the highs? And, folks, the listeners at home, if you&#8217;ve seen the chart, it literally ripped, came all the way down, and it has been sideways until this guy tweeted about it two days ago. And we got legs again, last take, and then we&#8217;re off the pod. What&#8217;s happening with JEWEL?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
So, bro, I used to love JEWEL. So, DeFi Kingdoms was one of my favorite trades last cycle, bro, because it launched in, it was August or September of 2021. And at the time, I was one of the guys bridging to every single chain. I was bridging, literally, AVAx, whatever, Harmony, Solana, any chain that had new stuff launching on it. I was there like one of the first people there that was like the meta, like, bridge to whatever. L1, test out all the new shit, be the first one there. And DFK was the first Dex that had fucking music in a game. And I was like, what the fuck? I&#8217;m testing out all think every other Dex is a Uniswap fork. Every single other decks, like, pure Uniswap fork. Same UI, same whatever. I&#8217;m like, okay, fuck it. I&#8217;ll buy the Dex coin, buy the chain coin. And then I bridge to Harmony, and I&#8217;m looking at DFK, and I&#8217;m reading through the docs, and there&#8217;s whatever, all the different hero types, all the different classes, the different skills that they do. And I used to be a big World of Warcraft guy. Like, Back in the day, I played World of Warcraft. I played League of Legends. I was a computer nerd. I used to play all the video games, and I never found anything crypto that was like, damn. I would play this, I would look at this, and I&#8217;m reading through the docs. I&#8217;m like, this is something that is at least is different from everything else that exists in crypto. And people laughed at me a lot back when I said it. I was like, dude, in my head. But that was the first thing that happened in my head. I was like, World of Warcraft, the different heroes, different classes, different skills, because I used to have whatever, herbalism, blacksmithing or the other, tailoring all that shit in World of Warcraft. I&#8217;m like, dude, this is the same shit. This is my NFT. So I was hyped. I was like, dude, I threw some extra cash at it. And the way the unlocked schedule worked, it was like a ton of it is locked on the back end. But if you throw money in the LPs early, your APR is extremely high. And I&#8217;m like, okay, well, it&#8217;s going to be locked for a while, but they&#8217;re incentivizing users in a really good way. So I&#8217;m like, if people are going to bridge over to here, and then it&#8217;s like, the game is decent, this is going to rip. So I minted the Gen Zeros when they dropped. I was like one of the first people in all the LP pools. I shared it in a discord. I still have the screenshot of it. I was like, bro, I just found the craziest APR on this game on Harmony. And people were like, fucking Harmony? Nobody&#8217;s going to fucking Harmony. Nobody&#8217;s bringing the Harmony. And then it was right around the time the market also topped. So it happened in September. I was farming it all September, October, and then in November, I was like, damn, market looks like it&#8217;s topping. So I started telling people like, yo, I&#8217;m going in the stables. I&#8217;m going cash. I think markets top, but I&#8217;m looking at DFK, and it doesn&#8217;t trade on any centralized exchanges. It&#8217;s purely on a Dex, and I&#8217;m still farming it, and I&#8217;m still playing with all these fucking heroes that I&#8217;m buying and fucking summoning new heroes, like, whatever, level them up and shit. So I was like, I&#8217;m just going to play DFK because there&#8217;s purely trading on a Dex. There&#8217;s no perps or anything. It&#8217;s a new launch. So if attention keeps increasing and going in that direction, the coin can keep going up even while other stuff is going down because it&#8217;s still small. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s not that big of a market cap. And that was my whole thesis for why I thought it was going to continue to do well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
What about present day? Do we got some legs on this or what?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah. Okay, so back then, it was super inflationary. Inflation was extremely high. The APR was how they incentivized all the LPs. And that&#8217;s one of the reason that it crashed so hard, is because it was super inflationary, and it also went straight up. So it was like a parabola breaking, plus all the inflationary rewards hitting at the same time. People took profit a lot. So right now, JEWEL is on. It&#8217;s not on Harmony anymore. It&#8217;s on Clayton, which is the main chain, and then it&#8217;s also on an AVAX subnet. So there&#8217;s two different realms and there&#8217;s three tokens, but JEWEL is no longer inflationary. They burned all the locked JEWEL, like most of it, and converted that into Crystal and Jade, and then that&#8217;s unlocking now. But JEWEL is purely deflationary. So you spend it in game. It&#8217;s the gas token on the AVAX subnet, its own subnet, and basically you need to spend it to do a lot of the things in game. So now it&#8217;s deflationary, whereas before it was inflationary. And they also have implemented all the combat systems, the PvP, PvE, all of that that didn&#8217;t exist back in the early stage of the game. They&#8217;ve been building it out this entire time. So now you actually have a game that people can play rather than just summoning heroes and doing the quest. It&#8217;s actually like PvP versus other people, and you have a deflationary coin instead of inflationary. So, dude, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to go back to all time high, but there is absolutely no way I wasn&#8217;t at least getting some of it just because of how much I was on it early on.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
I think it&#8217;s a decent spot. It just broke out. It just broke out of its range. It&#8217;s been sideways for like a year.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I got to go check it out. I haven&#8217;t checked since. I want to say, god, probably April or March of 2022. Like, legit. I haven&#8217;t checked in a hot minute. Zee on fire. Really appreciate your time, dude. This has been an absolute treat. One last question before you go. When my dolphins and your Eagles meet in the Super bowl, and we absolutely trounce you guys, Tua throws for 550. Tyreek has 220 yards. Mostert is running all over you. How are you going to feel? How shitty are you going to feel?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Bro we got to go to the game. We should go to Vegas, dude. It&#8217;s in Vegas this year.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, you guys might be there. I&#8217;m not going to be there. I can&#8217;t see the fins getting through. Our defense is too weak. I don&#8217;t think we have the legs. I don&#8217;t know if we can beat the Chiefs in our conference. Really, my only worry is the Chiefs. I don&#8217;t think we got to worry about anybody else but you guys. You got a couple of wagons in that conference. San Fran just beat you like they smacked us, bro.</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Smacked us.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That was bad. You were at that game too, right?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
I was at the game. I was mad as fuck.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Give me last question prediction. You guys going to win it or what? Who&#8217;s going to win the Super Bowl?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Eagles, bro. I think it&#8217;s going to be okay. Eagles. Eagles 49 ers in the NFC Championship. I think the Cowboys are going to lose first round Eagles in the Super Bowl. I think we&#8217;re going to play the Ravens.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Lamar?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Eh, Ravens.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love it. Appreciate you, bro. Great Pod. Really appreciate this and hopefully we&#8217;ll have you on for round two in the near future. Before you go, even though everyone already knows, but you got to plug yourself. Where can our listeners find you on Twitter?</p>
<p><strong>Zion Ansem</strong><br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m @blknoiz06 on Twitter and then my other account is @conzimp that&#8217;s me on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Love it. Folks what an episode. The one and only Zion aka Ansem aka B-L-K-NOIZ coming on the show, dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center. Super pumped to have him on and always appreciate his time. Folks if you guys enjoyed this one and hope you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I speaking to the team.

<h2>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h2>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always, still in Mexico. What a treat, very grateful. Coming in hot, Matt Zahab your host here as always, super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show, also coming in hot from one of the best countries on the planet, and that is, Le France, coming in hot, absolutely love it. Today we have Avril Spaydh Dutheil, a core contributor of Neutron and an experienced digital specialist with a background in marketing, community management, digital services and infrastructure with a longstanding interest in computing systems and privacy. He started his crypto journey way back in the day when he purchased Bitcoin in his high school cafeteria and went on to work for industry big name including P2P and Lido Finance, growing communities and leading strategic business initiatives. He&#8217;s now focused on supporting the Cosmos ecosystem, which I absolutely love, ushering in secure cross-chain DeFi and creating the next gen of blockchain tech. Super pumped to have you on Spaydh. Welcome to the show, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
Thank you very much for having me. It&#8217;s a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pump to have you on. Let&#8217;s go way back in the day here. You have worked for some incredible companies But before we get into that, we got to talk about your Bitcoin inception story I absolutely love this. You were at a high school caf. You bought Bitcoin I mean, this is not a kid friendly pod. You can be honest where you try to buy some weed, rebind drugs. What was going on there? What was your Bitcoin inception story? Give it to us straight up.</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
I wasn&#8217;t even that entertaining to be fair. I guess, especially during my youth, I tended to be somebody that easily opinionated about things. And around the time of the Snowden Revelations and everything, I had grown a sort of distress of the banking system. Although it wasn&#8217;t really relevant to me to be fair, I had like maybe 50 bucks a month to play around with. But yeah, around that time, I discovered Bitcoin was a thing. And so like went through the white paper and kind of like just found it fascinating. Also probably at the time understood like maybe, you know, 50% of it. But still, I was like, oh, banking system transfer value, but without banks. That&#8217;s exactly what I wanted in the world. So I started basically putting my like 50 bucks a month in Bitcoin. And I think the first app I ever had was like the Coinbase kind of like mobile app at the time. So I would just log into there from my school because there was Wi-Fi there. And I used to live in the countryside where the internet was really shite. And so, you know, that allowed me to connect, drop my 50 bucks in, feel good about myself. And then obviously, I completely care for fault the entire cycle. So I still hold these bitcoins to this day because I never, like by the time I was in the mental model of like selling them and taking profit, they were Down really badly. So, you know, a lot of learning experiences there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Hey, I&#8217;m the exact same as you. I have never sold. So not a big trader. Just, you know, if you believe in something, hold it long term. The rest will take care of itself. But I absolutely love that. Before we get into, obviously, everything Neutron and Cosmos related, what else about crypto really got you going? You said it was sort of unbanking yourself rather, which is huge. But you got in at a young age, which is pretty uncommon. Most people don&#8217;t get in that young, right? A lot of people who got in are much older than us and were much more mature than us, had more experience than us, and then got in at a later age. You got in how young. Was there any other reasons just beside sort of, you know, the peer to peer ability to transact actual value, to participate in a decentralized economy, Bitcoin as a whole? What else got you going about crypto?</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, I think the technology itself was really interesting, right? It was complex. I don&#8217;t think I fully grasp exactly how it worked at the time, but it was kind of like an interactual challenge, which is a piece of actually this industry that has been one of the most attractive aspects to it ever. Like to my personality type, I like a good challenge basically, and I like having to sort of like work to understand how something works, which is certainly a challenge for general adoption. But like to me, it was a motivating factor of like, this looks interesting. And I have to put in some effort to actually crack it DAOn. So there was this like this element of like, hey, transfer the value without banks, that was kind of like the initial thing. And then when Ethereum kind of like came around, or at least I picked up on it, that kind of like blew my mind because now it was, hey, let&#8217;s do what Bitcoin did to transfer the value, but now let&#8217;s apply this to anything you can put on a computer, which is, you know, a good chunk of our modern life. And so, you know, this combination of like, sending a piece of technology, which I was very fond of, like I was building computers and such for myself, like just to be gaming, basically. I was like looking into how the technology worked. And there was this kind of like, philosophical, political, kind of like complex that was also appealing. So it was kind of like a really good combo for me to get, I guess, interested in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So cool. And then present day, you are a core contributor at Neutron. This is a good opportunity to introduce Neutron and we&#8217;ll get into the nitty-gritty. But before we do that, give us the TLDR, give us the elevator pitch. What exactly is Neutron and what are you and the team working on there?</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure. So Neutron is a smart contract platform that has a few crucial differences from any other platform. The first one is that, like, first it&#8217;s highly secure for a technology called replicated security, which allows it to actually be one of the first blockchains to be secured by restaking. But more importantly, it&#8217;s a blockchain that allows you to develop smart contracts that you can deploy once and three Neutrons cross infrastructure expand across, you know, 50 plus blockchains today to onboard users and provide them a seamless experience, but also to expand the reach of your protocol so that it can grow to its full potential without having to maintain multiple instances. And finally, it&#8217;s a blockchain that sort of like leverages Cosmos&#8217;s unique value proposition of being able to customize really deep into the blockchain and make that available to application builders to build better applications that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to build anywhere else like on Ethereum or other shared environments, essentially. So to recap, Neutron is a highly secure, cross-chain smart contracting platform that makes application specific infrastructure available to developers so that they can build better products and onboard users from anywhere, basically.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very interesting. And to my knowledge, it&#8217;s all about sort of broadening liquidity choices, improving DeFi infrastructure. And like you said, and the reason why you guys choose to build on and with Cosmos is to offer developers greater flexibility. We&#8217;ve heard it so many times in crypto, whether it&#8217;s Twitter, other podcasts, my podcast, whatever the case may be, but without more use cases, we&#8217;re hooped. And the way to get use cases is to bring devs in. You need really smart guys and gals to come in and build really cool shit on Web3 Tech in order for the masses, you know, the everyday Joe&#8217;s and Josephine&#8217;s to start actually using crypto and Web3. And that&#8217;s what you guys are doing. And we&#8217;d love to see that.</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
I actually have a bit of a counter take here. So I agree with most of the conclusions here. There&#8217;s just one difference that would make regarding Cosmos and what we actually need to progress. This is largely inspired by Simon Warda from Confio. He makes a really good point, which is that we always say we need more devs, but especially in Cosmos and Cosmosm, we actually have a lot of devs. There&#8217;s enough talent here to actually build a number of really great applications. One of the things that we&#8217;re missing and that&#8217;s bottles that are necking us is not just the devs, it&#8217;s the entrepreneurs that have a product vision, that have an application that can lead these devs to actually ship products that are meaningfully differentiated, that solve real problems, that will onboard these people. There&#8217;s a separation of concerns here. There&#8217;s a lot of people who can write really good code, and sure, Blockchain technology is a bit more obscure. I guess it does take some onboarding, but if you have a really good team, you have a very strong vision and you just need somebody to write the code, you&#8217;ll find that person with some efforts, because there is a lot of talent actually. I agree with most of the conclusions, but there&#8217;s also a thing that it&#8217;s not just devs, actually, it&#8217;s also entrepreneurs themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. That&#8217;s going right in the show notes. And honestly, that&#8217;s the first time we&#8217;ve heard that on the show. So you think there&#8217;s an entrepreneur shortage over a dev shortage? Any specific areas of sort of Web3 that you think are really lacking? If you were to put yourself in these Steve Jobs and the Elon Musk and the Bill Gates Grade A entrepreneur boots, what areas of crypto would you be attacking so these really talented devs can work some magic and ship some really good products?</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
I mean, if I had 15 great ideas, I would probably be building them somehow. I mean, I don&#8217;t have to depend with, but I think there&#8217;s a bunch of stuff. I think what we&#8217;re seeing is that there&#8217;s definitely demand for something that combines elements of DeFi, or say, gambling, depending on where in the spectrum these are, and social interactions. FriendTech and such demonstrated this, but I don&#8217;t think anybody has actually produced something that was sustainable. I think there is a very wide unexplored area of using blockchain technologies to effectively replace governments to enable essentially like various forms of democracy and social organizations that are more decentralized. If you look at ant colonies, they have this ability to coordinate at the very low level between themselves without having necessarily this very vertical hierarchy that we have. Potentially, we can get closer to a model like this using these technologies. So I think that&#8217;s an interesting application. But what I mean is that there&#8217;s a lot of very far-fetched things that we could be doing with this technology. But whether or not there is something that can be venture-backed, for example, is a big question. Not everything is necessarily something that we make money. And so getting the funding to build these things can be harder. On the flip side, though, with all of the DeFi rails that we&#8217;ve built, we actually have what it takes to actually build pretty good funding systems. And so combining these things together, we could have a really good gambling ecosystem and a really good DeFi ecosystem, potentially something that could take over some of the functions that are currently handled by the traditional financial system, but also provide other services to humanity. But I think that&#8217;s more of a long-term thing, to be fair. I think the one thing that has product market fed right now is DeFi. DeFi is what crypto does best because it&#8217;s high value and it&#8217;s coordination between a number of actors that don&#8217;t necessarily know each other. And so it does so by removing trusts. All of these properties are basically ideal for this use case.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Let&#8217;s jump back into Cosmos for a sec. And again, you guys are building on the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos last year, the Terra collapse left a massive liquidity vacuum and burned a massive user race in Cosmos. I want to say end of 2021, early 2022, the Cosmos sort of narrative was one of the hottest narratives in all of crypto. I know tons of people, myself included, who sort of aped into ATOM. And then obviously it fell off a cliff. Does it really so? You&#8217;ve got to do your research beforehand. And again, c&#8217;est la vie could have happened to anyone else. But what can the Cosmos ecosystem do to really get to that next level? It&#8217;s just like you talked about about five minutes ago. There&#8217;s so many talented devs. There&#8217;s so many incredibly smart and talented and driven and hardworking people in the ecosystem. But it still seems like there&#8217;s not really any sort of front of mind consumer friendly product that we could use every single day. What&#8217;s the issue there? And how can this be fixed?</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s a fundamental question. So my assessment of the ecosystem is that the Cosmos is well in advance when it comes to technology. Like the infrastructure that exists in Cosmos in terms of how easily it allows you to do things you wouldn&#8217;t be able to do anywhere else is just unmatched. The tech is here. Now, on the technical side, the only thing that&#8217;s missing or not fully there is tying these components well together so that it all fits nicely into a product. That has been, I think, one of the challenges whereby the IBC on its own is awesome, Cosmos is awesome, Cosmosm is awesome, but tying these up together so that there&#8217;s no UX issues, for example, or such has been a challenge, although it&#8217;s getting a lot better. I&#8217;m really not concerned about the tech. What I think we&#8217;ve sort of lacked in the ecosystem is distribution. We have really good applications that benefit from this very good tech, but we have lacked a few elements to really get these kind of like flagship applications that just like boom and achieve really large scale. I think one of them is applications in Cosmos have a bit of a disadvantage to start with because of a lower discoverability. Since this stack is different from like EVM and such, a lot of the most visible, most used kind of like resources to search for opportunities. Either don&#8217;t support Cosmos or take longer to integrate. And so it requires more effort comparatively to get like the same, you know, in front of the same number of eyes, essentially. That&#8217;s one. So like discoverability. The second is onboarding, right? Like once you know that there&#8217;s an opportunity, you need to be able to get there and use it, right? And I think this is probably one of the most like in one of the areas where there has been the most pain in the ecosystem whereby until a couple of months ago, the experience was you would have to bridge funds, it would be slow, it would be costly, you would have to DAOnload a new wallet, create a seed phrase, save it on a piece of paper somewhere. Then you would have to sort of like bridge into one chain. Like after bridging to Cosmos, you would have to bridge to another chain, swap and then bridge to the chain you wanted to use and search. And so this kind of like sequence of action was one, not super intuitive and was a lot longer than what you would have on just like a shared environment, like just Ethereum, right? Or by you would have other constraints like gas fees and such. But at least you would understand how to do it. And the reality is that like IBC was very difficult to use to a number of people. Now that has improved tremendously, there are solutions that calculate all of the routes for you. So that is essentially one transaction you get from point A to wherever you want to go in just one transaction. Like all of this has gone a long way, but there&#8217;s still more that we can do. Like for example, we still need like different wallets to use Cosmos today than we would on other ecosystems. The bridging to the ecosystem, like inside of the ecosystem, bridging is largely sells like IBC is like probably one of the most secure bridging frameworks. And it&#8217;s built such that you can really use it as an, like you can abstract a lot of that. These operations away from the user. And so like now we&#8217;re seeing this sort of like manifests itself. But there&#8217;s still like a lot of work to be done on bridging into the ecosystem or into applications ready, because that&#8217;s what should matter. Like what I think is the future is you shouldn&#8217;t even know that like, well, I mean, you should know if you want to, but you shouldn&#8217;t have to care that you&#8217;re bridging. Because instead of like looking for networks and then applications on these networks, you should look for applications like what am I trying to do, right? I have an objective as a user. I want this objective to be met. Where is the, what is the best place to do that? Right? If I want to get exposure to X token, the only thing I should care about is like, Hey, where can I do that? And so I shouldn&#8217;t have to like think about, okay, so I&#8217;ll have the sequence of like bridging to X chain and then this other and then doing the swap and then bridging to another. No, like there&#8217;s this app. I have fun somewhere. I connected the app. The app does all of the heavy lifting of bringing the funds like processing the swap and then returning me what I actually go.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
So it&#8217;s gotta be clean.</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
Yeah, exactly. So that&#8217;s that&#8217;s one of our big focus. So, you know, we said like discoverability was an issue. The second one was sort of like onboarding friction. And the third one, I think is Cosmos has a stack that is unique because it allows you to build something that you couldn&#8217;t build elsewhere. But the problem is that we haven&#8217;t had that many teams. Like certainly there are, right? Like dYdX is probably one of the latest teams to actually do so, right? To leverage this unique tech to build a unique product. It&#8217;s, you know, one of the most performant perps out there and it relies on purely decentralized infrastructure. There&#8217;s no centralize sequencer anymore, which is, you know, technical achievement and a product achievement as well. But, you know, beyond dYdX and a few others, it&#8217;s not really like every application in Cosmos is that meaningfully differentiated for applications you would find on other ecosystems. And I think that&#8217;s something that as an ecosystem, we need to realize that our strength is building things others just can&#8217;t build. Right? It&#8217;s not just, you know, marginal improvements, right? Because marginal improvements won&#8217;t motivate radical changes in behavior, right? If you have two Dexes, one is on Ethereum and you can just click and use it. And the other one requires you to bridge and whatever. the other Dex want to be meaningfully better for you to actually jump to that product essentially. And so as an ecosystem, we need to focus on like really differentiated product. And so this is kind of like these three things are kind of like, I think the three fundamental problems that we&#8217;re laser focused on solving essentially for Neutron, but also for the ecosystem as a whole right now. And to be fair, to developers outside of solving for Neutron and the ecosystem, but also really to solve for like developers in the industry as a whole. Like one of the, I think one of the stories that exemplifies this like the best is Neutron recently merged with another blockchain, acquired merged with it essentially. And that blockchain was developed by a very talented team called Duality, which actually started out in the Ethereum ecosystem. And they did a bunch of work around Uniswap and other kind of like leading protocols. And that experience has eventually led them to design sort of like a new generation of a Dex that is a hybrid between an order book and an AMM and has the best of both worlds essentially. But the problems that when trying to actually build it, they were, they started like facing the limitations of what you can do in the VM essentially. And trying to break free from these constraints is what led them to Cosmos and eventually to join Neutron. But I think this is like, this is the best example of like, if we&#8217;re successful with our mission, both Neutron and you know, Cosmos as a whole, what we&#8217;ll end up doing is like unleashing people who have a strong vision of something they want to build something doesn&#8217;t exist today that can&#8217;t be built and will enable them to actually bring it to the market. And I think that&#8217;s where we can probably bring the most value to the industry and perhaps the world as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Spaydh, you&#8217;re on a roll here, mate. We got to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor, of the show that is PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to dive a little bit more into the neutrality upgrade and we have some breaking news as this episode is going to air next week. And that is early December. And that is the strategic acquiring of 25% of Confio. Can&#8217;t wait to get into that as well. Until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime friends and sponsors of the cryptonews.com podcast. PrimeXBT offers a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. PrimeXBT is also offering innovative products and professional trading conditions to all customers and a huge exclusive promo code that is <strong>CRYPTONEWS50</strong> to take advantage of this offer and receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading accounts. Again, the promo code is CRYPTONEWS50 all one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with Spaydh. Let&#8217;s jump into the neutrality upgrade. You just spoke about the integration of duality and how that helps just sort of bolster and beef up the Cosmos ecosystem. How exactly does that improve the DeFi infrastructure? I tried to really understand this. I took a, not I wouldn&#8217;t say a deep dive, but sort of skimmed over some notes regarding this, couldn&#8217;t really get into it. I love if you could explain that. I&#8217;m sure the listeners are super curious as well in regards to how the integration of duality really helps improve DeFi infrastructure for the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
I think there&#8217;s a few aspects to it. The first one is it allows smart contract developers to leverage infrastructure that&#8217;s tremendously flexible and that is capable of doing things that wouldn&#8217;t be just natively possible as just a set of smart contract, because it can leverage the blockchain, like the metal essentially itself to essentially execute certain functions, provide better execution as a result and such. And so one, it&#8217;s a very strong, very flexible piece of infrastructure for any developers building or looking to leverage it. Two, it&#8217;s much better, much more expressive venue for traders and users to engage with because it allows you to have an actual order book, like limit orders, fill or kill, good and tell canceled and other functionalities that you would find on the sacks, but not really on a dex, customary. So it&#8217;s a better place to trade as well. And then from a more meta point of view, it&#8217;s a way to resolve competition within the ecosystem. So that instead of competing for shares of the same pie, we can essentially align the interests of everyone and allow everyone to benefit by basically aggregating order flow and liquidity, so supply and demand effectively into the same place so that instead of having fragmented strands of order flow, which then get re-rendered together by aggregators and routers like third party services who will take a fee for that service, you can essentially have this out the box so that the order flow just, as much healthy order flow basically gets in front of the applications and their LPs, e.g. their users, as possible without these commissions and such on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love it. And we just got some breaking news as well. Always love some breaking news on the Cryptonews Pod. You and the team strategically acquired 25% of Confio. Again, by the time this episode airs, the news will go out. I understand it&#8217;s currently under embargo, but no one else besides our incredible editor, Justas will have access to this and neither of us will be doing anything with this news. But nonetheless, you guys acquired 25% of Confio. Absolutely massive. This will increase performance security and integration to the Cosm-Wasm ecosystem. I&#8217;d love if you could give us the TLDR on why you acquired them and what this means for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
Yeah, sure. I mean, Confio is kind of like one of the most important companies in the entire ecosystem because they are building, they developed the, you know, one of the leading virtual machines. Last time I checked, it was the third largest VM by developers or by developer activity. I don&#8217;t remember exactly, but it&#8217;s a very significant piece of open source software that like more than 50 blockchains rely on today in production. And it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s like very critical to neutral itself, right? Because small contracts on neutral are run in Cosmosm. Just to unpack this a little bit more, it&#8217;s a virtual machine that functions on the principle of like Web Assembly, which is what browsers today use to run very complex, heavy in resources, pieces of software like games in browsers with a high degree of performance essentially. And you have the same properties for small contracts, you have a very high degree of performance, and you also have better security over other implementations. For example, like Cosmosm resists to most of the attack vectors that are commonly used against solidity-based applications, like range transparency is not an issue in Cosmosm, it&#8217;s not possible to have essentially. And so making sure that this very important piece of software is not just maintained, but really thrives and has the ability to pursue very strategic directions in its development so that it becomes the best version of itself and continues to do so and continues to be open source for the long term is like very important to us both because Neutron depends on it, but also because this is like a critical piece of the ecosystem and that since Neutron is a cross chain small contracting platform, a good chunk of its power is actually enabling users and applications to interact deeply with applications and users and user base that are on other networks to connect very directly with them. And so like Neutron strives when the ecosystem as a whole strives essentially, and so like the strategic investment was basically a step in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very true. Also appreciate the breaking news. Always love that on the pod. Spaydh, we are getting a little tight for time here mate. A couple more questions, and then we will wrap up. One of the things that you guys did a couple of months ago was the launch of wstETH. And this was back in September along with XLR and Wormhole. What exactly is wstETH?</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
I mean, so I think there was a couple of objectives that we wanted to meet with this initiative, which was like today is, you know, you could say almost the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. And for a good reason, it&#8217;s an asset that represents a, you know, long exposure, I guess, to one of the most important, largest networks in the industry. It&#8217;s yield bearing, it contributes to securing and decentralizing the validator set and stake of the Ethereum network. So you know, it&#8217;s a very appealing asset and it&#8217;s one that makes for a very good collateral as well. And so you, you know, you see today like 50% of AVIS, I don&#8217;t remember which version, but I think it was V2. CVL, when I checked like a couple of weeks ago, and so on the one hand, bringing this asset into Cosmos was important because there was strong demand locally for it. And because it&#8217;s an asset that would allow like more diversified treasuries and exposures for users. And on the Lido side, on the DAO side, there was this, like Lido has historically been fairly conservative when it comes to bridging. It&#8217;s, you know, the main bridges that it had were initially like bridges to Ethereum L2s, validating bridges. And so to like enable the DAO to accept bridging to other ecosystem were validating bridges were not available. The framework for doing so needed to be very robust, but at the same time, there was some pressure to do so because not dealing with the situation would have resulted in a situation where multiple different denominations would have been bridged to the ecosystem. And when compounded with IBC, e .g., you know, like even for example, like Axelar Bridge wrap stake ETH on Injective and Osmosis would not be the same token. Wormhole Bridge Axelar, like Wormhole Bridge wrap stake ETH bridge to Neutron or, you know, another chain would also not be fungible together. And so to avoid the situation and enable the bridge to eventually be updated, like continuously built into something that resembles the more long-term vision of the DAO when it comes to the control of its asset, basically to like a new solution was required. And so that&#8217;s why we moved into the direction of bridge aggregation. We&#8217;ve partnered with, like Lido has selected Neutron and Axelar as the initial bridge system, but the bridge is being developed into a bridge aggregation solution, which will rely on Axelar, Wormhole and potentially other bridges like CCIP or others in the future so that the asset is resistant to the failure of any given bridge provides like, you know, message passing so that a crushing governance and other things and, you know, is sort of like under the direct control of the DAO. Essentially, the DAO will own all of the bridges architecture, even though actual bridge providers are used as relayers, but it will as a result be able to control the asset that&#8217;s locked, that&#8217;s bridged away, recover it in case something goes wrong, but also update it and shape it over time as it sees fit rather than sort of being at the wings of like third-party providers essentially. And so this was kind of like a win-win situation whereby this allowed Cosmos to gain a very valuable asset that can serve as collateral, bolster the DeFi ecosystem, while also enabling to set sort of like a good precedent for what very robust and functional bridging to other like between ecosystems can look like in the absence of some things like some framework like IDC basically. So yeah, the idea was to really open this channel between Ethereum and the Cosmos ecosystem, bring assets and users closer there as well. And I think, you know, since September it has grown really nicely. I think that&#8217;s a trend that we&#8217;ll continue to see essentially.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s been very nice indeed. Spaydh, you&#8217;ve been on fire here mate. Last question and then we&#8217;ll wrap up. Give me some hot takes before we let you go today. Doesn&#8217;t have to be crypto related, can be health, wealth, happiness, AI, aliens, you name it, food, whatever. But give me a couple Spaydh hot takes before you let us go today.</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a hard one. Coming up with a hot take on the fly. So I think 2023, you could say, has been like the year of modularity, right? It has culminated with the launch of Celestia. There&#8217;s a bunch of roll-ups being built on Celestia, on Neutron connecting with Celestia. We launched bridges to Celestia. There&#8217;s a number of other solutions to provide data availability and such, and other modular components like Avail and others that are launching left and right. So I think really modularity has been the theme of this year. I think in next year, what we&#8217;ll see is sort of like monolithic architecture being reframed because monolithic is arguably connotated a bit negatively, but there are some benefits to it, right? Like Solana, for example, and I&#8217;ll totally have been explaining why for them it&#8217;s the best architecture for what they&#8217;re trying to do. And so I think what we&#8217;re going to see is we&#8217;re going to see monolithic architecture being reframed with a focus on integratedness, e.g. there are some benefits, and in fact, Neutron is kind of like the cross between those two worlds, like the modular world and the monolithic world, whereby one of the key features actually value propositions, a feature, not a bug, is that because the stack between the virtual machine and the application layer of the blockchain itself is very closely integrated, we&#8217;re able to provide services to that builders that other platforms just couldn&#8217;t essentially, right? We can expose securely very core functions of the blockchain and make them available to developers to build better applications, right? So things like shaping the block production, shaping the liquidity in the market itself, recapturing a EVM and getting automation without relying on third-party bots and such, and all of this is possible for integratedness, right? And so what I think we&#8217;ll see is modularity is going to remain something that&#8217;s extremely relevant, and the projects that are working on this, I think are going to continue growing and be very defining parts of the industry, but I think other types of architectures will sort of start being reframed into something more positive that has its own benefits and advantages, and I think we&#8217;ll see a strong focus on integratedness and the benefits that it can bring when used correctly, right? Like integrating composability, interoperability, and application specific infrastructure into one package to build an application that&#8217;s able to reach further and to provide a better experience and a better product overall. That would be my hot take, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love it. Spaydh, you were absolutely dropping knowledge bombs all pod long. Thank you so much for coming on my man. This was truly a treat and I have a lot of homework to do. I&#8217;ll definitely be relistening to this one on a walk and taking notes because again, you made my head spin in the best of ways possible and can&#8217;t wait to have you on for round two in the near future. But until we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Neutron online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure. I mean, me personally, I don&#8217;t know that that&#8217;ll be so interesting to folks out there, but I&#8217;m on Twitter. I&#8217;m @0xSpaydh, S-P-A-Y-D-H. And then Neutron, you can find everything about neutron.org. On Twitter @Neutron_org. And, you know, we have a Telegram community, a Discord community. Feel free to join these. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll be able to, like, really engage with you, get your questions, answer them, discuss about all of the things that you think about the crypto and how we make the world better. And yeah, we&#8217;re looking forward to hearing from everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Unreal. Spaydh, thank you so much, mate. Appreciate it. And wishing you the team all the best. Can&#8217;t wait for round 2.</p>
<p><strong>Avril Dutheil</strong><br />
Likewise. Take care.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Folks, what an episode with Spaydh, core contributor of Neutron. He was absolutely on fire today. Dropping knowledge bombs left, right and center. We&#8217;d love to see that. If you guys enjoyed this one and I hope you did, please do subscribe. It would mean the world to my team and I. Speaking of the team, love you guys. Thank you so much for everything, especially Justas. You are the GOAT of editing. The best sound editor out there. Thank you for everything, my man. Also, the listeners, back to you guys. Keep on growing those bags. Keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and we&#8217;ll talk soon.</p>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab, still coming in hot from Mexico, still having to wear a cap as the hair do is out of control right now. Looking like Ronald McDonald. Next time you guys see me, I&#8217;m going to go see a lovely Mexican barber and he is going to get this taken care of. But enough about me. Time to jump into the star of the show, the one and only Kavita Gupta on the show today Founder and General Partner of Delta Blockchain Fund. She has over 18 years of investment experience via the World Bank, IFC and Eric Schmidt Family office. We&#8217;ll can&#8217;t wait to get into that and started one of the first blockchain early stage funds, Consensys Ventures and accelerator, Tachyon. Kavita has invested first checks into sector defining companies such as Polygon, Starkware, Quantstamp and Sorare, wow, to name over 100 companies. And there&#8217;s also a visiting scholar at Stanford University teaching that beyond Bitcoin class as an advisor to the Hughes Institute. Absolutely pumped to have you on Kavita. Welcome to the show. Super pumped to have you. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
Thank you so much, Matt. And I&#8217;m very excited. And you are in Mexico, and I&#8217;m super jealous.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
But you are at least kicking it in the best city in the world, and that is the one in only New York City.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
Yes, minus the weather right now.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yes, minus the weather. Crazy news, folks we are recording on November 22nd by the time this episode airs. It will be towards the end of November, but the big talk of the day is one day after the maybe one of the GOATs, depending on how you define GOATs and depending on what you think of them, but the one and only the Godfather of Crypto CZ got canned yesterday, four billion in fines, which again for him is like me getting a coffee at Starbucks. But he got a four billion dollar fine water under the bridge for him. He may or may not spend some time in jail. He has to take a couple years away from Binance and absolutely mayhem, banana lands. Kavita what do you make of all this news and is this good or bad for the crypto industry long term here?</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
No, so I feel like this was a long time due for CZ. He had a very good understanding that this is going to happen. I think it&#8217;s a very well closed or negotiated deal, which has been going on for over a year now. And there was already a news spreading out even like four months back that CZ is returning money from the fund. He has raised as a Binance and already planning who&#8217;s going to take over if he has to step down from CEO. So there were already some sort of internal story circulated in a closed group of people. I heard it around three and a half months back about how the plan, but the dollar number of the settlement was something which came out. And as you mentioned, and I completely agree, I think it&#8217;s just like a very sweet slap on the wrist for CZ. And even the 500 million, which he has to do personally is like, let&#8217;s go buy chocolate and have a good Christmas or a thing. The main question out here is, is that a bad legal framework or fair? And to be very honest with you, and maybe I&#8217;m biased because as a crypto native since 2013 and as a person who is way more towards how crypto people are thinking, if you don&#8217;t have a clarity on regulations, you really can&#8217;t go and say you did wrong because you never told us what is wrong.And I think Arthur Hayes case was one of the first one of, hey, we need KYC, but there was no regulations on KYC. It was not positioned as this has to be done for crypto exchanges for the longest time, even after Arthur Hayes was convicted for money laundering under the very similar cases. So I think for CZ, this is actually his Christmas. And I definitely consider him a good, even though I think Binance, when it started as an exchange, a lot of people had a lot of questions. There were always speculations or suspicions. Is there a Chinese money, which he has proven not to that extent? There was always during FTX, before FTX, around Luna crash. Does it has equal liquidity? Will it be able to survive? It has. I think with this big two Binance was way before Coinbase launching a lot of derivative products, but also creating its own chain. And Binance Smart Chain is one of the biggest technology infrastructure play in Asia. You can hardly see a company, especially in infrastructure gaming coming out of Asia, which is not on BSC. I feel like it&#8217;s just not an exchange. It is actually a whole legacy company. And Binance continues to survive. I mean, there&#8217;s still question whether they will be able to be able to operate in US or not. And the answer may change in one year&#8217;s time, but outside US, Binance is the biggest exchange in the world and continues to be.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And just to fortify your point here, it&#8217;s not even just the exchange. It&#8217;s the ecosystem as a whole. And I&#8217;m a big believer in the importance of singular words and what that does for an asset class or just a categorization of things. When you think of crypto, and if I&#8217;m like, Kavita, you can name a couple words or a couple companies like Binance might very well could pop up when you say that. And I think that really does move the needle. I think it is powerful when you have such a powerful brand. You know, it&#8217;s almost like Apple, Microsoft being synonymous with computers and tech. Like Binance is synonymous with crypto as a whole. And we do need to shout out CZ. I think it&#8217;s hilarious. All the memes going on right now. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re loving them as well. I saw one today where someone like Facetune CZ over Leo DiCaprio in the famous Wolf of Wall Street scene where he&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m not leaving. And it&#8217;s just too good. It&#8217;s too much fun.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
So I just want to say I&#8217;m met with a thought. One was in 2018 during TechCrunch Zoom and one was afterwards in UAE. I have to say, for somebody who already been positioned as one of the biggest player in the space, but at the same time always, I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s media or the operational Binance, who knows the reality, but also with a little bit of suspicion. He has been so humble, open and straightforward with the questions he has been served on the plate that has been very interesting and amusing at the same time, because that&#8217;s not what you expect. But I generally feel, I want to now loop in a very important question which you asked, is it a bad thing for crypto or a good thing? I feel like cleaning up of these and having and providing very clear guidelines of what&#8217;s and what&#8217;s not going to be acceptable is actually a really good thing for the institutional adoption in the crypto industry. And we have already started seeing that with the price movement, but also we&#8217;re going to see it with the technology more on the TradFi space. Absolutely amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Another hot take that&#8217;s been buzzing around Twitter recently is CZ and Binance. Well, Binance isn&#8217;t getting pushed out, but CZ got pushed out to fortify the space as a whole, get rid of those bad actors, people practicing malpractice, just like you just discussed. And this will pave way for the ETF. And BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, is not going to come in and open an ETF in a space where bad actors are still present. Yes, there will always be a couple of bad apples in the apple tree, but we are getting rid of them one by one. And the big boys and the big gals are the ones we&#8217;re going after first. This can&#8217;t be nothing but good for the ETF, right? Like this has to be all systems go, green light city, population us for January coming around.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
So absolutely yes for ETF, but I would not categorize that we are going after people who are all bad actors. I feel like of course there are SBF of the world, which is absolutely, there&#8217;s no gray area. Yeah, you can&#8217;t justify to be gray anymore. But at the same time, I generally believe like Kraken getting fine or Coinbase getting fines or BlockFi of the world or the CZs of the world. I think that is more about unclear gray area regulatory stuff, which has not hurt people, which has not really a block, is a different case. Of course, which got the whole FTX trauma, but not that the founders wanted it or did bad accounting or bad decision making to take people&#8217;s money and buy yachts. It&#8217;s not three year capital. It&#8217;s not Luna. But I feel like these are the cases where the lack of clarity or conservative or probably a negative perspective by the regulatory body towards crypto has really taken a front seat. So I just want to like put it in context that just because people who created crypto what it is today, right? DeFi wouldn&#8217;t have existed, options and futures wouldn&#8217;t have existed if Binance wouldn&#8217;t have been offered yet for a long time. Yes, taking an inter looping of pools which Kraken has done for institution has paid way for the Lido&#8217;s and the institutional staking of the world. In 2017, when we first invested in BlockFi people, having the value that your crypto can be converted into USD to buy a house and it has a real value associated with it at converting into the extent today of Gemini and earn and all those things wouldn&#8217;t have existed. So I feel like, yes, there have been amazing founders and entrepreneurs way beyond just these people but a lot in the ecosystem who has really set up the first and the second phase of crypto and blockchain. And now we are ready, government is ready and I think regulators are ready to take it and for the BlackRocks and Goldman Sachs of the world to come and the big boys to continue to now take this and make it as a big derivative product and build money.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s so true. I can&#8217;t wait for this to happen. I know this is a bit of a cop-up question and no one likes the timetable questions, but when do you think the ETF is ready to pop off? Everyone&#8217;s saying, Jan, do you think Jan&#8217;s a legitimate estimate slash hypothesis a little later, a little earlier?</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
I think Q1 for sure. For multiple reasons, and this is my personal belief not that I have some insight knowledge about it. I believe that first of all, next year is a big election year, and both parties need some wins. And this has been a very hot topic, not only for the financial industry, but the young voters across both aisle. So I feel like we suddenly going to see a lot of support for the crypto industry, especially with the bigger cases have been moved and the regulators have proven their point that they&#8217;re here, they are watching and they will take action. I think we need to move forward with it. That&#8217;s one. I think the second more important thing for the ETF is the ruling from the court, which has completely put has pushed SEC in the corner by asking really legitimate questions and saying, please explain why it won&#8217;t work and why would you object this now it&#8217;s not like media asking or closed door meetings having no answers. Like now you have to come and make your case like anybody else has the lay of the land and I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to push it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, that&#8217;s, I mean, some of the older interviewing questions were just absolutely nonsensical and just the power that SEC has, I mean had and still has is it&#8217;s crazy. And imagine if there were a couple of people closer to our age, you know, who actually were calling the shots at the SEC instead of, and no offense to the old folks. I know you always got to respect your elders and I do respect my elders, but a couple of you guys and gals just maybe, you know, retire, take a look at my hat, go play some golf, enjoy life, like stop going at all us crypto folks. We&#8217;re not all bad people, you know, smell the coffee a little, but that&#8217;s just not how life works.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
And if you have that people don&#8217;t take our taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yes. Very true. Let&#8217;s get into Delta for a second here. And when we dive into Delta Blockchain Fund, which is obviously your fund, you and your team&#8217;s fund, you are founder and GP there, we will have so many different areas to jump into. And this excites me a ton. I think a good place to start is give us the inception story of Delta, a couple of your early investments, why you jumped into those and then we&#8217;ll move a little forward and talk about some of the biggest themes and trends and areas of crypto that get you and the team the most excited present day.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
Thank you. Delt started because I basically have been in the space since 13, initially just mining while I was still working at the World Bank IFC and then doing investments at Google X, Fund Office. And then I started playing with the whole ICO craziness in 2016. And I was like, no, it&#8217;s not amazing. There was, I think the big point when I said, it was like, what the hell is happening here? This is either the biggest scam or the biggest goal, which is yet to be proven goal, is when after a day or two slunch of noses, it&#8217;s FDV was bigger than the market cap of Google. And I was like, what the hell is happening? Who are these people who are buying it? And it just basically as a student, as a person who has been computer engineering and economics as masters, I was just super curious. How does this hold economics work? And how does this market and buy and sell and exchange and everything around it works? And which got me super into it and started one of the first funds in the space. And it was very moved in early because I felt like I have missed a lot of my friends or mentors, like a lot of my mentors were like one of the first people at Google. And so I definitely missed that time. Then there were a lot of my colleagues and friends who were first in Facebook and Twitter. And I have missed that too. So I was like, this is interesting. I&#8217;m going to give it a try. Maybe it will be good to be one of the first ones. And that&#8217;s how we started. And because there were very few, there were limited 203 funds. There were very limited amount of structure money, which was available in the space back in 17. I was very lucky to be like first checks in BlockFi, Polygon, Starkware, Quantstamp, Sorare, OpenSea Separate, like a bunch of stuff and really see the evolution of the founders. So by the time I reached 21, by then I have already parted ways from my first fund back in 19. I was already teaching at Stanford, beyond Bitcoin. I was spending a lot of time with founders on campus. I realized that I was getting a lot of opportunities to join the existing Web2 big funds to start their crypto blockchain arms and be the GP. And but I felt like, let me see, as a woman, will I be able to raise money for a fund? I think it was a personal journey to try. And I was like my worst case scenario, I&#8217;ll join one of the funds and still do investments, which I love.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
And I wasn&#8217;t sure because I have not raised money for the fund ever before. It was my first time. I did not have a lot of contacts with respect to family offices or institutions. But I had amazing mentors like my first boss, Nina Shapiro, who has the first ever and the only ever women treasurer of IFC in the history of IFC. I talked to her. I talked to a couple of other really big founders, CEOs of public companies who have been my mentors in my life. And I realized, let&#8217;s take this bet. And one after another, it&#8217;s just amazing in three months, not only we closed the targeted amount of 50, but we were completely over subscribed all the way to 65 in our first close. And so somehow got lucky and had a great track record and put it all together. And then we went back to when we started thinking, how are we going to be different? Because suddenly in 21, we saw over 50 funds, 30 funds coming into the space all over the world. With some just the mainstream funds, people who never had any experience in crypto, just starting it because that was the big wave at that time. So we as a team started thinking, how are we going to be different? And what we realized is our whole team, me, Konstantin, Smith, Mudet, the co-team, we are all actually super crypto natives since 2013. And we understand the evolution, but we are also deep Web2 users. So we understand infrastructure and the gaps of infrastructure. And that&#8217;s what we decided that we&#8217;re going to invest into pick and shovels, the most non-sexy things in blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
Without which you can never really build a beautiful house. If your piping is not working, your bathroom is busted, your house is not livable. So that&#8217;s what we started picking. So we started looking into, everyone was going for cross chain applications. We were going for cross chain swap infrastructure platforms. So that&#8217;s something like layer swap, which even in today&#8217;s time has been consistently over a million dollar revenue quarter by quarter in today&#8217;s time and completely profitable. They have not even touched the VC money they have raised because they don&#8217;t have to. What they are doing is, if you have your modular blockchain, let&#8217;s say you are on base, you are on Soria&#8217;s platform or anything, you never have to think about as a user, oh, I have USDC or I have Solana USD or I have some other token, you just go on a completely new chain and you do your transactions and it will just take care of all possible swaps at the back end without you ever thinking. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to drive the adoption. Or something like Karma3Labs, which is identity compute, another very important thing. We hear about a lot of social identities, which are needed, like Farkasta is doing a great job, Lens is doing an amazing job. But who&#8217;s going to really under all these different social identities, who&#8217;s going to come and really compute it for you and put it universally everywhere. And that&#8217;s where I feel like the non-sexy shovel comes in and need the cool investments out there. So we did that, we did Airstack because developers and user consumer indexing needs to be way more easier and way more faster. We are doing a lot of cross-chain analytics tools for the developers, but also for chains to use. For an example, if you move your money from polygon to let&#8217;s say Solana through two bridges, both Polygon and Solana also needs to burn and settle and have to have dashboard immediately in a live way, see it and that particular app, if it&#8217;s, let&#8217;s say, are we doing it from one to another to do it? And so token flow comes in that category, you have a Solity comes in that category. So a bunch of those, I can keep on going. Sorry, Matt, I don&#8217;t want to take your whole 45 minutes, just fight it about the companies we have invested in.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
No, this is great. And again, I love the sort of first narrative that you guys sculpted and went after, which was again, the unsexy, you know, pick and shovels, the infrastructure, the house, the plumbing, the HVAC, you name it. That&#8217;s what you need. That&#8217;s, and it moves the needle. It&#8217;s no different than investing in, you know, something like AWS, where everyone thinks of Amazon as the, oh, it&#8217;s the company that ships stuff to your doorstep the same day or the next day, which I love. But like, if you&#8217;re in tech, AWS is just as powerful if not more powerful. So just a great little example there. Let&#8217;s talk about your firms and obviously yours current events and current trends, current things that you guys are really focused honed in on right now. We have GameFi popping off. We have everything in the Solana ecosystem popping off, although we don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s going to last, but still what sort of trends or what sort of narratives you guys really focused on current day Q4 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
As I said, we watch every trend. Like right now, every other conversation is about IntentFi. And how are you going to use intents for the DeFi, which is actually just a six year version of saying predictive markets or prediction markets, right? There has been the last two quarters, everybody. And now it has become like a Holy Bible that if you are creating something, you have to drop ZK somehow in the ADEC, right? Or you have to drop AI, even though nobody&#8217;s talking about how the hell are you going to get data? Data is so difficult. And it&#8217;s a cumbersome game till today to get data on chain, right? The on chain data. And so how are you even going to get a clean data to build AI predictive algorithms? But sure, let&#8217;s just put AI in the next. So we have been seeing lots and lots in the last two quarters. I think we have to take a step back and acknowledge and be okay with this acknowledgement that it&#8217;s not even a decade old industry. Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet launch or a pre-net launch was 2015, which was literally hasn&#8217;t really started building up like 17 and 18. Still we were investing in crypto sides of things, right? Only 2021 is when DeFi started popping up, real NFT trading start popping up. So we are under a five year old real tech industry. So yes, we can have a lot of narratives and a lot of really nice themes going on, but the thing is our infrastructure is not there. We are at the infrastructure where AOL was. We are still not at Gmail stage. We are reaching the Hotmail stage.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Well said. Love that analogy.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
We are not there. So I love all the hype because there is so much money because of crypto and tokens associated with this industry that the hype is very high. But we have to give a pat on our shoulder. And I say it in a very positive way. We have to give a pat on our shoulder that the tech industry, which is really under a five to six years, is being talked about globally. Institutions wants to adopt it. Governments are printing their identity on it. We have got a huge adoption, but we don&#8217;t have the universal tech for billions of people to adopt yet. And that&#8217;s where Delta comes in. And that&#8217;s where we are pushing in not very trendy things, but every infrastructure thing, which can make those trendy things to exist on top. So I can give you all the trends, thousands of dex, which we are seeing every week. And how do we know what people are talking about month by month, how the trends are changing? But that&#8217;s not our personal play.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Kavita, we need to take a quick break and a huge shout out to our sponsor, The Show that is PrimeXBT. And when we get back, we are going to keep talking about the global and geopolitical events and how they impact market dynamics. And we&#8217;re going to keep diving into the VC crypto landscape.

I would love to go right into the day to day of yourself and your team. I feel like a lot of people over the last 10 years now want to become venture capitalist. I don&#8217;t feel like it was sort of two on the radar 10 years ago, but now you see that it is truly a pretty sweet job. I mean, yes, you have to work your tail off as you should in any, you know, highly paid and highly sought after job, but you get to put money and faith into teams that are going to obviously give you guys a bunch of money back and change the world, which is something that&#8217;s pretty frigging cool and something that I would love to do one day as well. With that being said, walk me through your day to day, in my mind, Kavita, I feel like you get hundreds of pitch decks a day, your analyst sends over the best ones, you analyze them, you follow up with the team, book meetings, see all the pitches, hear all the pitches, maybe go meet them in person, feel them out, send them money, check up on them. The rest is history. How far off am I? How far on am I? Give me the spiel here. What is the day to day of the life of Kavita?</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
I think everything that you said definitely exists in my life on the daily basis, but much more. But before I start there, I want to burst a bubble. There has been, there was a Twitter thread, I think. Somewhere started by, I think Sam Altman created one Twitter thread, I don&#8217;t know. I think following the news nowadays, maybe he had a fight with one of his VCs or something where he said, Messy job is not a full-time job or something. And I love Sam, he&#8217;s a friend, but like, come on. He has been a community president. I hope he wasn&#8217;t doing that because we don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a tough life. I know when you&#8217;re a founder, you feel like as a founder, your life is tough. You have to build, that&#8217;s just true. Of course, I always jokingly and endearingly say, a founder till series A is like a peon. It&#8217;s like a janitor because they have to do everything. Like we don&#8217;t have the luxury of saying, oh, somebody else will do it. No, if you have to clean the floor, if you have to build a deck, if you have to go and make it to that meeting, you just do it, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
A true wearer of all hats. You wear every hat there is.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
Yeah and with humility, and you have to just do it. And I feel like there is founders life is tough. But now, as a founder, you always feel like, oh, these people just do meetings and chill, and go to these events or host these events. But here is the real life behind the curtain. These dark circles are very well-earned, living a VC life for over a decade. You have thousands of decks, and you have to go through every deck, even though you have a strong feeling that as soon as you open the deck, that this is gonna be bullshit, and I don&#8217;t want to spend another second on this. You still have to give that deck the equal respect, the equal time, the equal brainpower of the whole team, and then take a vote. That&#8217;s at least how we do it at Delta. We have a daily standing team call, which has technical team members, which has business team members, sometime marketing members, joining, and everyone, pitch in, go through every deck. Anyone who has individually received the deck by mail, by Twitter, by Cole, LinkedIn, by people who have sent it to us on Telegram, on Slack, we combine it together in one channel. We go through it, we give 5 to 10 minutes to eat, and we use our brainpower. After that, there is follow-ups of things which we are interested. Sometimes we want to learn, sometimes it&#8217;s a founder&#8217;s place, sometimes it&#8217;s a product play. Based on various different things, then there is a first call of somebody from investment, somebody from technical team getting together, doing those calls, understanding, coming back to the team call, talking about it, everybody using brainpower again. Then senior member going, we do three to four, then there&#8217;s a deep diligence process which works, right? Because sometimes the product is very different, that you have to go deep into tech, and then you have to go to the codes. And from the codes, we also have to now compare that whatever the founder is saying really exists. Do we also understand? Because we don&#8217;t know everything. You come across genius founders, and you start questioning your own, you have existential crisis once in a while, right? And sometimes the founder has said something completely different, and the codes are copy pasted from some reddit thread, and you are like, what the hell is happening here? You know? Yeah. So it&#8217;s a whole spectrum. It can go anyways, same thing on business side. There is a new terminology which we have started rolling our eyes on. People have started giving you, hey, are you revenue positive? Yes, our ARR is this. And I&#8217;m like, bro, this is February. How are you calculating your ARR in millions when the reality is you just get in game? It&#8217;s a while. It is, I think sometimes there are days when I feel like back to back for nine hours, I&#8217;m gonna hear stories, then I&#8217;m gonna put in three hours to collaborate those stories and make some sense out of it. And then the real diligence work starts. So it is the job where you have to always be out and about, always need to have a nice humble face and a smiling face and give respect because every founder is out there working the best they can do. They have put a lot of things on hold to take a founder&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s not a glamorous life. I know we love to make founders like Sam or Elon or Jack looks very crazy life, but there are only 100 of them out of millions of people who are trying to be founders. So it is a way to have, then apart from just this process, the events you have to do, as you would know the crypto conferences just never stops. There was no beer market for crypto conferences. It&#8217;s still wild. You have to go, you have to have your presence. You meet people in person. You host people. You go to hackathons. You judge. I recently judged ETH Lisbon, which absolutely loved. But between the travel, between your emails, between every Telegram messages, between going through 1000 decks and talking to so many founders, plus as a GP of the fund maintaining investor relations, accounting, operations. It is a lot. It&#8217;s not as slack as it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so true. Kavita, we are getting a little tight for time. I do have a couple more questions and we&#8217;ll wrap up here. I&#8217;m a big story fan. I love stories. Stories are what make the world go round. And you must have one or two stories where you were grinding, hauling ass all day long like you normally do and you&#8217;re on deck number 98 of 100 on that day. And it is just a, wow, holy shit, this team and this idea and this company is going to be incredible. Do you have any stories for us like that where you came across a deck and you were like, holy shit, this is a gold mine.</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
Yeah, it does happen once in a while. It doesn&#8217;t happen as often as we would love to have it, but it does happen once in a while. So I&#8217;ll give an example, I&#8217;m thinking. So I think ASTAC was one of those example. Token Flow was another one, Fortify is another one. I remember when we looked at ASTAC, it came from a very well-respected VC from traditional world who knew the founder and has done a small check. That was the time there was one after another, we had 40 pitches for indexing. We were like, okay, we know we need to do a move in the data indexing play, and that&#8217;s a big one that&#8217;s still not solved to the extent the graph is great, well, it is another great one, but we thought there was still a big space to be covered. We kept on thinking and then we looked at ASTAC, wasn&#8217;t very sure that the initial deck wasn&#8217;t very convincing, but we had to do a call because it came through somebody we respected a lot, and then I decided, I somehow didn&#8217;t do the first call, the team did and they came back and they&#8217;re like, we&#8217;re not sure but the founder is great. So we went on the second call and everybody walked out saying, what he&#8217;s saying versus what we understand is there are different but what he&#8217;s saying if that does exist, then this is great. So it took us longer, it was not a regular process. We kept on being unsure, but we are very glad we did that and not only we did, then we actually increased our amount in the next round because we got so excited by them and we have such a big conviction in them. So once in a while it does happen, that&#8217;s why you have to be in a full energy even on your 98th day. You never know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Such a cool story. I always have these weird, you know, not dreams and visions is definitely the wrong word, but just role playing with a, you know, a VC does day to day. And I always picture like out of the blue, like you get the next Facebook or you get the next, you know, Insta or you get the next Twitter or TikTok, whatever the case is, it just pops up on your screen, you&#8217;re on your MacBook going through the deck almost, you know, not half asleep, but so tired of shitty decks. And then boom, you&#8217;re just like, Oh my goodness, I&#8217;m done. My job&#8217;s done. I know, like anything else in life never happens like that. But it&#8217;s cool to think about. Kavita, the last question, the role of institutional demand. A lot of people shit on crypto VCs on crypto institutional investments. And I think it comes from a jealousy thing, because you guys get to come in and move the needle where you choose, whereas the average show on Josephine doesn&#8217;t really have a chance. And it&#8217;s no different than anything else in life. Money makes the world go around. And when you have a lot of capital, you can move mountains. And that&#8217;s just the way it goes. And it&#8217;s never going to change. The role of institutional demand is absolutely paramount. Everyone has seen a time after time, every single bull market, all the big institutions come in, we see the influx of funds coming in, we see the inflows. It&#8217;s huge. What is the true role of institutional demand in crypto and how big of a part does it really play in the overall space?</p>
<p><strong>Kavita Gupta</strong><br />
It&#8217;s a huge part because not only it pushes, see, institutions have been there for over 100 years, right? They have a way with the regulators and with the governments to accept a derivative product or an offering and make that offering global. So we are talking about trillions, multi trillions of dollars, which can really not only make this industry a 10 year old, industrial, 15 year old industry based on, you start from 2009 or 2015, Bitcoin versus ETH, but not only just legit, but something which opens up to every Tom, Harry, Sam sitting in a tier three city across the globe. And I think that&#8217;s huge power, right? And then that gets the right risk associated, right? People behind it. So institutions are huge. I mean, the reasons stablecoins have become that big is not because of the crypto-native people, but that institutional approach for USDC and USDT and now governments are talking about CBDC. And I think ETF is just the beginning, Matt. I truly believe ETF is like these institutions, small hanging, testing water scheme. You&#8217;re going to see in the next big cycle some of the best derivative products for their wealth, punishment units for all their HNI&#8217;s, you know? And that&#8217;s when the real power of money, which is still unlocked to this space, is going to have the feeling or the real Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And that&#8217;s just to use. And again, I always, every guest comes on and there&#8217;s a couple of really big snippets and absolute lines of gold that I come away with. And my biggest one from you today, Kavita, was your analogy of AOL, Hotmail, Gmail. We&#8217;re still at AOL stage, you know? And that&#8217;s a great one. Cause again, everyone who&#8217;s been through that understands that. And I can&#8217;t wait to see what is going to come. Kavita, you absolutely crushed this. Thank you so much for coming on. I know we barely scratched the surface. I would love to have you on for round two as you and the team are always in the pulse. You guys are both buzzing. Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you personally and Delta Blockchain Fund online and on socials.</p>

<strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. We are buzzing as always. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab, still coming in hot from lovely Mexico. And my guest is coming in hot today from the one and only Lisboa, Portugal. Probably butchered that but what a spot. Absolutely lovely. Today we have Conor Ryder on the show CFA and Head of Research and Data at Ethena, the crypto infrastructure company building USDe, the first ever global internet bond and stablecoin, not reliant on existing banking institutions. We absolutely love that. Prior to joining Ethena, Conor built his career in the traditional finance industry and pivoted into the crypto sector in 2022. As a research analyst at Kaiko, a leading crypto data provider. Conor is also CFA certified and is a seasoned expert in crypto markets and industry events. And his industry insights been featured in CNBC, Bloomberg Financial Times, Reuters, CoinDesk and more super pumped to have you on, Conor welcome to show my friend. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Hey Matt, thanks for having me. It&#8217;s a better intro than I&#8217;ve ever given myself. So I&#8217;ll note that one down.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love it. Look man, pump to have you on. Everyone, I&#8217;m sure who&#8217;s listening right now can hear the accent. Give us your story. You have one of the best accents on the planet. Who doesn&#8217;t love a good old Irish accent? Before the show, you and I were shooting the shit. You told me you just moved from Dublin to Lisbon, two incredible cities. Walk me through your childhood, growing up. Obviously you are a finance guru where you went to uni, how you fell in love with crypto, your crypto inception story, set the stage for us. Then we&#8217;ll get into all the fun stuff with Ethena and USDe. But the stage is yours, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Sure thing. So yeah, thanks for having me again. Yeah. So as you can tell, and as you covered, I grew up in Dublin, Ireland, was there basically my whole life until about two months ago when I moved to Lisbon. So yeah, I went to college in Dublin, studied business and law. So I was always kind of interested in business and just wanted to give myself, I guess, another angle on a kind of standard business degree. But always knew I wanted to go down that route. And then I had offers to join accountancy firms coming out of college. And I didn&#8217;t particularly want to go down that route. Again, this may be why I&#8217;m in crypto is I need something a bit more riveting than accounting, no offense to any accountants out there. But so I took a year off then to go to Australia and kind of travel a bit. And that&#8217;s when I first heard of Bitcoin. Didn&#8217;t look too much into it, allocated a tiny bit, but it was more from just like a finance point of view, just allocating like two or five percent of like portfolio to like get the asymmetric upside, let&#8217;s say, but didn&#8217;t really think too much about it. Came back, figuring out what I wanted to do. And I decided then to go obviously down like a TradFi route, but more towards like asset allocations. So I went and worked for pension fund that was based in the UK, but I was working in Dublin for them. And so yeah, I hopped around a few asset managers in Dublin and in London for about four or five years. And yeah, kind of as lockdown hit, dug more deep into crypto as a lot of people did. Obviously it was a really interesting time to get into it. I was just in a house of four guys and now three out of the four of us work in crypto, we all got into it at the same time we were sitting there watching, yeah, watching everything play out, watching the GameStop saga play out, everything like that. So it was a great couple of years and I just got super into it then and decided to kind of move into it professionally. And that&#8217;s when I joined Klikop who are a kind of crypto data provider. And I sat in the research team there for a bit of a year and a half. Research and all sorts of things, stablecoins, exchanges, derivatives, really interesting role. That&#8217;s kind of what I wanted to do research. And yeah, obviously during that year it was there was 2022 and 2023 and crazy stuff was happening. And you&#8217;re kind of looking into, I guess, a lot big part of my specialty was liquidity and just seeing liquidity being sapped from the space with everything that was going on. And then you constantly have journalists hitting you up, basking you, is crypto going to die tomorrow, basically? Or for the inside scoop on CZ and Binance? Like I knew him personally, I swear at the amount of times I got asked about CZ and what he was like and I&#8217;ve never talked to the guy. Journalists just wanted that scoop. But yeah, super interesting job. And then about six or seven months ago, I met Guy, the founder of Ethena, just as he was kind of setting Ethena up and he had read some of my work. And we just kind of basically chatted for a while about the setup of USD and what Ethena were trying to do. And he had seen some of the stablecoin pieces I had. And this is that I was talking about this need for a more decentralized alternative to a stablecoin that can actually scale and that&#8217;s still secure and everything. And I thought Ethena fit that bill, so yeah, made the decision to kind of join up with Guy and help build it, build out that. So yeah, super excited now. And I do feel like we&#8217;re onto something good here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. What an intro. Wow. You&#8217;re on fire already. Comming out hot right out of the gates. You brought up a very important but often underlooked topic and that is the importance of liquidity. More specifically, I feel like in crypto markets over other markets, you sort of said your, I&#8217;m paraphrasing and I apologize. I&#8217;m also putting words in your mouth, but you sort of said you&#8217;re a liquidity expert. That&#8217;s probably me. You would, you&#8217;re way too humble and would never say that, but you definitely are a liquidity expert. Why is liquidity so important in crypto? And like, I&#8217;d love if you could just talk about some of the implications both good and bad, it has when it&#8217;s either launching to the market or sucked out of the market.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Absolutely. So yeah, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m a liquidity expert, but yeah, it&#8217;s actually spent a bit of time looking into it over the last year or two. And yeah, essentially, it&#8217;s super important in obviously really immature markets, which crypto is, it&#8217;s less talked about in traditional financial markets just because they&#8217;ve been around for however many years, decades. And there is this like a surplus of liquidity for the most part in traditional finance. And you don&#8217;t really hear about stock pumping on low liquidity that much, whereas that happens in crypto all the time. So essentially, one of the biggest liquidity metrics was is market depth, which is like essentially a measure of how many orders are placed on an order book at one time that aren&#8217;t filled yet. And we just saw them hitting kind of yearly lows and all time lows over the last year on exchange order books. And what that meant was that basically prices for tokens had less support both to the upside and the downside. So it took less and less basically quantity of orders to move the prices. And we just saw that happening over the last year or two as liquidity was just pulled from the space, like you had the collapse of many of the crypto lenders, the ones that survived went really happy with leaving their money sitting on a centralized exchange then. And you just had a bunch of events play out and even regulators then like cutting off some of the payment rails to crypto exchanges and the FIAT on and off ramps. So it was just all these compounded things that basically had this compounding effect on liquidity just being sucked out of the space. We&#8217;re starting to see that come back now, but essentially yet the last year or two, it&#8217;s just been a story really of illiquidity for crypto and just trying to claw that back and I guess make the market more mature just so we don&#8217;t have these kind of crazy wild swings in a day because if we are trying to be this kind of financial system, we can&#8217;t really have like three or five volatility assets, yeah, and especially in the majors like Bitcoin and ETH. So hopefully liquidity is coming back to the space now and we&#8217;re starting to see that definitely with this Spot ETF come and that&#8217;ll help that big time. So yeah, that&#8217;s kind of the high level take on liquidity I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Before we get into stablecoins and synthetic dollars and Ethena, of course, I&#8217;d love to talk about some current market trends. Then we&#8217;ll get into the fun stuff. Are there any macro or even micro trends that you see that are really playing out? Obviously, we are recording sort of middle to end of November. This episode will air towards the end of November. You have GameFi coins picking back up. You have all of the sort of top 10, top 20, which are ripping for maybe not ripping, but definitely slowly and gradually rising for the most part. You have Bitcoin being talked about all over the place. You have ETH just hitting 2K USD. What kind of macro and micro trends are we looking at? I guess on just a longer term scale, are you still max bullish? Are we going back to the moon? What&#8217;s your play, Conor?</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Pretty bullish honestly. Yes, definitely, but maybe a bit less bullish than it was three or four months ago when you&#8217;re looking at different price levels. But definitely the tailwinds are starting to line up for Bitcoin for ETH for all the kind of majors in crypto. It&#8217;s been kind of talked about ad nauseam, I guess, but these Spot ETFs are probably the first step. Like every, I guess, market cycle needs that first catalyst to get it going. I think last time maybe it was like Michael Saylor buying Bitcoin and putting it on the balance sheet of micro strategy. But this time maybe the Spot ETF is kind of the similar comparison to that. It&#8217;s that first catalyst to get us out of that bear market and basically peak up animal spirits again and peak up everyone&#8217;s interest. And I really do think that like the analysts that are into ETF say it&#8217;s like a 90% chance they&#8217;re approved by January. So that&#8217;s hopefully a great sign. And I think I saw a stat that like financial advisors in the US, they allocate basically 80% of their clients assets into ETFs. And then there&#8217;s obviously this demand from their clients and that&#8217;s been talked about as well from like you see Larry Fink or any of the big kind of executives and any of these big asset managers have said that on record and on CNBC that there&#8217;s demand for clients to invest in Bitcoin. There just hasn&#8217;t been infrastructure there for them to be able to do that. And now hopefully come January, there will be that infrastructure. So hopefully that&#8217;s the next wave of flows coming into the space. And then also then after that, you&#8217;ve got the kind of Bitcoin halving coming up and obviously there&#8217;s debates whether or not to surprise them as always. But following that, then hopefully we&#8217;re like we also are at the top of a rate interest rate cycle now. So hopefully like if we&#8217;re looking ahead to six months time, there will be hopefully starting a cut interest rates and that&#8217;s been known to be supportive to crypto prices and crypto yields. So I think things are definitely looking up. Yeah. And it&#8217;s kind of hard to find bearish events that are on the horizon now. I know they usually come by surprise, but I&#8217;ve definitely been bullish now compared to this time last year.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that and you said three months ago you were even more bullish you and the team three months ago you guys were just like all just licking your chops waiting for everything to rip?</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Well, kind of, but what we&#8217;re doing here is like Delta Neutral. So we&#8217;re essentially going to be hedging any exposure we have to eat. So even if we do think we&#8217;re max bullish, we can&#8217;t really express that in our positioning. It&#8217;s kind of Delta Neutral approach we&#8217;re taking. So yeah, I guess we can get into that later. But it was more just from a personal side of things that I was max bullish probably.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Let&#8217;s jump right into it. You just set the stage. You are obviously head of research and data at Ethena and you guys created the first ever global internet bond and stablecoin, which is not reliant on existing banking solutions and institutions. And this is USDe. I love the names. Very sexy as well. I mean, you could have thrown a lot of, you know, letters before the USD, but it just, it just rolls cleanly off the tongue. And I think a lot more emphasis than people really want to admit as we are just such, you know, emotional creatures. And when you say something like that, it makes you feel a certain kind of way. Nonetheless, give me this sort of elevator pitch on what exactly you and the team are building. And then we&#8217;ll get into everything stablecoin related. I&#8217;ve read your stuff. I&#8217;ve watched your videos, your interviews, you have some really good takes and some spicy takes on everything stablecoin related to stablecoin trilemma. But until then, let&#8217;s start with Ethena, give us the elevator pitch, then we&#8217;ll get into the fun stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, absolutely. So on the name, hopefully, like USDe as much, because that&#8217;s what we pivoted a couple months ago. There is an USDe out there by Libra. So we were nearly forced into that decision to take a different approach. But yeah, we, I hope you like that as much. We definitely do. Anyway, it&#8217;s just putting the E after the USD, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Changing the show notes as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, so the elevator pitch, I guess, for Ethena is basically building this synthetic dollar position on a decentralized protocol based on ETH. And essentially what we&#8217;re doing is we are taking on crypto native collateral, so stake Ethereum, and we are hedging that price exposure in derivative markets on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. And essentially at the end of that position, then you get this tokenized dollar. That&#8217;s why we call it kind of a synthetic dollar because you&#8217;ve netted out your exposure from a P&amp;L perspective. So if staked Ethereum is rising, your short position is counteracting that and you just basically have this dollar position. And then at the end of that process, then you also are able to earn kind of two sources of yields. So one being the staked Ethereum side, obviously earning about 4% now. But then also historically, you&#8217;ve been paid to go take the short side of the ETH future position. Just because of the kind of supply demand imbalance in crypto and the demand to go long. And so shorts have been compensated nearly for taking that side of the trade by about 6% or 7% annually. So hopefully at the end of that trade, then you have this synthetic dollar that&#8217;s using crypto native collateral. And then it&#8217;s kind of an unlevered source of yield of hopefully historically in the last three years, it&#8217;s been a double digit yield. So we&#8217;re hoping that can continue. And then that obviously poses a really interesting comparison versus like real world assets or traditional bond assets that are yielding like 4% or 5%. And now all of a sudden, hopefully we have this stable kind of synthetic dollar position that uses crypto native collateral that actually earns like a double digit yield from obviously kind of like a censorship resistant collateral perspective as well. So that&#8217;s the elevator pitch on Ethena and USDe.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. So just to make sure I have this right here, Conor, you guys are obviously long with the derivatives and that gives you give or take 4% like you said. And then on the short side, you know, you&#8217;re getting let&#8217;s just say 7%, that gives you your double digit 11% yield literally just from being sort of net neutral at the end of the day in order to get that pure $1 finality that you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yes. So I guess to clarify, it&#8217;s like the liquid staking derivative, the token ETH on the asset side. So that&#8217;s the collateral. And then you&#8217;re taking short ETH perpetual futures. So you&#8217;re going short the futures on the derivative markets to hedge that price exposure. So you&#8217;re offsetting your position from a P&amp;L perspective. And then, yes, obviously, then the other point is that that yield isn&#8217;t obviously guaranteed. It&#8217;s supposed to fluctuate. But we&#8217;re happy, I guess, and part of my job is to look into the data on that. And you&#8217;re essentially looking at the funding rate for the short ETH position. And that&#8217;s a bit that fluctuates the most, obviously. But taking the mean from that, it&#8217;s like, as I said, 6% or 7% being paid to the short side. And in bull markets, it gets even higher. So two weeks ago, when the market was ripping, we saw rates of like 30% and 40% on an annual basis. Yeah. So no, I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s going to persist maybe over the 12 months because it&#8217;s an annual yield, that&#8217;s able. And if it did, you have that staked in there. So even over the last three years, that average is incorporating 2022, which had pretty low averages because obviously there was more demand to go short crypto assets then. But that&#8217;s 6% or 7% is average over in that 2022 yields included in that. So again, super interesting, hopefully from just purely a collateral standpoint, we&#8217;re using this decentralized collateral, that&#8217;s actually now earning more yield than more centralized collateral like bonds and stable coins. Because that&#8217;s been one of the big problems I think with crypto lately is that it&#8217;s the first time in basically crypto&#8217;s existence that traditional bond yields have overtaken crypto yields. Like now in crypto, you&#8217;re only getting like 2% or 3% in your assets for the most part, versus 5% for TradFi bonds. And that comes back to the liquidity point earlier as well. That&#8217;s also another compounding effect that I probably forgot to mention earlier is that money has left the space because now, okay, why would you leave it in a DeFi smart contract earning 3% where you could earn it in a US government secured asset, a bond in traditional finance earning 5%. And so you saw a lot of probably asset managers pulling liquidity out of the space. So basically crypto needs to kind of get more competitive from yield perspective. And we&#8217;re hoping we can be one of those assets that does that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Oh man, you&#8217;re on a roll here. We got to talk about the stablecoin trilemma, which is again, one of you and Ethena is very perhaps unique is the wrong word, but definitely one of your hypothesis and themes that you guys hammer home. Obviously, a combination of achieving stability, decentralization, and of course, you know, a good yield as well. But walk me through the stablecoin trilemma, why it&#8217;s so important paramount to crypto success as a whole and how you and the team are working to provide a solution here.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, exactly. So yeah, you covered the three kind of points for the stablecoin trilemma. And I guess it&#8217;s kind of coming back to what problems we&#8217;re solving. And hopefully the problem is that stablecoin trilemma, that&#8217;s kind of been the holy grail for stablecoins. And it is a tough problem to solve. So you had obviously the stable point of it is obviously hopefully in the name, it&#8217;s a stablecoin. But we&#8217;ve seen examples in the past where projects have sacrificed that stability, i.e. probably TERA for the sake of scalability and decentralization, they obviously didn&#8217;t have a good enough peg mechanism or they were maybe under collateralized. And that was responsible for a big part of their growth, but they weren&#8217;t able to retain that stability. So that&#8217;s something they obviously sacrificed from that trilemma. Then obviously from like a censorship resistance perspective, that they&#8217;re obviously super stable. So we&#8217;re talking about there, we&#8217;re talking about probably more centralized stablecoins like USDC and USDT. They&#8217;re collateral back in their stablecoin isn&#8217;t actually censorship resistant, obviously because it&#8217;s bonds, US government bonds, they can step in any day and just hit the kill switch and basically cancel it&#8217;s USDC or USDT&#8217;s access to those bonds if they wanted. So you can&#8217;t really say that they&#8217;re censorship resistant, but obviously they&#8217;re super stable and pretty scalable as well because they only need to back their stablecoin one to one, which leads us into then the scalable point of side attaining switch. Up until now, probably DeFi stables haven&#8217;t been able to do so they&#8217;ve been focused on emphasizing stability and decentralization and basically to do that, their censorship resistance and to do that, they&#8217;ve had to take an over collateralized approach to still be stable. So they&#8217;re using, some of them mostly are using crypto collateral, but because you&#8217;re using crypto collateral, then you have to actually over collateralize. So the collateral back in the stablecoin isn&#8217;t too volatile. So for that reason, then they&#8217;ve kind of given up their scalability and they&#8217;ve struggled to match the scalability of the more centralized stablecoins. And that&#8217;s part of the reason why we&#8217;ve seen that centralized stablecoin dominance increase now. So I think centralized stablecoins are responsible for like 70% of transactions on chain in DeFi, which is pretty ridiculous when you think that DeFi is going to be building this like parallel financial system, but actually 70% of the transactions on this parallel financial system are tethered to the traditional banking system via those centralized stablecoins. So yeah, this stablecoin dilemma has been this holy grail that issuers are trying to solve. And I guess to circle back to Ethena, hopefully then we&#8217;ve kind of touched on each of those points is we have censorship-resistant collateral, i.e. Stealth, that&#8217;s the crypto-native collateral. We hopefully are scalable because as, so this is probably the most intricate part, but as I said, with the derivative position, you basically need to match what for every $1 Stealth you have, you need to have a $1 short for the perpetual position to hedge that off. So that means you actually only need to take a one to one collateral ratio as well. So we&#8217;re actually kind of as scalable as as centralized stablecoins. And then from a stability perspective as well, it falls into the same thing. It&#8217;s your offsetting hedges for each dollar of collateral you have. So they should enter it perfectly offset each other. And then hopefully you&#8217;ve touched on each of those three points of stablecoin trilemma. So yeah, there&#8217;s obviously trade-offs that we&#8217;re making here that we can dig more into. We are touching centralized exchanges, but we&#8217;re doing that via custodians and for good reason, basically. So to access centralized liquidity is pretty paramount for stablecoins, especially Delta and neutral ones that are using derivative markets. Centralized exchanges basically have like 98% of the volumes and an open interest for perpetual future markets. So you&#8217;re getting way better liquidity and you can actually scale the scale of this the stablecoin into the hundreds of millions. We&#8217;ve seen previous attempts at Delta Neutral stablecoins just stick to DeFi and decentralized exchanges and they kind of failed and couldn&#8217;t scale past like tens of millions. So yeah, we&#8217;re taking that approach, touching those centralized exchanges, but we&#8217;re actually doing that in a way that no collateral actually sits on the centralized exchange itself. It sits in a custody count. So someone like Copper, Fireblocks are kind of these institutional great custodians that hopefully have kind of obviously secured your assets in a manner that minimizes your counterparty risk. You&#8217;re not taking on that much counterparty risk via the exchange, but you can still access that centralized liquidity that you need to.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Conor, you&#8217;re absolutely buzzing right now. We need to take a quick break and give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show and that is PrimeXBT. But when we get back, we are going to keep jumping into stablecoins. Talk about how the stablecoin market recently hit a two year all time low and the difference between stablecoins and synthetic dollars, the pros and cons, and why it&#8217;s important to differentiate between the two. And we might even talk about Conor&#8217;s electric mustache as well. But until then, huge shout out to PrimeXBT, longtime sponsor of the show and longtime friends of the Cryptonews Podcast.

And now back to the show with Conor. Conor, let&#8217;s get into the fun stuff. The most fun stuff, your mustache. It&#8217;s an electric factory. It&#8217;s absolutely great. I was going to, I&#8217;ve done Movember many times in 2018, first year in university. I may have even done it in high school. I have some Lebanese blood in me. So that&#8217;s why I got the beard going. I got the hairy chest if need be. But your mustache, I watch your interviews on CNBC and all the financial ones. You were baby face. You were clean cut finance bro. What&#8217;s with the stash? I love it. Give us the backstory on that.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
It&#8217;s crypto now in me. I gotta let the facial hair loose. Yeah, honestly, I didn&#8217;t know how to do my locker. Honestly, I was just playing around in Movember, probably for the first time ever, and just got pretty lazy, didn&#8217;t let it. Good kind of let the facial hair grow a bit. And my problem is I can&#8217;t grow a full beard. So I said, I&#8217;ll give the mustache and try for Movember. And yeah, if you stroke my ego enough, it might stay. So that could be the end.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love it. How&#8217;s the feedback been overall? Good feedback from people on the team, the lady, whatever. Everyone loves it.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, no ladies there yet, which is probably worrying, but yeah, no. In the last week, it&#8217;s probably taken shape. The first week, I think it&#8217;s the toughest when you just have a few straggly whiskers and then it looks terrible. So I&#8217;m hoping now I&#8217;m through the worst part and you can actually start getting some compliments there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Next time you see me, I might have to go for like the handlebars. Sometimes I&#8217;ll do the Wolverine, but it&#8217;s a little spooky and you know, people don&#8217;t take it too seriously when you get on a zoom call with a Wolverine beard. So anyways, back to the show here. Let&#8217;s jump into stable coins, synthetic dollars. A lot of people don&#8217;t know the difference between the two. Not gonna lie until I did research for the show. I thought they were pretty much the same thing. Then I started doing research and I was like, okay, we got a difference. This is very cool. I&#8217;d love to throw the ball over to your court. What&#8217;s the diff between stable coins and synthetic dollars? What are the two sort of pros and cons between them? And why is it so important to differentiate the two of them?</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, I think it&#8217;s kind of a nuanced difference. And as you said, probably most people don&#8217;t know the difference. And that&#8217;s probably fair. It&#8217;s more that the key difference really is just from, like, I guess, the marketing perspective of your actual, let&#8217;s say, stablecoin. Like, really, this comes back to probably what happened during TERA. And I guess TERA were pitched as this stablecoin. But as I touched on earlier, that that stablecoin trial, they weren&#8217;t even emphasizing stability. They were basically sacrificing stability in favor of basically everything else. So yeah, it&#8217;s kind of just from, like, I guess, maybe like a consumer point of view and being fair to the customer or the consumer about the real risks of the product. And you shouldn&#8217;t really be advertising yourself as stable unless you are literally backed by maybe like 100% cash or money market funds, treasuries with less than like a 90 day maturity even because I guess even we saw with USDC, there is that unhedgeable risk there that within USDC we saw in March 2023, I guess, this year. We saw that they basically had two long dated bonds and they had to redeem them below par. And then people were panicking about the peg of the stablecoin because they were taking such a hit on those bonds when they started selling them and to market them to market. So essentially, even like USDC and USDT, can we claim those are stable? Because even at USDT, they&#8217;re not fully transparent about the reserves. And if they have to redeem them all in a rush, are they ever true stablecoin as well? So perhaps maybe you can only advertise as a stablecoin. And this might be something that&#8217;s like part of this new stablecoin bill or something is that you&#8217;re fully kind of backed with 100% cash. And that&#8217;s fully a fair advertisement to the users of your product. Whereas at Ethena, we&#8217;re kind of being realistic in that there&#8217;s risks to the product and we&#8217;re trying to be as transparent about that. And we&#8217;re holding crypto native collateral. So I guess that in itself is a risk. We&#8217;re making steps obviously to hedge that price exposure on derivatives of markets, but we couldn&#8217;t. It probably felt unfair to users to turn around and say it&#8217;s a stablecoin. I think a synthetic dollar approach is better. Just kind of setting expectations. Not that we&#8217;re saying we&#8217;re going to deviate from peg too much or anything like the expectations those hedges will be more or less perfectly aligned and they&#8217;ll offset each other. And you have this synthetic dollar position at the end of that yet. Calling it a stablecoin is too broad a brush, I guess, to be to be painting these things with that we should be kind of more nuanced about it. And if you aren&#8217;t backed by 100% cash or treasury bonds with less than 90 day maturity, you should probably have to call yourself something else. Just so you&#8217;re being fair to users and users can kind of better understand the risks of the product because that&#8217;s what we should really get better at as an industry, I guess, is that better transparency, not trying to pretend to be something you&#8217;re not. And just, yeah, I guess just being fully, fully transparent about any kind of risk of the product. So users know what they&#8217;re getting into.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, well said. That was the base takeaway that I learned when doing research from the show as well. Because I know you just touched on one of the most important points, which is the 90 day kickbacks. Like, and I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have Paolo Ardoino, who&#8217;s not the CEO of Tether on the pod a couple times. Their balance sheet is absolutely absurd. Like they have billions and billions of T-bills, 90 day bangers, you name it. They are literally one of the biggest companies, I assume, in the world for US T-bills that isn&#8217;t like a sovereign wealth fund or a country. Like it&#8217;s wild to think that a cryptocurrency is so intertwined and so tethered, you know, play on words with the UST. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
And I think they only have like 50 employees or something as well. It&#8217;s like, they&#8217;re probably the per employee, they&#8217;re the most profitable company like in the world, full stop nearly. It&#8217;s not, yeah. I could talk about Tether for days probably.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Yeah, no go give me give me a little riff about tether. What&#8217;s your I&#8217;m sure you get off to the time like</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, that was a big question of journalists before. Maybe it&#8217;s not specific to Tether, but I guess maybe centralized stablecoins. Just this model of internalizing all the yields of your product and externalizing all the risk of like depeg to users. So there&#8217;s like this, obviously, 120 billion worth of stablecoin market cap, and that&#8217;s 120 billion of stablecoin demand that&#8217;s not yield bearing. And that&#8217;s if there&#8217;s that much demand for like a non yield bearing product where users are taking on all the risk and not getting any reward for it. What&#8217;s the market then for hopefully like a product that looks like that that actually returns yield back to the user of like 5% or 10%, which is what I think about like, yeah, so it&#8217;s this model of like return free risk. And as I said, Tether were more more profitable than like BlackRock last quarter or something just because they&#8217;re sitting on this gold mine, essentially a 5% cash bonds, and then they don&#8217;t pay any of that to users. But that goes back down to I guess this demand for stablecoins and that&#8217;s the fascinating part of it is that there&#8217;s so many people out there that are desperate for these like borderless permissionless dollar denominated assets that are on chain to transfer that to like whether and it sounds probably ridiculous to us. We&#8217;re not really the subject of any kind of government tyranny or like heavy inflation or anything like that. But we&#8217;re seeing it in Argentina now we&#8217;re seeing it in bunch of South American countries where their their currency is getting inflated away and they would love to have their savings denominated in a dollar asset, which stablecoins gives them the chance to they can do that and they can do that in a borderless fashion. So that&#8217;s probably where this demand is coming from it and obviously transacting on chain and everything but there&#8217;s a significant portion there of this demand that just really wants a dollar denominated asset. So hopefully bringing that on chain with yeah crypto native collateral is interesting as well. But yeah, I think in a few years time there&#8217;d be a kind of bigger percentage share of that stablecoin market is yield bearing and actually returning some of that yield that they&#8217;re just banking basically on behalf of users back to the users.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Have you seen, my apologies I should know his name. My apologies to all my Argentinian friends here. The new, it starts with an M, the new president. Miliere, whatever. That guy is a loony. He&#8217;s an absolute lunatic. I love him. He&#8217;s like a kind of cool guy.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s just like what they&#8217;ve tried as we worked. So try something new and that seems to be something new.</p>
<p>Matt Zahab<br />
I would love to have a couple of pints with that guy, although I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s a pints guy. I think he&#8217;s like a not a micro dosing mushrooms guy either. I think he&#8217;s like a macro dose kind of guy. Like I think he loves to get after it. And he&#8217;s like, you know, he&#8217;s turpin liberals. He&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know if you saw that video on Twitter where it&#8217;s like ministry of sport and tourism gone, ministry of health gone. Like he&#8217;s a lunatic. So I mean, he&#8217;s all for Bitcoin. And he even would love to, I mean, I don&#8217;t know how one could abolish a central bank. I know that&#8217;s what he wants to do to the Argentine central bank. I don&#8217;t know how you would ever do that. I feel like there&#8217;s just too much debt and it&#8217;s a shitshow that&#8217;s too big and the fire&#8217;s far too wide and far too hot that you could ever put that out. It&#8217;s obviously way out of my pay grade. But yeah, just very cool to see what he might be able to do. Conor, we are getting a little tight for time. A couple more questions and then we&#8217;ll wrap up and you&#8217;ve been on an absolute heater, just an absolute rule by the way. So thanks again for doing this, but stablecoins and synthetic dollars. A lot of people are getting spooked out by the US dollar. Talking about how the war dollar and the petrol dollar will finally lose its reign as the number one and most powerful currency in the world. You, your team, many others are in the camp that stablecoins can help maintain US dollar dominance. I am also in this camp. There&#8217;s a reason why we don&#8217;t have a stablecoin euro or for my country, for example, Canada, there&#8217;s not a single chance. There&#8217;s not a snowball&#8217;s chance in Haiti that we&#8217;re ever going to see a frigging actual prominent one because we&#8217;re just such a joke when it comes to anything. Financial or economical or startup related, but how can synthetic dollars or stable coins help maintain US dollar dominance, despite all of the other efforts from countries to move away from the US dollar?</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, well, it&#8217;s definitely as we touched on earlier, it&#8217;s like Tether or something like the 16th largest sovereign wealth holder of US Treasuries, I think, which is pretty nuts to think about. And I guess if your theory is that the dollar kind of demand is waning, this is probably a source of dollar demand that we talked about. And that&#8217;s probably at like a market bottom as well. So like the demand for stablecoins right now, I guess should have been at a market like bottom. And we only see that increasing hopefully as time goes on and stablecoins kind of grow as a percentage of crypto market cap is in the trillions where stablecoins are just kind of like 100 and 120 billion. So yeah, that&#8217;s hopefully a super interesting part. It&#8217;s like driving that demand for US Treasuries. And that&#8217;s probably a reason why then US regulators probably are taking it a bit more seriously now. And they&#8217;re starting to try and push this stablecoin bill through is because what we&#8217;ve seen is that they like basically DUS is whole and MO is exporting financial goods and services. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve been called that forever and exporting the dollar as well. And what we&#8217;ve seen as far as stablecoins are concerned is that the majority of stablecoin issuers now are moving offshore and tether dominance is rising. Whereas you see like USDC market cap is falling and the percentage for at the start of 2023, the percentage of offshore versus US issuers was 50-50 in terms of stablecoin market cap. And now that&#8217;s moved to like 75% offshore and 25% on. So yeah, the US is kind of losing its hold of this demand for dollars essentially. And that&#8217;s all moving to offshore issuers like Tether, who are now one of the most profitable companies in the world. And the US regulator is going to start taking that seriously. So they showed like it&#8217;s a big factor, a big use case for US Treasuries, I guess, is sitting back in the decentralized stablecoins. And there you have PayPal, USD entering the space as well. And that should only kind of exacerbate that impact as well. But yeah, it&#8217;s definitely, yeah, I&#8217;m in the camp of the dollarization. It is like a real thing and doesn&#8217;t don&#8217;t think dollar dominance is going anywhere anytime soon. And yeah, as I said, you just need to look at crypto. It&#8217;s like 99% of volumes are dollars rather than any other currency. So people in like other nations, as I said, Argentina and South America, they want their savings to nominate in US dollars if they can get it. And they&#8217;re doing that now via stablecoins, which is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Very true. Last question here, Conor. Then we&#8217;ll wrap up. Let&#8217;s talk about use cases. Again, this is one of the things that I get asked all the time, Matt. Yeah, so cool. You talk about Tether or I will wear my Tether hat around. I&#8217;ll wear one of my crypto shirts around. Gave me some real world use cases. And again, we live in Canada. Yes, our currency, most of my network, excuse me, lives in Canada. Yes, we have lost a decent amount, nothing compared to the Argentinas or the turkeys of the world who literally have lost upwards of 90% of their purchasing power. For the people in the Eurozone, United States and Canada, who all have good currencies and who live in G8 countries, what would you tell them when they&#8217;re like, hey, Conor, what kind of stablecoin adoption are we looking at? And what kind of real world use cases do we have to look forward to?</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s a good question. And yeah, the kind of point I had, or like, this is just like a personal point and maybe probably a few people in a team as well as that stablecoins are the killer app of crypto. And there&#8217;s a lot of use cases on chain where you see just people like playing with NFTs and profile picture NFTs and stuff. And I think we&#8217;ve that was kind of a flash in the pan. And that&#8217;s like, not it really, we need to kind of go back to one of the actual use cases. And as I said, we&#8217;ve touched on it already is probably stablecoins and transferring dollars on chain. And to me, that&#8217;s the biggest use case. Like, even for, let&#8217;s say, like, we&#8217;re not looking to like invest all our savings in dollar dominated assets, because myself and yourself are in hopefully stable enough currencies. But like, a perfect example would be like, I went to a soccer match in Paris with an ex American colleague. And we were trying to figure out how to send each other money. And we couldn&#8217;t do it without taking like three or four days or like a bank transfer. It was just a nightmare. So what do we do? We turn around and just send each other USDC, which was actually like a pretty cool moment for us both like to crypto maxis, but for us both to be like actually like crypto self to a real life problem there, as stupid as that sounds, but that&#8217;s actually kind of where we&#8217;re at. So in terms of use cases, I think stablecoins still can serve a purpose for people that aren&#8217;t looking to get out of inflationary currencies. The whole point of stablecoins is I guess yet making dollar transfers kind of permissionless and borderless and cutting out the middleman there because the banking sector is one of the only kind of sectors that hasn&#8217;t been innovated in the last like 50 or 60 years, like 60 years ago, it&#8217;s still took like two or three days to do a wire transfer still the same now, which is just nuts. So I think the stablecoins for me are just the killer use case and we can talk for days about other use cases on chain and playing with kind of yeah, derivatives or gambling on chain or anything like that. But to me, stablecoins are that killer use case. And that&#8217;s what we really need to kind of hold in on it and start building around like infrastructure and payment infrastructure for them. And they&#8217;re super interesting use cases there, hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Conor, truly a great episode. Thank you so much for coming on, mate. Really appreciate it. Before we let you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Ethena online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Yeah, so my Twitter is just @ConorRyder. The Twitter for Ethena is @ethena_labs. We just came out last week with kind of all of our public facing documentation. So we have like a really extensive GIP book and hopefully some of the most like extensive documents that are out there right now. We&#8217;ve got like a 100 answer FAQ that we released on Notion as well. So you&#8217;ll see the links on Twitter and have a read through them and hit me up if you have any questions. But yeah, we&#8217;re pretty happy with the standard of docs we&#8217;ve put out and there&#8217;s plenty for people to get their teeth into there</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Amazing. Thanks again, Conor. Appreciate it. This was truly a blast and would love to have you on more often, as I know we barely even got into the current crypto market stuff, but I know that you are incredibly in tune in all of this as well. It&#8217;s your day job. You are head of research. You&#8217;re doing research all day long. We love that. And hopefully you can have you on as a recurring guest, but thanks. Really appreciate it and can&#8217;t wait for round two.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Ryder</strong><br />
Definitely Matt. Cheers. Thanks Matt.</p>

<h3>Full Transcript Of The Interview</h3>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Cryptonews Podcast. It&#8217;s your host, Matt Zahab. We are buzzing as always. And I&#8217;m super pumped to have today&#8217;s guest on the show. This gentleman might have the nicest and best beard in all of the crypto sphere. We have Frederik Gregaard, coming in hot today, the CEO of the Cardano Foundation, a true leader in fintech and blockchain, who has a background in banking, and wealth management and asset management. He joined the Cardano Foundation in 2020 and leads work across the Foundation&#8217;s three core focus areas, operational resilience, education, and adoption. These focuses guide all of the Foundation&#8217;s activities, and his work has enabled expedited value creation for inclusive and equitable growth using Cardano with the overall goal of decentralized, efficient, and secure economic empowerment for all. Been waiting for this one for a hot minute. Super pumped to have this lad on. Fred, welcome to the show, my friend. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I&#8217;m doing excellent. Thank you for asking and thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Pumped to have you. I got to start with the beard. You have the most electric beard in all the crypto. How long have you been supporting that bad boy for?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a really good question. I don&#8217;t know, like eight, nine years probably, something like that. When I started losing my top hair, I was getting really frustrated. I thought, hey, what can I do? And it turns out I can grow a beard.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Have you ever, so it&#8217;s been eight years, even me. I mean, I think I&#8217;ve gone baby face, I want to say two or three times in the last three years. And every time I do, I&#8217;m always like, holy crap, you look so young, like you look so different. Have you ever put yourself in any of those like AI image generators to see what you look like without the beard?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
No, I haven&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ve been dappling into AI and also longevity treatments for quite a long time in terms of sort of projection also where society goes. So I put myself into one of these aging things, right? But not just an aging things in terms of, you know, an image of me looking really old, but also sort of like where you get into a virtual reality experience and you actually sort of experience based on some life choices, how you will be in your age, right? So in this case, it was a virtual reality experience where I was, I think, 115 years old and I was sitting in this flat and I was having problems moving. And that was definitely not the place I wanted to be, right? Because it was sort of like a two room apartment with no view and, you know, there was a microwave oven. It was not a lot of green and sustainable food, right? It was sort of packaged food I was supposed to eat and that came sort of elated to sort of mend me and treat me. And, you know, it opens a few eyes, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
100%. No, I love how we started this. Before we get into Cardano Foundation and obviously your business past, I&#8217;d love to let myself and the listeners learn a little bit more about the guy who is running Cardano Foundation more on the personal life, some habits, some rituals, maybe even we can keep buzzin on the longevity aspect. Me myself, I&#8217;m a big sauna ice bath guy. I know everyone thinks it&#8217;s cheesy, but it makes me feel incredible. It&#8217;s an easy way to get the heart rate up. Whenever I get out of an ice bath, I feel like I&#8217;m Superman. It&#8217;s only time today. I feel like a superhero. The dopamine lasts for literally hours. Do you have any rituals or habits that really move the deal for you?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, I tried to get out in nature. So at the moment, I&#8217;m fortunately injured because I did some very big projects over the summer. But a couple of times a year, I go for a very long run in the mountains. And I learned a lot by being in nature, specifically in remote nature. And one of the things I use the most, sort of in my daily job, is the ability to ask for help. And sometimes you can be a kind of a proud person and you say, I know everything, I&#8217;m the CEO, and I&#8217;m supposed to be able to have all professions sort of catered into one personality. But that&#8217;s simply isn&#8217;t the case. So this ability to ask for help is very strong. And then the other part is the humility when you&#8217;re out in nature and you feel the vibrance and the sunlight and the ice going through the glacier seas and stuff like that. It&#8217;s just very cool.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
It&#8217;s the absolute best. When you&#8217;re saying long runs, how long are we talking here?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
So I think the longest sort of recorded run I have is probably around 240 miles. So that&#8217;s quite a distance. And I tend to sort of be in the range of 100, 240 miles. And I do that maybe twice, three times a year. But it&#8217;s sort of always sort of special projects, you know, a special community where you can give something back. It&#8217;s always in the mountains. It&#8217;s sort of always tend to be sort of somewhere remote.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
And it&#8217;s crazy the mental clarity you get from going on a long walk or a long run, just like all the clutter, all the nonsense, all the BS, I always find it just always goes away. I absolutely love that. Let&#8217;s jump into your past here before becoming CEO of Cardano Foundation. Fintech Background did a whole bunch. Walk me through a little bit about what you did, and then we&#8217;ll get into the Cardano and all the crypto fund stuff here.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Oh yeah, where should we start? Just before I, you know, Cardano was working for PWC and I built up two things with PWC. I built up what&#8217;s called the blockchain go to markets, including sort of the general strategy. So that includes advisory, audit and legal and so on. And then I built up and we call it an experience center. And many people went there to get exposure to emerging technology, whether there was sensors or AI or machine learning or blockchain. Or whatever that was. But the true nature of the experience center was actually using something called MG Taylor, which is a methodology made by an architect and a Montessori kindergarten teacher, which is about how you align a large group of people. So imagine if you could take 50 to 100 people into a room, lock them in for two days, and you don&#8217;t manipulate them, you don&#8217;t, you know, force and view down on them, you find a topic which they&#8217;re completely aligned on and you let them lose into a business. And that basically accelerates businesses incredible, right? Because, you know, you suddenly don&#8217;t have 100 individuals, you have like an army of change makers which you&#8217;re sending back into the business. So it uses a lot of elements from design thinking, from, you know, smells. So we already had several ovens in the facility in PWC. We&#8217;re always baking bread. So then when people came in, the sort of the sensors were opening up for that smell. We were playing music. We had a grand piano there. Of course, it was machine learning and AI enabled, but we had a grand piano. And if you have a large group of people, there&#8217;s always somebody who can play the piano and it&#8217;s very rare you can do that on a grand piano, right? So, you know, we use sort of different elements to basically open up people&#8217;s life and facades and take away those things and let them be humans interacting with humans and let them be motivated about the things they are motivated about and then basically get the business out of them and then send them back with a, you know, a plan and how they work together to enable large changes in organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. And this was developed by a kindergarten teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, an American kindergarten teacher and she uses a philosophical Montessori, which I think probably a lot of people have heard about. And then an architect, you know, a house architect basically thinking about buildings and you know, how should rooms be constructed? So they were looking at the world and they found that the world was sort of not really going in the direction where there was more love and more alignment and more sort of positive things coming out of humanity was more going in a direction where we saw that people were seeing more disaster, more macroeconomic disaster events, more, you know, evil centralization of power to the wrong persons, et cetera. And they said, you know, what can we do with the skillsets we had? And then they invented this called MG Taylor, which is now sort of a subgroup of people. It&#8217;s probably close to a thousand people worldwide working with this methodology. And it&#8217;s literally changing war zones today. So some of my colleagues has been working on stopping wars. Most other has been working with United Nations World Economic Forum. I spent some time both with the World Economic Forum but also with blockchain. That&#8217;s actually how I came in contact with Charles Hodgkinson was due to some of the work I did there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. And Fred, you just teed me up for my next question here. Taking this job must have been, again, you had multiple incredible jobs at very high level firms, obviously PWC, even the big four consulting firms as well. This must have been a bit of a headscratcher or perhaps I&#8217;m wrong. And it was a no brainer. But when you took this job and when you met Charles, what were sort of the key factors that made you be like, damn, I got to do this.I got to help take this thing to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I was probably my daughter. I was actually thinking I would go back into banking and build a bank for the actual users of the bank and really align the incentives because the thing banking has gone astray is not really helping the people who really need the expertise. So I was thinking and going back to banking and Cardano was one of my clients, you can say, in advisory, right? And then one day my daughter woke up and she had a nightmare and she came down to me and I had sort of basement office and she was asking, you know, crying and said, you know, what are you doing dad? And I was like, well, I&#8217;m helping some dude earn more money. You know, and she was like, why? And I was like, well, I actually don&#8217;t know because I already took the decision to leave PWC and I was sort of like, yeah, why am I actually sitting up at two o &#8216;clock messing with my, you know, a sleep schedule and, you know, away from my family to help somebody, you know, earn more money on an account. He was not really caring about anyway. So, you know, after she left and I talked to her in and she fell asleep, I was sort of thinking about, you know, maybe as an investment banker, there is another route I could do. So I started looking into my portfolio and, you know, I think I was always very impressed by Cardano, specifically the vision and the mission. The purpose of Cardano is so different than many of the other blockchains back then. So I thought, hey, this is actually a way where I can, you know, deploy my skill set and do something with the bank I normally can&#8217;t do. And that is to be a part of potentially, you know, I was about to say saving the world, but that sounds so big, right? But at least ensure that the world becomes a better place for every working day I have compared to just optimizing money in a pyramid scheme somewhere in another industry.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s wild. This is also a masterclass in storytelling. My goodness. I&#8217;ll be listening to this over and over again. This is an absolute masterclass. We just touched on Cardano and he talks about, you briefed on Cardano&#8217;s foundation and obviously not the Cardano foundation, but it&#8217;s foundational elements and three core focus areas, operational resilience, education and adoption. I absolutely love this. I think this needs to be injected into everyone&#8217;s veins in the crypto space and everyone who wants to learn more and jump in as well. I&#8217;d love if you could touch on these three core points, why they&#8217;re so important and how you and the team are moving the needle to bring the next million users into Web3.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Sure. So we have a concept in the Cardano Foundation called blockchain for good. And I think not knowing your listeners, I need to go one step back before we go to blockchain for good. So just keep that as an anchor point. But if you think about what truly makes a public permissionless blockchain special, is the ability that it does not cancel everybody out. It doesn&#8217;t belong to the canceled culture. It does not belong to the culture where you have to be born in a certain country to have a certain identity, to be able to get access to health care, to capital market services or just to vote or whatever that might be. And we have about two billion people around the world who actually don&#8217;t have an identity. And we have a huge digital divide between the people who has and the people who haven&#8217;t. So unfortunately, the way the world is structured at the moment is that everything is centered around this sort of centralized identity service, which you cannot create yourself where you&#8217;re depending on certain trust anchors or institutions who gives you the access permissions to be you, to be who you are. And that, of course, is very dangerous when you then come and say, no, everybody can gain value from Cardano. Everybody can contribute to Cardano and everybody can take something from Cardano and bring that back to your community. Because what it also does is it battles or dabbles with the control, you know, the enforcement control, which we built into society to ensure that people behave, right? And it also says, you know, we are not the one who polices the blockchain. The blockchain is a social good, is a utility. So when the Cardano Foundation speaks about blockchain for good, we mean it in two aspects. The first aspect is sort of an ESG aspect, right? What we&#8217;re saying, you know, if something is available for everybody to do and there is an information asymmetry, and I think about when the start of the internet came, there is a couple of use cases where it&#8217;s very frequently being used, so very few people benefit on behalf of the masses. So you&#8217;re actually saying you&#8217;re seeing a well skewing in the wrong direction, right? So we set forward to say, OK, what can we do? And how can we measure us externally to ensure that we can open up the eyes for what&#8217;s possible to add value to the global society or the spaceship we call Earth today to bring people more together and to show that blockchain can be used for social good? That&#8217;s why we did the tree planting project called Very Tree in Kenya where we got close to planting a million trees where every single tree is actually an NFT who lives on the blockchain. And you can verify who was the planter, and you can get data, so dynamic metadata on a quarterly basis that the tree actually exists and there&#8217;s no double counting. That means it doesn&#8217;t go into the normal greenwashing and all those things you see there. But it&#8217;s also the same rationality and why we work with United Nations, humanitarian crisis organizations and so on. So the idea here is really we&#8217;re taking, OK, if we are not policing the blockchain and we don&#8217;t have a view, we need an external framework to define what is good. And there we use United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. And there&#8217;s 17 of those and we say it has to take a few boxes, huh?  The other part of blockchain for good, sort of the double meaning of the word, is the longevity. So the Cardano Foundation is into the longevity of blockchain. This is a marathon, an ultramarathon. It&#8217;s not a sprint. So most blockchains, they are actually not economically sustainable. And that means that they will run out of juice or gas or funding or whatever you might call it over time, right? And what we&#8217;re really looking at is saying we need to get to a situation that the blockchain becomes immortal. If you want to get to a situation that the blockchain becomes immortal and truly fulfills the promises of being there for humanity across the generations and centuries to come, we need to get to a situation that when you go to a dinner party and you bring your own food to the dinner party, there&#8217;s always too much food because you have this mentality that you bring a little bit more than you can eat yourself. If you go to a centralized dinner party, if I&#8217;m cooking for you, right, you&#8217;ll probably eat all my meat and drink my red wine and you eat too much, really, because it was good, right? And we&#8217;re actually short of resources. So what I&#8217;m trying to say is that these blockchains to be immortal, we need transaction diversity at a scale who covers the incentives for the generations to come. And nearly no blockchain, if any at all, has solved that yet. Therefore, the Cardano Foundation set forward and said, if we look at those two use cases, those two hypothesis of how to enable that, what do we need to do? And the first thing we came to was saying, we have already over a thousand companies who&#8217;s deployed in Cardano. If you want to have business critical infrastructure or humanity critical infrastructure or identity on Cardano, operation resilience is very important. And as you probably know as being a blockchain affinato, the way the blockchain is structured is a complete different security architecture than what we know from the internet and other settings. And that means that for us, operation resilience is one of those things you cannot go down on. I&#8217;ve been quoted at the moment for saying, boring is good, right? So Cardano has actually been up since 2017. It never missed a beat and we processed over 78.3 million transactions or something like that, right? So it&#8217;s really a lot. And we have no downtime, knock on wood. And what we&#8217;re basically doing with the foundation is we have built a real-time network monitoring tool, including the ability to look into the networking stack and other things to ensure that when things are happening, we have a pre-warning, we have ideas about how to do disaster recovery in a decentralized distributed network. We have experts who understand this is again a little bit boring, sorry about that. What&#8217;s the key point when SOC 1 is, which is really these kind of risk mitigations you use when you run a central bank or if you run a hospital or if you run, you know, pacemakers and stuff like that. You cannot just produce a pacemaker and get a hospital to put it in. You need to go through a set of qualifications who allows you to do that. So that&#8217;s the operation resilience. We truly believe that if a blockchain is fast and brave, that&#8217;s probably not what you want if this is going to be the foundations of society forever, right? You want something who is peer-reviewed, academic, who has a very tough operation resilience, specifically when you know that the product to market fit is not a straight fit, right? So if you look around the blockchain and crypto world, we have all these discussions about the regulatory environment in the US and we have all these, you know, what is the use cases and maybe blockchain had over promised a bit. And what that basically tells you is that the actual huge use cases of blockchain in the future has not been there yet. They&#8217;re coming, huh? So you need a way also to adapt the code base to ensure that this product to market fit in the future will be there. Now how do you adapt the code base? Well you have to start thinking about who is going to tell you what features they need in order for them to use the blockchain. Secondly, do you pay them for it or do they do it because there&#8217;s business value? And therefore education actually became a very important part of us because when we looked into the education landscape, everybody speaks about tokenization, everybody speaks about CBDCs, everybody speaks about Bitcoin, people speaks about how Ethereum was able to replace Wall Street in capital assimilation. But they don&#8217;t speak about identity in Ethiopia for students. They don&#8217;t speak about supply chain for 100,000 bottles of wine from 22 different wineries signed off by the National Wine Agency in Georgia. They don&#8217;t speak about scattered random diamonds who can be injected in cancer medicine so you can track and ensure that that is the exact medicine. Now that&#8217;s what we are touching upon in the Cardano Foundation because we think this is actually what&#8217;s going to kickstart the blockchain revolution. So this part of having free available high quality education who can get business people to understand the magic what engineers and IT people already know so they can understand where does the use case fit and where doesn&#8217;t it fit is why education is so important. Secondly, by writing these scripts as the foundation has now done in public, where you can get that for free, you can translate it, you can build an app on it, you can do whatever you want with it, it&#8217;s under an open source or public source license. So that basically means that there&#8217;s a business model to be had to do it in Arabic or to do it in Japanese and do a learning platform. But we provide all the content for free because we want the whole world to understand blockchain, not just Cardano. And the other part of that is of course when you look into the regulatory space, which is difficult, right? Because as I told you in the start, when you have public permission as blockchains, you&#8217;re giving away enforcement power, right? What it really does is it opens up the opportunity to address the regulator and tell them about that blockchain is more than capital markets. The blockchain is more than a utility token or security token. The blockchain is value creation, is job creation, is changes democracy, it does a lot of things, right? So this ability for us to do that also led us to building a REC TEK tool. So I think we are the only Layer 1 blockchain we ever built a REC TEK tool for policy makers and regulators who basically takes down the pants of a blockchain and says, you know what? We are very open to talk to you about staking. We are open to talk to you about incentives. So let us tell you how exactly staking works in Cardano. And you will find there&#8217;s no slashing, there&#8217;s no login mechanism or period, there&#8217;s no ownership change. So if you look into current capital markets infrastructure, you can now see with your own eyes why we are different than many others. And not only can you see that, you can verify that all the way down to the actual blockchain and to the code, depending on your knowledge level. And then we took the educational content and we pushed that into that workflow diagram in our Explorer to show that. And we now been in contact in the last two, three months, I think, with close to 10 different regulators and enforcement agencies and showed them this. And they are just like completely excited. One of them said, you&#8217;re bringing trust back into blockchain, which I think is a very powerful statement, but also is a testament to where we as an industry might have misjudged the environment a little bit. So those two anchors into what we&#8217;re really trying to do with this adoption. So what you really need is you need a multitude of different use cases on the blockchain whether that&#8217;s Cardano&#8217;s blockchain or another one, is actually a little bit irrelevant. But you want to get as many people to live on the blockchain as possible, because specifically how Cardano works is that when you do a transaction on Cardano, the transaction fees is being rooted through the treasury into the incentive structure, and that basically pays the state pool operators for operating Cardano. So the more transactions you have, and the more diversity in transactions, and the more they use the blockchain for what it was meant to do, so smart contracts and native assets, the higher is the transaction fee is by the way the terministic fees in Cardano, so you can calculate that down to the cent, the more economic sustainable it becomes. So this anchors into this sort of idea about blockchain for good, right? That you need to have those components in place to allow the legacy world, the Web2 world, but also the legacy in real world, you know, the supply chain companies and commodity companies and supermarkets to go on a blockchain, you need to answer a few questions and you need to show that your technology stack is ready for that.</p>

I love that. Fred that was absolutely electric. I love the spiel there. So many points we can touch on. We do need to give our sponsor of the show a quick shout out. But before then, one of my favorite things that you just discussed in that little spiel was just one of the best things about Cardano and you said, it&#8217;s a little boring and it&#8217;s sexy. It&#8217;s a little boring and it&#8217;s a little unsexy. It does what needs to be done. It is a perfect layer for powering all these applications and projects that want to come on the blockchain and a shit ton, pardon my French, of real world applications. And that&#8217;s what we need for the blockchain to grow. It can&#8217;t just be, hey, we&#8217;re a coin, number go up, number go down. The financial incentives needs to go away. There needs to be some real world use cases and we are going to get into that in one second folks. But until then, huge shout out to our sponsor of the show, longtime friends of cryptonews.com and longtime friends of the Cryptonews Podcast. You know who we&#8217;re talking about. That is PrimeXBT. They offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layout and widgets to best fit your trading style and take advantage of their highly reliable market data and performance.

That is CRYPTONEWS50, all one word to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. Now back to the show with Fred. Fred, let&#8217;s jump into some of the recent projects that you and the team have done at Cardano Foundation. I am not going to lie. I love a good glass of vino every once in a while. Red, white, rose, you name it. When I was doing research for the show, I learned about the George and Wine partnership. That is so friggin&#8217; cool. You got to give us the TLDR. What happened there? How did you guys make this happen? I think this is absolutely brilliant and I would love for more of this to happen in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Wow, the truth of this is probably starting all the way back in the Soviet Union. So when the Soviet Union collapsed, something new happened. And that is what people don&#8217;t realize is that wine was most likely invented in Georgia. But under the Soviet Union, they were only allowed to market their product within the Soviet Union. So when the Italian wine and Spanish wine were sort of living on this marketing grace, you know, and building these strong for the world&#8217;s best wine, well, they had communism, right? But it means also that for them, wine is their identity. Every single family nearly has their own wine receipts and they work together with local vineyards and so on. So when we came in contact with the agricultural ministry there, what we learned was that the quality controls for their wine is extraordinary high. And they were talking about how do we export the Georgian culture and how do we show the world what Georgia is made of? You know, obviously they&#8217;re thinking about, you know, business opportunities, they&#8217;re thinking about tourism, they&#8217;re thinking about the country Georgia&#8217;s brand and what do they have to offer. And their wine was a big thing. So we were in competition with a couple of other blockchains, even a specific wine blockchain even, very specialized. And it turned out that due to us, you know, being who we are in terms of academic reviews and being able to answer those questions around disaster recovery and, you know, business continuity and all those kind of things, we were elected to do that. And we found a local partner in Switzerland because blockchain alone does not anchor into a physical product. So we worked together with a company called Scantrust who does high definition QR codes. And the first thing we did was authenticity. So the ability to authenticate that the wine you have is actually the real wine who comes from the fields. Right? So, you know, on the internet, you have all these sort of copycats and you never really know what you buy. And what I thought was, oh, hey, this is really good. This is engine room stuff. You know, this is about, you know, security and so on. But what it turns out was that this small winery was actually a female wine producer called Bayer. She got sold out of, you know, within for a year or something like that. So people in Norway and Korea was buying Georgian wine where there was never any commercials about Georgia at all. Because there&#8217;s a new generation on the internet with you and I probably belong to, which I think about as blockchain citizens. And we actually want to verify what we buy if that&#8217;s actually the right thing we buy, because we&#8217;ve been through the the treadmill of getting, you know, fake iPhones home or get, you know, Chinese copies or whatever it is. Right? And the other part was that she was able to very cheaply portray herself through the user experience. Right? So she could talk about her field and her history and those kind of things. And what we now done this year is we turned it from an authenticity solution into a track and trace solution. So we&#8217;re actually putting the right now just labeling it, but we&#8217;re talking about 100,000 bottles of wine from the region of Bolnisi. And what&#8217;s very interesting here is that the government of Georgia is signing every single bottle on the blockchain that has been through the export control, including customs are signing off when it leaves the country. And that means that you&#8217;re suddenly relying on something where this blockchain was made to do, but it&#8217;s very hard to do. And that&#8217;s something called verified credentials. So the ability to verify that you are the right trusted authority to sign this data on the blockchain. And you as a consumer will then be able, if it has a business value for you, to track every single one of those 100,000 bottles and get the story of the vineyard, including the fields and the grapes and the produce and all of that through the user experience. And you can then verify that with the, you know, national wine agency under the agricultural ministry. And you can, you know, see if it&#8217;s really true, right? So we do that together with Scantrust and the country of Georgia. And my hope is that here sort of in Q1 when they finish bottling, that&#8217;s going to be hitting, you know, worldwide. And everybody out there who buys a Bolnisi, one of those 100,000 bottles will be able to insight with the Cardano blockchain and understand a little bit better what blockchain actually can be used for, both in terms of exporting culture, but also in terms of verifying track and trace and authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
That&#8217;s so cool. I&#8217;m not here in Mexico at the moment on the east coast. And I&#8217;m, I do know a couple people in the wine game. So I&#8217;m going to be hitting them up after the show and I&#8217;ll see if I can get my hands on one of those bottles. That would be absolutely incredible. Also, thanks for the history lesson there. I did not know that Georgia was like the sort of birthplace of wine. I would have guessed it was like you said, you know, one of the Spain, Italy or France or one of the like, but so cool. Another topic I&#8217;d love to get into Fred is obviously the global blockchain landscape. Do you guys are front runners and leaders and actually speaking with the big boys and the big gals at the top of the food chains in the regulatory space? What are some of the conversations that are happening right now? I know you obviously can&#8217;t spill all the beans. I mean, we&#8217;d love a nice little breaking news flash on the Cryptonews pod, but what are some of the policy developments going on in the blockchain space right now from a regulatory standpoint?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Yeah, so to be honest, right now the US is actually quite quiet. And I know this sounds a bit odd, right? Because obviously you see a lot of headlines and so on. But, you know, I think we&#8217;re going into election season there, right? And all they&#8217;re building up cases or they&#8217;re running cases, right? In Europe, the big thing is MiCA. MiCA is sort of the, let&#8217;s call it the stable coin and a couple of other things, regulation on cryptocurrencies, which is coming into force. And there is a sort of a grace period to be compliant there. And there&#8217;s a couple of things, sort of curve balls who are thrown into that mix. And I think in a certain way, this is sort of is very good policymaking from the European Union. Conceptually, I&#8217;m a little bit questioning a few points. And one of the points is, I think you should not hinder innovation. So they&#8217;re basically protecting the inner market of the European Union and ensuring that if you are having a stable coin, it actually needs to be issued by somebody under MiCA license. So, for instance, probably see Tether and USDC and others will, you know, very quickly need to figure out how they get, you know, a European issue. But we&#8217;re already in discussions with MiCA 2. And MiCA 2 is going to cover more than stable coins and then utility tokens is also going to go into most likely things like NFTs and yield farming and staking and other things. And that&#8217;s going to be very interesting. And I hope that more Layer 1s will start engaging in that. Out of Japan is really interesting. They&#8217;ve come up with some really good regulation. It&#8217;s very protective, but it&#8217;s very clear. And as you probably know, Cardano and ADA, our utility token has been whitelisted to the JBCA there for years. So we&#8217;re really ready to engage. And we just spent some time together with the Swiss regulator in a workshop, but also the European banking authorities and European security and market authorities sort of like equivalent to the SEC and the FCA in the UK and showed them the REC TEK tool I spoke to about earlier. And the two things that really starting to ask questions about which are really interesting, the first one is they start understanding they cannot be technology agnostic. Before they were like, OK, a blockchain is a blockchain. It has to be fair game if it&#8217;s a blockchain. It&#8217;s equal. But now they&#8217;re saying, well, there&#8217;s so big differences in terms of the blockchain. It&#8217;s not just if it&#8217;s, you know, a proof of stake or proof of work. It&#8217;s actually also if it&#8217;s a proof of relevant history, a proof of history. But it&#8217;s also is it multi-party computation or zero knowledge proof. And, you know, what is the incentives in there? You know, do you have like a slashing or do you only have positive reinforcements like Cardano? So they&#8217;re really asking very good and detailed questions. And they were very positive when we showed them the Cardano Explorer with these regulatory tooling in there where they can verify how Cardano is built. The other thing we sort of surprised me a bit was that they had a lot of questions on business continuity and a disaster recovery. And what that makes it means is that they are not just looking and saying, OK, I have a little use case, a little token on top of a blockchain. Well, they actually start looking at, OK, they have requests from large counterparties to move some of the infrastructure who normally would be in a centralized, you know, environment to a distributed, decentralized environment. So they had really deep questions around, you know, block propagation around centralization of staking or mining, how you monitor the network, how you flag certain actions, can you do front running in and those kind of aspects. And luckily, I&#8217;m sort of coming from a world of building banks and my chief legal officer is coming from the Swiss regulators and he has a specialty in distributed systems. So we were able to have these dialogues with them. And I think on one hand, this is scary and on the other hand, this is very positive. I look at it very positively because it means that we are getting into the place where blockchain is accepted much more. But we are still playing a finite window where we could end up with some not so good regulation in terms of really utilizing the value of blockchain. So there is definitely if I have one cry out for your listeners, is find as many non financial use cases you can on a blockchain. Doesn&#8217;t matter which one and start tweeting about it, start talking about it, speak to your friends, do your elevator pitch? Because the more people realize that the blockchain is not associated with capital markets and banking only, but it&#8217;s a worldwide industry optimization game, the better it is for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. Very quickly, Fred, before we move on to our next question here, and I know we&#8217;re getting a little tight for time as well. The overall sentiment, though, from the regulators, there&#8217;s no way that it&#8217;s not better than what&#8217;s a couple of years ago. I feel like every couple of years, they become more educated. They learn more about blockchain as a whole and understand more potential use cases that are non-financial, incentive, and capital markets related. Would you say that that&#8217;s true?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
I think that&#8217;s true for some regulators. So I mean, I was a little bit scared of highlighting people or pointing fingers, right? But I would say definitely the Swiss regulator, Luxembourg, FCA, MIS in Singapore, Hong Kong, has definitely taken, and the European Union has taken huge steps forward. I really truly feel that. I think I can agree with your sentiment there.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
I love that. And last little thing, then we will wrap up here Fred, Cardano Foundation. You guys had an incredible year and obviously we are recording mid November. This episode will air mid to end ish November. You guys just did Cardano Summit 2023 in Dubai. That looked like an absolute bang or that looked like an incredible time. I&#8217;d love for you to touch on that. And then a little forward looking here, what&#8217;s on the docket for 2024? What do you have on the back burner? What are you in the plan? What are you and the team have planned for 2024? Can&#8217;t wait to see all this stuff pop off.</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
That was a good question. Let&#8217;s see where we start. I think what was truly unique about the Cardano Summit in Dubai, and by the way, we did 30 different locations around the world at the same time as we did Dubai, so plus minus two weeks. So it&#8217;s not just Dubai is really around the world. I think what people really paid attention to was the fact that we had regulators and policymakers to a Layer 1 event present, but not just present like members of parliament in the actual crowd. We had them on the stage, really discussing and nearly brainstorming each other with how we do and how we can do better in enabling that. So a big thank you for the city of Dubai to basically host us there. The other part was the attendance. What a lot of people told me was, hey, this doesn&#8217;t feel like a crypto bro event. This feels like industry blockchain. We had the World Trade Organization there. We had the United Nations there. We had Fortune 500 companies. We had large industry companies like Trade Zones, who has 23,000 companies in their trade zone who was there. And that combined with all the engineers and the blockchain affinados who were sort of mixing together and finding out what works and doesn&#8217;t work and signing deals and doing things. So I think this dynamic where you really feel the blockchain is getting maturing in terms of the industry adoption, I think that was fantastic and really high quality content as well. If you miss some of it, some of the YouTube videos is now live. And specifically some of this stuff on the technical side, with side chains and interoperability, its identity is really key to understanding where blockchain is today. On your other question, so what&#8217;s happening next year? So Operation Resilience will continue. I think we will never stop there. So Operation Resilience, Mainnet Monitoring, Cybersecurity, Bug Bounty and those kind of aspects. I think this is truly important. As you&#8217;ve probably seen, Cardano is the large Layer 1 who has the most GitHub commits, right? So it basically means we are adding more and more code as more and more companies are relying on Cardano. And that obviously means that we need to be much more careful there and we need to get the right Q&amp;A and things in process. The other thing which you can expect as you&#8217;re going to see a lot more open source from us. So already this year we did Python libraries and Java libraries, but most importantly we did a project called Icon Boot Flap from the Foundation in full open source. And if you saw the adoption circle, so the amount of time it took to develop this in the true open source format and the amount of adoption, plus that it actually is 10 times faster and 10 times easier than the original smart contracting language on Cardano, you got to be wondering, isn&#8217;t that the future for solving the product to market fit on blockchain, right? I think this is like true amazing. So we&#8217;re going to build on this icon, which is called, on the learnings there and also our connections to the Linux Foundation and the Apache Foundation and what we learned and interacting in those ecosystems. And then we&#8217;re going to do a lot more in open source and not just sort of small things, but we&#8217;re really going to try and see if we can push the envelope there. Then Technical Enablers is still a big thing. So you saw our ledger sync came out this year, which is a database you can see. We did some changes to the command line interface and we did some changes to&#8230; a couple of other things. So what we&#8217;re hoping to get out with is what we call a metadata bus, which we already, actually, Bolnisi Wine is living on that. So think about a combination of how you structure metadata, identity and transaction building in a tool. So basically to lower the cost of operating on Cardano. So tooling and those kind of things is some of the things we really want to deliver, but tooling in a way that business architects can get full value of it. And then obviously we are, as you know, in Cardano, we are in the age of Voltaire, which is the governance era. So we&#8217;re going to, hopefully, we&#8217;ve been working very hard on that with the community. We had over 50 workshops around the world. We&#8217;re going to vote in the, what we call the Cardano Improvement Proposal, CIP 1694, which is the tooling for true decentralized governance. So it&#8217;s voting and PKI&#8217;s and a lot of beautiful things that really allows the community to take over the lead on decision making. And so that&#8217;s going to be really cool. And then there&#8217;s going to be a longer discussion and hopefully a finalization of what we think about as the guardrails for Cardano. Because when you have something as big as Cardano, what you want to do is you want to keep the essence of Cardano or make it very hard to change, but still you can change it, right? And then smaller things like transaction fees or, you know, other things, block sizes that you can very easily change that as sort of when you need to, right? So then these are different in terms of the democracy there and some safeguards around that. So that&#8217;s going to be one of the last work chunks we&#8217;re going to do next year as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Incredible. Fred what an episode you were a human electric factory today and very grateful and Incredibly pumped to have you on hopefully we can do this again in the future Before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Cardano Foundation online and on socials?</p>
<p><strong>Frederik Gregaard</strong><br />
Sure. So, cardanofoundation.org is the best place to find the Cardano Foundation. We would like to have a new, more exciting webpage and we will have that in the future. cardano.org is a very good place to go, specifically the forum. In the forum there&#8217;s a lot of different threads, also in different languages, and the community is one of the biggest, if not the biggest and best community in the whole blockchain. So if you can&#8217;t find anything, just write help somewhere and the community is super helpful. There&#8217;s also a whole set of Discord channels and then there&#8217;s our developer portal. So if you go on our developer portal through cardano.org you can see use cases, containers, tooling and other things that can help get you started. And then we have a large sort of venture funding bootstrapping system called Catalyst. And on Catalyst you have the ability to look for funding or look for business partners and other things. So that&#8217;s also a cool place. I&#8217;m not so active on socials to be honest, but you can find me on Twitter and on LinkedIn under @F_Gregaard or Frederik Gregaard on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Zahab</strong><br />
Amazing. Frederik, thank you so much, incredible episode. And hope to have you on for round two, wishing you and the team all the best moving forward. This was incredible. Thanks again, mate.</p>
