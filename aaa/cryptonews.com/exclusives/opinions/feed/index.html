										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The future of money is digital and many countries are developing their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). This in turn will have far-reaching implications on society, businesses, and banks, as the use of physical cash declines.</p>
<p>Retail CBDCs are government-backed digital fiat money which is regulated by the country’s central bank and seen as an alternative to crypto. But when it comes down to introducing CBDCs, there are concerns about data protection and security.</p>
<p>To use CBDCs individuals will have to part with personal information and this is where it gets sticky. Many individuals do not want their everyday transactions monitored. Let alone give the government access to this data which in turn could be used to control consumer behaviour on a mass scale.</p>
<p>Over the years Governments have pushed to develop CBDCs almost in response to crypto. Regulators and governments are wary of crypto due to the lack of transparency around the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Crypto remains volatile so is unlikely to be considered a currency despite El Salvador becoming the first country to make bitcoin legal tender in September 2021. We have yet to see if El Salvador’s Bitcoin bet pays off.</p>
<h3><strong>Donald Trump on CBDCs</strong></h3>
<p>Most recently former US President Donald Trump <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trumps-promise-i-will-never-allow-the-creation-of-a-cbdc.htm">grabbed headlines</a> speaking in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He defined CBDCs as a “dangerous threat to freedom.” Pro-crypto former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently dropped out of his campaign, was also present on stage, officially endorsing Trump.Trump has been dismissive about the value of cryptos and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the past.</p>
<p>The 2024 Republican frontrunner has once again promised against the creation of a CBDC “to protect Americans from government tyranny.”But would introducing CBDCs solve any issues? Is there a way around privacy and security concerns? The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claims there is <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp80.pdf">and released a report</a> in November 2023 on <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp80.pdf">“Project Tourbillon”</a> which explores privacy and security.</p>
<p>The BIS claims its findings through <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp80.pdf">Project Tourbillon</a> introduce a new privacy paradigm that balances user needs and public policy objectives: payer anonymity. For example, if a consumer pays a merchant using CBDCs and does not disclose personal information to anyone, including the merchant, banks and the central bank. So if the identity of the merchant is disclosed to the merchant’s bank (as part of the payment) but is kept confidential there. The central bank does not see any personal payment data.</p>
<h3><strong>Is China Ahead of the Curve? </strong></h3>
<p>Over the years many countries have been developing their own CBDCs almost in stealth mode. China’s e-CNY pilot has been distributed and used widely. For example from February to March 2022,  e-CNY was piloted in the Beijing Winter Olympics venues.</p>
<p>In December, Singapore’s regulatory body the<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg"> Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)</a>  said it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-china-to-begin-piloting-digital-currency-in-tourism-spending-push.htm">plans to begin piloting</a> the e-CNY in collaboration with China to encourage tourism spending. The two countries first signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work together back in 2020. No timeline was given for when the digital currency would be trialled.</p>
<p>Sweden’s e-krona CBDC – which will be issued by Sweden’s central bank, Riksbank, has put in place privacy architecture for its pilot. Sweden has been moving toward becoming a cashless society.</p>
<p>The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria have already introduced CBDCs. And more than 100 countries are in the exploration stage. Central bankers in Brazil, China, the euro area, India, and the UK are at the forefront, according to an <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/11/20/central-bank-digital-currency-development-enters-the-next-phase">International Monetary Fund (IMF) report</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka has always been a country where cash is king and this remains the case despite the country planning to introduce its digital currency by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Once dubbed &ldquo;the pearl of the Indian Ocean&rdquo; &#8212; Sri Lanka is known for producing the finest tea, fresh coconuts, and spices. Not forgetting the exotic wildlife including the leopard, elephant, sloth bear, blue whale, and sperm whale.
</p>
<h4><strong>What You Need To Know About Bitcoin In Sri Lanka</strong></h4>
<p>
Sri Lanka <a href="https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/news/risks-of-using-and-investing-in-cryptocurrency-20230329#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20Directions%20No,payments%20related%20to%20cryptocurrency%20transactions.">remains anti-crypto</a>. Its stance on cryptocurrencies is that digital currency is not considered legal tender in the country. According to directions No. 03 of 2021 under Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017, Electronic Fund Transfer Cards (EFTCs) such as debit cards and credit cards are not to be used for payments related to cryptocurrency transactions.
</p>
<h4><strong>Would Bitcoin Solve Sri Lanka&#8217;s Economic Crisis </strong></h4>
<p>
Sri Lankan economic crisis first started in 2019 and in 2022, Sri Lanka&#8217;s economy struggled after fuel supplies ran dry. In terms of GDP, Sri Lanka is expected to reach $76.86 billion by the end of 2024, according to data from <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/sri-lanka/gdp#:~:text=GDP%20in%20Sri%20Lanka%20is,according%20to%20our%20econometric%20models.">Trading Economics,</a> and in the long-term, Sri Lanka&#8217;s GDP is projected to trend around $79.54 billion in 2025 and $82.33 billion in 2026, reports Trading Economics.&nbsp;In October 2023,<a href="https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/about/organisational-structure/principal-officers/nandalal-weerasinghe"> Nandalal Weerasinghe,</a> the Governor of the Central Bank in Sri Lanka, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-can-btc-eth-bounce-back-from-double-bottom-support-levels.htm">said he believes that</a> the adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies will worsen the nation&rsquo;s economic condition.</p>
<p>Last year, American millionaire Tim Draper travelled to Sri Lanka and proposed using Bitcoin as a legal tender to combat the corruption that caused the island nation&rsquo;s hyperinflation. &nbsp;But Sri Lanka wasn&#8217;t having any of this. During a TV shoot in Sri Lanka, Draper met with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Weerasinghe to suggest Bitcoin as a practical solution for solving financial issues. But Weerasinghe, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka &ndash; a major authority figure <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-can-btc-eth-bounce-back-from-double-bottom-support-levels.htm">made it clear that doing so</a> would aggravate the economic condition of the nation.
</p>
<h4><strong>Central Bank Warns of Crypto Scams&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>
The Central Bank has warned the public of the growing number of financial scams operating with the promise of high returns based on crypto-investments.&nbsp;&ldquo;These scams include deceiving individuals and obtaining money from them with the promise of providing a high return by investing money in cryptocurrency, as well as deceiving individuals to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency projects. Such scams circumvent traditional regulatory and legal protection mechanisms, resulting in individuals losing their hard-earned money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Central Bank made it clear that it has not issued any licence or authorized any individual or business to operate schemes involving cryptocurrency, or mining operations, cryptocurrency exchanges, deposit-taking or custody services related to cryptocurrency or any cryptocurrency investment advisory service.
</p>
<h4>Central Bank Plans to Launch Digital Currency</h4>
<p>
Sri Lanka&rsquo;s Central Bank announced plans to introduce a digital currency by the end of 2024 its official told a top committee in Parliament, as reported by the Colombo-based local media news site <a href="https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Central-Bank-to-introduce-digital-currency-by-the-end-of-this-year/108-274975">Daily Mirror LK.</a>&ldquo;The exercise of introducing &lsquo;Lanka Pay&rsquo; and &lsquo;Central Bank Digital Currencies&rsquo; has already begun. The two systems will be launched by the end of this year,&rdquo; Central Bank officials informed the Ways and Means Committee in Parliament, reports <a href="https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Central-Bank-to-introduce-digital-currency-by-the-end-of-this-year/108-274975">Daily Mirror LK</a>.</p>
<p>Central Bank officials were called before the committee to discuss issues pertaining to online payments in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Chairman of <a href="https://www.parliament.lk/en/component/committees/commitee/showCommittee?id=580">Ways and Means Committee</a> Patali Champika Ranawaka inquired about the regulation of online payment systems in Sri Lanka,&rdquo; Parliamentary Media Unit (PMU) said. In September 2023,&nbsp; Nandalal Weerasinghe, the Governor of the Central Bank <a href="//www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/about/Speech_20231103_keynote_speech_at_the_forum_in_KDU_e.pdf">acknowledged in a keynote</a> speech that interest in digital currencies has been gaining traction and within the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are also engaged in studies on the potential of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) which is the digital form of legal tender issued by the Central Bank. There is consensus across global central banks that CBDC will help enhance the efficiency and resilience of the payment system while also serving to increase financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Importantly, other potential benefits of CBDC include more effective monetary transmission and improved financial transparency,&rdquo; <a href="//www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/about/Speech_20231103_keynote_speech_at_the_forum_in_KDU_e.pdf">said</a> Weerasinghe. For now, Sri Lanka is showing signs of revival through growing tourism but cryptocurrency remains an unregulated investment instrument and is not recognized as an asset class.&nbsp;<br style="font-weight: 400"><br style="font-weight: 400"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have faded into the background with all the chatter and excitement around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund being approved in the US market.</p>
<p>Earlier today GameStop <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gamestop-retreats-from-crypto-space-shuts-down-nft-marketplace-amid-regulatory-hurdles.htm">revealed it has shut down</a> its NFT marketplace, signaling its withdrawal from the cryptocurrency space. The announcement was made via a statement on the platform and cites &ldquo;the continuing regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space&rdquo; as the primary reason behind this decision.</p>
<p>Another notable move was made by X, formerly known as Twitter, which quietly removed all references and options for owning NFTs as an account avatar. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/x-removes-support-for-nft-profile-pictures/" rel="sponsored">TechCrunch reported</a> on January 8, that X had silently removed a feature for paid subscribers. They&rsquo;re no longer able to set an NFT as a profile picture.
</p>
<h4><strong>NFT Trading in Decline&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>
Trading of NFTs has been in decline for over a year. Data compiled by Statista, shows the number of active wallets involved in NFT trading has declined by more than 25% between Q2 2023 and Q3 2023. This is a notable decline from the end of 2021 &mdash; when the number of users was estimated at nearly two million.</p>
<p>The NFT bear market continues which can be linked to the crypto market which has been stagnant. Is it game ove for NFTs? Or will the digital collectible make a come back?</p>
<p><b>What Causes NFTs to Surge?</b></p>
<p>NFT trading has at times surged at various moments. Statista highlights that back in 2017, the surge was connected to the popularity of collectible CryptoKitties whereas the second surge was in March 2021, had to do with media reporting the largest NFT sales to date. In August 2021 was likely caused by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1264288/axie-infinity-nft-development/" rel="sponsored">sales of Axie Infinity</a>, a popular NFT game in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In December, <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/dapp-activity-soars-to-3-4-million-nfts-close-on-1-billion#Chapter-4" rel="sponsored">Dapp Radar reports</a> there has been a slight surge in NFT trading volume passed $994 million, an increase of 125% from the previous month, with a total of 3.67 million sales. Blur led the NFT sector with 35% market share in trading volume, followed by OKX with 32%. OpenSea dropped to a yearly low at 14%, but retains 191,000 active traders.</p>
<p>Over the years, luxury brands such as&nbsp; <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/crypto/luxury-brands-gucci-tiffany-co-dive-into-nfts-despite-slump" rel="sponsored">Prada, Gucci, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana have been launching NFTs</a>&ndash; fast forward to today and there&rsquo;s the occasional drop. One of the reasons luxury brands launched NFTs is to increase brand exposure, and combatting counterfeiting. The question arises is there a good use case case for NFTs?</p>
<p>In the art world NFTs have been used to tokenize physical assets, such as art work, and collectibles, this trend is slowly growing and reshaping th the art world and how we own, and trade digital assets.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-new-era-5-best-cryptocurrencies-to-hold-in-a-traditional-investment-portfolio.htm">historic moment</a> for the cryptocurrency market as the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (SEC) finally approved eleven spot </span><a href="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/244717/sec-forced-to-clarify-bitcoin-etf-rules-after-unauthorised-x-post.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Crypto enthusiasts around the world are looking on excitedly. Unfortunately, a similar product for UK investors is highly unlikely to be approved, according to one financial advisor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This latest approval in the US for the first-ever spot crypto ETFs throws open the doors for institutional and retail investors. It seems the UK will lag on the crypto ETF action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The UK is the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/6500/the-british-economy/">second-largest</a> economy in Europe and currently the sixth-largest in the world, following the US, China, Germany, Japan and India. Where does the UK stand when it comes to crypto products?  Well, it’s no secret the UK has been increasingly tough when it comes to crypto.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am personally doubtful that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority will authorise Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency ETFs to be made accessible to UK retail investors any time soon,” said Jason Hollands, Managing Director at investing platform Bestinvest.  </span></p>
<h2><strong>FCA</strong> Ban<strong> Implemented 2021</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">In January 2021, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/06/uks-ban-on-crypto-derivatives-goes-into-effect-today/">FCA implemented a ban on</a> the sale of derivatives and exchange-traded products. The FCA said it considers the products to be ill-suited for retail consumers due to the potential harm they pose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hollands notes that Bitcoin enthusiasts among the UK’s estimated nine million self-directed investors who use online platforms and apps to manage their investments through ISA, SIPP and general investment accounts –might be in for a wait to have the same choice as their US counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the years, the FCA has repeatedly flagged its concerns about the extreme volatility of crypto assets, the high risk of losses and the difficulties retail investors face in valuing them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For an ETF to be made directly available by a UK regulated investment platform, under a regulation known as PRIIPs (Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products Regulation) ETF and other fund providers must comply with UK regulatory requirements in terms of producing a Key Information Document, which a US-listed ETF won’t have,” explains Hollands. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Institutional Investors</strong> Can<strong> Access Crypto ETPs </strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is important to note that institutional investors (not retail) <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/17/goldman-sachs-jpmorgan-ubs-are-trading-an-etp-tied-to-polkadots-crypto/">can access crypto products</a> through Goldman Sachs, ICAP, JPMorgan, and UBS. Exchange-traded products offering exposure to cryptocurrencies are readily available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even [if] Bitcoin or cryptocurrency ETFs to become authorised in the UK in the near future, it is possible that these would be primarily accessible for professional investors such as discretionary fund managers or those certified as sophisticated investors,” said Hollands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">He goes on to explain that this is due to the FCA’s Consumer Duty principle, which was a major regulatory development in the financial services sector last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It aims to increase consumer protection for retail investors and ensure regulated firms are focused on good client outcomes, and as a result execution-only investing platforms have become more cautious about the access they provide to higher risk or more complex products, rather than relying on the caveat emptor ‘buyer beware’ principle which was widely assumed to have prevailed previously,” explains Hollands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, UK retail investors will have to watch on in envy as US investors can access a range of exciting new spot Bitcoin ETFs. </span></p>

<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) social media account being compromised is concerning. Impersonations and hacks are nothing new in the cryptocurrency space but could the hack have been avoided?</p>
<p>After the post, the SEC started an internal market manipulation investigation on itself. X, formerly known as Twitter, confirmed the SEC’s account was compromised when it posted the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-gary-gensler-says-official-sec-account-is-compromised-whats-going-on.htm">fake spot Bitcoin ETF approval announcement</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Market Manipulation </strong></h4>
<p>Senator <a href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1744860826392047845">Cynthia Lummis tweeted</a>: &#8220;Fraudulent announcements, like the one that was made on the SEC’s social media, can manipulate markets. We need transparency on what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/x-confirms-us-secs-official-account-was-indeed-hacked.htm"> X confirmed</a> that the compromise did not stem from any vulnerability in their systems. Instead, an unidentified individual gained control over a phone number associated with the SEC account through a third party.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We can confirm that the account <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a> was compromised and we have completed a preliminary investigation. Based on our investigation, the compromise was not due to any breach of X’s systems, but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number…</p>
<p>&mdash; Safety (@Safety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Safety/status/1744924042681897343?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In turn, the SEC then tweeted the importance of protecting your investment accounts. Despite the false announcement, analysts believe that this security lapse won’t be a reason for the delaying of spot Bitcoin ETF approval which is expected to happen late on Wednesday. Unfortunately, instances of market manipulation in the cryptocurrency sector are a recurring tactic.</p>
<p>Here are the most common risks in the cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<p><b>Phishing Attacks: </b>This is when users can be tricked into revealing their private keys or login credentials through phishing emails or websites. This involves the practice of sending fraudulent communication.</p>
<p><b>Hacks and Cryptocurrency Exchanges: </b>Cryptocurrency exchanges are often targeted for large-scale thefts. If an exchange is compromised, users&#8217; funds can be at risk.</p>
<p><b>Third-party Applications and Software: </b>Third-party applications are any applications that aren&#8217;t created or supported by the maker of the device the app is installed on. Hackers may find new ways to exploit bugs in third-party software to retrieve sensitive information.</p>
<p><b>Wallet Vulnerabilities: </b>Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency wallets to steal funds.</p>
<p><b>Smart Contract Flaws: </b>Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be exploited to drain funds from decentralized applications (dApps) or blockchains.</p>
<p><b>Ponzi Schemes: </b>Fraudulent schemes promising high returns can deceive users into investing their cryptocurrencies, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p><b>51% Attacks: </b>In smaller blockchain networks, malicious actors can gain control of a majority of the network&#8217;s mining power, allowing them to double-spend coins. 51% attack is an attack on a cryptocurrency blockchain by miners who control more than 50% of the network&#8217;s mining hash rate.</p>
<p><b>Social Engineering: </b>Manipulating individuals to disclose sensitive information or transfer funds through social engineering tactics is another risk. Social engineering isn&#8217;t a direct cyber-attack. It is when actors with bad intentions gain the trust of their targets, so they lower their guard and give up sensitive information.</p>
<p><b>Insider Threats: </b>Employees or individuals with insider access to sensitive information can misuse their privileges to steal funds or sensitive information.</p>
<p><b>Lack of Regulation: </b>The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies can make it challenging to enforce security standards and protect investors.</p>
<p><b>Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks: </b>To mitigate these risks, users and organizations should adopt best practices, such as using hardware wallets, keeping software up-to-date, and conducting thorough due diligence before investing or participating in cryptocurrency transactions. Setting up 2FA is an important first step for security because it immediately neutralizes the risks associated with compromised passwords.</p>

<p>There are many retailers accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment and realizing how important it is to attract and tap into a more tech-savvy client base.</p>
<p>Some would argue that the end of fiat currencies is nigh, and eventually, fiat will be replaced by digital currencies. If we already have a fiat payment system why change this and what are the advantages of using digital currencies for retail transactions?</p>
<p>Data from Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/audit/us-corporates-using-crypto-pov.pdf">reported roughly</a> 2,352 US businesses accepted Bitcoin in late 2022, and that doesn’t include Bitcoin ATMs. An increasing number of companies worldwide are using Bitcoin and other crypto and digital assets for a host of investment, operational, and transactional purposes.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>Benefits of Using Cryptocurrency in Retail</b></p>
<p><b></b>Using digital currencies for transactions offers several advantages such as speed. Digital currency transactions can be completed instantly or in a matter of seconds, compared to traditional banking systems which can take days.</p>
<p>Digital currencies can reduce or eliminate the need for intermediaries, leading to lower transaction fees for retailers. Cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized platform, making international transactions smoother without the need for currency conversion.<b></b></p>
<p>Then there is the issue of security – blockchain technology, which underpins many digital currencies allows for enhanced security features. This in turn can protect both retailers and customers from fraud and unauthorized transactions. <b></b></p>
<p>Another factor is reduced fraud risks. The immutable nature of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">blockchain</a> ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered, reducing the risk of chargebacks and fraudulent activities.</p>
<h4><b>Financial Inclusion</b></h4>
<p>For the underprivileged cryptocurrency has the potential to foster financial inclusion and improve access to financial services especially those in developing countries. Financial inclusion is important and digital currencies can provide banking services to the unbanked or underbanked populations, potentially expanding the customer base for retailers.</p>
<p>Through accepting digital payments retailers can offer innovative payment solutions, such as loyalty programs, or smart contract-based transactions using digital currencies.</p>
<h4><strong>Transparent Transactions </strong></h4>
<p>Every transaction on the blockchain is recorded transparently, allowing for greater accountability and trust between retailers and customers. This also cuts out the need for due diligence before a huge transaction.  Digital transactions cut out the middlemen. Direct peer-to-peer transactions can eliminate the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors, reducing costs and potential points of failure.</p>
<h4><strong><b>Retailers accepting Bitcoin</b><br />
</strong></h4>
<p>So who are the most notable and prominent retailers that have embraced digital currency payments?</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><b>Microsoft:</b> This American multinational technology corporation has been accepting Bitcoin for use in its online <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30377654">Xbox Store since 2014.</a> However, the firm temporarily paused from accepting Bitcoin due to volatility in the market. Microsoft is once again accepting cryptocurrency strictly for the Xbox store credits.</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks:</strong> The coffee shop customers pay directly with Bitcoin thanks to a partnership with digital wallet <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005401/en/Bakkt-Launches-Its-Digital-Wallet-Bakkt-App-to-Manage-All-Forms-of-Digital-Assets-Debuting-with-Starbucks-GolfNow-and-Best-Buy-Among-Other-Marquee-Brands">provider Bakkt.</a>  In 2022, Starbucks unveiled Starbucks Odyssey becoming one of the first companies to integrate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a loyalty program.</li>
<li><b>Tesla: </b>SpaceX and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk has been open about his interest in Dogecoin. Tesla first began accepting crypto as a form of payment for its cars but discontinued the program soon after. However, Dogecoin is <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/dogecoin#:~:text=What%20cryptocurrency%20does%20Tesla%20accept,making%20your%20purchase%20with%20Dogecoin.">still accepting</a> some Tesla Merchandise.</li>
<li><b>Wholefoods: </b>This grocery chain, owned by Amazon, has shown interest in cryptocurrency and there have been initiatives to enable crypto payments, although the rollout was still in progress as of my last update.</li>
<li><b>Time Magazine:</b> In 2019, TIME magazine <a href="https://time.com/5955969/time-partners-with-crypto-com/">first began</a> accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for digital subscriptions through a new partnership with <a href="https://crypto.com/">Crypto.com</a> exchange.</li>
<li><b>Virgin Galactic:</b> The space tourism venture founded by Richard Branson, is accepting bitcoins as a form of payment for space tourists. Unfortunately, Virgin Galactic has been a loss-making business announcing job cuts and a pause in commercial flights in an effort to save cash.</li>
<li><b>Overstock:</b> The e-commerce home decor firm selling bedding and furniture accepts cryptocurrency as a form of payment. This was one of the earliest major retailers to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>How to Shop with Cryptocurrency</b></h4>
<p>To begin shopping with cryptocurrency involves a few basic steps to ensure you have the necessary tools and knowledge to make secure transactions.  Here&#8217;s a brief guide on how to get started:</p>
<p>First of all, choose a wallet. Before you can shop with cryptocurrency, you&#8217;ll need a digital wallet to store your crypto assets. Wallets come in various forms: you can either choose a software wallet which involves an application or software installed on your computer or mobile device. The other option is a hardware wallet.</p>
<p>This is a physical device that stores your cryptocurrency offline, offering increased security.  Online wallets are web-based services that store your crypto assets on the cloud. However, these are considered less secure than hardware or software wallets.</p>
<h4><b>Acquiring Crypto</b></h4>
<p>The next step is to acquire Cryptocurrency: To start shopping, you&#8217;ll need to acquire some cryptocurrency. This can be done by using exchanges. Platforms such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken allow you to buy cryptocurrencies using traditional currencies (like USD, EUR, etc.).</p>
<p>There is the Peer-to-Peer option. This allows you to buy from individuals through platforms like LocalBitcoins or through decentralized exchanges. There are also crypto ATMs: In some locations, cryptocurrency ATMs allow you to purchase crypto using cash.</p>
<p>Next, choose a retailer that accepts cryptocurrency as a form of payment.  Not all retailers accept cryptocurrency. Look for online platforms or physical stores that have integrated crypto payments. Some popular retailers or platforms include Overstock, Shopify merchants, and various independent online stores.</p>
<h4><b>Making the Purchase</b></h4>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve selected a product or service from a retailer that accepts cryptocurrency. Next comes the fun part: Choose the cryptocurrency payment option. Enter the necessary details, which usually include the amount in crypto and a receiving address. Confirm the transaction from your wallet.</p>
<p>It’s important to monitor and manage your account. Always keep an eye on your cryptocurrency transactions. Ensure you&#8217;re sending funds to the correct address and are aware of any associated fees.</p>
<h4><b>Stay Informed </b></h4>
<p>The world of cryptocurrency is dynamic and fast-moving. Stay updated on the latest developments, security best practices, and changes in regulations.</p>
<p>Remember, while shopping with cryptocurrency can offer privacy, speed, and other benefits, it also comes with risks. Always prioritize security, ensure you&#8217;re dealing with reputable retailers, and be cautious of potential scams.</p>

<p>Crypto scams over the years have involved <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/07/how-to-defend-yourself-against-pump-and-dumps/">pump and dump schemes</a>, Ponzi schemes such as OneCoin project led by the notorious CryptoQueen <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/ruja-ignatova/@@download.pdf">Ruja Ignatova,</a> as well as hacks such as Mt Gox, becoming more and more sophisticated.</p>
<p>This article wouldn&#8217;t be complete without the mention of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67281759">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> who was behind the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.</p>
<p>Now the question arises: could any of these scams have been prevented? It seems crypto is still very much a nascent asset class that is known to be relatively high risk and volatile. There are many notable scams that have occurred throughout its history.</p>
<p>Being aware of crypto scams is critically important for protecting oneself. Over the years due to the scams there has been increased regulatory scrutiny and oversight of the digital assets sector, potentially impacting the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It is important for the crypto community to work together to maintain trust and credibility.</p>
<h3><b>The Biggest Crypto Scams</b></h3>
<p>In 2014, one of the earliest scams involved the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox. This is one of the most infamous incidents. Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after claiming to have lost 850,000 Bitcoins (worth over $450 million at that time). This incident significantly impacted the reputation of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Next we have OneCoin – a project that was marketed as a revolutionary cryptocurrency, OneCoin was later revealed to be a Ponzi scheme. OneCoin first began operating in the US in or around 2015. Between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016. Its founders and promoters faced legal actions in various countries, and the scheme defrauded investors of billions of dollars. CryptoQueen Ruja Ignatova who was behind the project still remains a fugitive after disappearing six years ago. Ignatova is on the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/ruja-ignatova/@@download.pdf">FBI’s most wanted list. </a></p>
<p>In 2018, we saw Bitconnect operating as a high-yield investment program, it promised investors outsized returns. However, it was eventually exposed as a Ponzi scheme in 2018, leading to its collapse and significant losses for investors.</p>
<p>In the same year, PlusToken was launched &#8211; dubbed a multi-level marketing cryptocurrency wallet and exchange. It attracted millions of users and allegedly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/01/ringleaders-of-plustoken-scam-jailed-for-up-to-11-years/">defrauded investors</a> out of 14.8 billion yuan ($2.25 billion) worth of cryptocurrency in the eastern province of Jiangsu, China in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2019, QuadrigaCX which was Canada&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, collapsed following the sudden death of its founder, Gerald Cotten. It was later revealed that the exchange had lost access to its cold storage wallets containing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, leaving customers unable to access their funds.</p>
<h3><b>Tether Controversy </b></h3>
<p>Next we have Bitfinex and Tether –  There have been controversies and allegations surrounding the relationship between the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and the stablecoin Tether (USDT). Concerns have arisen regarding the backing of Tether&#8217;s reserves and its impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. In 2021, <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21">the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</a> fined both of the firms more than $42 million on allegations the USDT stablecoin was not fully backed.</p>
<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/do-kwons-usd-1m-bet-doesnt-look-good-as-luna-crashes.htm">collapse of Terraform Labs’ algorithmic stablecoins</a> wiped out $50 billion in valuation. This was the trigger that started the 2022 crypto winter. In May 2022, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-and-terraform-labs-court-filings-to-stay-confidential-prior-to-crypto-fraud-trial.htm">TerraUSD and Luna crashed,</a> taking billions of dollars of investor equity with them. Most recently new details have come to the surface regarding the high-profile crypto fraud case between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Terraform Labs. On December 20, Judge Jed Rakoff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a protective order that will keep material confidential leading up to the trial.</p>
<h3><b>FTX Collapse </b></h3>
<p>In 2023, a high profile scam involving Sam Bankman-Fried who dominated mainstream media headlines. He is responsible for the FTX collapse. Bankman-Fried was charged with stealing as much as $10 billion from FTX customers in order to finance his spending activities which included political contributions.</p>
<p>These are just a handful examples, and the cryptocurrency space has seen numerous other scams and fraudulent activities over the years. Investors should exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and be aware of the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3><b>Recognizing Red Flags</b></h3>
<p>Now the adage applies here – “if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.” So if you encounter any crypto promotion or offer that will make you rich overnight or seems so good it can&#8217;t possibly be true, your instincts will be spot on.</p>
<p>Investors should be aware of major red flags such as unrealistic promises, anonymous teams, lack of transparency, and pressure tactics. Here we talk through these red flags in more detail.</p>
<h3><strong>Question Complex Jargon</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto can be confusing for many but if a crypto project is throwing complex jargon at you – question it – by using overly complex language or technical jargon without clear explanations they may be trying to confuse or mislead potential investors. There is no such thing as stupid question so ask away and interrogate openly.</p>
<p>Next question to ask yourself before investing &#8211;  is there a clear use case for the project? If the project&#8217;s whitepaper lacks a clear use case, technical roadmap, or coherent business model, it may be cause for concern. Run for the hills.</p>
<h3><strong>Learn Super Sleuth Skills</strong></h3>
<p>Become a super sleuth and try to verify information &#8211; so any claims that cannot be verified, such as partnerships with reputable companies or endorsements from well-known individuals without evidence, should be approached with skepticism. Do your due diligence on the founders backing the project.</p>
<p>Question any security concerns –  projects with significant security vulnerabilities, past hacks, or a lack of robust security measures are high-risk.</p>
<p>There are still a number of ponzi or pyramid schemes out there in the market – any projects that rely on new investors&#8217; funds to pay existing investors, rather than generating legitimate returns from a sustainable business model, are classic red flags.</p>
<p>Question the project  if it promises unrealistic token distribution – this is when projects allocate a disproportionate amount of tokens to the team or founders, or have unclear token distribution mechanisms, then you may be right to suspect.</p>
<p>When online look for reviews – any negative reviews, reports of suspicious activities, or warnings from trusted community members and experts can indicate potential issues with a project.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s essential to conduct thorough due diligence, research the project and team, seek independent opinions, and consult trusted sources or advisors before investing in any cryptocurrency or participating in a crypto project.</p>
<p>Make sure you &#8220;DYOR&#8221; which is another popular term and stands for Do Your Own Research. This is a  common phrase used by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts.</p>
<h3><b>Protecting Yourself From Crypto Investments</b></h3>
<p>Understanding common scams and fraudulent tactics can educate newcomers and seasoned investors alike, fostering a more informed and resilient community. Large-scale scams such as FTX collapse can have broader economic implications, affecting market dynamics, investor sentiment, and the overall growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>It is important to do your research especially when it comes to any exchange before you buy crypto and look into cryptocurrencies before investing. Understand the level of risk you can take.</p>
<p>Please remain vigilant, share this guide with your network, and actively contribute to fostering a safer cryptocurrency community.</p>

<p>What do Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan, Floyd Mayweather, Jake Paul and Matt Damon all have in common? They are just a handful of celebrities who have promoted cryptocurrency projects and faced the wrath of the regulators in the United States.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why an increasing number of celebrities have been getting involved in the cryptocurrency space and the most obvious is due to the lucrative financial opportunities.</p>
<p>Another popular reason is publicity and branding which play a crucial role in a celebrity being relevant in today’s society. Over the years, crypto and non-fungible tokens have experienced growth and just by associating themselves with cryptocurrencies can increase a celebrity&#8217;s visibility and appeal to a younger audience interested in digital assets.</p>
<h3><b>Celebrity Cryptocurrency Scandals</b></h3>
<p>This year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jake-paul-lindsey-lohan-soulja-boy-several-other-celebrities-face-sec-charges-for-touting-cryptocurrencies-what-happens-now.htm">filed civil charges against</a> eight celebrities, alleging they illegally promoted two cryptocurrencies without disclosing that they were paid to do so, in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59">news release</a>, the SEC unveiled charges against celebrities who promoted cryptocurrencies Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT), which were sold by crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun. The celebrities involved in this scandal included Lindsay Lohan, internet personality Jake Paul, musician Soulja Boy, singer Austin Mahone, porn actress Kendra Lust, rapper Lil Yachty, musician Ne-Yo, and Senegalese-American singer Akon. The celebrities involved in this scheme, apart from Soulja Boy and Mahone, paid a combined total of more than $400,000 to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings.</p>
<h3><b>Celebrities Who Own Bitcoin</b></h3>
<p>Despite the lack of regulation around the space and the risk involved in holding crypto many notable people are dabbling. Well-known celebrities who have publicly disclosed their ownership of Bitcoin and this list includes: Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight boxing champion, Snoop Dogg, a rapper and entertainer, Paris Hilton, a well known Hollywood socialite and businesswoman, Ashton Kutcher, an actor and entrepreneur as well as Gwyneth Paltrow, an actress and founder of Goop.</p>
<p>Over the years, Musk who has been in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226">trouble with the SEC numerous times</a> – admitted that he owns bitcoin, ethereum and dogecoin, and has previously added the dogecoin Ð symbol to his X account. Musk will also openly engage with dogecoin developers.</p>
<h3><b>Kim Kardashian Charged by the SEC </b></h3>
<p>One <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kim-kardashian-charged-by-sec-for-promoting-ethereummax-pro-russian-paramilitary-raised-crypto-worth-400k-crypto-exposure-by-banks-014-more-news.htm">high profile case</a> involves the socialite and celebrity Kim Kardashian who paid over $1.2 million to the SEC for unlawfully touting a crypto security offered and sold by EthereumMax without disclosing the payment she received for the promotion on social media.</p>
<p>Kim Kardashian agreed to settle the charges, pay $1.26 million in penalties, disgorgement, and interest, and cooperate with the Commission’s ongoing investigation, they <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183">said</a>. “This case is a reminder that, when celebrities / influencers endorse investment opps, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean those investment products are right for all investors,” <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832">SEC Char Gary Gensler tweeted</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Scandals and Controversies Continue </b></h3>
<p>When celebrities are fined by the SEC for involvement in crypto scams, it can have a huge impact on the crypto community and this includes the loss of trust. Incidents such as those involving Kim Kardashian and Jake Paul can erode trust in the broader crypto market. Investors might become more skeptical about endorsements and celebrity involvement in crypto projects.</p>
<p>The increase in the number of fines issued by the SEC can lead to more stringent regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, impacting how exchanges, projects, and even retail investors operate.</p>
<p>The negative publicity can sway public opinion, potentially deterring newcomers from entering the crypto space due to fears of scams or fraudulent activities. But  on the positive side, these incidents can raise awareness about the risks associated with crypto investments, prompting individuals to be more cautious and conduct thorough research before investing.</p>
<p>Overall, while the immediate impact might be negative in terms of trust and regulatory scrutiny, it can also lead to a more informed and cautious crypto community in the long run.</p>
<h3><b>Celebrity-Backed Crypto Projects</b></h3>
<p>Over the years, there have been several celebrity-backed crypto projects and endorsements. Some notable examples include “Akoin: which is a project founded by singer Akon. The intentions behind this project were good – aiming to be a cryptocurrency for Africa, particularly for its underbanked population.</p>
<p>Other projects include “Centra&#8221; which was endorsed by celebrities like Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled, this project aimed to offer a crypto debit card. However, the founders faced legal troubles. Stellar Lumens (XLM) is another project which again was not exclusively celebrity-backed, but gained attention when Ashton Kutcher donated XLM to Ellen DeGeneres&#8217; wildlife fund on her show.</p>
<p>Dogecoin is another project – although it is not founded by a celebrity, it gained significant attention and value due to endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban.</p>
<h3><b>Legal Implications and Regulations</b></h3>
<p>Some might argue Kim Kardashian being forced to pay $1.26 million in penalties is nothing to her. Kim, who is a billionaire is worth an estimated $1.8billion, according to Forbes – she can afford to take the hit as can Elon Musk.</p>
<p>But the legal implications and regulatory challenges involved in cryptocurrency activities cannot be ignored. Many jurisdictions have specific regulations governing the promotion and sale of securities, including cryptocurrencies. If celebrities don&#8217;t comply with these regulations, they can face penalties from regulatory bodies like the SEC or equivalent agencies in other countries such as the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK.</p>
<p>In many cases, celebrities have failed to disclose that they are being compensated for their endorsements, which is a violation of advertising standards and can lead to legal consequences. If a celebrity makes false or misleading statements about a cryptocurrency or related product, they can be held liable for deceptive advertising practices.</p>
<p>Given these risks, celebrities should be more cautious and consult with legal advisors before getting involved in any cryptocurrency-related activities or endorsements.</p>
<h3><b>Impact on Cryptocurrency Popularity</b></h3>
<p>There is no doubt that associating with a cryptocurrency or platform that turns out to be fraudulent or involved in illegal activities can damage a celebrity&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<p>Any interest and involvement of celebrities in Bitcoin can influence its perception and adoption by the general public. It&#8217;s essential to approach celebrity-backed projects with caution, as endorsements do not guarantee a project&#8217;s legitimacy or success. Always do thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency or project.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important for today’s tech savvy investors and consumers to conduct thorough due diligence and be skeptical of endorsements that seem too good to be true.</p>

<p>It’s never too late in life to dabble in cryptocurrency investing <strong>– </strong> For seniors unfamiliar with the sector cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for virtual transactions.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like the US dollar or the Euro), cryptocurrencies operate on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/decentralized-network">decentralized networks</a> based on blockchain technology. This means there&#8217;s no central authority, like a bank, overseeing transactions.  Instead, the network relies on a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/distributed-ledger#:~:text=Distributed%20ledger%20technology%20(DLT)%20is,data%20store%20or%20administration%20functionality.">distributed ledger</a> that records all transactions across a vast number of computers.</p>
<h4><b>Understanding Blockchain Technology</b></h4>
<p>For those looking to understand the technology further – Imagine a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain">blockchain</a> as a digital ledger or record book that keeps track of all your transactions. Instead of one person or organization holding this book, copies are held by many people all over the world. So, when a new transaction takes place, it is added to this book or ledger in a way that everyone agrees on.</p>
<p>Once a transaction is added, it&#8217;s very hard to change it because doing so would mean changing copies held by many people. This decentralized and secure way of recording transactions is what makes blockchain special and trusted for things like cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>While individual transactions might be pseudonymous (with addresses instead of personal names), the entire history of transactions is open for everyone to view. This openness allows participants to verify the integrity of the system.</p>
<p>Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it becomes extremely difficult to alter. This immutability ensures that once data is recorded, it remains unchanged and trustworthy. Overall, these features combine to create a system where data is both secure from unauthorized changes and transparently available for verification.</p>
<h4><b>Benefits and Risks</b></h4>
<p>There are a number of benefits and risks to take into account before investing in cryptocurrencies. Here we present both potential benefits and risks:</p>
<p>Let’s start with the benefits first of all.  Investing in cryptocurrencies does have the potential of high returns. Cryptocurrencies, especially in their early stages, have witnessed substantial growth, leading to significant returns for early investors.</p>
<p>Another factor to take into account is the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp">diversification play</a> – Cryptocurrencies offer an alternative asset class, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional stocks, bonds, and real estate.</p>
<p>For some, decentralization is an important factor when it comes to investing. Cryptocurrencies operate independently of central banks and governments, providing a hedge against traditional financial systems.<br />
It’s a 24/7 market so unlike stock markets that operate during specific hours, cryptocurrency markets are open around the clock, offering flexibility to trade anytime.</p>
<p>When it comes to risks –  the downside is that cryptocurrency prices can be <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/prices-most-volatile/">highly volatile,</a> with sharp price fluctuations in short periods. This volatility can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses. Then there is regulatory uncertainty. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is evolving. Changes in regulations or crackdowns by governments can impact prices and trading.</p>
<p>There are also security concerns. While blockchain itself is secure, platforms and wallets storing cryptocurrencies can be <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2022-biggest-year-ever-for-crypto-hacking/">vulnerable to hacks or cyberattacks.</a> Some would argue there is a lack of fundamental value as unlike stocks that represent ownership in a company or bonds backed by assets, cryptocurrencies don&#8217;t have inherent value. Their value is based on market demand and sentiment.</p>
<p>Be warned there is the risk of market manipulation given the relatively small size of the cryptocurrency market compared to traditional financial markets, it can be susceptible to price manipulation schemes and rug pulls. Before investing in cryptocurrencies, it&#8217;s essential to do thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consider consulting with financial professionals.</p>
<h4><b>Getting Started with Cryptocurrency</b></h4>
<p>Now here&#8217;s a simplified step-by-step guide on how to buy cryptocurrencies:</p>
<p>First of all, do your research and choose a cryptocurrency – options include <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). Then comes the important part which is to select a cryptocurrency exchange preferably one which is regulated. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges available, such as Coinbase and Kraken. Choose one that operates in your country and supports the cryptocurrency you want to buy.</p>
<p>Sign up for an account on the chosen exchange. You&#8217;ll typically need to provide an email address, set a password, and verify your identity by uploading a government-issued ID. Then enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. This usually involves linking your account to a mobile device or authenticator app.</p>
<p>Remember, investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks, so only invest what you can afford to lose and always do your research beforehand. If you&#8217;re planning to hold the cryptocurrency for the long term, consider transferring it to a personal wallet for better security. There are various types of wallets, including hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, and software wallets like Exodus or MyEtherWallet.</p>
<h4><b>Safety and Security</b></h4>
<p>Safety and security are an issue in the cryptocurrency space as cybercriminals often use phishing scams, fake websites, or deceptive tactics to trick individuals into revealing their private keys or passwords. Robust cybersecurity practices, including user education, can mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>As the cryptocurrency space evolves, regulatory requirements around data protection, privacy, and cybersecurity are becoming more stringent. Adhering to these regulations is essential for crypto businesses to avoid legal repercussions.</p>
<p>Any security breach or hack can severely damage the reputation of a cryptocurrency or platform. Trust is fundamental in the crypto space, and maintaining high cybersecurity standards is crucial for building and retaining trust among users and investors.</p>
<p>In summary, cybersecurity in the crypto space isn&#8217;t just about protecting digital assets; it&#8217;s about ensuring the integrity, trustworthiness, and continued growth of the entire ecosystem.</p>
<h4><b>Tax Implications</b></h4>
<p>Be warned there are tax implications for cryptocurrency transactions that can vary significantly depending on your country or jurisdiction. But in many places, the following general principles apply: Capital gains tax – this is when you sell or dispose of cryptocurrency, any profit or loss is typically treated as a capital gain or loss. The tax rate and how the gain or loss is calculated can vary based on how long you held the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Then there is income tax to consider too – so if you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services, it may be considered taxable income based on its fair market value at the time of receipt. There are reporting requirements – many tax authorities require individuals to report cryptocurrency transactions on their tax returns, often through specific forms or disclosures.</p>
<p>Given the complexities and potential tax implications of cryptocurrency transactions, it&#8217;s advisable to consult with a tax professional or accountant familiar with cryptocurrency tax laws in your jurisdiction. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and help ensure compliance with applicable tax laws.</p>

<p>Data mining plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency space as it is integral in providing market analysis, risk management, and ensuring security and integrity of transactions is in place.</p>
<p>Traders and investors use data mining techniques to analyze market trends and identify new patterns in cryptocurrency investing which helps them make decisions. Just by analyzing historical data, data mining can help in predicting future price movements or market behavior which is a technique known as “predictive modeling.”</p>
<p>By detecting suspicious activities through transaction data this can help in prevent fraud or unauthorized transactions.</p>
<p><b>Sustainable Mining</b></p>
<p>There are several cryptocurrency projects and platforms that have recognized the environmental concerns associated with traditional proof-of-work (PoW) mining and have adopted more eco-friendly technologies.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-work.htm">PoW mining</a> – this is a method used to achieve consensus in a decentralized system through computational work. The downside is PoW requires massive amounts of energy because miners use powerful computers running 24/7 to solve puzzles. This has led to environmental concerns, especially when mining operations rely on non-renewable energy sources.</p>
<p><b>Crypto Projects Recognizing Environmental Concerns</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum 2.0: Ethereum, is one of the largest blockchain platforms in the cryptocurrency space, it went through the process of transitioning from PoW to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with Ethereum 2.0. This transition was expected to significantly reduce the energy consumption of the network.</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA): <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a> uses a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm">PoS</a> consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. It claims to be more energy-efficient than PoW-based systems and aims to provide scalability and sustainability.</li>
<li>Tezos (XTZ): Tezos is another project utilizing a PoS consensus mechanism. It allows token holders to participate in the consensus process, reducing the need for intensive computational mining.</li>
<li>Algorand (ALGO): Algorand employs a PoS protocol that is designed to be energy-efficient and scalable. It aims to provide fast and secure transactions without the need for intensive computational power.</li>
<li>NEAR Protocol: NEAR uses a consensus mechanism dubbed <a href="https://near.org/papers/nightshade">Nightshade sharding,</a> which is a variation of PoS. It is designed to be more energy-efficient and scalable while maintaining security.</li>
<li>Chia (XCH): Chia is a cryptocurrency that utilizes a &#8220;proof of space and time&#8221; consensus mechanism. Instead of relying on computational power, it leverages unused storage space on hard drives, making it more energy-efficient compared to traditional PoW systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>PoW, PoS and Nightshade </b></p>
<p>Above are all cryptocurrency projects that represent a growing trend in the space towards more sustainable and eco-friendly technologies. However, it&#8217;s essential to note that while these alternatives may be more energy-efficient than PoW, they still have their own set of challenges.</p>
<p>In summary, while cryptocurrency mining, especially using PoW, is energy-intensive, there is ongoing research and development to explore more energy-efficient alternatives. This includes <a href="https://near.org/papers/nightshade">Nightshade,</a> which is a variation of PoS. It is designed to be more energy-efficient and scalable while maintaining security.</p>
<p><b>Data Mining and User Privacy</b></p>
<p>Another issue which is a concern with data mining in the context of cryptocurrency is the potential loss of user privacy.</p>
<p>Even though addresses on a blockchain are pseudonymous, if linked with other external data sources or if certain patterns are identified, it might be possible to figure out users identity. Although other data sources, like publicly available data or data leaks, can be combined with transaction data to infer more about users.</p>
<p>Many people believe cryptocurrencies offer anonymity, but the reality is more nuanced because transactions on a blockchain are transparent and immutable. If someone knows which address belongs to an individual, they can track that person&#8217;s entire transaction history.</p>
<p>Then there are privacy coins, like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/monero/">Monero</a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zcash/">Zcash</a>, which have been developed to address privacy concerns by implementing technologies that obscure transaction details, offering more privacy compared to transparent blockchains like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Although data mining provides valuable insights from cryptocurrency transaction data, it also poses significant risks to user privacy. As the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, finding a balance between transparency (necessary for trust in the system) and user privacy will be crucial.</p>
<p><b>Regulatory Developments</b></p>
<p>Regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on the environmental and privacy concerns linked with cryptocurrency and data mining.</p>
<p>One concern is the energy consumption in cryptocurrency mining, particularly for Bitcoin, consumes significant energy. Some estimates suggest it uses as much energy as entire countries. Regulators are seeking ways to encourage more energy-efficient mining methods or transitioning to proof-of-stake systems.</p>
<p>Then there is “e-waste” which is the rapid turnover of mining hardware that contributes to electronic waste. Regulations may target recycling and responsible disposal of these components.</p>
<p>As companies mine data for insights, concerns arise over user privacy. Regulations like<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu"> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> in the European Union aim to give users more control over their data.</p>
<p>Then there is financial privacy as cryptocurrencies offer certain anonymity features, they also pose risks like money laundering. Regulators are keen on striking a balance between privacy and preventing illegal activities.</p>
<p><b>Eco-friendly Policies</b></p>
<p>There are a number of eco-friendly policies such as the “Hydroelectric Power in Quebec, Canada.” Quebec is attracting numerous cryptocurrency miners due to its abundant and cheap hydroelectric power, which is more environmentally friendly compared to coal or fossil fuels.</p>
<p>There has been discussion in the region by Hydro-Quebec, which asked Canada&#8217;s energy regulator in 2022 to suspend the allocation of 270 megawatts that had previously been planned for blockchain industry in Quebec, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/03/canadian-energy-provider-hydro-quebec-proposes-stopping-electricity-supply-to-blockchain-industry/">reports</a> CoinDesk. Miners that were operating in Quebec back then included Bitfarms, Hive Blockchain and Argo Blockchain.</p>
<p>Then there is the “El Salvador&#8217;s Geothermal Energy” – El Salvador, after adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/05/el-salvadors-volcano-energy-secures-1b-in-commitments-for-241-mw-bitcoin-mine/">announced</a> plans to use geothermal energy from its volcanoes for Bitcoin mining, aiming for a more sustainable approach. El Salvador&#8217;s Geothermal Energy is used to mine Bitcoin and it was agreed to allocate 23% of profit to the Salvadoran government.</p>
<p>The “Proof-of-Stake Transition” when Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake mechanism, significantly reduced its environmental footprint.</p>
<p><b>Striking the Balance</b></p>
<p>Today regulators around the world are working to strike a balance that promotes innovation while safeguarding the environment and user privacy.</p>
<p>It seems the global impact and the cumulative energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is substantial and has been compared to the energy consumption of entire countries. This has raised concerns about its environmental impact, particularly in terms of carbon emissions.</p>

<p>Paying taxes is considered a civic duty – it is important for cryptocurrency investors to note they cannot hide their gains from  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uncle-sam.asp">&#8220;Uncle Sam&#8221;</a> – also known as the <a href="https://www.irs.gov">US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</a> This is the US authority responsible for collecting federal taxes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Over the years the IRS has intensified its focus on cryptocurrency investors and any failure to report gains will result in being charged as a criminal — it is not worth the risk. The<a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets"> IRS has made it very clear</a> that <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions">digital assets</a> or virtual currency are taxed as property although the tax authority does not recognise it as real currency also known as “fiat.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The relevance of cryptocurrency in the financial landscape is changing with digital assets becoming more acceptable and mainstream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Remember every time cryptocurrency is sold for profit it is seen as a gain – this is a &#8220;taxable event&#8221; which means capital gains will be taxed as they would with any other asset class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Tax Basics for Cryptocurrency</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tax can be an extremely complicated arena which requires advice from an accountant – To start you off here is a clear and up-to-date guide on crypto taxes in the US for the upcoming tax season (2023-2024).</p>
<p>This guide aims to help individuals understand their tax obligations related to cryptocurrency transactions, investments, and income. This guide is for information purposes only —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>please seek advice from a professional tax advisor.</p>
<p>Many cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, Bitstamp and eToro<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>require users to share their identification and upload a video when signing up – these exchanges are subject to the laws and regulations of the country they operate in. The exchanges will also conduct <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-kyc-know-your-customer-process-explained.htm">know-your-customer</a> (KYC) checks that require a thorough background check on clients using the platform.</p>
<p>Understanding key tax terms relevant to cryptocurrency investing is crucial. Here is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a general overview of how the IRS categorizes cryptocurrencies for tax purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Taxable Events</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Let’s start with breaking down what is a taxable event. It is important to understand that a taxable event can involve crypto-to-fiat transactions, trading, and the mining of digital assets. In the context of cryptocurrency, a taxable event refers to any transaction or action that results in a tax consequence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This can include the selling or exchange cryptocurrency for fiat currency (like USD), trading one cryptocurrency for another, receiving cryptocurrency as a form of payment for services rendered or goods sold and the mining of cryptocurrency, which can be considered income.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-taxes.htm">specific tax implications</a> can also vary depending on the jurisdiction and individual circumstances, so it is important to consult with a tax professional familiar with crypto taxes.</p>
<p>Reporting taxable events related to cryptocurrency to the IRS in the U.S. involves several steps.<br />
Here&#8217;s a simplified overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Detailed Records: It is important to maintain comprehensive records of all cryptocurrency transactions. This includes dates of acquisition and sale of cryptocurrency. The value at the time of the transaction, and any associated costs or fees.</li>
<li>Determine Gains or Losses: Calculate the capital gains or losses for each transaction. This is typically done by subtracting the cost basis (what you paid for the cryptocurrency) from the sale proceeds (what you received when you sold or exchanged the cryptocurrency).</li>
<li>Complete Form 8949: Use <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8949.pdf">Form 8949</a> to report capital gains and losses from cryptocurrency transactions. List each transaction on this form, detailing the date acquired, date sold or exchanged, proceeds, cost basis, and gain or loss.</li>
<li>Transfer Information to Schedule D:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After completing the Form 8949, transfer the total gain or loss to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-schedule-d-form-1040">Schedule D</a> (Capital Gains and Losses). This form summarizes your net capital gain or loss from all transactions, including those from cryptocurrency.</li>
<li>Include in Tax Return: Include the information from Schedule D in your overall tax return (typically <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040">Form 1040</a>).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Pay Taxes Owed: Now comes the difficult part &#8211; it’s time to part with your gains. If you have a net capital gain from your cryptocurrency transactions, you may owe taxes on that gain. The rate at which you&#8217;re taxed depends on how long you held the cryptocurrency before selling (short-term versus long-term capital gains).</li>
<li>Use Form 1040: If you&#8217;ve realized gains from cryptocurrency trading as a business or as a self-employed individual, you may also need to complete additional forms, such as Schedule C, to report the income or loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that tax laws and reporting requirements can be complex and may change over time. So it&#8217;s advisable to consult with a tax professional or accountant who is knowledgeable about cryptocurrency taxation or crypto taxes to ensure accurate reporting and compliance with current regulations..</p>
<h2>How to Stay Informed on Crypto Taxes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are a number of ways to stay informed about IRS rule changes related to cryptocurrency investing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Official IRS Website: The IRS website often publishes updates, guidance, and rulings related to cryptocurrency taxation. The &#8220;Virtual Currencies&#8221; section is particularly relevant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are also IRS Publications so it is worth keeping an eye on publications such as Publication 544 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets), Publication 550 (Investment Income and Expenses), and Publication 525 (Taxable and Nontaxable Income) for any updates or guidance related to cryptocurrency. The IRS regularly releases notices, announcements, and rulings that provide guidance on various tax topics, including cryptocurrency. Monitoring these can help you stay updated.</li>
<li>Get Advice From a Tax Professional: It is important to get professional advice from a qualifies tax professional who specializes in crypto taxes and can provide personalized guidance and ensure you&#8217;re adhering to the latest rules and regulations.</li>
<li>Industry News and Publications:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Online news sites such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews.com</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com">CoinDesk</a> and other cryptocurrency-focused media outlets offer up to date news on any tax rule changes and developments.</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Platforms: Some exchanges and trading platforms such as Coinbase may provide resources, webinars, or guides on tax implications related to their services.</li>
<li>Online Forums and Communities: Platforms like Reddit, dedicated cryptocurrency forums, or other online communities can be valuable sources of information. However, always verify information from these sources with official IRS guidance or a tax professional.</li>
<li>Attend Seminars and Webinars: By attending seminars, webinars, or workshops hosted by tax professionals, financial institutions, or industry organizations focusing on crypto taxes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stay One Step Ahead!</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Given the evolving nature of cryptocurrency and its taxation, it&#8217;s crucial to regularly check multiple sources and prepare early for your tax return — Start by organizing cryptocurrency-related documents, seek professional advice if necessary, and stay informed about any updates in tax regulations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When in any doubt, always consult with a tax professional or advisor familiar with cryptocurrency rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Happy investing!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>The United Nations estimates that approximately 385,000 babies are born each day – now imagine if a handful of these newborns were educated and raised to become the next Bitcoin billionaire? There is no age restriction for mining and learning therefore there is nothing stopping parents from educating their kids about crypto from a very early stage.</p>
<p>Having children is an extremely expensive business. But if parents could justify having children with the potential return on investment things could work out. Despite the slump it is still possible to get rich from Bitcoin, seeing significant gains over the long run. It is important to be aware that in the U.S., you must be at least 18 years old to invest in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.troweprice.com/content/dam/trowecorp/Press%20Release%20-%20PKM22_release_FINAL%2004052022.pdf">T. Rowe Price’s 14th annual Parents, Kids &amp; Money Survey,</a> which sampled more than 2,000 parents and their 8- to 14-year-old kids, the report revealed interesting insights about parents’ and kids’ knowledge and interest in cryptocurrency. Many kids believe that cryptocurrency is the future of investing: 40% of kids agree with the statement “cryptocurrency is the future of investing.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Findings showed that cryptocurrency is generating money conversations with kids: 42% of parents who are familiar with cryptocurrency agree with the statement, “My kids and I have regular conversations about finances because of cryptocurrency.” And 48% of parents familiar with cryptocurrency say they are excited to talk to their kids about cryptocurrency/ digital assets.” –</em> T. Rowe Price’s 14th annual Parents, Kids &amp; Money Survey.</p></blockquote>
<h3><b>What is Cryptocurrency?</b></h3>
<p>Let’s start with the basics. When teaching toddlers the alphabet — integrate crypto terminology into their everyday speech. So for example: A is for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/altcoins/">Altcoins</a>, B is for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, C is for Crypto and D is for Diamond Hands and so forth. Teaching children at an early age phrases such as “<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/the-most-popular-cryptocurrency-terms.htm">FOMO’ and “HODL</a>” is a win-win.</p>
<p>During bedtime &#8211; stories play an important part in a child’s upbringing – so why not get the kiddy-winks dreaming about digital money. So instead of fairy tales about Prince Charmin saving Cinderella from her evil stepmother and Jack and the Beanstalk  – it’s time to tell children the tale of “Jake and the Bitcoin”  – a tale about a little boy who is offered a USB drive instead of money or magic beans. Teach them financial independence.</p>
<p>Read the full take here by <a href="https://talesworld.org/fairy-tale/jake-and-the-bitcoin/">The TalesWorld Team. </a></p>
<h3><b>Gift your Child a Digital Piggy Bank?</b></h3>
<p>Make learning about crypto more relatable – explain to children that cryptocurrency is like a treasure chest stored in a computer. Instead of holding physical coins you can touch, magic internet money is stored virtually. Picture a digital piggy bank where you keep your digital coins. Just like your piggy bank at home, it&#8217;s a safe place to keep your special money.</p>
<p>One idea is to gift your child crypto by purchasing a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/wallet-guides/">cold wallet</a> which allows for crypto to be sent to a specific address. Hold onto this until they reach adulthood. When purchasing crypto on behalf of your child there is no bank involved. So, if it’s lost or stolen it wil be gone forever. Hold onto that address and password. If you forget the  wallet&#8217;s password or lose access to your private keys – you will typically lose access to the funds stored on that wallet.</p>
<p>Explaining the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-bitcoin-mining-works.htm">mining process of Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrencies can be simplified – think of it like a computer system which is being used to generate new coins. This process involves lots of power from decentralized networks of computers around the world that verify and secure <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/blockchain/">blockchains</a> – the virtual ledgers that document cryptocurrency transactions.</p>
<p>Another idea is to reward a child with treats when Bitcoin goes up – Imagine your computer is a secret clubhouse. Only you and your friends who know the secret codes can go inside. Cryptocurrency works the same way, keeping your special digital coins safe and happy.</p>
<p>Inform children about the importance of security and get them reciting seed phrases before bed. In the digital world, there are smart computer helpers called “miners.” They work together to make sure everyone&#8217;s digital coins are safe and sound.</p>
<h3><b>Funny Crypto Meme Names such as Dogecoin </b></h3>
<p>There is no doubt crypto is a fun digital asset class which has been designed for the online gaming industry. There are a number of fun and entertaining cryptocurrencies such as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-shiba-inu-coin.htm">Shiba Inu</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-pepe-2-0-coin.htm">Pepe Coin</a>, Floki and BoneShiba Swap – this makes crypto way more entertaining than hard money.  Dogecoin also known as the first &#8220;dog coin&#8221; or  &#8220;meme coin”  is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a &#8220;joke&#8221;, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies an be spent to purchase real-world goods and services in various ways although their acceptance is still not as widespread as hard cash. Currently there aren&#8217;t any age limitations for playing with bitcoin, although opening an account would require the guardian handling this side of busines as most big exchanges meet <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-kyc-know-your-customer-process-explained.htm">Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations</a> to ensure that customers are at least 18 years old. Therefore KYC regulations require customers to confirm their identity when opening an account.</p>
<h3><b>Play-to-Earn, Gaming and Earning Crypto</b></h3>
<p>Play-to-earning gaming is a new trend which is popular in emerging markets and developing countries like Brazil and the Philippines. – <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-to-earn-games.htm">Play-to-Earn gaming</a> is where player are able to earn cryptocurrency through gaming by completing online activities. The trend is also known as P2E games, giving players cruptocurrecy or non-fungible tokens rewards even allowing gamers to buy virtual land. Games will engage children to learn about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Those looking to buy a present for their teenagers – Popular games include <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-play-axie-infinity.htm">Axie Infinity</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/entering-the-metaverse-signing-up-to-decentraland.htm">Decentraland</a>, Illuvium, Splinterlands, The Sandbox, and Gods Unchained. How does gaming and earning crypto work? For example Axie Infinity involves skills and can be competitive which means finding an “Axie” pet which is able to destroy its opponents virtually.  So the more opponents defeated the more a players wallet grows. Please beaware that most games such as Axie Infinitywill be rated 18+, however, there is no age-verification process</p>
<p>Anotehr important warning around play-to-earn games in the past have raised concerns with some parents parents and health experts as they do introduce children to digital assets – it is important to monitor children’s activity and in like with everything in life moderation is key. This is a brilliant way to intrdocuce investing but age restriction do apply with most games.</p>

<p>Taipei Blockchain Week kicked off this week with around 2,000 people from the crypto community gathering on Thursday to hear industry players discuss blockchain trends ranging from Llayer 1&#8217;s role in Web3&#8217;s in 2024 to the future of decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">DeFi</a>).</p>
<p>The event opened with a keynote speech from the Mayor of Taipei, Chiang Wan-an who welcomed innovation to the city. High-profile guest speakers included Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, and Binance’s new CEO Richard Teng who spoke about the importance of regulation in the crypto space.</p>
<p>From a live stream Teng, a former Abu Dhabi regulator who was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">recently appointed CEO of Binance</a> succeeding Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ),  said he felt “humbled and honoured” to be leading the exchange adding he has seen the user base continue to grow – currently standing at 167 million users.</p>
<p>Speaking about his past role as a regulator he stressed that it is important to support growth as well as manage risk – just focusing on managing risk means the growth dynamic will be overlooked.</p>
<p>“Traditional media still associate crypto and blockchain with scams and illicit funds – but if you look at data issued by the US financial crime office Chainalysis and many other research pieces &#8212; the amount of illicit funds going into crypto is 0.02%,” said Teng.</p>
<p>Teng went on to add he remains bullish regarding crypto and with the Bitcoin Halving coming up and “hopefully” with an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-could-grow-by-1-trillion-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-cryptoquant-report.htm">ETF being approved in the US</a> more institutions will be entering the space.</p>
<h3><b>Special Guest Buterin Holds Taiwan Employment Gold Card</b></h3>
<p>Buterin spoke at the conference enthusiastically talking through Ethereuam’s pipeline. Ethereum co-founder Buterin has a special relationship with Taiwan having been granted a <a href="https://www.ftvnews.com.tw/news/detail/2023816F10M1">Taiwan Employment Gold Card</a> &#8211; a permit that will allow him to legally reside and work in the country.</p>
<p>Most recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-plans-to-redesign-ethereum-staking-praises-utxo.htm">Buterin</a>, who introduced a conceptual architecture called the enshrined Zero-Knowledge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-delays-decision-on-invesco-galaxys-ethereum-etf-until-february-2024.htm">Ethereum</a> Virtual Machine (ZK-EVM) to enhance the main chain’s efficiency has <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/enshrined_zk_evm">blogged</a>, that the proposal of the enshrined <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nil-foundation-launches-type-1-zkevm-for-scalability-on-ethereum.htm">ZK-EVM</a> is aimed at integrating advanced cryptographic techniques directly into Ethereum’s main chain. By doing so, it seeks to provide a more secure and efficient verification process for Ethereum transactions. Specifically, it intends to improve and optimize the operation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-layer-2-blast-closes-in-on-solana-after-reaching-600-million-tvl-in-10-days.htm">Layer-2</a> applications.</p>
<h3><b>What Bear Market?</b></h3>
<p>With stands full of cakes and freebies, and human sized neon yellow Pikachu’s roaming around the conference centre in Taiwan – it certainly didn’t feel like a bear market. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-fomc-optimism-spot-etf-buzz-lift-btc-to-42750.htm">price of Bitcoin has soared</a> to $42,777, marking a significant 4% increase on Thursday. This rally is buoyed by a wave of optimism following the Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting, which indicated a dovish stance on future rate hikes, and sparked lively discussions on the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, with investment giant BlackRock interpreting the minutes as a ‘green light for investors.’</p>
<p>David Tng, managing director of TZ APAC, which is Asia&#8217;s leading Tezos blockchain Incubator told Cryptonews there is an excellent turnout ths year. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve been very impressed at how Taipei Blockchain Week has grown. The event has gathered leaders and innovators from all walks of the industry, from Layer 1 blockchain entities to startups making a real-world impact”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tng who is based in Singapore and flew to Taipie for the event – and sees Taipei Blockchain Week as an excellent opportunity to network explaining that the Taiwanese artists and projects he has met are great symbols of the innovation he is seeing in the region.</p>
<p>“The akaSwap team was one of the startups that really caught my eye with their unique gamification approach they take when building their products,&#8221; said Tng.</p>
<p>Day 2 of the event continues tomorrow.</p>

<p>In an exclusive insight, Wael Makarem, Financial Markets Strategist Lead at Exness, offers his expert opinion on the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the wake of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao&#8217;s recent resignation</a>.</p>
<p>This significant development in the crypto world has prompted a reevaluation of market dynamics, investor behavior, and future trends.</p>
<p>Makarem delves into the complexities of Bitcoin and Ethereum&#8217;s price movements, institutional influences, and the regulatory shifts shaping the industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Exclusive Insights from Wael Makarem</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In an exclusive interview, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wael-makarem-cima®-acsi-b62a4ba0/?originalSubdomain=ae">Wael Makarem</a>, the Lead Financial Markets Strategist at Exness, provided <a href="https://cryptonews.com">CryptoNews</a> with detailed insights, illuminating the current trends in the cryptocurrency market in the wake of the resignation of Binance CEO.</p>
<p><i><strong>Here are the salient points from their interaction:</strong></i></p>
<h3><strong>1. Influencing Factors in Crypto Price Movements</strong></h3>
<p>Wael Makarem, the Financial Markets Strategist Lead at Exness, offers a comprehensive analysis of the diverse factors impacting the price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum. He explains that these leading cryptocurrencies respond to a myriad of influences both within and outside the crypto market.</p>
<p>This includes the growing demand from various investor groups and the fluctuating risk sentiment and monetary policies, underscoring the inherently risky and sensitive nature of these digital assets.</p>
<p>A significant driver for both <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum is the increasing involvement of institutional investors. Major financial institutions are actively engaging with Bitcoin through ETFs and custody services, lending greater legitimacy to the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Regulatory decisions also play a crucial role, as evidenced by Grayscale’s legal victories against the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-spot-bitcoin-etf-market-sees-new-applicant.htm">SEC over its crypto ETF applications</a>, which have markedly bolstered market confidence.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the anticipated 2024 halving event for Bitcoin, set to slash the production of new coins by 50%, is expected to lend substantial support to its value.</p>
<p>Moreover, a shift in risk sentiment, fueled by the expectation that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of its interest rate hikes, and the potential for reduced borrowing costs next year, could further bolster the appeal of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar risk-prone assets.</p>
<p>Makarem’s insights highlight the intricate web of factors that investors must navigate in the dynamic and complex world of cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<h3>2. Outlook on Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>Wael Makarem provides an insightful <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-total-crypto-market-cap-reaches-1-5-trillion-is-40000-the-next-target-for-btc.htm">outlook on the cryptocurrency market</a>, noting its significant rally in recent weeks. This surge has seen a broad increase in prices across various cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin continuing to lead as the dominant force. Its market capitalization, exceeding an impressive 730 billion dollars, underscores its substantial influence in the crypto sphere.</p>
<p>Makarem points out that while current trends indicate a positive outlook, buoyed by a risk-on sentiment among investors, potential challenges lie ahead. He emphasizes that the cryptocurrency market could face risks stemming from regulatory and economic changes.</p>
<p>Notably, shifts in monetary policy and projections for economic growth are critical factors that could alter the market&#8217;s risk appetite. These aspects are poised to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market, reflecting the interconnectedness of global financial policies and digital asset valuations.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Reflections on Binance&#8217;s Recent Developments</strong></h3>
<p>In his analysis of the latest developments with Binance, Wael Makarem, underscores the complexities and risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in terms of regulation and operations. The recent settlement between <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-from-binance-us-board-of-directors.htm">Binance and U.S. authorities</a> has thrown a spotlight on these challenges, demonstrating the precarious nature of the regulatory landscape in the crypto industry.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Binance Executives Preemptively Disclosed $4.3 Billion Settlement</p>
<p>Executives from Binance, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, are reported to have informed their top market makers about a potential $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities before it was made public,… <a href="https://t.co/AfAg9CR0Sg">pic.twitter.com/AfAg9CR0Sg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; YAMI (@yami10101092) <a href="https://twitter.com/yami10101092/status/1731164850175594975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Makarem points out that the ever-evolving regulatory environment poses significant risks not only for companies operating within the crypto sphere but also for investors whose assets might be impacted by legal actions.</p>
<p>This scenario is further complicated by the presence of illegal activities and operations within some of the largest market players, potentially leading to disruptions and uncertainties for investors.</p>
<p>However, Makarem also suggests a silver lining in this situation. The increased oversight and regulatory actions, while initially posing challenges, could eventually lead to a safer trading environment.</p>
<p>As more companies in the crypto industry begin to comply with rules and regulations, the overall market stability and investor confidence could improve. This shift towards a regulated environment, according to Makarem, might be essential for the long-term health and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Market Dynamics and Investor Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>Wael Makarem discusses how current market dynamics are influencing investor behavior and decision-making in the cryptocurrency market. He observes that recent legal and regulatory developments are prompting caution among investors, significantly affecting the market&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>This cautious approach is further compounded by global economic conditions, including high inflation, stringent monetary policies, and slowing economic growth in major economies.</p>
<p>Despite the general risk-on sentiment that has benefitted cryptocurrencies, Makarem warns that the market might continue to experience risks and volatility.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Investment Advice and Risk Management</strong></h3>
<p>Regarding advice for investors and traders, Makarem emphasizes the importance of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-regulator-sets-it-sights-crypto-risks-potential-risk-management-rules.htm">risk management</a> in the current cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>He advises investors to prioritize diversification as a strategy to spread and mitigate risk, focusing on long-term potential rather than short-term gains. Keeping abreast of market trends and regulatory changes is crucial in this rapidly evolving sector.</p>
<p>Makarem also stresses the importance of assessing personal risk tolerance and investing within those limits. Active risk and loss management are key to navigating the cryptocurrency market successfully.</p>
<p>He particularly cautions against leveraged trading, highlighting its potential to amplify losses. His advice underscores the need for a measured and well-informed approach to investing in cryptocurrencies, balancing the prospects of high returns with the inherent risks of this volatile market.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In conclusion, Wael Makarem&#8217;s analysis provides a multi-dimensional view of the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the influence of institutional interests, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors.</p>
<p>His insights into Binance&#8217;s recent developments highlight the complex interplay between regulatory risks and market stability.</p>
<p>Makarem advises investors to focus on risk management and informed decision-making in this dynamic financial landscape. His expert perspective not only captures the current state of cryptocurrencies but also offers a roadmap for navigating future market trends.</p>

Hardware wallets are considered &ldquo;cold wallets&rdquo; because they have no direct internet functionality and must be attached to another device, such as a smartphone or PC, to bridge to the internet and perform a transaction.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">These hardware devices and the bridge they connect via are the most crucial points of failure when performing cryptocurrency transactions.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">With 2022 becoming the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-hacks-stole-record-38-billion-2022-led-by-north-korea-groups-report-2023-02-01/">worst year on record</a> for cryptocurrency hacks, with $3.8 billion stolen, OPSEC has never been more critical. As the digital asset space becomes more mainstream, attackers seek new ways to exploit users and platforms.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While the stakes and risk profile for every entity using digital assets will vary, all users should obey best practices for protecting their value.</p><h2>Securing The Signing Environment</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Before signing transactions, look at your environment to identify <i>anything</i> that could serve as an attack vector.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Assuming you are in an otherwise private setting, such as your home, this includes things like cameras or microphones, which are present on almost all modern laptops and mobile devices.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Don&rsquo;t forget about various Internet of Things (IoT) products such as smart TVs, Alexa, etc. Any of these can be potentially used to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazons-alexa-never-stops-listening-to-you/">spy on you</a> while you perform a transaction.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As such, it&#8217;s essential to &ldquo;clean&rdquo; your working space of anything that could be potentially tapped into &mdash; powering down or even removing these devices from the area of operation altogether.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">While this may come across as a little paranoid, if large, critical amounts of money are on the line, it is one important aspect of protecting you from attackers.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Signing transactions from any public space, such as an office, library, or cafe, is generally not recommended, but you may sometimes have no other alternative. If this is the case, several steps can be taken to maximize security.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Once again, you&rsquo;ll want to account for any security cameras in the area. These days, CCTV, especially HD and 4K resolution cameras, can easily read what is displayed on a computer or mobile phone screen within the field of view.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Of course &mdash; and hopefully, this goes without saying &mdash; there shouldn&rsquo;t be any other people in direct proximity. It is best to find the most secluded space possible, an empty workroom, for example.</p><h2>Update All Involved Devices</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps most importantly, you&rsquo;ll want to update all software and firmware on any devices involved in the signing process.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If you aren&rsquo;t using a computer or mobile device directly, then your hardware wallet will need to connect to one to transmit a transaction.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Theoretically, hardware wallets are designed so that it shouldn&rsquo;t matter if the unit they connect to is compromised. All processes happen on the wallet itself; PCs or smartphones are only used to broadcast the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">However, some forms of malware can alter various aspects of a transaction, including the amount and the recipient address. Even the change address &mdash; an address where the change from a transaction goes after the chosen amount has been sent to the recipient &mdash; can be manipulated, a field that is easy to overlook.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If you are using a phone or computer, you will want to update your operating system with the latest security patch. Your wallet&#8217;s firmware, too, should be regulatory updated.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Though unless the update involves a specific urgent security threat, it is often better to wait a few days after a new release to upgrade. This is because it&rsquo;s common for there to be bugs present in the latest patches, which tend to be resolved quickly but can cause headaches. For this reason, giving non-critical updates a bit of room to be tested is a good idea.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">One last thing to remember is to continually update all software and firmware only from official sources, like a website or repository.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Try to learn to use tools like <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GPG</a> to check the file signatures against the officially documented ones to confirm all data matches what is supposed to be there.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Never trust any links, even those coming from within a given piece of software itself, as there are far too many ways they can be used as a means of attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As an example, the popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> wallet <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/electrum/"><strong>Electrum</strong></a> suffered an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/electrum-wallet-phishing-attackers-steal-usd-22m-in-bitcoin-7980.htm">attack</a> in 2020 that allowed malicious actors to push a message to all users through the app itself, claiming the need for an update with a link provided.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As it turned out, the link was a phishing attack that installed a corrupt version of Electrum on the victim&rsquo;s machine. This gave the attackers full control of the wallets of those who installed the malicious software, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds.</p><h2>Easily Overlooked OPSEC Procedures</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">One of the most obvious attack vectors to address is human error. Even if you think you have good security, humans tend to develop a false sense of security when nothing goes wrong, leading to lax practices.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The worst failures happen when you let your guard down. Never rush a signing event; ensure you have plenty of uninterrupted time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Hurrying or being distracted are great ways to overlook something like double-checking your transaction data before confirming a signature.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">While we&rsquo;ve mentioned several lines of defense, the latter should never be taken for granted. Double and triple-check the amounts and addresses involved in any transaction because it could save you from making a major mistake.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Also, be extremely wary of using public charging stations or even unknown, third-party USB cables. There are seemingly innocuous USB cables <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90413945/theres-a-scary-new-reason-not-to-borrow-a-strangers-iphone-cable">circulating</a> with tiny chips inside the head that can intercept and inject data &mdash; hijacking a cryptocurrency transaction and wreaking havoc.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Combined with some issues around compatibility and device wear, it is always best to use the USB cables that are packaged with any external signing device.</p><h2>Health Checks Can Provide Quick Confidence In Your Keys</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Lastly, there&rsquo;s a technique that some signing devices offer that can be invaluable in boosting security. Known as a &ldquo;<a href="https://support.keys.casa/hc/en-us/articles/360045442511-Health-checks-in-the-Casa-app">health check</a>,&rdquo; this technique provides an easy way to verify that your keys are available for signing transactions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If you were to run a health check on a mobile phone, the check would first confirm that your key is available locally and that the device is working correctly. It will also ensure that the same valid key is backed up securely on the cloud.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This can all be automated with a simple click, and the user will be alerted if anything is wrong.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The same basic steps apply for hardware wallets, but the external device will need to be connected to a computer or mobile phone. Health checks can be done for multiple keys on multi-signature wallets as well.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Importantly, If these keys are stored across different devices, the health check should be run on every relevant unit.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While the world of OPSEC is complex and ever-changing, securing the environment, keeping all devices updated, and ensuring they&rsquo;ve accounted for easily overlooked issues, are essential steps to staying ahead of attackers.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">By combining these strategies with regular health checks every six months, users can significantly improve the security that protects their cryptocurrency funds.</p><p>____</p><h3>Learn more:&nbsp;</h3><p>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-trezor-and-the-sandbox-issue-security-warnings-cronos-launches-a-new-dex-three-japanese-banks-set-to-test-stablecoins-on-japan-open-chain.htm">Trezor Issues a Security Warning</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/popular-hardware-wallet-was-hacked-by-cybersecurity-firm-should-you-concerned.htm">This Popular Hardware Wallet was Hacked by a Cybersecurity Firm &ndash;&nbsp;Should You Be Concerned?</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-crypto-hackers-fraudsters-stole-162-billion-in-q4-alone-silvergate-cuts-40-of-workforce-us-sec-brings-charges-in-coindeal-investment-scheme.htm">Crypto Hackers &amp; Fraudsters Stole $1.62 Billion in Q4 Alone</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-lost-nearly-4-billion-to-fraudsters-last-year-will-things-improve-in-2023.htm">Web3 Lost Nearly $4 Billion To Fraudsters Last Year &#8211; Will Things Improve in 2023</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-scammer-gets-away-with-12m-arb-tokens-through-address-poisoning-attack-heres-what-happened.htm">Crypto Scammer Gets Away with $1.2M in ARB Tokens Through &#8216;Address Poisoning&#8217; Attack &ndash; Here&#8217;s What Happened</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-wallet-maker-ledger-raises-109-million-latest-funding-round-bull-market-back.htm">Crypto Wallet Maker Ledger Raises $109 Million in Latest Funding Round &ndash; Is the Bull Market Back?</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metamask-introduces-more-payment-options-for-buying-cryptocurrencies-crypto-adoption-rise.htm">MetaMask Introduces More Payment Options for Buying Cryptocurrencies &ndash; Crypto Adoption on the Rise?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/apple-approves-decentralized-exchange-uniswap-ios-wallet-app-heres-how-it-works.htm">Apple Approves Decentralized Exchange Uniswap iOS Wallet App &ndash; Here&#8217;s How it Works</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm">How to Choose a Bitcoin Wallet?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/3-ways-to-set-up-an-ethereum-wallet.htm">3 Ways to Set Up an Ethereum Wallet</a></p>

Enter utility NFTs.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Designed to provide tangible utility to holders by way of rewards and other perks, utility NFTs may, in fact, be the key to the widespread adoption of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">Web3</a>. By offering real-world benefits, this may convince non-crypto natives to test the waters of Web3.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Below are six use cases of NFTs, all of which illustrate how utility NFTs can benefit holders while at the same time, insulating the space against future hype cycles to create a stronger Web3 and drive greater mainstream use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">1. NFT Memberships</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Imagine the exclusivity of <strong>Soho House</strong>, but instead of memberships by way of referrals and direct debits, people are granted access by purchasing a Soho House NFT.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Companies such as <a href="https://cnaluxury.channelnewsasia.com/people/what-does-mandala-clubs-new-s15000-nft-membership-get-you-213236"><strong>Mandala Club</strong></a> have already begun to leverage the potential of NFT memberships, selling at price tags as high as S$15,000. Benefits offered through NFT memberships include access to exclusive newsletters, Discord channels, interviews, and events.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Not only do NFT memberships provide a streamlined means to verify members, but they also allow for peer-to-peer sales and trading enabling the value of a given membership to appreciate with demand through secondary trading and sales.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Examples in the cryptosphere include the <a href="https://crypto.com/nft/collection/82421cf8e15df0edcaa200af752a344f?tab=items"><strong>Loaded Lions</strong></a> and <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club</strong> (<a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/">BAYC</a>) memberships. The Loaded Lions offers members VIP experiences, giveaways, and priority access to selected <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cryptocom/"><strong>Crypto.com</strong></a> NFT drops.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The BAYC membership, on the other hand, offers owners access to member-only areas, real-world events, and special merchandise. Just as event organizers would now turn to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/"><strong>Eventbrite</strong></a> for ticket sales, NFTs can be used as a conduit for membership sales, acting as a means to onboard more mainstream users to Web3.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">2. Driving Phygital Experiences</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Alongside virtual asset ownership, the concept coined &lsquo;phygital&rsquo; ties physical goods and services into the digital world by way of NFT sales. This may take place when a buyer receives a physical item through the purchase of an NFT.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond merely digital art, NFTs are being used as a medium for <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-first-nft-home-just-sold-for-175000/437522">real-world real estate sales</a>.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Another iteration of &lsquo;phygital&rsquo; takes place when the purchase of a certain item offers buyers a digital version in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/metaverse/">metaverse</a>. <strong>Adidas</strong>&rsquo; <a href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/metaverse">Into the Metaverse</a> collection demonstrates how this can be brought to life in real time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">With an <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1241219/adidas-sports-and-outdoor-online-shops-brand-profile-in-the-united-states#:~:text=How%20loyal%20are%20the%20customers,show%20loyalty%20to%20the%20brand.">84% loyalty rate</a> among US customers, companies like Adidas can leverage their influence to entice customers into Web3 through phygital NFT offerings.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">3. Metaverse Branding</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Hand in hand with the allure of phygital NFT offerings, NFTs in the metaverse enable companies to corner a new addressable market on the frontier of branding and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/advertising/">advertising</a>.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">With increasing recognition and momentum, the metaverse offers companies a world of new real estate to consider for marketing efforts.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Major brands such as <a href="https://www.swoosh.nike/"><strong>Nike</strong></a> and <a href="https://vault.gucci.com/en-GB/story/metaverse"><strong>Gucci</strong></a> have dropped NFT collections for owners to claim digital editions of their products. As a result, users are able to wear their favorite brands in the metaverse through new forms of digital expression enabled by augmented and virtual reality.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In turn, loyal customers may find themselves more likely to onboard into Web3, with a metaverse full of brands that they already know and trust.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">4. NFTs in Gaming</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">NFTs enable <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/gaming/">gamers</a> to buy assets and features within <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain</a> games, effectively allowing them to buy into communities they are passionate about.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">In contrast to traditional in-game purchases, NFTs allow assets to be ported from one game to another and controlled by the owner rather than the game.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This extends the lifespan and value of in-game assets, handing the power back to players. The autonomy granted by NFT asset ownership offers an incentive for traditional gamers to transition to blockchain gaming, providing a means to onboard an additional user pool into Web3.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">5. NFTs to Rewire DeFi</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Similar to the unique benefits that NFTs can offer holders in a membership setting, the unique non-fungible nature of NFTs can provide holder-specific positions and benefits within the decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) landscape.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">At present, DeFi users often face periods of illiquidity when staking cryptocurrency to earn rewards. NFTs, however, offer an easily-tradable alternative, removing issues of illiquidity when users would otherwise have to lock up protocol tokens for fixed periods of time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, DeFi protocols can also add gamification elements, offering users benefits such as NFT staking boosters, exclusive allowlist access, and fee rebates to name a few. <strong>VVSGotchi</strong> does this by offering tangible utility to its VVS Miner Mole NFT collection through experience points which can be used to earn higher rewards on staked NFTs.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">DeFi protocols can also define the scarcity of their NFTs, allowing the value to match the demand.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The given examples illustrate how NFTs can further enrich the DeFi ecosystem with added functionality while reducing the risk of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/volatility/">volatility</a>. In doing so, NFTs will help build a more robust DeFi landscape, creating a greater appeal for new and existing users alike.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">6. Gamification of Health and Social Media</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Through the use of NFTs, the gamification of traditional industries hands the power back to the users through greater data ownership and monetization opportunities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, one can mint their <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/nfts-an-health-data/">health history into an NFT</a> and sell it to third parties interested in the data. Alongside, health-oriented feature-to-earn projects are already entering the fray, such as <a href="https://stepn.com/"><strong>Stepn</strong></a>, which allows users to earn rewards for the steps they have taken.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">With royalties automatically accrued to the creator, the use of NFTs in conjunction with the wellness industry offers users innovative new revenue streams.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">While <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/social-media/">social media</a> giants such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/instagram/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a> are working to provide users with NFT offerings, launching features to allow users to mint and sell on existing platforms, a new generation of decentralized social media has entered the mix.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">New projects such as <a href="https://www.deso.com/"><strong>DeSo</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.lens.xyz/"><strong>Lens Protocol</strong></a> are poised to offer users a fully Web3-native social media experience with features such as creator coins, micro tipping, and gas-free NFT minting.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The unique revenue streams offered by the gamification of both health and social media through NFTs offer users the means to monetize things they are already doing for free.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The result? Two vast addressable user bases able to champion the use of NFTs into the mainstream.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">NFTs: Catalyzing the Mainstream Adoption of Web3 with Utility</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Rather than having to rely on status value or quick trades, NFTs will be able to add a more meaningful, long-term value proposition for countless industries worldwide.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">By thinking in terms of the functions that the underlying technology offers, everyday users can reap the benefits offered by NFTs without concern for market volatility or the price fluctuations of specific assets.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">In doing so, NFTs will act as the catalyst to propel the mainstream <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">adoption</a> of Web3 by supporting, streamlining, and strengthening existing verticals rather than dismantling and rewiring them altogether.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">____</p><h3>Learn more:</h3><p>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/luxury-brand-gucci-collaborates-with-bored-ape-creator-yuga-labs-for-metaverse-project-crypto-adoption-rise.htm">Luxury Brand Gucci Collaborates with Bored Ape Creator Yuga Labs for Metaverse Project &ndash;&nbsp;Crypto Adoption on the Rise?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/exclusive-interview-tether-co-founder-says-crypto-industry-will-bounce-back-despite-past-failures-heres-why.htm">Exclusive Interview: Tether Co-Founder Says Crypto Industry Will Bounce Back Despite Past Failures &#8211; Here&rsquo;s Why</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-crypto-startup-enables-users-send-nfts-using-phone-numbers-is-future-of-nfts.htm">New Crypto Startup Enables Users to Send NFTs Using Phone Numbers &ndash;&nbsp;Is This The Future of NFTs?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spotifys-latest-experiment-playlists-unlocked-by-nft-holders-the-future-of-music-streaming.htm">Spotify&#8217;s Latest Experiment: Playlists Unlocked by NFT Holders &ndash; The Future of Music Streaming?</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indian-advertising-watchdog-releases-new-guidelines-for-crypto-ads.htm">Indian Advertising Watchdog Releases New Guidelines For Crypto Ads</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-ad-regulator-sends-enforcement-notice-crypto-promoters.htm">UK Ad Regulator Sends &#8216;Enforcement Notice&#8217; to Crypto Promoters</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gaming-giant-sony-files-patent-enable-nft-transferability-across-games-consoles.htm">Gaming Giant Sony Files Patent to Enable NFT Transferability Across Games and Consoles</a><br>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/amazon-enter-crypto-nft-market-with-gaming-initiative-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">Amazon to Enter the Crypto NFT Market with Gaming Initiative &ndash; Here&rsquo;s What You Need to Know</a><br><br>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/a-beginner-s-guide-to-nfts-what-you-should-know.htm">A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to NFTs: What You Should Know</a><br>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-nft-marketplaces.htm">Top 10 NFT Marketplaces</a></p>

And while our revenue model heavily relies on incentivizing people to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/staking/">stake</a> their crypto, seeing that some of them don&rsquo;t really understand what staking is has always been quite disheartening for me.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Failing to comprehend what you&rsquo;re doing inevitably leads to trouble. And in this case, it might be trouble for the entire community.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Being responsible is one of the core requirements for any validator on any proof-of-stake (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-stake/">PoS</a>) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain</a>. It&rsquo;s absolutely fair and reasonable. Otherwise, those blockchains would stop working quite soon.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">But what we often tend to ignore is that the community has its own share of responsibility, too. In this piece, I&rsquo;ll explain what it&rsquo;s all about.</p><h2>Start with the Basics</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">For starters, sometimes we need to explain how a PoS-based economy is different from a proof-of-work (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-work/">PoW</a>) one.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">PoW blockchains depend on the computational power of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/mining/">miners</a>. The more powerful your equipment, the more likely you are to mine a new block and get new coins as a reward. In this case, the coins represent nothing but value imposed on them by the community.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In PoS blockchains and their variations like DPoS, a coin represents more than just value: it&rsquo;s also a governance right. Put simply, owning a coin on a PoS blockchain grants you the right to influence its further development and progress through voting.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">But quite often, you don&rsquo;t have enough funds (and coins) to run and maintain your own node, which would allow you to make decisions affecting the entire network. That&rsquo;s where validators come into play.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Running your own node is quite an expensive endeavor. Not only do you need the equipment, but you also need to service it 24/7, which requires some profound DevOps expertise. It&rsquo;s simply cheaper and less troublesome to have someone else do that for a fee that is incomparably lower than your own potential expenses on running a node.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A validator is very much like your representative in a parliament. While you may wield the source of power in your country as its citizen, you actually have only a fraction thereof, much like most of your compatriots. Instead, you delegate your governance rights to someone you trust. That&rsquo;s the gist of representative democracy. And also, that&rsquo;s the gist of PoS blockchains.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">We don&rsquo;t need to go very far to see what happens when people delegate their power to delinquents. Just like an incompetent government might rule their country into oblivion, irresponsible validators could put a blockchain on the brink of extinction solely by failing to do their job right.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This very fact alone means that the community must feel responsible for the fate of the blockchain whose tokens they hold. This directly impacts the profitability of their purchase, at the very least.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">But instead, we often see that the only thing people are interested in is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). Moreover, the typical way of thought suggests that the higher the APR is, the better for the delegator. And, believe it or not, it is just as big a problem.</p><h2>How High APR Can Be Evil</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">While the crypto economy is often hailed as superior to the fiat one, it primarily concerns the technological aspect, leaving behind the fact that they&rsquo;re not so very different from the economic standpoint.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When the US Federal Reserve System (FRS) starts printing new dollars, it&rsquo;s pretty apparent to everyone that a surge of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/inflation/">inflation</a> is afoot. But when you get your staking rewards, you actually do the same: you validate transactions of existing coins and, for doing so, get similar coins out of thin air. It is the very same inflation model that we see in the fiat economy. For good or for bad, it&rsquo;s just how things work in our world in this day and age.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">APR, the most popular metric for most people who weigh on whether they should start staking, is, in fact, the inflation rate of the blockchain in question.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">And inflation means that the asset&rsquo;s value is gradually diluted, and so is the user&rsquo;s share in the blockchain&rsquo;s governance. The core problem here, however, is that people tend to disagree on what this value actually means.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To many people, I have to admit, the value is measured in the exchange rate of the coin to USD. This kind of user is mainly after the quick buck, and they don&rsquo;t give much thought to what sort of blockchain they&rsquo;re investing in by staking their coins.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The real value of a coin, however, is in the power it grants its holder to influence the direction the blockchain takes and, therefore, its success. The more successful a blockchain is, the higher its tokens are valued in USD. So, in a way, ignoring this aspect actually harms their plans to make money.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The same logic suggests that there are better ideas than seeking blockchains with higher APRs. An APR of 20% means that the inflation rate is through the roof. You would start panicking about your well-being if it were US dollars, pounds, or euros. Why are you happy when it&rsquo;s crypto? It&rsquo;s just as bad for you.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">When a PoS blockchain has an APR of 20%, it means that its model is flawed and seeks to attract more users rather than create a sustainable model. It becomes apparent later when it turns out that their customer base growth seriously lags behind the APR, leading to accelerated value dilution and, eventually, to the devaluing of the blockchain itself. I can compare it to a country whose currency becomes a bunch of worthless paper due to unreasonable economic policy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, some blockchains don&rsquo;t even need staking for their functioning, and they add it artificially to attract more users. Just take a moment and think about it: if a blockchain doesn&rsquo;t need staking to produce new coins, it might be just a machine for creating coins without any intrinsic value.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">This evokes particular words in my mind. One of them starts with a &ldquo;P&rdquo; and ends with an &ldquo;onzi.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">But even if staking is required for a blockchain&rsquo;s effective functioning, people should still look out for its operation&#8217;s fundamentals. A healthy model often sees the yearly growth of the customer base overtaking the inflation rate (or APR, if you like). This makes the system more balanced and more likely to survive. Caring about things like that is what makes a delegator just as responsible as a validator.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">That said, not all validators are equally responsible. But even among the most irresponsible ones, nothing and no one can compare to cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><h2>Exchanges Can Ruin Everything</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">At the dawn of PoS blockchains, the most common question in the community was: are those &ldquo;validators&rdquo;&nbsp; trustworthy? Can&rsquo;t they collude to overtake the blockchain?</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In my practice, it&rsquo;s a rare stroke of luck if you happen to agree with many people on where to go for lunch, let alone conspire to hijack a complex distributed ecosystem. All validators have their skin in the game, and that&rsquo;s exactly how the ecosystem ensures that none of them would do things to harm it intentionally. And, to my knowledge, no validator has ever done that.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">That&rsquo;s not the case for exchanges. Unlike validators, they don&rsquo;t have any skin in the game.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">They&rsquo;re more like an institutionalized version of those irresponsible users who just want to get rich quickly and don&rsquo;t care about long-term ramifications. Exchanges pursue their own interests, and providing staking opportunities is just one more revenue stream for them. Unsurprisingly, they treat it as such.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">While holding immense user assets in custody, they effectively control them and prevent users from exercising their voting rights through a representative. An exchange can vote if it pleases. Or it can ignore all voting altogether.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">They can just neglect their nodes for days, as we saw in the case of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/kraken/"><strong>Kraken</strong></a> last year. In theory, an exchange can destroy a blockchain by voting or not voting on behalf of many people who would have wanted otherwise. In the real world, we call it usurpation. In the crypto world, we often act as if it&rsquo;s just the way things must be.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The instances of Kraken or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/ftx/"><strong>FTX</strong></a> prove beyond the shadow of the doubt that exchanges cannot be trusted with holding your assets, let alone staking them on your behalf. And if an exchange faces problems with regulators, liquidity, or literally anything, the last thing it would care about is user interests. And it&rsquo;s the users who will pay for the exchange&rsquo;s screw-ups.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">If I were to sum up everything I said, it would be this simple thought: greed is bad.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">You can track down every problem that I mentioned here to human avarice. It may be the avarice of someone who doesn&rsquo;t care about the future value of their holdings and seeks only to make a quick buck. It may be the avarice of an exchange that puts its own interests ahead of those of blockchains.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We must truly understand the true nature of staking, with its pros and cons, if we want this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/">Web3</a> concept to move forward and bring about a better world. If we don&rsquo;t, human greed will corrupt our best efforts.</p><p>____</p><h3>Learn more:&nbsp;</h3><p>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-core-developers-announce-date-for-long-awaited-shapella-upgrade-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Ethereum Core Developers Announce Date for Long-Awaited Shapella Upgrade &ndash; Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-regulator-probing-crypto-staking-services.htm">South Korean Regulator Is Probing Crypto Staking Services</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/our-company-survived-crypto-winter-will-do-it-again-heres-our-survival-guide-for-crypto-businesses.htm">Our Company Survived a Crypto Winter and Will Do It Again: Here&rsquo;s Our Survival Guide for Crypto Businesses</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/one-misconception-and-severe-design-flaw-of-the-ethereum-merge.htm">One Misconception and Severe Design Flaw of the Ethereum Merge</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm">What is Proof-of-Stake?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-stake-eth-for-ethereum-2-0.htm">How to Stake ETH for Ethereum 2.0?</a></p>

Any person who is conducting virtual asset service (VAS) business prior to the VASPA coming into force should be looking to be registered with the <strong>BVI Financial Services Commission</strong> (the BVI FSC) within the 6-month transitional window which expires on 31 July 2023.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All applicants should try their best to submit a full and complete VAS application to the BVI FSC within the transitional timeframe. Incomplete VAS applications run the risk of not being processed by the BVI FSC.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is important that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/regulation/">regulatory</a> advice be taken by persons who are conducting VAS business to ensure that the VAS regime is applicable to them. Once it is determined that a person is a virtual asset service provider (VASP), it is important to start working on the registration application to be filed with the BVI FSC. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Applicants for registration under the VAS regime would need to consider:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (a) <strong>Governance issues</strong>: of always having 2 individual directors, there may be a requirement for a local resident director to be appointed and also having in place a VASPA approved authorised representative based in the BVI who will have to possess sufficient knowledge of the applicant&rsquo;s VAS related business as well as an auditor;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) <strong>Ownership structure</strong>: full information on the ultimate beneficial ownership structure of the VASP including all intermediary structures (if any) will need to be disclosed &ndash; complex structures may lead to delays;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (c) <strong>Business plans</strong>: detailed business plans will need to be submitted taking into account matters related to corporate governance, capital reserves, technological audits, liquidity, risk management strategies, consumer protection provisions, related parties and public disclosures, custody and safe-guarding, escrow and lock up provisions, interoperability, cessation of business and succession planning, implementation of the travel rule;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (d) <strong>Policies and procedures</strong>: an applicant will need to have robust internal controls including, risk assessment frameworks, AML/CFT/CPF and sanctions compliance procedures, outsourcing agreements and policies, data protection and cybersecurity framework, statement of technological infrastructures, business continuity plans, custody and safe-keeping of assets framework, complaints handling procedures, technology audits framework and suitable insurance requirements;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(e) <strong>AML/CFT/CPF requirements</strong>: a VASPA will be considered a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; doing &ldquo;relevant business&rdquo; under the AML/CFT/CPF legislation, as such, a VASPA will need to ensure that as a part of the AML/CFT/CPF regime that it is identifying procedures in relation to new and continuing business relationships, establishing and maintaining verification procedures, where there is reliance on third parties that there is the appropriate channels to obtain the identification documents from those third parties as a means of recording the identity of customers, maintaining records and underlying documents, appointing the necessary compliance and money laundering reporting officers, conducting annual training etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is imperative that all VASPs, once registered under the VASPA, ensures that they comply with all of the on-going regulatory requirements that apply to the VAS regime, e.g.:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) remaining <strong>fit and proper</strong>, as such, fulfilling the BVI FSC&rsquo;s assessment that all VASPs are competent and that they conduct their business in line with the regulatory principles in the Regulatory Code 2009;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) <strong>notification / pre-approval requirements</strong>: for example, change of information provided, change of name, maintaining financially sound condition, appointment of directors, appointment of authorised representative and auditor, submission of audited financial statements, maintenance of records, disposition or acquisition of significant or controlling interest in a VASP, client assets, AML/CFT/CPF and sanctions compliance;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (c) <strong>screening of employees</strong><i><strong>: </strong></i>assessing the competence and probity of employees;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(d) maintaining <strong>adequate human and technological resources</strong> and policies, procedures and mechanisms to ensure compliance; and</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; (e) considering and adapting resources and procedures to any <strong>changes in scope of business</strong> and legislative development.&nbsp;<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Failure to comply with the requirements under the VASPA or the AML/CFT/CPF regime can lead to various criminal offences which carry both monetary penalties and custodial sentences. The BVI FSC would also have at its disposal the administrative penalty regime for any administrative breach by a VASP. These would be the mechanisms that the BVI FSC can use as a part of any enforcement action to be taken.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As with any new legislative regime, it is important that existing VASPs and potential VASPs work closely with their service providers to understand the regime created by the VASPA and its subsidiary legislation and guidance to ensure that the VASP is ensuring full regulatory compliance with the VAS framework.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">____</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">Learn more:</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fatf-preparing-regulation-for-p2p-crypto-trading-platforms-8319.htm">FATF Preparing Regulation for P2P Crypto Trading Platforms</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-the-new-fatf-rules-will-open-up-crypto-to-a-layer-of-mid-4546.htm">How the New FATF Rules Will Open up Crypto to a Layer of Middlemen</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-regulation-is-key-to-crypto-industry.htm">Why Regulation Is Key to Crypto Industry</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-supreme-court-takes-landmark-crypto-case-with-coinbase-lawsuits-today-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">US Supreme Court Takes on Landmark Crypto Case with Coinbase Lawsuits Today &ndash;&nbsp;Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know</a>&nbsp;<br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/exclusive-interview-tether-co-founder-says-crypto-industry-will-bounce-back-despite-past-failures-heres-why.htm">Exclusive Interview: Tether Co-Founder Says Crypto Industry Will Bounce Back Despite Past Failures &#8211; Here&rsquo;s Why</a>&nbsp;<br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/is-it-safe-to-use-bitcoin.htm">Is It Safe To Use Bitcoin?</a></p>

<p><i>Roger Manuel Benites is a development director at <strong>The Blockchain Center</strong>, a 503(c) non-profit organization specializing in the education and adoption of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital asset technologies.</i><br />__________</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I returned to Lima (Peru) in the year 2013 when I was introduced to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> by my brother Roger Gabriel Benites<strong>.</strong> It was while living in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/argentina/">Argentina</a> that Roger Gabriel was first exposed to a digital currency known as Bitcoin and the inflated premium dollar, “dollar blue”. The Bitcoin currency network, backed by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/blockchain/">blockchain</a> technology, empowers the unbanked and the banked alike by freeing them from central banking and unstable national currencies. In 2013, Bitcoin had grown in prominence as Argentina struggled with hyperinflation brought about by financial policies and complex government politics. It was clear to my brother and me that Bitcoin had the potential to alleviate many of the monetary issues holding back developing economies around <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/latin-america/">Latin America</a> and the globe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Experience proved to me that economic development was only possible when people could trust their monetary system and the rule of law. It was clear that Bitcoin as a currency and monetary network, which was beyond the reach of challenging politics, could accelerate developing economies. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">No other group stood to benefit more from access to the Bitcoin global monetary system than the unbanked, who make up a significant percentage of people in Latin America. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">The only question was how best to implement a technology that in 2013 was still so new and experimental.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The primary goal of this technology was to reduce the costs and burdens imposed by legacy systems that control and oversee the remittance payments of the world&#8217;s underdeveloped economies. Bitcoin technology had the potential to move money seamlessly, increasing economic growth in every country that would adopt it and build on top of it. By having the technological prowess to replace the current outdated legacy financial network known as <strong>SWIFT</strong>, our nations would save the people of Latin America millions every year by enabling stable remittance <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/payments/">payments</a> and real-time currency exchanges. Remittance companies in Latin America that were subject to hyperinflated currencies, outdated political systems, and high costs were ripe for disruption.</p>
<h2>US blockchain Research and Development &#8211; The North and South of the Americas</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p style="text-align: justify">I returned to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/usa/">US</a>, New York and Connecticut, to continue my research in blockchain technology in 2016 and was able to be part of various blockchain <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/smart-contract/">smart contract</a> pilot projects specializing in decentralized finance, real estate, medical, and government applications. My team and I were able to research and develop various blockchain use cases and practical applications for real-world problems. Much of this research was published as part of a Blockchain education book, titled “Blockchain for Accounting and Business”, written by Saurav Dutta and distributed globally to academic and financial institutions. In 2018, the opportunity arose in Miami to create a Bitcoin center which later evolved into <strong>The Blockchain Center</strong>. The Blockchain Center is a non-profit organization developed to facilitate the mainstream <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/adoption/">adoption</a> of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology through political, financial, and media impact projects at national and international levels. The Bitcoin center was founded in 2014 by Bitcoin pioneer Nick Spanos under the name “The Bitcoin Center”, and was featured in the <strong>Netflix</strong> documentary “Banking on Bitcoin”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">“The Blockchain Center Miami was created in order to form an economic and innovation hub in downtown Miami, attracting blockchain and tech companies from New York, San Francisco, and worldwide. We’ve had great support from the local city office since the beginning  and to this day they have been a strong  advocate of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.” &#8211; Nick Spanos</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The initial goal was for the city of  Miami to become the “Silicon Valley of Latin America” to increase economic growth, talent development, and innovation.  As the city continues to push cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies in its agenda, Miami is poised to become the most disruptive city when it comes to decentralized government blockchain applications such as voting and public asset management via smart contracts. Miami is the center for Latin America’s imports &amp; exports, cellular/satellite communications, and, most importantly, Latin American financial institutions that hold a majority of the continent&#8217;s wealth. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">This positions Miami as the perfect neutral zone for all the countries in Latin America and the starting point for a Latin American union.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">From experiencing firsthand the growth of blockchain technology supporters, it became clear that Latin Americans believe in a union that would turn our developing countries into flourishing ones. This can be done by uniting and leapfrogging over inefficient systems of government and money.</p>
<h2>A more united Latin America</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p style="text-align: justify">To better understand the current situation of Latin American continental progress, there are currently three organizations that have been developed to create a more united Latin America, the <strong>Alianza del Pacifico</strong>, <strong>Mercado Comun del Sur</strong> (Mercosur), and <strong>Mercados Integrados Latino Americanos </strong>(MILA). These organizations were designed to converge Latam countries to provide economic prosperity by enacting financial and monetary policies but are divided due to foreign interests related to the US, China, and Russia. The west of Latam is supported by Alianza del Pacifico, while the east is supported by Mercosur. MILA is an organization created to integrate the financial markets of Latin American countries. Currently, there are four countries signed up: Peru, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico. The integration aims to strengthen capital markets to increase investor confidence in the supply of securities, and issuers, and increase larger sources of funding. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first milestone of the initiative is implementing a new organization where all Latin American countries accept and promote economic growth and innovation using decentralized financial infrastructures and blockchain technologies, as well as strong public and private partnerships for the overall goal of a strong united Latin America.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/102855/253495/pic-1.jpg" alt="" width="451" /></figure>
<h2>In order to build the future, we must understand the past</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the 1920s, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/germany/">German</a> government, under the Weimar Republic, was experiencing hyperinflation following World War I. The country desperately needed to rebuild its economy but lacked the necessary gold reserves. To overcome this challenge the Weimar Republic developed a new type of currency known as the “Rentenmark”, which was redeemable for bonds of land and industrial plants in order to stabilize the currency and bring back the confidence of foreign investors. The Weimar Republic also introduced new fiscal measures to insure the Rentenmarks stability. Credit was not offered to the German industry to prevent widespread speculation through leverage and subsequent inflation. With the currency in short supply, banknotes that were issued returned to acceptable levels, and confidence was returned to the German economy temporarily. This initiative was successful for a number of reasons but primarily due to the support of American bankers known as the <strong>Dawes Committee</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Dawes Committee created a novel solution for managing the funds raised from the sale of the Rentenmark. The process began with the German government raising money for war reparations and then transferring said funds into a special escrow account in the <strong>Reichsbank</strong> which would be managed and overseen by an American Agent-General. This new office would then decide how the funds should be put to use, either to pay back debt, buy German goods, or provide credit to local businesses. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">This ingenious mechanism ensured these assets were properly distributed and invested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">Another case study of how a nation or state can leverage its natural resource wealth can be seen in the <strong>Alaska Permanent Fund</strong>. The Alaska Permanent Fund was established by the State of Alaska through a constitutional amendment in 1976 before the trans-Alaska pipeline began production. The goal of the fund was to monetize a portion of the state&#8217;s oil revenues for the needs of future generations of Alaskans. A few years later after induction, the Alaskan government formed the <strong>Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation</strong> (APFC) to manage investments of the Permanent Fund outside of the State Treasury. The investments were then guided by a six-member board of trustees appointed by the Governor. The Fund uses oil royalties to make investments in bonds, stocks, real estate, infrastructure, and private entities. Every year payouts of the fund are made to Alaskan residents which are used for college savings, retirement accounts, charities, and basic living expenses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">APFC successfully injected millions into the economy (billions by 2023) in the early years of the fund&#8217;s creation and this past year alone injected 2.1 billion into the economy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">Studies have shown that it has reduced the state’s poverty rate since its approval by the Alaska Constitution. According to the Institute of Social and Economic Research from 2011-2015, the fund reduced the poverty rate in Alaska from 11.4% to 9.1%. The Permanent Fund has been able to generate continuous revenue for the State of Alaska and future generations of its people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">A similar mechanism could be applied to developing economies with vast untapped natural resources.</p>

<h2>Ingenious mechanism, escrow accounts, and multi-party agreements?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p style="text-align: justify">These are known financial banking terms that have been used and implemented for ages, which asks the question: could blockchain and tokenization help increase transparency and efficiency and unlock the potential of illiquid assets? </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We will begin by explaining what a blockchain smart contract is, and according to IBM, “Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met”. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">To simplify this, smart contracts can help transactions between various parties be more transparent, efficient, and most of all fair, since every decision is governed and verified by computer code and all parties need to agree in order to move to the next event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are several steps in the supply chain of natural resources such as the mining of gold or the farming of soybeans. Many parties are involved in this process and being able to verify certain amounts of the supply are valid are key factors that blockchain smart contracts could help validate, as well as provide a more precise real-time total value locked of assets in a digital or physical vault or better yet, phygital vaults. For example, the Dawes Committee could have used smart contracts when dealing with the various parties involved for instant settlement transactions and verification of assets if the technology was available at the time. The parties in the smart contract would consist of the German government, the Dawes committee, and the buyers of the Rentenmark. The Alaska Permanent fund could use Blockchain smart contracts to verify the supply chain of the oil reserves from the Alaska pipeline, or even tokenize each barrel of oil based on an individual oil field such as the Sourdough or Prudhoe streams for inventory and logistics management.</p>

<h2>Latam Initiative: Bitcoin and DeFi: a bright future for underdeveloped economies</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Bitcoin blockchain&#8217;s decentralized and secure nature, as well as its wide acceptance by financial institutions and large trading volume, make it an ideal foundation for a new solution that aims to improve the economic and government systems in Latin America. By applying Bitcoin&#8217;s network metrics to monitor a country&#8217;s natural resources production rate and validate asset reserves, transparency and trust can be established in the network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The proposed <strong>Nuevo Sol</strong> network aims to build a network of trusted resource providers, including private corporations and public organizations, that must meet a delivery quota to maintain reliability and strength. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">By implementing a decentralized financial network governed by smart contracts, the Nuevo Sol network can promote price stability, increase liquidity, and drive economic growth for all citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">This new mechanism will allow developing Latin American nations with untapped potential to properly value each country’s natural resources by means of tokenization. It will be able to provide the people with a stable means of exchanging value and provide economic equality to all its citizens by providing access to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">decentralized</a> financial technologies for the unbanked.</p>

Some might argue that the glass is half empty. However, through countless studies, researchers are proving that the glass is in fact half full. <strong>Deloitte</strong>&rsquo;s recent study <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/grid/cross-border-payments.pdf">points out</a> that payment transactions through blockchain technology are not only 40% to 80% cheaper than traditional processes but are also &lsquo;<i>astronomically quicker than conventional cross-border transfers due to being near-instantaneous</i>&rsquo;.</p><p>Similar to telephones, which evolved from PSTN lines to copper lines to 4G and now 5G, the world of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/payments/">payments</a> is undergoing a transformation as it adapts to using blockchain technology to meet the scalability and borderless demands of a fast-growing global economy.</p><h2>Blockchains &amp; global payments: yesterday, today, and tomorrow&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>For too long, the payments space has dealt with challenges of high cost, lack of transparency, limited speed, and accessibility. Traditionally, the payments system works with trusted sources (a.k.a. middlemen) and third parties who act as critical facilitators in transaction processes. These facilitators make transactions more expensive as each vendor/middleman takes small cuts/fees.</p><p>Furthermore, traditional payment systems are much more time-consuming and inconvenient. In addition to international payments taking days to complete, the obstacle of working hours in various timezones, and the need for oversight and transactors 24/7, regardless of weekends and holidays, they are way more prone to holdbacks and fraud due to a lack of transparency.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Think back to 2018, when nearly <a href="https://www.elasticpath.com/blog/crypto-commerce-banking-on-blockchain-for-b2b-payments">78% of businesses</a> reported a case of fraud in B2B payments.</p></blockquote><p>Today, blockchain technology offers lower costs, faster transaction speeds, increased security, and complete transparency to all users within the financial sector. Merchants and retailers who once depended on middlemen to transfer money from Point A to Point B now see accountability, transparency, and greater improvements in terms of speed and costs.</p><p>As digital payments are proving to work exceptionally well within developed countries&rsquo; markets, by extension, the movement is now opening doors to faster cross-border payments and global transfers. Currently, cross-border payments are haphazardly patched together. However, with the adoption of digital payment systems, we will witness a world-changing, seamless process born, changing the way we interact with value across borders forever.</p><h2>Transforming global commerce</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A recent report from <strong>Insider Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/despite-growth-crypto-payment-adoption-remains-low">stated</a> that by 2023, 5.5 million US adults, or 2.3% of US Internet users, would use digital currencies and cryptocurrencies to make payments.</p><p>With key players such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/visa/"><strong>Visa</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/mastercard/"><strong>MasterCard</strong></a>, <strong>Strike</strong>, <strong>Stash</strong>, and many more aggressively entering the digital payments space, one can only imagine the impact of blockchain technology on the financial industry. Enablers like digital currencies, tokenization of currencies, issuance of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/stablecoin/">stablecoins</a>, on-chain transactions, and more are all key players in this mass adoption of digital payments and currencies.</p><blockquote><p>Multinational or financial companies are just some of the ones who crave a piece of this pie.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Every prominent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/banking/">bank</a> in the world is currently pondering digital payments or experimenting with the goal of remaining competitive, innovative, and relevant. 100% of the world&rsquo;s banks are awaiting clarity, and 90% of them are awaiting regulatory clearance. While the smaller, less prominent banks are held back either due to their risk appetite or unclear regulations, they are slowly making their way into the new world of digital payments.&nbsp;</p><p>However, these inhibitors are soon to become obsolete as stablecoin regulators are aggressively pushing the regulatory movement forward and opening doors worldwide.</p><h2>When it comes to digital asset payments, the glass is half full</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>No matter where you stand on this debatable crossroad of blockchain technology and its impact on the global payments system, it is inevitable to conclude that digital currency technology is here to stay. With every bank and company already thinking of or racing towards digital currencies, it is only a matter of who crosses the finish line first.</p><p>With that being said, increased participation from developed and developing countries stands to produce substantial benefits through blockchain technology&rsquo;s global impact. Within the next five years, the world will witness both a proliferation of consumer enablers and many of the world&rsquo;s most renowned banks diving head-first into what will soon prove to be the future of finance.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/world-economic-forum-says-crypto-blockchain-technologies-will-continue-an-integral-part-of-modern-economy.htm">World Economic Forum Says Crypto and Blockchain Technologies Will Continue to be an &#8220;Integral&#8221; Part of Modern Economy</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-tim-draper-says-el-salvador-will-become-one-of-richest-countries-earth-for-one-reason.htm">Billionaire Tim Draper Says El Salvador Will Become One of the Richest Countries on Earth For This One Reason</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-sberbanks-blockchain-platform-to-be-ethereum-compatible-internet-computers-mainnet-integrates-with-bitcoin-exclusive-automotive-group-accepts-crypto.htm">Sberbank&#8217;s Blockchain Platform to be Ethereum-Compatible</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-australia-sues-block-earner-hacker-steals-42m-from-fenbushi-founding-partner-dbs-completes-repurchase-transaction-on-a-blockchain-based-network.htm">DBS Completes Repurchase Transaction on a Blockchain-based Network</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-paypal-to-expand-its-crypto-service-to-luxembourg-bybit-integrates-apex-pro-dex-nomad-preparing-relaunch.htm">PayPal to Expand its Crypto Service to Luxembourg</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/looking-at-defis-untapped-potential.htm">Looking at DeFi&#8217;s Untapped Potential</a></p>
