										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the buzz around Bitcoin spot ETFs, all eyes are on a possible <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> ETF.</p>
<p>The SEC has already <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-delays-grayscales-spot-eth-etf-application.htm">delayed decisions</a> on applications from Grayscale and BlackRock. Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fidelity-follows-blackrock-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-where-next-for-ether-eth.htm">Fidelity&#8217;s proposal</a>, submitted in November, faces a crucial March deadline.</p>
<p>But, what are the chances of these products being approved soon? And does the approval of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> spot ETFs set a precedent for their potential approval?</p>
<h2>Spot Ether ETFs Could Face Challenges Similar to Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Gaining approval for Bitcoin ETFs was a lengthy and legally complex process. Brian Evans, CEO of BDE Ventures, suspects something similar will happen when it comes to the proposed Ether ETFs.</p>
<p>“There will be long, possibly drawn-out discussions over such issues as cash or in-kind redemptions as well as surveillance-sharing agreements,” he told Cryptonews.</p>
<p>“These were some of the issues with the BTC ETFs that had to be sorted out, and I suspect that something similar will play out with Ethereum.” He believes it&#8217;s highly likely that they will eventually receive approval.</p>
<h2>Impact of Ethereum&#8217;s Classification on ETF Approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ethereum currently exists in a regulatory ambiguity. But Rostin Behnam, Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), <a href="https://events.law.rutgers.edu/event/1866">previously said</a> it should be regulated as a commodity.</p>
<p>Clear definitions for decentralization from regulators like the CFTC will play a crucial role in the potential approval of a spot ETH ETF.</p>
<p>“End users of the ETF need clarity on who controls Ethereum if it really is a commodity. Ideally is ‘nobody’ like BTC,” said Pontem co-founder Alejo Pinto.</p>
<p>“The question I would ask if it’s a security: who controls it? Who is responsible for reporting requirements of ETH? I doubt Vitalik would do it,” he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if ether is categorized as a security, this could significantly complicate matters.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160560" style="width: 889px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-160560" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-300x136.png" alt="Spot Ether ETF" width="889" height="403" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-300x136.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-1024x465.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-768x348.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-1536x697.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm-150x68.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868252-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-3-33-45-pm.png 1556w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160560" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: CCData</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ethereum enables users to use their Ether (ETH) tokens as collateral to support the network and engage in transaction validation. Under its proof-of-stake system, validators lock tokens to secure the blockchain and earn interest-like returns.</p>
<p>Consequently, certain regulators perceive this model as resembling an investment contract. This, by definition, could subject the asset to US securities laws.</p>
<h2>What if ETH is a Security?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously suggested that cryptocurrencies offering token staking <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-sec-chair-gary-gensler-refuses-say-if-eth-security-bullish-for-ethereum.htm">might be considered securities</a>.</p>
<p>Helika CEO Anton Umnov noted that such a classification would lead to greater SEC oversight and a focus on crypto market maturity.</p>
<p>Cryptosmart CEO Alessandro Frizzoni agreed, saying the possibility of Ethereum being labeled a security poses a hurdle to the ETF&#8217;s approval.</p>
<p>“It threatens the survival of the Ethereum project itself and could therefore put the Ethereum ecosystem under great uncertainty. I think Ethereum is decentralized enough to not be classified as a security and therefore the Spot Ethereum ETF will ultimately be approved,” Frizzoni said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Ethereum is categorized as a security, it would restrict the involvement of infrastructure partners and custodians in overseeing the ETF.</p>
<h2>Custody Challenges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Conversely, if Ether is not classified as a security, it could potentially follow a less strict regulatory route. It would still be required to address significant concerns related to investor protection and the integrity of the market, according to Web3 security firm HashEx CEO Dmitry Mishunin.</p>
<p>Mishunin pointed out that the market shouldn&#8217;t anticipate a substantial price spike after the approval of such an ETF.</p>
<p>“The market has a way of pricing in such developments well before they officially occur, meaning that by the time of approval, the event&#8217;s potential impact on Ethereum&#8217;s price might already be reflected in its current valuation,” he said.</p>
<p>Industry insiders also say the ETF issuers need to accurately track Ethereum&#8217;s price and securely handle custody of the underlying assets. BlackRock getting in on it makes an approval seem more likely, but regulators will still need more clarity.</p>
<h2>Spot Ether ETF Approval Timeline</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Deutsche Bank expects the first such ETF <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-expected-may-23rd-and-could-surge-in-value-new-report-says.htm">to be approved by May 23</a>. Meanwhile, TD Cowen <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-timeline-predictions-td-cowen.htm">expects approval to drag on</a> to 2025 or 2026.</p>
<p>Other crypto executives have mixed opinions, indicating that the outcome primarily hinges on political variables.</p>
<p>COZ CEO Tyler Adams is skeptical it will happen this year, pointing to regulators’ cautious approach when dealing with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>“I think that Ethereum is a pretty large, fundamental leap from Bitcoin due to its underlying model. Ethereum has an infinite supply and its technological volatility renders the discussion increasingly complex – the same does not exist for Bitcoin,” he said.</p>
<p>LayerTwo Labs co-founder Austin Alexander believes that approval may come to fruition in the next year or two.</p>
<p>“Even with a change at the SEC, perhaps with a Trump presidential victory, it’s still unclear to me that new leadership would speed things up in this regard,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Phillip Shoemaker, executive director of decentralized identity firm Identity.com is double the spot ETH ETF will ever materialize.</p>
<p>“Look how long it took the BTC ETFs to get approved, after all. If anything, I suspect that the SEC might soon go after the Ethereum blockchain and associated tokens,” he said.</p>
<p>“All this said, I do hope it happens. It would help further mainstream the space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-news/">Blockchain</a> and artificial intelligence (AI) together have the potential to boost each other, making the two fiels more exciting and diverse.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://tensquared.com/research/research-24-02/10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf">new report</a> from TenSquared Capital highlights the ways AI can enhance speed and efficiency in the Web3 arena.</p>
<p>Essentially, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-companies-leverage-ai-despite-ongoing-challenges.htm">AI joining forces with Web3</a> has the potential to tackle tough global issues. It can also automate essential tasks, boost data-driven choices, and amp up trust and transparency for users.</p>
<p>The growth equity firm’s research team explored specific areas where AI can be applied to make Web3 more structured.</p>
<h2>AI’s Power in Cross-Language Coding</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AI, particularly tools like ChatGPT and Github Co-Pilot, can significantly influence the crypto industry by simplifying code writing.</p>
<p>These AI tools empower developers to work on various blockchains, even if they are not well-versed in a specific programming language.</p>
<p>For instance, if a developer is proficient in Solidity but needs to code in Rust for Cosmos, they can rely on ChatGPT/Co-Pilot to assist in the translation process, TenSquared’s report said.</p>
<p>“AI code-writing tools lower the barrier to entry in blockchain and allow developers to write much more quickly,” they stated.</p>
<p>AI not only speeds up code writing — it can also enhance blockchain infrastructure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160489" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160489" style="width: 688px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-160489" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm-300x216.png" alt="AI Web3" width="688" height="495" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm-300x216.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm-768x554.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm-150x108.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160489" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TenSquared Capital</figcaption></figure>
<p>The tech can create smart contracts and consensus protocols that make real-time decisions using on-chain data. Furthermore, it can improve Web3 security through AI-based detection systems, ensuring more accurate and efficient smart contract decisions.</p>
<p>A few startups have already embraced this. For example, Oraichain employs AI-powered APIs to establish the groundwork for intelligent smart contracts and advanced decentralized applications (DApps).</p>
<p>Additionally, DApps can use on-chain AI for data analysis and automation.</p>
<p>Experts predict AI agents will use crypto for most payments, as large language models (LLMs) can handle transactions via crypto wallets and interact with smart contracts and DeFi protocols effectively.</p>
<h2>Boosting Web3 Security</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Researchers and startups are already diving into AI-based consensus methods, which are key for keeping blockchains safe and scalable.</p>
<p>Take Velas, for example, which is developing an AI Delegated Proof-of-Stake system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Inery is working on a way to validate blocks more efficiently based on uptime.</p>
<p>AI also plays a role in beefing up Web3 security, helping to fend off cyberattacks and shore up blockchain defenses. It&#8217;s a big deal because security is a major roadblock for users getting into crypto.</p>
<p>Just in January, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-lost-127m-to-hackers-in-january-2024-more-crypto-news.htm">Web3 took a $127m hit</a> from hackers across 19 different incidents. And last year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-korea-hackers-illicit-gains-dwindled-in-2023-despite-more-attacks-chainalysis.htm">cyber fraud groups made off with over $1b</a> from the crypto industry, according to Chainalysis.</p>
<h2>AI in Credit Scoring</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AI can reshape decentralized finance (DeFi) by using historical lending data to create credit scores and improve loan decisions. For instance, Spectral&#8217;s MACRO Score is an on-chain credit score powered by advanced machine learning for DeFi lending.</p>
<p>Through trading bots and predictive analytics, AI can enable traders to enhance their decision-making and profit from market trends. Platforms like 3Commas offer crypto trading bots for automated strategies.</p>
<h2>Interactive Gaming</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Generative AI can personalize gaming stories and characters. For example, Inworld AI creates AI NPCs, making games like WebKinz more immersive. ASM, part of Futureverse, develops a platform for user interaction with AI Agents in gaming worlds.</p>
<p>AI can also enhance NFT platforms and Web3 social networks by delivering personalized content and relevant product recommendations to users.</p>
<p>However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently warned that the toughest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-discusses-challenges-between-crypto-and-ai-warns-tread-carefully.htm">challenge in crypto and AI integration</a> is creating a single, decentralized AI trusted by other applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of open-source technology provider <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/komodo/"><strong>Komodo Platform</strong></a>, talked to <em>Cryptonews</em> about the current crypto investment sentiment, incoming &#8220;major&#8221; institutional investments, and the renewed rise of decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unstoppable-and-push-protocol-launch-token-gated-chat-more-crypto-news.htm">DeFi</a>).</p>
<p>The expert further shared interesting insights into major themes that will define 2024, non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-25-january.htm">NFT</a>) use cases leading to increased interest, the US SEC Chair&#8217;s disinterest in the crypto industry&#8217;s opinion, and more.</p>
<p>Read on to learn what he told us.</p>
<h2>Investors are Enthusiastic, But Cautious</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency space is not easy to predict as it&#8217;s ever-changing. That said, Stadelmann shared that for most retail investors, enthusiasm is driven by the potential of crypto. At the same time, caution persists due to market volatility and regulatory uncertainties.</p>
<p>When it comes to institutional investors, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has created a wave of optimism and signals growing confidence that crypto will only gain more momentum over the next few years.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Stadelmann noted that the crypto market’s short-term trends remain tied to macroeconomic factors. These significantly influence investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Speaking of hard-to-predict areas: crypto market&#8217;s price trends and news events. However, Stadelmann said there are some possible themes to consider.</p>
<p>As said, the US <strong>Securities and Exchanges Commission</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-blames-social-media-account-hack-on-sim-swap-attack-in-fake-bitcoin-etf-post.htm">SEC</a>) finally approved the first round of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/castle-fund-just-because-bitcoin-etfs-are-allowed-doesnt-mean-theyll-succeed.htm">ETFs</a>) in January. Per the CTO,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Although the initial hype around this news has since faded, major investments from institutions are only beginning.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, throughout February and the rest of 2024, we’ll see more of these large players from TradFi start to enter the crypto space.</p>
<figure id="attachment_156731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156731" style="width: 2401px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-156731" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes.png" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes.png 2401w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-300x157.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-1024x537.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-768x403.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-1536x806.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption-text">The daily volume (in USD) for spot bitcoin ETFs. Source: theblock.co</figcaption></figure>
<p>Therefore, we&#8217;ll soon see to what extent institutional investors and ETFs factor into the market’s price movement.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note the anticipation building around the next <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">Bitcoin halving</a>, expected in April.</p>
<p>Halvings typically signal the start of a new bull market cycle for BTC – but also for altcoins. It will be interesting to see, Stadelmann said, if BTC and/or altcoins can reach new all-time highs post-halving.</p>
<h2>DeFi Market Poised to Grow Again</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Things have significantly changed for DeFi between 2022 and 2024. And the shift goes beyond crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/expect-massive-inflows-to-follow-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-but-bull-market-is-still-in-question-experts-say.htm">market</a> prices.</p>
<p>The bear market of 2022 brought numerous challenges to many DeFi projects, Stadelmann said. This includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-atm-vulnerability-fixed-hackers-could-have-gained-full-control.htm">vulnerabilities</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-setback-smart-contract-exploit-results-over-200-ethscriptions-being-nabbed.htm">smart contract exploits</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/regulatory-uncertainty-makes-poloniex-deeply-frustrated-3887.htm">regulatory uncertainties</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>And these remain major concerns in 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also during 2022, DeFi&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) went from more than $150 billion to less than $40 billion. However, as of January 2024, TVL has rebounded to $55 billion at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The CTO opined,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The space appears poised to grow once again.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another noteworthy shift since 2022 has been the maturation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-dominates-with-nearly-50-of-ethereum-layer-2-total-value-locked.htm">Layer 2</a> (L2) blockchain networks, which has increased scalability and reduced transaction costs. DeFi applications on these networks are now usable from a cost perspective, said the expert.</p>
<p>Also, cross-chain interoperability developments have contributed to a more united DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Major Themes for 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We’ve already noted the potential future movements in crypto prices, investment sentiment, and DeFi markets.</p>
<p>But 2024 has much more to offer. Stadelmann listed the year’s major themes. He said these will gain more importance even beyond 2024 as the crypto space matures.</p>
<p>First and foremost, he said, is the interoperability among different <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-association-addresses-sen-warrens-criticism-of-crypto-hires.htm">blockchain</a> networks.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the blockchain space diversifies, the need for users to trade across blockchains will only continue to increase.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the CTO’s opinion, more users will turn to peer-to-peer (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/p2p-crypto-platform-paxful-resumes-operations-led-by-delaware-lawyer-heres-latest.htm">P2P</a>) bridge solutions, like the one offered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/last-minute-crypto-gift-ideas-for-tech-natives-and-newcomers.htm"><strong>Komodo Wallet</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Next: L2s will continue to grow and witness accelerated adoption. More users are moving into the DeFi space and are using decentralized apps (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ledger-removes-bug-allowing-popular-decentralized-applications-to-be-compromised-heres-the-latest.htm">dapps</a>) more frequently. Hence, it is critical to alleviate Layer 1 congestion and reduce transaction costs by processing a significant portion of transactions off-chain.</p>
<p>Stadelmann said that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The ongoing development and adoption of L2 solutions signify a crucial step towards achieving mainstream scalability for blockchain technology.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Gary Gensler is Not Interested in Crypto Industry’s Opinion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The central theme for 2024, Stadelmann said, is the pursuit of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-senator-says-lack-of-regulatory-clarity-driving-crypto-outside-us.htm">regulatory clarity</a>. And greater certainty will, hopefully, create a catalyst for accelerated market growth.</p>
<p>Governments and regulatory bodies globally are increasingly engaging with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptocurrency-industry-spends-record-18-96-million-in-federal-lobbying-so-far-in-2023.htm">the crypto industry</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Stadelmann recently <a href="https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/01/08/open-letter-gary-gensler-decision-define-sec-legacy/">wrote an open lette</a>r to SEC Chair <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gary-gensler-warns-about-ais-impact-to-financial-systems-doesnt-touch-on-cryptocurrency.htm">Gary Gensler</a>. Asked if Gensler is interested in hearing the crypto industry’s opinions, Stadelmann replied that he doesn’t think so.</p>
<p>One positive move from Gensler’s administration was the approval of new ETFs. And yet,</p>
<blockquote><p>“After years of delays, the main factor for approval was likely political pressure from capital-rich institutions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, we have seen very little movement to protect investors or make crypto more accessible to investors, he said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SEC enforcement actions against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-faces-sec-pressure-for-financial-transparency-in-ongoing-legal-saga.htm"><strong>Ripple</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/judge-to-address-in-binance-case-are-cryptocurrencies-securities-under-u-s-law.htm"><strong>Binance</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-gives-coinbase-shot-at-full-dismissal-in-sec-case.htm"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm"><strong>Kraken</strong></a> have stunted the potential growth of the crypto industry. And while the agency has clear evidence against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-likens-binance-ftx-expresses-concern-over-crypto-industry.htm"><strong>FTX</strong></a> and “other industry players that have blatantly hurt investors,” argued Stadelmann, Gensler decided not to focus on these issues.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3&#x20e3;Fraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure retail investors into scams. These investments continue to be replete w/ fraud- bogus coin offerings, Ponzi &amp; pyramid schemes, &amp; outright theft where a project promoter disappears w/ investors’ money.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>NFT Use Cases Wil Result in More Interest</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finally, non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/magic-eden-rewards-top-nft-news-today-24-january.htm">NFTs</a>), despite discussions of their decline, are here to stay.</p>
<p>Stadelmann said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am optimistic about their future in 2024 and beyond. The NFT market has undergone a major shift in focus, expanding beyond digital art to include gaming, virtual real estate, and metaverse-related assets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Industries will continue to adopt NFT technology. Subsequently, use cases will diversify and lead to renewed interest.</p>
<p>“I predict we’ll see NFT become more integrated with real-world assets, which will provide unique experiences that go beyond simple digital ownership,” the CTO opined.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Why Don’t We Have DeFi Simplicity Yet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It’s been said for years that simplicity and ease of use are the answer to DeFi’s adoption issues. Stadelmann argues that achieving this goal has proven to be a difficult task.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle is the inherent complexity of DeFi processes involving <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/liquidity-pool-comprising-paypals-pyusd-stablecoin-on-curve-locks-135-million-in-value.htm">liquidity pools</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-yield-farming.htm#:~:text=Yield%20farming%2C%20to%20put%20it,they%20come%20with%20high%20risk.">yield farming</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Balancing user-friendly interfaces with the intricacies of blockchain technology presents a non-stop challenge.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some potential solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhance user education through comprehensive tutorials; e.g. users taking the time to learn about the fundamentals of blockchain technology and how to use specific DeFi platforms;</li>
<li>simplify the DeFi onboarding process for crypto newcomers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Komodo Wallet, for example, recently added a <a href="https://app.komodoplatform.com/#/fiat">fiat on-ramp</a>, lowering the barrier to DeFi market participation. Users can directly buy crypto with fiat instead of signing up for a centralized exchange account and learning how to transfer assets on-chain.</p>
<h2>Year of the Dragon Brings New Roadmap</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Stadelmann couldn’t share any specific Komodo’s plans for 2024, but said that it will focus on enhancing blockchain interoperability to unify the DeFi space.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We plan to release our 2024 roadmap on Chinese New Year, which falls on February 10, 2024, as it marks the beginning of the Year of the Dragon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, in December, the platform added the above-mentioned fiat on-ramp to Komodo Wallet (web) that supports providers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brazils-central-bank-pix-joins-ramp-networks-payment-solutions.htm"><strong>Ramp</strong></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-banxa-and-cardanos-yoroi-wallet-enable-in-app-fiat-on-off-ramping-bybit-reveals-personality-based-trading-nft-usdt-competition.htm"><strong>Banxa</strong></a>, which support bank transfers, <strong>Apple Pay</strong>, <strong>Visa</strong>/<strong>Mastercard</strong> cards, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former CIA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden on Tuesday called for financial aid to support Tornado Cash founder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tornado-cash-co-founder-expresses-concerns-about-upcoming-trial-on-money-laundering-charges.htm">Roman Storm’s legal defense</a>.</p>
<p>Storm and his co-founder Semenov were <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1702">arrested</a> in Aug. 2023 for alleged sanctions violations in the US through their crypto mixing service, accused of laundering over $1b.</p>
<p>“My legal team and I are going to put forth a strong defense at trial, not just for my family&#8217;s sake, but for the future of software developers and financial privacy,” Storm said in a video posted to X on Monday.</p>
<p>“Folks, I need your help. Whether you&#8217;re a passionate developer, involved with Web3, or just care about software and privacy, this legal battle will affect you. So, please help contribute to my legal defense, because this case will set a major precedent for years to come,” he added.</p>
<p>Storm, who holds both US and Russian citizenship, was <a href="https://twitter.com/brianeklein/status/1694779420731658700">released on bail</a> shortly after his detention on a $2 million bond secured against his Washington state residence.</p>
<p>Snowden has asked supporters to help, saying: ” Privacy is not a crime.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you can help, please help. Privacy is not a crime. <a href="https://t.co/R4vauNLRB4">https://t.co/R4vauNLRB4</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Tornado Cash saw an 85% drop in transactions following OFAC sanctions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Storm, together with Semenov and developer Alexey Pertsev, founded Tornado Cash in 2019.</p>
<p>The mixer, still operational as of now, offers users a way to hide their transaction history, effectively protecting their financial privacy from outside observation.</p>
<p>Tornado Cash accomplishes this by masking the trails of transactions, providing a shield against any form of surveillance and tracking.</p>
<p>In 2022, the US Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/the-chopping-block-did-ofac-overstep-by-sanctioning-tornado-cash-ep-386.htm">imposed sanctions</a> on Tornado Cash for alleged exploitation by North Korean hackers in money laundering activities.</p>
<p>These sanctions intended to forbid anyone in the US from engaging with the service, including sending or receiving funds through it.</p>
<p>The indictment claimed that Tornado Cash functioned as a money service business without registration, a requirement under FinCEN regulations.</p>
<p>Post OFAC sanctions, <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/tornado-cash-volume-dramatically-reduced-post-sanctions-but-illicit-actors-are-still-using-the-mixer">Tornado Cash saw an 85% drop in overall volume</a>, with illicit transactions through the mixer decreasing by about 77%, according to TRM Labs.</p>
<h2>Edward Snowden’s advocacy mirrored in Storm&#8217;s mission</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Snowden&#8217;s backing of Roman Storm makes sense, as they both appear to share views on privacy and encryption.</p>
<p>He became known for disclosing National Security Agency (NSA) materials to the media, resulting in major privacy rulings and changes in policies and technologies.</p>
<p>Critics argue that Tornado Cash provides a legitimate tool for users seeking financial privacy, useful for anonymous political donations, or shielding personal finances.</p>
<p>Groups like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coin-center-sues-janet-yellen-over-tornado-cash-sanctions.htm">Coin Center</a> and the Blockchain Association have backed the service&#8217;s developers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the first <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-frenzy-begins-as-sec-finally-approves-first-spot-bitcoin-funds-bitcoin-remains-unresponsive.htm">Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded funds receive historic approval</a> in the United States, Asian industry leaders, particularly in Hong Kong, are actively exploring similar crypto products.</p>
<p>BitGo’s APAC Director Abel Seow told Cryptonews that they are witnessing an increased interest in similar products post spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States. He said that they are seeing increased momentum in markets like Hong Kong, and “murmur of interest” in places like South Korea.</p>
<p>Over a dozen fund providers are currently in discussions with Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to formulate a strategy for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/10-fund-companies-preparing-to-launch-spot-crypto-etfs-in-hong-kong.htm">launching a local Bitcoin spot ETF</a>.</p>
<p>Abel further noted that the surge in crypto ETFs shows that a lot of these regulators around the world have been keeping an eye on what the US are doing and what they will be doing. If the US approves spot Ethereum ETF in May, that could be another monumental moment for everyone involved, he added.</p>
<p>BitGo was earlier selected as custodian for Hashdex’s spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.</p>
<p>Talking about Hong Kong, Abel noted that they have deep capital markets among the best recognized markets in the region and a very skilled institutional workforce that is plugged into the rest of the world. Launching an ETF or ETF derivatives would be playing to their strengths, he added.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, several asset managers have hinted at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-expected-to-approve-spot-crypto-etfs-by-mid-2024.htm">launching a spot Bitcoin ETF this year in Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<h2>BitGo Eyes Further Expansion into Asia</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BiGo recently acquired in-principle approval as a major payment institution. Abel emphasized on the importance of Asian markets for them going forward. He noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve secured our IPA with MAS in Singapore with full approval coming soon. In Korea, we’ve established a partnership with Hana Bank, known as the JP Morgan of Korea. These milestones contribute to BitGo&#8217;s global expansion goals, and we are prioritizing the APAC region with new hires”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bitgo.com/newsroom/press-releases/bitgo-secures-usd100m-series-c-funding-at-usd1-75b-valuation/">BitGo raised $100 million</a> in series C funding at a valuation of $1.75 billion valuation in August last year.</p>
<h2>Future of Structured Crypto Products</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Talking about the future of structured crypto products like spot Bitcoin ETF, Abel said that there could be a world where such products become the norm for private clients to access crypto. He noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I suspect that as momentum builds up in this space, and people get more comfortable, they will see Bitcoin as an asset class no similar to tech stocks. And whether you want to buy options on GameStop or options on Bitcoin, it can be one of the same thing.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an insightful interview with <em>Cryptonews</em>, Dan Hoover, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer at investment firm <a href="https://www.castlefunds.com/"><strong>Castle Funds</strong></a>, discussed several Bitcoin ETF-related <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pantera-capital-projects-bitcoin-price-resurgence-and-increased-defi-market-activity.htm">topics</a>.</p>
<p>These include how valuable Bitcoin ETF trading volume information really is, what it takes for ETFs to succeed, why TradFi market minutiae are “very foreign” to most crypto market participants, and much more.</p>
<p>This is what he had to say.</p>
<h2>When is Trading Volume a Valuable Information?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The spot Bitcoin ETFs&#8217; initial trading volumes suggest that the supporting players in any successful exchange-traded product (ETP) launch are not yet up and running in volume, Hoover told <em>Cryptonews</em>. (Note: ETFs are a subset of ETPs as a broader category.)</p>
<p>Therefore, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Trading volume is only powerful information if it results in creation of new ETP shares (assets in the Trust that the sponsor can charge a fee on).”</p></blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, it just shows that the same shares are changing hands repeatedly.</p>
<p>Typically, this means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>hedging costs are high because of the poor availability of substitutes for the index/asset being tracked that can be cheaply borrowed;</li>
<li>there aren’t enough Authorized Participants (APs) onboarded to create or redeem shares, so there’s less urgency to create or redeem shares at lower premiums or discounts; fewer APs mean that arbitrage opportunities may exist in the market longer as there are fewer parties and less capital available to take advantage;</li>
<li>the equity options market-makers aren’t able to transact in size yet, usually due to high borrowing costs or broker-level restrictions on options trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an investor in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/spot-bitcoin-etfs-would-reduce-power-of-whales-and-increase-stability-nansen-analyst.htm">bitcoin</a> markets, said Hoover, he would prefer that the BTC held in an ETP be purchased in the market and belong only to the fund or Trust, instead of being borrowed from another party that keeps a claim on the coins.</p>
<figure id="attachment_154745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154745" style="width: 2401px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-154745" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930262-etf-volumes.png" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930262-etf-volumes.png 2401w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930262-etf-volumes-300x157.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930262-etf-volumes-1024x537.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930262-etf-volumes-768x403.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930262-etf-volumes-1536x806.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930262-etf-volumes-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930262-etf-volumes-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-154745" class="wp-caption-text">The daily volume (in USD) for spot bitcoin ETFs.

<h2>Just Because Bitcoin ETFs are Allowed Doesn’t Mean They’ll Succeed</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Spot Bitcoin ETFs come with a set of benefits. These include fewer access challenges for investors and a competitor for the poorly-performing futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, Hoover argued.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, the launch issues “will ease a bit.&#8221; There will be an opportunity for the market participants &#8211; APs, broker-dealers, and options market-makers &#8211; to resell ETPs to individual investors, Hoover said.</p>
<p>Long-term, however, while ETPs are “a reasonable solution” to the regulatory ambiguity constraining access for most US investors,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I believe that the ETP technology (with its additional liquidity sources, price discovery functions, etc.) is a poor solution to digital-asset market access problems.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, it took nearly three decades for ETFs to become fully regulated in the USA, so Hoover finds it unlikely that “the current suite of products will lose their regulatory reasons to exist any time soon.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the COO explained that the Bitcoin markets are “understandably very concerned” about several large market participants trading BTC on a continuous market – while the supply and demand are constrained to a single specific point in time five days a week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shane Rodgers, the Chairman and Co-founder of the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/interview-with-shane-rodgers-navigating-future-of-crypto-markets-amidst-regulatory-hurdles-altcoin-saturation.htm">PDX</a></strong> platform, argued that there aren’t downsides to the Bitcoin ETFs. The only thing is that, in the short term, investors continue to be “overly exposed to the vagaries of unsophisticated small money in the spot retail space.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, said Rodgers,</p>
<blockquote><p>“[There are] tremendous benefits to the upside in terms of prices and valuations, as well as, especially, increasing mass acceptance and adoption of BTC, and of crypto assets generally.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Issuing is one thing, but whether an ETP, including the spot Bitcoin ETF, will <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-ceo-most-of-11-approved-bitcoin-etfs-wont-survive-more-crypto-news.htm">actually succeed</a> is another. Hoover noted that success depends on several key questions. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the sponsor (<strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>Franklin</strong>, <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Bitwise</strong>, <strong>Grayscale</strong>) have enough relationships with APs, market makers, and institutional investors to keep trading in the Bitcoin ETF orderly?</li>
<li>Are there substitutes for the Bitcoin ETF that could be cheaper, safer, or track the underlying more closely if market conditions change?</li>
<li>Does the sponsor have relationships with enough brokerage houses to complete due diligence and trade on the platforms (e.g., <strong>Merrill Lynch</strong>, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, <strong>Edward Jones</strong>)?</li>
<li>Does the sponsor have enough other products or its own capital available to market its brand and support advisors with marketing materials?</li>
</ul>
<p>Rodgers opined that the only real differentiating factor so far in the approved BTC spot ETFs are the fees.</p>
<p>Additionally, crypto is still a speculative and volatile asset class. “The fact you can participate via an ETF does not mitigate the safety or volatility of the underlying spot asset,” he said.</p>

<h2>TradFi Market Details Are Foreign to Crypto Market Participants</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hoover noted that it is essential to understand how demand for “exposure” to Bitcoin through an ETP actually impacts the “flows” or value of assets within that ETP.</p>
<figure id="attachment_154748" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154748" style="width: 2401px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-154748" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930351-spot-bitcoin-etf-flows.png" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930351-spot-bitcoin-etf-flows.png 2401w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930351-spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-300x157.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930351-spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-1024x537.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930351-spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-768x403.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930351-spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-1536x806.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930351-spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705930351-spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-154748" class="wp-caption-text">The daily volume (in USD) for spot bitcoin ETFs. Source: The Block</figcaption></figure>
<p>He explained that the ETPs have several layers of separation between “demand for Bitcoin by investors” and additional shares.</p>
<p>Importantly,</p>
<blockquote><p>“These market minutiae are very foreign to most participants in the digital asset markets, and the idea that there are so many layers between market demand for the ETP and demand for the underlying asset can be difficult to connect with the expectations of &#8216;massive flows&#8217;.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hoover gave an example of an investor who wants to purchase ETP shares. They place the order with their broker. Then, the order could be filled from any or several sources.</p>
<p>Here are four scenarios, and only one results in ETP seeing additional assets under management (AUM):</p>
<ul>
<li>The broker has shares in inventory or an order from another customer in the opposite direction, in which case the ETP sees no additional AUM as a result of the investment.</li>
<li>The broker doesn’t have the shares available, but they can borrow in the shares. This happens under the assumption that they will have an offsetting order in the next two business days, which is standard settlement for the shares. The ETP again sees no additional AUM.</li>
<li>The broker buys the shares in the market from another broker. The ETP sees no additional AUM.</li>
<li>If there is demand for the shares not satisfied by the existing order book (buyers and sellers) and still not satisfied when considering the cost of borrowing the ETP shares from long-term holders such as index or pension funds, an AP may approach the ETP to create a new “basket” (generally, around $1 million worth) of new ETP shares. In this case, the ETP finally gets to see (and charge fees on) the investor’s capital.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this said, there are reasons for hedgers not to choose the new Bitcoin ETF. “Orderly trading in ETP shares is dependent on cheap, accurate hedging,” the expert said. It is driven by the availability of good substitutes for the asset the ETP seeks to track.</p>
<p>However, given the costs of hedging in the futures market and the regulatory difficulties when it comes to broker-dealers owning spot BTC themselves, Hoover said he wouldn’t find it surprising if some hedgers choose the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-ceo-calls-for-simultaneous-approval-of-spot-products-to-level-the-field.htm"><strong>Grayscale</strong></a> product, shares of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-overcomes-bankruptcy-eyes-stock-market-return.htm">mining</a> companies, or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vanguard-holds-significant-stake-in-microstrategy-indirect-bitcoin-exposure.htm"><strong>MicroStrategy</strong></a> as better accessible BTC substitutes than the spot BTC.</p>
<h2>BTC Settles Every 15 Minutes, Bitcoin ETF Shares Only on Business Days</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hoover also commented on the initial selling pressure in spot BTC, saying “there are some reasonable explanations” there.</p>
<p>There was some “sell the news” pressure, but also what he described as the release of pent-up demand to close out the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscales-bitcoin-trust-gbtc-outpaces-majority-of-etfs-with-half-a-billion-in-trading-volume.htm">GBTC</a> arbitrage trade carried by certain participants for years.</p>
<p>The CEO mentioned that the broader pressure on the markets was likely related to the early stages of setting up efficient hedging operations to keep market-making profitable and the trading costs reasonable.</p>
<p>He again noted the differences between trading these product shares and trading digital assets 24/7.</p>
<p>First, he said, there is the above-discussed “long path” between market demand for ETP shares and flows measured by new ETP shares being issued.</p>
<p>Then, Hoover said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The SEC approved the first trades on Thursday before a three-day weekend in the US markets, which contributed to the delay.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A trade creating new ETP shares (“flow”) on Thursday would not need to be paid for with cash until next Tuesday. Therefore, there is no efficient hedging of any price action until Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Bitcoin settles with each block or approximately every 10-15 minutes. However, the Bitcoin ETF shares settle on T+2 New York business days. It does not include weekends and holidays.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This timing difference, compounded by the fact that the ETP needs to price at the 4:00 pm New York close of the equity markets, creates a potential for manipulative activity in the Bitcoin market similar to that seen in the foreign-exchange markets in the early 2010s, for which a cartel of 15 banks paid more than $2.3billion to settle ligitation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The APs who bought the new Trust shares on Thursday and Friday, said Hoover, had a responsibility to manage their exposure to the price of BTC while the equity markets and the banks do not work.</p>
<p>Hence, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-buys-over-13-days-of-bitcoin-production-a-sign-of-supply-shortage.htm"><strong>BlackRock</strong></a>, for example, was obligated to help its customers (the APs) meet that responsibility.</p>
<p>Per Hoover, agreeing to issue new shares of the iShares IBIT trust on Friday, lock in an amount of BTC due in exchange for those shares based on the Friday 4:00p price in New York, and then wait to buy in the BTC until the following Wednesday when the shares were issued and settled – would have been “very irresponsible.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>ETP Is an Institutional Product, It Can’t Be a Retail One</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Lastly, Hoover explained that the market for ETP shares is ultimately an institutional market. All ETPs are institutional products by definition.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-fidelitys-spot-ethereum-etf.htm">SEC</a>) requires companies to issue new shares of these products in expensive blocks. iShares IBIT, for example, is targeting a block size of $1 million, said Hoover.</p>
<p>BlackRock and the other Bitcoin ETF sponsors have consistently marketed their products to the “advisor” and “buy-side” markets.</p>
<p>This includes managers of model portfolios (e.g., <strong>Edelman Financial Engines</strong>), “robo-advisors” (such as <strong>Schwab’s Intelligent Portfolios</strong> product), and professional asset managers (hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, and the like).</p>
<blockquote><p>“If an individual investor can’t place an order for ETP shares directly with the fund or trust via a transfer agent, and be guaranteed that their shares will be purchased at net asset value of the fund or trust on that day, the product is not a retail product.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are regulatory restrictions, but also the margins on ETP fees “simply aren’t large enough to support the massive cost of mass-marketing to retail investors.”</p>
<p>The business relies on economies of scale, Hoover said. A few flagship products provide enough fees to support marketing the sponsor’s brand across all of the products on the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka has always been a country where cash is king and this remains the case despite the country planning to introduce its digital currency by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Once dubbed &ldquo;the pearl of the Indian Ocean&rdquo; &#8212; Sri Lanka is known for producing the finest tea, fresh coconuts, and spices. Not forgetting the exotic wildlife including the leopard, elephant, sloth bear, blue whale, and sperm whale.
</p>
<h4><strong>What You Need To Know About Bitcoin In Sri Lanka</strong></h4>
<p>
Sri Lanka <a href="https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/news/risks-of-using-and-investing-in-cryptocurrency-20230329#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20Directions%20No,payments%20related%20to%20cryptocurrency%20transactions.">remains anti-crypto</a>. Its stance on cryptocurrencies is that digital currency is not considered legal tender in the country. According to directions No. 03 of 2021 under Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017, Electronic Fund Transfer Cards (EFTCs) such as debit cards and credit cards are not to be used for payments related to cryptocurrency transactions.
</p>
<h4><strong>Would Bitcoin Solve Sri Lanka&#8217;s Economic Crisis </strong></h4>
<p>
Sri Lankan economic crisis first started in 2019 and in 2022, Sri Lanka&#8217;s economy struggled after fuel supplies ran dry. In terms of GDP, Sri Lanka is expected to reach $76.86 billion by the end of 2024, according to data from <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/sri-lanka/gdp#:~:text=GDP%20in%20Sri%20Lanka%20is,according%20to%20our%20econometric%20models.">Trading Economics,</a> and in the long-term, Sri Lanka&#8217;s GDP is projected to trend around $79.54 billion in 2025 and $82.33 billion in 2026, reports Trading Economics.&nbsp;In October 2023,<a href="https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/about/organisational-structure/principal-officers/nandalal-weerasinghe"> Nandalal Weerasinghe,</a> the Governor of the Central Bank in Sri Lanka, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-can-btc-eth-bounce-back-from-double-bottom-support-levels.htm">said he believes that</a> the adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies will worsen the nation&rsquo;s economic condition.</p>
<p>Last year, American millionaire Tim Draper travelled to Sri Lanka and proposed using Bitcoin as a legal tender to combat the corruption that caused the island nation&rsquo;s hyperinflation. &nbsp;But Sri Lanka wasn&#8217;t having any of this. During a TV shoot in Sri Lanka, Draper met with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Weerasinghe to suggest Bitcoin as a practical solution for solving financial issues. But Weerasinghe, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka &ndash; a major authority figure <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-prediction-can-btc-eth-bounce-back-from-double-bottom-support-levels.htm">made it clear that doing so</a> would aggravate the economic condition of the nation.
</p>
<h4><strong>Central Bank Warns of Crypto Scams&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>
The Central Bank has warned the public of the growing number of financial scams operating with the promise of high returns based on crypto-investments.&nbsp;&ldquo;These scams include deceiving individuals and obtaining money from them with the promise of providing a high return by investing money in cryptocurrency, as well as deceiving individuals to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency projects. Such scams circumvent traditional regulatory and legal protection mechanisms, resulting in individuals losing their hard-earned money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Central Bank made it clear that it has not issued any licence or authorized any individual or business to operate schemes involving cryptocurrency, or mining operations, cryptocurrency exchanges, deposit-taking or custody services related to cryptocurrency or any cryptocurrency investment advisory service.
</p>
<h4>Central Bank Plans to Launch Digital Currency</h4>
<p>
Sri Lanka&rsquo;s Central Bank announced plans to introduce a digital currency by the end of 2024 its official told a top committee in Parliament, as reported by the Colombo-based local media news site <a href="https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Central-Bank-to-introduce-digital-currency-by-the-end-of-this-year/108-274975">Daily Mirror LK.</a>&ldquo;The exercise of introducing &lsquo;Lanka Pay&rsquo; and &lsquo;Central Bank Digital Currencies&rsquo; has already begun. The two systems will be launched by the end of this year,&rdquo; Central Bank officials informed the Ways and Means Committee in Parliament, reports <a href="https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Central-Bank-to-introduce-digital-currency-by-the-end-of-this-year/108-274975">Daily Mirror LK</a>.</p>
<p>Central Bank officials were called before the committee to discuss issues pertaining to online payments in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Chairman of <a href="https://www.parliament.lk/en/component/committees/commitee/showCommittee?id=580">Ways and Means Committee</a> Patali Champika Ranawaka inquired about the regulation of online payment systems in Sri Lanka,&rdquo; Parliamentary Media Unit (PMU) said. In September 2023,&nbsp; Nandalal Weerasinghe, the Governor of the Central Bank <a href="//www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/about/Speech_20231103_keynote_speech_at_the_forum_in_KDU_e.pdf">acknowledged in a keynote</a> speech that interest in digital currencies has been gaining traction and within the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are also engaged in studies on the potential of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) which is the digital form of legal tender issued by the Central Bank. There is consensus across global central banks that CBDC will help enhance the efficiency and resilience of the payment system while also serving to increase financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Importantly, other potential benefits of CBDC include more effective monetary transmission and improved financial transparency,&rdquo; <a href="//www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/about/Speech_20231103_keynote_speech_at_the_forum_in_KDU_e.pdf">said</a> Weerasinghe. For now, Sri Lanka is showing signs of revival through growing tourism but cryptocurrency remains an unregulated investment instrument and is not recognized as an asset class.&nbsp;<br style="font-weight: 400"><br style="font-weight: 400"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talking with <em>Cryptonews</em>, three experts have shared their views on spot Bitcoin ETFs trading volumes.</p>
<p>They discussed the initial price drop post-approval, how the US Fed and presidential election could affect the market, BlackRock’s marketing approach, the benefits and downsides of the new product, and more.</p>
<p>For this article, we talked to Vijay Marolia, the Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of <strong>Regal Point Capital</strong> and a money manager with over 20 years of capital markets experience, Shane Rodgers, the Chairman and Co-founder of the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/interview-with-shane-rodgers-navigating-future-of-crypto-markets-amidst-regulatory-hurdles-altcoin-saturation.htm">PDX</a></strong> platform, and Dan Hoover, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer at investment firm <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/etfs-are-inevitable-but-not-imminent-crypto-expert-argues.htm">Castle Funds</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Read on to learn what they told us.</p>
<h2>Initial Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume Suggests That BTC Will Only Get Bigger</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Talking about the approved <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-all-the-essentials-facts-winners-losers-tickers-and-fees.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> trading volumes, Vijay Marolia opined that “Bitcoin isn’t going away anytime soon.”</p>
<p>Shane Rodgers argued that volumes indicate the size and scope of the new ETF market. They suggest that BTC adoption and investment will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ll see that reflected in direct BTC prices and trading volumes,” said Rodgers.</p>
<p>He added that the market is correct to anticipate massive inflows.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This will drive BTC prices and crypto valuations overall well into the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The market saw an initial price decrease following the new Bitcoin ETF approval.</p>
<p>Per Marolia,</p>
<blockquote><p>“This as the first act of a strategic shift in institutional investors exposure—this is not necessarily a vote on a bull or bear market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rodgers argued that the drop doesn&#8217;t tell us much at all &#8211; only that BTC is behaving like a normal financial asset more and more. These moves are quite normal in traditional financial assets, he said.</p>
<p>He added that “it should also always be remembered that retail investors are &#8216;sheep&#8217;. Most recent Bitcoin selling has been profit taking, overtaken by unfounded worry from the retail crowd.”</p>
<p>Most Bitcoin trading happened on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tusd-says-recent-depegging-is-related-to-binance-launchpool-activities.htm"><strong>Binance</strong></a> and some of the bigger Asian exchanges. But the selling was “unsophisticated,” Rodgers opined, “and in our view created a nice buying opportunity.”</p>
<p>Rodgers also commented on some recently expressed BTC supply shortage concerns. When asked if these are valid, he replied “Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a digital asset divisible by 18 decimal points, making the maximum supply of 21 million BTC irrelevant, he said. Therefore, there will never be a shortage of BTC.</p>
<h2>Donald Trump’s US Presidential Win Would Delay Strong Bull Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As time goes by, things are bound to change. The question is in which direction.</p>
<p>Rodgers commented that the near-term and long-term impact of the new Bitcoin ETFs on the market is positive. And not just for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/spot-bitcoin-etfs-would-reduce-power-of-whales-and-increase-stability-nansen-analyst.htm">BTC</a>, he added, but the entire crypto space.</p>
<p>Per Marolia, we are likely to see “slightly less volatility” in the coming months while average volumes start to increase. This follows the mentioned initial decrease. The expert argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is a healthy way of building a “base” of strong (read: long-term) investors.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Marolia brought up a couple of key factors that will significantly impact the market in the coming years: the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/benjamin-cowen-bearish-on-fed-rate-cuts-how-will-bitcoin-price-react-to-the-feds-policy-shift.htm"><strong>US Federal Reserve</strong></a> and the 2024 presidential elections.</p>
<p>One should keep in mind that Bitcoin was created due to a lack of trust in global fiat monetary systems, he noted.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the Fed lowers rates or ANY democratic wins the election (including undercover democrat, Nikki Haley, this is BULLISH for Bitcoin and will cause more inflation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, should <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trumps-promise-i-will-never-allow-the-creation-of-a-cbdc.htm">Donald Trump</a> win the election (again), Marolia opined that it would slow down or delay another strong bull market in Bitcoin. He said that it would likely cause dollar strength and that, just like gold, we price Bitcoin in dollars.</p>
<h2>BlackRock’s Marketing Approach is a Step to Mass Adoption</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/global-directory"><strong>BlackRock</strong></a> has been making headlines left and right, specifically in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-new-bitcoin-etf-debuts-strong-holding-over-120-million-in-btc.htm">ETF context</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that BlackRock is targeting an audience besides crypto enthusiasts. Asked if this is the correct approach, Rodgers said it is – especially at this point in the maturity cycle for the asset class.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This helps us get past reliance on the unsophisticated average retail investor, to more prudent investors with greater capital and better judgement. It’s a step along the way to increasing mass adoption.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the company recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-buys-over-13-days-of-bitcoin-production-a-sign-of-supply-shortage.htm">purchased 11,439 BTC</a>. Per Rodgers, however, this purchase, in and of itself, has “zero meaningful impact.”</p>
<p>Dan Hoover, the CCO/COO at <strong>Castle Funds</strong>, said he doesn’t believe that BlackRock is buying this much BTC for themselves. The number was implied by the increase in assets under management (AUM) reported for the <strong>iShares Bitcoin Trust</strong> (IBIT) after the first two days of trading, he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If this is the case, I think that this is a positive sign that the ETP’s can in fact scale their creation (and, theoretically, their redemption) processes in an orderly fashion.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If the BTC were purchased over the holiday weekend, it shows that risk-management processes are in place, such as hedging. This helps mitigate risk to the market-makers and Authorized Participants (APs). This is healthy for both the ETP holders and the market in general, he argued.</p>
<p>But downsides remain, Hoover noted. The Bitcoin market relies on transparency in holdings and movements, tracking flows across different wallets with each block mined.</p>
<p>However, he said, BlackRock – or any of the brokers they are using to buy the underlying BTC – are unlikely to be readily identifiable on chain for now. This will persist at least until the patterns of ownership are worked out.</p>
<p>“When added to the timing delays, the net result is confusion and volatility until the market learns how to track and adapt to these market actors,” Hoover said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian crypto market is buzzing with talks of taxation and regulations. With the central government set to announce the interim budget on 1st February, crypto exchanges and traders are hoping for relief from the 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) and 30% tax on crypto. However, the chances of their wish being granted seem less likely.</p>
<p>In a conversation with Gaurav Mehta, the founder of <a href="//catax.app/%5C%22" rel="sponsored">Catax</a>, India&rsquo;s first crypto tax software, we explore where India is heading with crypto tax laws and regulations.
</p>
<h2>India&rsquo;s First Crypto Tax Software</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Gaurav conceived the idea of running a crypto tax software back in 2014 and had already started pitching the idea to investors, 8 years before any formal crypto tax regulations in India. Though the solution of crypto taxes didn&rsquo;t start to materialize until 2022 for Catax.</p>
<p>Gaurav, who works as a forensic expert with different law enforcement agencies on cases related to blockchain, was a guest lecturer at National Academy of Direct Taxes where he trained IRS officers from 2021-2023. Catax, which primarily started to serve crypto taxation solutions to governments and businesses, aims to help a million retail customers with free crypto tax solutions in 2024-2025, Gaurav told Cryptonews.
</p>
<h2>Government is Building Competency in Catching Crypto Tax Evaders</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Talking about current crypto taxations in India, Gaurav said:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Up until 2023, the anonymity of the blockchain primarily benefited individuals. However, starting in 2024, the dynamics shift in favor of organizations, compliance, and all stakeholders. This shift occurs because the recent advancements have enabled the capacity to interpret, and track the blockchain effectively. As a result, taxation is poised to become a significant concern for everyone in the upcoming years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;The government is now building competency in this domain that will ultimately translate into identifying the people who are evading taxes,&rdquo; he added.
</p>
<h2>The Battle of 1% TDS on Crypto Transactions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
As per Gaurav, 1% TDS on crypto taxes is justifiable as it helps remove the fraud from markets such as pump and dump schemes. He said: &ldquo;The 1% TDS is primarily to remove the speculation from the market which has been there for such a long time manipulating the public, 1% TDS ensures that the people are only encouraged to engage in necessary and effective trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, before 1% TDS on crypto transactions was implemented in India in July 2022, nearly <a href="//cryptonews.com/news/indian-government-misses-on-420-million-in-crypto-taxes.htm%5C%22">three to five million customers flew to offshore exchanges</a> in five months. This resulted in approximately a loss of $420 million in taxes for the Indian government. Now, all the <a href="//cryptonews.com/news/india-blocks-offshore-crypto-exchanges-after-non-compliance-warning.htm%5C%22">offshore crypto exchanges have been blocked</a> in India.</p>
<p>Earlier, in <a href="//cryptonews.com/exclusives/interview-2023-year-end-wrap-with-coindcx-co-founder-neeraj-khandelwal.htm%5C%22">an interview with Cryptonews</a>, co-founder of India&rsquo;s leading crypto exchange CoinDCX, Neeraj Khandelwal, said &ldquo;1% TDS on crypto transactions is a &ldquo;death blow&rdquo; to the industry.
</p>
<h2>Future of Crypto Regulations in India</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Gaurav noted that given India has a protectionist economy, meaning the government closely oversees the funds flowing outside of the country, unlike the developed countries like the USA or UK, it is unlikely that crypto regulations will be similar to those countries.</p>
<p>However, India currently has a community of more than 15 million investors who have a vested interest in crypto and are trying to convince the government to bring regulations. Gaurav further added that given India&rsquo;s economic position, there could be regulations that separate crypto trading from crypto ownership. He added:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We may have something where people would be able to create a Demat-like account on the crypto exchanges and would be able to buy and sell their crypto. But to transfer the crypto from India to somewhere else that clearance would be done by National Securities Depositories Ltd (NSDL) and Central Securities Depositories Ltd (CDSL) like entities.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h2>RBI Governor Remains Critical of Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos today, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das, once again reiterated the negative stance on crypto, saying, &ldquo;cryptocurrency is highly speculative and country like India should be very careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cryptocurrencies have huge risk, particularly for emerging market economies because it can impact your financial stability, currency stability, and monetary system.There is no underlying value. It is not a currency, but it has the potential to become a currency in which event it can occupy the part of the payments system. It can impact your banking system and therefore it has very much risk involved in it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Crypto regulations was among one of the main topics during the G20 summit last year in India. The Indian government proposed universal regulations for all the G-20 members and accepted a <a href="//cryptonews.com/news/key-g20-policy-paper-suggests-against-blanket-crypto-ban-calls-for-comprehensive-regulatory-oversight.htm%5C%22">synthesis paper proposing a IMF and FSB</a>. The crypto community in India continues to wait for any formal regulations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again the social elite gathered in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF) – a global event bringing together the most influential players in politics and business to discuss the upcoming trends in business.</p>
<p>For the last seven years, crypto players have edged their way into Davos during the WEF. Who can forget 2017 (peak crypto) &#8212; crypto was the hottest trend. The talk of the town not forgetting the initial coin offering (ICO) phase.</p>
<p>After the ICO bubble popped <a href="https://in.investing.com/analysis/beyond-icos-can-cryptocurrencies-find-new-legitimacy-via-stos-and-ieos-200209669" rel="sponsored">there was an attempt to make</a> “security token offerings” (STOs) and “initial exchange offerings” (IEOs) a thing but this fizzled out too.</p>
<p>In 2018, the WEF saw more chatter around Bitcoin and how some cryptocurrencies were a fad, but blockchain technology was here to stay. Then eventually crypto and blockchain technology took a back seat at Davos and chatter around the importance of regulation continued on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>In 2019, attendees continued <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/davos-2019-leaders-share-mixed-cryptocurrency-predictions/" rel="sponsored">to try and revive the sector,</a> with many verbally bashing crypto as fad. Back then at the WEF, Jeff Schumacher, founder of BCG Digital Ventures, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/davos-2019-leaders-share-mixed-cryptocurrency-predictions/" rel="sponsored">said:</a> “I do believe it [bitcoin] will go to zero. I think it’s a great technology but I don’t believe it’s a currency. It’s not based on anything.”</p>
<p>Between 2020-2023 (excluding 2021 when the WEF was cancelled due to Covid) – crypto continued to remain on the outskirts – although addressed and included (for diversity) it is no longer the hot new trend as it was in 2017. Despite crypto players desperately trying to revive the sector with cool afterparties and Bitcoin pizza day – crypto remains niche,  a bit like Marmite.</p>
<h4><strong>WEF Davos Discussion Points</strong></h4>
<p>Cryptonews touched base with attendees on the ground in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Davos, WEF attendees have been discussing the recent approval of ETFs and how this significant achievement could potentially lead to widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies,&#8221; said Marcos Benitez, head of sales Switzerland for<span class="&quot;gmail-Apple-converted-space&quot;"> </span>Copper.co.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many countries are looking to the United States to follow a similar regulatory framework. It&#8217;s worth noting that within the first two days of the listing of various Bitcoin ETFs, a staggering $4.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency had already been traded,&#8221; added Benitez.</p>
<h4><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval </strong></h4>
<p>CoinDesk <a href="//www.coindesk.com/author/christine-lee/%5C%22" rel="sponsored">producer and anchor</a> Christine Lee, who is at Davos said the crypto crowd gathered this year is optimistic due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the ETFs.</p>
<p>“The crypto vibe in Davos 2024 is decidedly more optimistic thanks to the SEC’s approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs, driving the market higher in anticipation of further institutional adoption. When the news was announced last week, entrepreneurs at CfC St. Moritz, a highly curated crypto conference pre-Davos, were popping champagne bottles, and the wine continued to flow at the various parties throughout the World Economic Forum this week,” said Lee.</p>
<p>Lee has attended numerous events in Switzerland explains many crypto companies are back on the Promenade in Davos, though their operations have scaled back coming off the bear market.</p>
<p>“Circle is opting for private meetings rather than last year’s blowout party and Filecoin Foundation has dialed back their budget. Others making repeat appearances include Hedera, Caspar Labs, 1 Inch, the Global Blockchain Business Council, CV VC, and Skybridge Capital,” said Lee.</p>
<h4><b>WEF Davos 2024 Crypto Media Coverage </b></h4>
<p>Here is a round up of some of the interesting coverage coming out of Davos relating to the cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<p>Reuters, Divya Chowdhury and Lisa Pauline Mattackal <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/skybridges-scaramucci-sees-bitcoin-over-170000-by-2025-halving-spot-etfs-2024-01-15/" rel="sponsored">report</a> hedge fund SkyBridge&#8217;s Anthony Scaramucci believes Bitcoin&#8217;s price could breach $170,000 next year, driven by demand for newly listed exchange traded-funds and April&#8217;s halving event. &#8220;If bitcoin&#8217;s at $45,000 on the halving, where it roughly is right now, it&#8217;ll be $170,000 by mid- to late 2025,&#8221; the SkyBridge founder and managing partner told the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/skybridges-scaramucci-sees-bitcoin-over-170000-by-2025-halving-spot-etfs-2024-01-15/" rel="sponsored">Reuters Global Markets Forum</a> at Davos.</p>
<p>CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal and MacKenzie Sigalos <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/davos-2024-ai-takes-over-wefs-main-area-pushing-crypto-aside.html" rel="sponsored">report</a> that, artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be dominate the Promenade far more than crypto firms this year, reversing a trend from the past few years. The duo look back at their previous converge of crypto at Davos.  In January 2023, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/14/why-the-2022-crypto-winter-is-unlike-previous-bear-markets.html" rel="sponsored">the crypto winter had set in</a>, firms pulled back on splashing the cash at Davos, but there was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/davos-1point4-trillion-wipeout-hits-crypto-industry-at-wef.html" rel="sponsored">still a heavy presence from the industry</a>, inclduing a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/19/davos-mystery-of-orange-bitcoin-car-revealed-and-owner-slams-critics.html" rel="sponsored">mysterious orange bitcoin car</a>. Today it seems Davos is all about AI which is dominating the WEF.</p>

<p>The <strong>MetaMask Snaps</strong> plugin, which provides access to the popular <strong>MetaMask</strong> wallet&rsquo;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metamask-expands-global-presence-with-payment-partnerships-across-six-countries.htm">30 million monthly active users</a>, is now available on the open-source, proof-of-stake network <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hedera-adds-major-household-name-to-its-council-why-is-this-important.htm">Hedera</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This Hedera Wallet Snap plugin, built by <a href="https://www.tuum.tech/" rel="sponsored"><strong>Tuum Technologies</strong></a>, enables developers, companies, and individuals to enjoy new benefits beyond MetaMask&rsquo;s native features, said the press release. Developers can now integrate Hedera&rsquo;s functionality into MetaMask-based applications.</p>
<p>Donald Bullers, Founder and CEO of Tuum Technologies, told <em>Cryptonews</em> that the prevailing market conditions provide &ldquo;a significant validation of the enduring presence of decentralized technologies&rdquo; powered by distributed ledger technology (DLT).
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This acknowledgment is expected to broaden adoption among a previously skeptical demographic, leading to a substantial increase in crypto wallet account activations.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Consequently, there is a heightened demand for ongoing product innovation in the space to meet the growing needs of users, Bullers said.
</p>
<h2>Enabling Access to Range of Networks through MetaMask</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Tuum Technologies is a software engineering company and a developer of open-source, decentralized identity solutions.</p>
<p>It created Snaps, which extends the functionality of MetaMask by enabling developers to create custom plugins.</p>
<p>The integration of Hedera into an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), multichain wallet &ldquo;opens up numerous doors&rdquo; for developers, users, and companies to interact with the Hedera network directly through MetaMask applications.</p>
<p>Bullers told <em>Cryptonews</em> that,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The introduction of Hedera&#8217;s native functionality to MetaMask&rsquo;s 30 million MAUs not only increases interoperability but also extends access to a diverse range of networks, including Hedera.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
This amalgamation, said he, combines MetaMask&rsquo;s robust security features and Hedera&rsquo;s speed and cost-effectiveness, &ldquo;elevating the overall user experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It &ldquo;paves the way for user experience efficiencies,&rdquo; said the announcement, enabling anyone to send <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-hedera-hbar-price-rallies-10-and-this-other-coin-could-explode-next-heres-why.htm">HBAR</a> to Hedera and EVM addresses. It also enables the retrieval of account information and viewing of token balances.
</p>
<h2>More Features Coming Soon</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
The Hedera Wallet Snap eliminates the need for Hedera JSON-RPC Relay. This allows the plugin users to retrieve account information from the Hedera Consensus Node and the Hedera Mirror Node.</p>
<p>Per CEO Bullers,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For developers and companies currently operating MetaMask-enabled applications or planning to build them, this integration offers an alternative to Hedera JSON RPC Relay and opens doors to Hedera&#8217;s full suite of capabilities.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The use of native integration, as opposed to relying on Hedera JSON RPC Relay, allows developers to support features from the Hedera Token Service (HTS) and extend their capabilities into other network services. These include File Service, Smart Contract Service, and Consensus Service.</p>
<p>Bullers noted that the initial release comprises basic functionalities. The team is actively working on incorporating advanced features in the coming months. This will include viewing transaction history and staking/unstaking HBAR to and from Hedera Network nodes.</p>
<p>Kiran Pachhai, Co-founder of Tuum Technologies, commented that the Hedera Wallet Snap is &ldquo;a sophisticated plugin that empowers developers to enhance the capabilities of their applications beyond the native features of MetaMask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shayne Higdon, Co-founder and CEO of <strong>The HBAR Foundation</strong> added that this is just a first step for the plugin. Specifically as more features and functionalities will be announced in the coming months.</p>
<p>Hedera Wallet Snap can be installed from MetaMask Open Beta. It is available on GitHub as a JavaScript NPM package.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hedera-and-algorand-ecosystems-unite-to-form-derec-alliance-for-decentralized-asset-recovery-system.htm"><strong>Hedera</strong></a> has announced the latest member of its governing council &ndash; the tech giant <a href="http://www.hitachi.us/" rel="sponsored"><strong>Hitachi</strong></a>. Hedera&rsquo;s President Charles Adkins told <em>Cryptonews</em> why having household names join the ranks is relevant.
</p>
<h2>Hedera Lending Credibility with Hitachi America</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><strong>The Hedera Council&rsquo;s </strong></p>
<p>newest member is <strong>Hitachi America, Ltd</strong>. According to the press release, it plans to start creating proofs-of-concept for end-to-end supply chain and sustainability solutions on Hedera in the next year.</p>
<p>Charles Adkins told <em>Cryptonews</em> that having these major names join the council specifically, and the industry in general, is key.</p>
<p>This is a nascent technology, he said. At this stage, it&rsquo;s important to have key partners who can demonstrate their trust in the technology.</p>
<p>He added:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These well-known names lend credibility and recognizable branding to people all over the world who are still on the fence about utilizing this technology in other ways for themselves.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Also, Bill Miller, co-chair of the membership committee for the Hedera Council, commented that distributed ledger technology (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/overview-of-the-current-dlt-landscape.htm">DLT</a>) is &ldquo;blossoming into real-world applications at massive scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This process, he argues, requires support from household industry names such as Hitachi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Web3 infrastructure is increasingly attractive to large enterprises, who have never before been able to demonstrate the transparency and accountability of supply chain and other systems that are so urgently needed in today&rsquo;s times,&rdquo; Miller said.
</p>
<h2>Already Developing Blockchain Technology Solutions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Adkins told <em>Cryptonews</em> that the governing council looks to engage in meaningful discussions with organizations that have a deep interest and commitment to implementing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereumpow-core-team-disbands-to-achieve-full-decentralization-as-onedao-provides-transitional-support.htm">decentralized</a> technology.</p>
<p>Being a part of the council &ldquo;allows them to have a voice in the room to discuss with other wonderful companies how to navigate the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement noted that Hitachi brings new capabilities to the Council, strengthening the network through its technical and research capabilities. Furthermore, it brings expertise and innovation in machine learning and generative <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-reveals-ai-tokens-outperform-btc-and-eth-with-up-to-650-yearly-gains.htm">AI</a> technologies. This has increased the varied expertise that forms the Council&rsquo;s knowledge base.</p>
<p>Per the press release,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hitachi and its affiliates have already employed their technological expertise to develop valuable blockchain technology solutions in payment systems, supply chains, predictive maintenance, and mining.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Hitachi America is headquartered in California and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of <strong>Hitachi, Ltd</strong>. It brings to the table industrial solutions expertise, said the press release. The company offers a range of electronics, power and industrial equipment and services, energy, industrial, health care, IT, OT, mobility, and IoT with operations throughout the Americas.</p>
<p>Ravigopal Vennelakanti, Vice President and head of Hitachi&rsquo;s Big Data Analytics Solutions Lab, commented that Hitachi sees real-world potential in DLT solutions built on Hedera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hedera addresses emerging needs in supply chain resiliency, clean energy, IT/OT and the semiconductor industries, for example,&rdquo; Vennelakanti said. &ldquo;Its unique DLT provides the single truth and tokenization mechanisms for distributed workflows that are needed to address these challenges.&rdquo;
</p>
<h2>Equal Vote in Adding Members</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Hedera is an open-source, proof-of-stake network governed by the Hedera Council. The latter is a consortium of diverse, global organizations and enterprises committed to network innovation and Hedera&rsquo;s continued decentralization.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Council members are chosen by having discussions and finding alignment before bringing them forward for a council vote, Adkins said.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Its forty members include <strong>Boeing</strong>, <strong>Chainlink</strong>, <strong>DBS Bank</strong>, <strong>Dell</strong>, <strong>Deutsche Telekom</strong>, <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>LG Electronics</strong>, <strong>The London School of Economics</strong>, <strong>University College London</strong>, <strong>Nomura Holdings</strong>, <strong>Shinhan Bank</strong>, <strong>Standard Bank Group</strong>, <strong>Ubisoft</strong>, and more.</p>
<p>The members share an equal vote in the direction of Hedera&#8217;s software and services. They also run the initial network nodes.</p>
<p>As for Hedera&rsquo;s plans for 2024, the President said it intends to &ldquo;keep improving engagement with the community and improving in all other areas of governance and network performance.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<h2>New Record</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
The growing interest in <strong>World ID</strong> in Argentina has resulted in a new national record, said Worldcoin. There were nearly 16,000 Orb verifications in a single day in late December.</p>
<p><a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/record-world-id-interest-argentina-leads-new-innovation-500k-verifications" rel="sponsored">According</a> to the announcement,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;More than 1% of the Argentine population has now verified their World ID, similar to milestones set in Chile (1.5%), Spain (0.8%) and Portugal (2.5%).&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The rise in verifications, it added, comes weeks after the launch of <strong>World ID 2.0</strong>. This is the second generation of Worldcoin&rsquo;s proof of humanity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As for future plans, a spokesperson told <em>Cryptonews</em> that Worldcoin &ldquo;expects to see additional integrations launch in 2024 and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231213314816/en/Introducing-Worldcoin%E2%80%99s-World-ID-2.0-Delivers-enhanced-privacy-and-human-centered-digital-access-to-Shopify-Mercado-Libre-Minecraft-Reddit-and-Telegram" rel="sponsored">announced</a>&nbsp;expansion plans to Mexico and Singapore. It aims to keep scaling to meet demand for its World ID verification services in 2024.</p>
<p>The team also looks forward to seeing how developers build on World ID, it said.
</p>
<h2>Updated Verification Process</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
The <strong>Tools for Humanity</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-price-rebounds-as-sam-altman-stays-as-developers-chairman.htm">TFH</a>) team has released an update to the in-app verification process, the announcement added. This is the company behind Worldcoin&rsquo;s first wallet, World App.</p>
<p>There is now a new multi-hour appointment window available. Per the team, it is:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Designed to help streamline Orb verifications and reduce wait times for those with booked appointments, which are mandatory in Argentina.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
World App users can easily identify their nearest Orb locations, said the announcement, and book an appointment to verify their World ID.</p>
<p>The ability to verify the World ID unlocks up to one hour before the scheduled appointment. It is available up to two hours after it.</p>
<p>Users can also cancel and reschedule appointments.
</p>
<h2>Surpassing 5 Million Accounts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Worldcoin is a decentralized open-source protocol created around the Worldcoin token and the decentralized World ID. It uses biometric authentication to differentiate between a human and a bot.</p>
<p>It is backed by prominent investors and co-founded by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/altman-co-founder-of-worldcoin-raises-115-million-for-unique-cryptocurrency.htm">Sam Altman</a>, the Chief Executive Officer of <strong>OpenAI</strong> , the team behind the generative AI chatbot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinmarketcap-launches-chatgpt-plugin-simplify-crypto-analysis.htm"><strong>ChatGPT</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In May 2023,&nbsp;<a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-app" rel="sponsored">Worldcoin launched its World App</a>. Six months later, World App reached <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoins-world-app-hits-1m-mau-six-months-after-launch.htm">over one million active users</a> (MAUs) and over four million downloads.</p>
<p>Per the spokesperson, World App is &ldquo;thriving.&rdquo; In late December, it surpassed 5 million accounts and 1 million weekly users.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">world app just crossed 5m users and is now used by 1m per week</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Shopify Integration Was &lsquo;Immediate Success&rsquo;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
World ID 2.0 features <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-unveils-integrations-with-minecraft-reddit-telegram-shopify-and-mercado-libre.htm">integrations</a> with popular platforms like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/argentinas-e-commerce-giant-mercadolibre-reports-21-million-in-customer-crypto-assets.htm"><strong>Mercado Libre</strong></a> in Argentina, the latest announcement said. Other integrations include <strong>Reddit</strong>, as well as an early anti-fraud retail integration with <strong>Shopify</strong>.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the anti-fraud tool, Worldcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1735439766848487487" rel="sponsored">debuted a limited-time Shopify store</a>&nbsp;in December 2023.&nbsp;It recently <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/shopify-world-id-results-worldcoin-first-anti-fraud-retail-integration" rel="sponsored">released</a> the results, stating:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With minimal promotion, the online pop-up store was a near immediate success. The initial supply of sweatshirts sold out within the first 12 hours, and within the first 40 hours all items were officially out of stock.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
In total, more than 2,000 &ldquo;unique humans&rdquo; in more than 45 countries across 6 continents placed orders.</p>
<p>Per TFH&rsquo;s Tiago Sada, &ldquo;by ensuring actions are taken by unique humans and not bots, businesses can better protect themselves against fraud while reaching as wide and fairly distributed an audience as possible.&rdquo;
</p>
<h2>&lsquo;Broad Adoption&rsquo; of Worldcoin in India Despite Orb-Verification Pause</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Worldcoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-discontinues-its-orb-verification-services-in-india-brazil-and-france.htm">recently paused</a> its Orb-verification service in India, Brazil, and France. The Orb, a five-pound chromatic sphere, scans individuals&rsquo; eyeballs to verify their identities.</p>
<p>The <strong>Worldcoin Foundation</strong> stated that World App &ldquo;continues to experience broad adoption&rdquo; in India, with thousands of downloads each week.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Orb-verified proof of personhood services have been temporarily scaled back as the protocol works to develop and roll out a bespoke, safe, and orderly process that sufficiently meets the demand for World ID in India.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Individuals can refer to the World App and Worldcoin website for updates regarding Orb availability near them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a person close to the matter,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Essentially, Brazil and France are currently exactly where the Worldcoin protocol said they would be earlier this year.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Worldcoin reiterated that the orb verification services were <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-begins-rollout-orbs-meet-global-demand-world-id" rel="sponsored">intentionally</a> only available for a limited-time preview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are plans in 2024 to launch those markets in a more ongoing (non-preview) way. Therefore, this really isn&#8217;t news unless the protocol doing something it said it would do is news,&rdquo; the person close to the matter said.</p>

<p>Web3 infrastructure firm <strong>Bitfinity Network</strong> has raised millions from major backers, while nearing the launch of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Its founder talked with <em>Cryptonews</em> about how this EVM works to solve the issue of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-is-not-taking-off-as-mainstream-payment-boe-governor.htm"><strong>Bitcoin’s</strong></a> limited use, as well as about a potentially incoming wave of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cftc-committee-recommends-enhanced-understanding-and-regulation-of-defi.htm">DeFi</a> and tokenization on Bitcoin similar to that on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-dominates-with-nearly-50-of-ethereum-layer-2-total-value-locked.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Bitfinity Network has successfully secured over $7 million in funding from major backers. These include <strong>Polychain Capital</strong> and <strong>ParaFi Capital</strong>. Max Chamberlin, Founder of Bitfinity, said the team is “thrilled to announce support from two leading investors in the blockchain space.”</p>
<p>According to the press release shared with <em>Cryptonews</em>, the funds will be utilized for the project’s “mission to establish off-chain infrastructure for Bitcoin and Ordinals. “</p>
<p>Chamberlin added that the backing reaffirms the company’s mission to bring greater utility to developers within the Bitcoin, <strong>Solidity</strong>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-internet-computer-icp-price-rallies-55-as-new-meme-coin-prepares-to-launch.htm"><strong>Internet Computer</strong></a> (ICP) communities.</p>
<p>Ben Forman, Managing Partner at ParaFi Capital, said that solidity developers now benefit from Bitfinity’s high throughput, low fees, and Bitcoin-native support.</p>
<h2>Solving the Issue of Bitcoin’s Limited Use</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The announcement noted that this significant raise coincides with the development of the <strong>Bitfinity Ethereum Virtual Machine</strong> (EVM).</p>
<p>The team describes it as a Bitcoin sidechain integrated into the Internet Computer blockchain. There is also “the addition of <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/"><strong>Taproot</strong></a> assets on the horizon.”</p>
<p>It enables solidity developers and existing EVM-compatible services to build Bitcoin-enabled decentralized apps (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-ministry-of-industry-aims-to-foster-nft-and-dapp-growth-despite-crypto-ban.htm">dapps</a>).</p>
<p>The Bitfinity EVM will enable the deployment of EVM dapps with speeds 100 times faster than Ethereum and at a fraction of the cost, the team claims.</p>
<p>The integration connects “the worlds of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” they said. This promotes greater interoperability and expands the possibilities for DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Bitfinity&#8217;s Founder, Max Chamberlin, told <em>Cryptonews</em>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Imagine putting your Bitcoin into a lending and borrowing pool or an automated market maker and earning yield from your Bitcoin. Imagine using Bitcoin as an asset for restaking and securing other networks. It&#8217;s important because it unlocks Bitcoin&#8217;s potential beyond being a passive investment bearing no interest or yield, solving the issue of its limited use.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He noted that users can utilize numerous platforms on Ethereum to put their assets to use.</p>
<p>But there has been the explosion of asset types on Bitcoin, Ordinals, Runes, BRC20, etc, he said. There’s now a need for blockchain technology to enable DeFi services not just for Bitcoin but for the emerging token ecosystem on Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Incoming EVM Launch</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chamberlin said that the mainnet launch of the Bitfinity EVM is expected mid to late January.</p>
<p>It will be the first EVM to integrate with Bitcoin without relying on intermediary bridges, the announcement said.</p>
<p>Bitfinity uses the ICP&#8217;s threshold signature scheme (aka Chain-Key) to enable smart contracts to hold and transfer BTC and Ordinal assets on-chain.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This approach offers heightened security and transparency compared to conventional bridge mechanisms — allowing developers and users to circumvent a $3b annual attack vector.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier, Bitcoin faced exclusion from DeFi due to its incompatibility with smart contracts. But the integration with ICP has finally made BTC accessible in DeFi.</p>
<p>ParaFi Capital’s Ben Forman commented that, as the demand to integrate Bitcoin increases, “we believe Bitfinity’s EVM opens up the Bitcoin ecosystem to novel use cases and applications.”</p>
<p>Chamberlin told <em>Cryptonews</em> that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Use cases could include lending and borrowing platforms and automated market makers (like <strong>Uniswap</strong>) that use Bitcoin as the base asset of the pools, as well as borrowing against your Ordinals (like NFTs on Bitcoin) and using this to trade or purchase other services.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Notable Features of the Bitfinity EVM include Solidity smart contracts gaining access to ckBTC, fully decentralized stack, speeds 100 times faster than the Ethereum Mainnet, lower gas fees, and being audited by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-quantstamp-reveals-defi-protection-product-that-reimburses-losses-polygon-proposes-protocol-council-bitdeer-announces-2-million-share-repurchase-program.htm"><strong>Quantstamp</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f31f.png" alt="🌟" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />In this article we explore innovations like the Bitfinity EVM, the surge in ordinal inscriptions, enterprise adoption, and the promise of DeFi on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#39;s massive untapped liquidity could pave the way for a new generation of Dapps! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f310.png" alt="🌐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/k8f5VNRlgm">https://t.co/k8f5VNRlgm</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Expect a DeFi Wave</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chamberlin suggested that the road for developing off-chain infrastructure for Bitcoin and Ordinals will be bumpy – but worthwhile.</p>
<p>In the short term, there are “simple and somewhat centralized platforms” for exchanging both BRC20 and Ordinals, he said.</p>
<p>But a lot of infrastructure is needed to create DeFi services for Ordinals that are decentralized. This includes threshold signature schemes for custodying the assets on the side-chain or Layer 2 (L2) and decentralized indexers for Ordinals.</p>
<p>Per the Founder,</p>
<blockquote><p>“These are all being built on ICP and Bitfinity. Once we have these two critical pieces of infrastructure, expect a wave of DeFi and tokenisation similar to that on Ethereum.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the press release said, Bitfinity&#8217;s roadmap includes integrating <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/taproot-adoption-remains-low-but-devs-say-it-isnt-problem-for-bitcoin.htm">Taproot</a> assets, including Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, into its protocol. It will accomplish this by creating on-chain indexers that monitor Taproot asset transactions recorded in the segWit data fields.</p>

<p><em>This is your weekly digest of top crypto news from Cryptonews.com, followed by a collection of 20 hand-picked crypto jokes.</em></p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>This week in crypto: unsurprisingly, ETF discussions. While Tuttle Capital Management <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tuttle-capital-files-for-six-leveraged-and-inverse-bitcoin-etfs-with-sec.htm">filed for six new Bitcoin ETFs</a> with the US SEC, two of the issuers released <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-binance-ceo-richard-teng-changing-the-industrys-messianic-narrative-more-news.htm">details on the fees that they will charge investors</a> for the ETF, and Glen Goodman argued <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-is-fully-priced-in-argues-analyst-glen-goodman.htm">an ETF is fully priced in</a>, BitGo’s Steve Scott and AJ Nary opined that an ETF approval is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-is-unlikely-to-change-regulatory-environment-in-the-us-more-news.htm">unlikely to resolve the bigger regulatory picture in the US</a> anytime soon.</p>

In Kyrgyzstan, the water-rich environment has the potential <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hydropower-fuels-kyrgyzstans-crypto-mining-industry.htm">to provide a necessary boost for the country’s crypto mining industry</a>.</p>

<p>There are many retailers accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment and realizing how important it is to attract and tap into a more tech-savvy client base.</p>
<p>Some would argue that the end of fiat currencies is nigh, and eventually, fiat will be replaced by digital currencies. If we already have a fiat payment system why change this and what are the advantages of using digital currencies for retail transactions?</p>
<p>Data from Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/audit/us-corporates-using-crypto-pov.pdf">reported roughly</a> 2,352 US businesses accepted Bitcoin in late 2022, and that doesn’t include Bitcoin ATMs. An increasing number of companies worldwide are using Bitcoin and other crypto and digital assets for a host of investment, operational, and transactional purposes.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>Benefits of Using Cryptocurrency in Retail</b></p>
<p><b></b>Using digital currencies for transactions offers several advantages such as speed. Digital currency transactions can be completed instantly or in a matter of seconds, compared to traditional banking systems which can take days.</p>
<p>Digital currencies can reduce or eliminate the need for intermediaries, leading to lower transaction fees for retailers. Cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized platform, making international transactions smoother without the need for currency conversion.<b></b></p>
<p>Then there is the issue of security – blockchain technology, which underpins many digital currencies allows for enhanced security features. This in turn can protect both retailers and customers from fraud and unauthorized transactions. <b></b></p>
<p>Another factor is reduced fraud risks. The immutable nature of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">blockchain</a> ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered, reducing the risk of chargebacks and fraudulent activities.</p>
<h4><b>Financial Inclusion</b></h4>
<p>For the underprivileged cryptocurrency has the potential to foster financial inclusion and improve access to financial services especially those in developing countries. Financial inclusion is important and digital currencies can provide banking services to the unbanked or underbanked populations, potentially expanding the customer base for retailers.</p>
<p>Through accepting digital payments retailers can offer innovative payment solutions, such as loyalty programs, or smart contract-based transactions using digital currencies.</p>
<h4><strong>Transparent Transactions </strong></h4>
<p>Every transaction on the blockchain is recorded transparently, allowing for greater accountability and trust between retailers and customers. This also cuts out the need for due diligence before a huge transaction.  Digital transactions cut out the middlemen. Direct peer-to-peer transactions can eliminate the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors, reducing costs and potential points of failure.</p>
<h4><strong><b>Retailers accepting Bitcoin</b><br />
</strong></h4>
<p>So who are the most notable and prominent retailers that have embraced digital currency payments?</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><b>Microsoft:</b> This American multinational technology corporation has been accepting Bitcoin for use in its online <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30377654">Xbox Store since 2014.</a> However, the firm temporarily paused from accepting Bitcoin due to volatility in the market. Microsoft is once again accepting cryptocurrency strictly for the Xbox store credits.</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks:</strong> The coffee shop customers pay directly with Bitcoin thanks to a partnership with digital wallet <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005401/en/Bakkt-Launches-Its-Digital-Wallet-Bakkt-App-to-Manage-All-Forms-of-Digital-Assets-Debuting-with-Starbucks-GolfNow-and-Best-Buy-Among-Other-Marquee-Brands">provider Bakkt.</a>  In 2022, Starbucks unveiled Starbucks Odyssey becoming one of the first companies to integrate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a loyalty program.</li>
<li><b>Tesla: </b>SpaceX and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk has been open about his interest in Dogecoin. Tesla first began accepting crypto as a form of payment for its cars but discontinued the program soon after. However, Dogecoin is <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/dogecoin#:~:text=What%20cryptocurrency%20does%20Tesla%20accept,making%20your%20purchase%20with%20Dogecoin.">still accepting</a> some Tesla Merchandise.</li>
<li><b>Wholefoods: </b>This grocery chain, owned by Amazon, has shown interest in cryptocurrency and there have been initiatives to enable crypto payments, although the rollout was still in progress as of my last update.</li>
<li><b>Time Magazine:</b> In 2019, TIME magazine <a href="https://time.com/5955969/time-partners-with-crypto-com/">first began</a> accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for digital subscriptions through a new partnership with <a href="https://crypto.com/">Crypto.com</a> exchange.</li>
<li><b>Virgin Galactic:</b> The space tourism venture founded by Richard Branson, is accepting bitcoins as a form of payment for space tourists. Unfortunately, Virgin Galactic has been a loss-making business announcing job cuts and a pause in commercial flights in an effort to save cash.</li>
<li><b>Overstock:</b> The e-commerce home decor firm selling bedding and furniture accepts cryptocurrency as a form of payment. This was one of the earliest major retailers to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>How to Shop with Cryptocurrency</b></h4>
<p>To begin shopping with cryptocurrency involves a few basic steps to ensure you have the necessary tools and knowledge to make secure transactions.  Here&#8217;s a brief guide on how to get started:</p>
<p>First of all, choose a wallet. Before you can shop with cryptocurrency, you&#8217;ll need a digital wallet to store your crypto assets. Wallets come in various forms: you can either choose a software wallet which involves an application or software installed on your computer or mobile device. The other option is a hardware wallet.</p>
<p>This is a physical device that stores your cryptocurrency offline, offering increased security.  Online wallets are web-based services that store your crypto assets on the cloud. However, these are considered less secure than hardware or software wallets.</p>
<h4><b>Acquiring Crypto</b></h4>
<p>The next step is to acquire Cryptocurrency: To start shopping, you&#8217;ll need to acquire some cryptocurrency. This can be done by using exchanges. Platforms such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken allow you to buy cryptocurrencies using traditional currencies (like USD, EUR, etc.).</p>
<p>There is the Peer-to-Peer option. This allows you to buy from individuals through platforms like LocalBitcoins or through decentralized exchanges. There are also crypto ATMs: In some locations, cryptocurrency ATMs allow you to purchase crypto using cash.</p>
<p>Next, choose a retailer that accepts cryptocurrency as a form of payment.  Not all retailers accept cryptocurrency. Look for online platforms or physical stores that have integrated crypto payments. Some popular retailers or platforms include Overstock, Shopify merchants, and various independent online stores.</p>
<h4><b>Making the Purchase</b></h4>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve selected a product or service from a retailer that accepts cryptocurrency. Next comes the fun part: Choose the cryptocurrency payment option. Enter the necessary details, which usually include the amount in crypto and a receiving address. Confirm the transaction from your wallet.</p>
<p>It’s important to monitor and manage your account. Always keep an eye on your cryptocurrency transactions. Ensure you&#8217;re sending funds to the correct address and are aware of any associated fees.</p>
<h4><b>Stay Informed </b></h4>
<p>The world of cryptocurrency is dynamic and fast-moving. Stay updated on the latest developments, security best practices, and changes in regulations.</p>
<p>Remember, while shopping with cryptocurrency can offer privacy, speed, and other benefits, it also comes with risks. Always prioritize security, ensure you&#8217;re dealing with reputable retailers, and be cautious of potential scams.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, 2024 may be a popular year for homebuyers. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) recently <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/nar-forecasts-4-71-million-existing-home-sales-improved-outlook-for-home-buyers-in-2024">predicted</a> that home sales will begin to rise next year, with 4.71 million existing homes forecasted to be sold in 2024. According to NAR, this would represent a 13.5 percent increase in home sales compared to 2023.</p>
<p>Industry experts are also predicting that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-billionaire-michael-saylor-announces-new-600-million-btc-purchase-time-to-buy.htm">price of Bitcoin will go up in the coming year</a>. The increasing interest in real estate, coupled with a new bull run, may lead some to wonder whether or not they should purchase real estate using cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2><b>Buying real estate using cryptocurrency: A growing trend</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although buying a home with cryptocurrency may not yet be a common practice, some industry experts believe that this will be a trend in 2024 and beyond.</p>
<p>Natalie Karayaneva, founder and chief executive officer of <a href="https://propy.com/browse/about/">Propy</a> – a company that automates real estate transactions using blockchain technology – told Cryptonews that 11 percent of all homebuyers used cryptocurrency for down payments in 2021. Karayaneva mentioned that the 2021 bull run likely helped drive this interest. “Each bull run cycle will often result in a growing trend of people interested in buying real estate with cryptocurrency,” she remarked.</p>
<p>According to Karayaneva, Propy has processed thousands of transactions since the company’s inception in 2017. “Propy has surpassed $4 billion worth of volume on our blockchain network, handling millions of dollars in crypto payments,” she said. Karayaneva further believes that the first home sale conducted by Propy paved the way for other sales. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The first home sale conducted by Propy was wrapped as a non-fungible token (NFT) and bought within 5 minutes by a Gen Z, who paid ETH directly to a smart contract. Another sale was made using Bitcoin to Bitcoin, as the home seller wanted cryptocurrency.”</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_146187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146187" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-146187 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873084-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-59-51-1.png" alt="" width="628" height="640" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873084-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-59-51-1.png 628w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873084-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-59-51-1-294x300.png 294w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873084-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-59-51-1-64x64.png 64w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873084-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-59-51-1-150x153.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-146187" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Propy</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the home buying process using cryptocurrency has evolved over time. For instance, Karayaneva explained there are now several steps involved when it comes to buying a home through Propy. She mentioned that interested buyers first need to register on the Propy platform, undergoing <a href="https://notabene.id/crypto-travel-rule-101/kyc-crypto#:~:text=What%20does%20KYC%20in%20Crypto,and%20verify%20the%20customer's%20identity.">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-cryptocurrency#:~:text=Anti%2Dmoney%20laundering%20(AML)%20is%20a%20collection%20of%20crime,in%20both%20fiat%20and%20cryptocurrency.">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> verification processes. Users can then initiate a purchase by making a cryptocurrency transaction for the selected property.</p>
<p>“Propy facilitates each transaction through its platform, allowing users to pay in various cryptocurrencies, utilizing third parties licensed for exchanging, or crypto-to-crypto facilitation,” Karayaneva explained. Propy then employs smart contracts to execute the transaction. “These contracts ensure the terms of the agreement between the buyer and seller are met. Propy Title – an escrow and title licensed company – executes on title search and transfer,” she added.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of the transaction, the property title is recorded in the local county and put on the blockchain. Karayaneva added that transfer of title can be completed via an NFT process, which often requires a two week preparation for the seller.</p>
<figure id="attachment_146189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146189" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-146189 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873319-propy-0003-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873319-propy-0003-1.png 800w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873319-propy-0003-1-300x188.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873319-propy-0003-1-768x480.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873319-propy-0003-1-150x94.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-146189" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Propy</figcaption></figure>
<p>Other platforms are enabling the use of cryptocurrency for real estate transactions. For example, <a href="https://bitpay.com/">BitPay</a> – a Bitcoin payments service provider – recently published a <a href="https://bitpay.com/blog/buy-a-house-with-cryptocurrency/">blog post</a> outlining how to buy a home using cryptocurrency though BitPay. According to the article, BitPay can facilitate cryptocurrency real estate transactions on behalf of buyers and sellers. The post states:</p>
<blockquote><p>“An email invoice will be generated by the selling party. The buyer receives the invoice and pays from their preferred <a href="https://bitpay.com/wallet/">crypto wallet</a>, either manually or by scanning a QR code. BitPay then transfers the funds to the seller via direct deposit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, BitPay partners with a handful of real estate groups, allowing buyers to use cryptocurrency to purchase homes in different locations.</p>
<figure id="attachment_146188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146188" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-146188 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873174-screenshot-2023-12-29-at-10-05-27am.png" alt="" width="800" height="583" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873174-screenshot-2023-12-29-at-10-05-27am.png 800w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873174-screenshot-2023-12-29-at-10-05-27am-300x219.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873174-screenshot-2023-12-29-at-10-05-27am-768x560.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873174-screenshot-2023-12-29-at-10-05-27am-150x109.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-146188" class="wp-caption-text">Source: BitPay</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some platforms are also enabling crypto holders to purchase portions of real estate using <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp">stablecoins</a> tied to the US Dollar. Jerry Chu, chief executive officer of <a href="https://lofty.com/?isPopup=1&amp;x_ads_source=9&amp;x_ads_group=155464186276&amp;x_ads_id=680109574946&amp;targetid=kwd-542693619782&amp;utm_source=Lofty_Branding&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-bmsBhAGEiwAoaQNmmceMaaGbIjMruWkEPmGeZDHzz8UWJFIfIJbtVrBdYVQYk4yJ6lfFhoCaLwQAvD_BwE">Lofty AI</a> – a real estate tokenization platform – told Cryptonews that all of the transactions on Lofty settle using the blockchain and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/">USDC</a>, which is a US Dollar pegged stablecoin. Chu believes that through this process there isn&#8217;t a strong shift from the traditional method of buying or selling real estate with fiat. “The shift is more so to using the dollar in a more efficient manner to enable a better transactional experience for these users,” he said.</p>
<p>Chu explained that Lofty is a platform that functions as a marketplace where homeowners can directly sell their properties to buyers online. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Traditionally, if a seller wanted to sell a house, they would have to sell either 100 percent, or nothing at all, and could typically only sell to one buyer. On Lofty, the ownership of all properties are divided into smaller fractions. Sellers can now sell any amount of equity in their properties to any number of buyers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to buy real estate on Lofty, Chu explained that every user must go through a full KYC process. “Once this is successfully completed, they can connect a crypto wallet to their account or use the default one generated for them,” said Chu.</p>
<p>Chu shared that interested home buyers can then navigate through the Lofty marketplace to browse over 135 properties for sale. He added that all the due diligence materials and disclosures are made publicly available for the featured properties. “This includes inspection reports, appraisal reports, seller background checks, credit ratings, and much more,” he said.</p>
<p>Once a buyer decides to invest in a specific property, Chu explained that they are directed to a transaction screen, where they can select how much to buy and at what price point. According to Chu, payment options include USDC, along with other cryptocurrencies. “Once the buyer submits the offer, a smart contract will match and settle the transaction instantly. The buyer will have received ownership in the property through ‘property tokens’ in their wallet and the seller will have received USDC in theirs, finalizing the transaction,” said Chu.</p>
<h2><b>Mortgages and insurance for crypto real estate transactions</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As using <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-solutions-aim-to-make-america-s-real-estate-market-more-accessible">cryptocurrency to purchase real estate gains traction</a>, it’s also important to consider the role of mortgages and insurance.</p>
<p>Karl Jacob, chief executive officer and co-founder of <a href="https://www.goloansnap.com/">LoanSnap</a> – a mortgage company specializing in cryptocurrency transactions – told Cryptonews that mortgages play a crucial role because they allow buyers to borrow money against homes they wish to purchase. While this may be, Karayaneva pointed out that mortgages secured using crypto are still a burgeoning concept. However, she noted that it&#8217;s possible to get a mortgage through various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and crypto mortgage startups.</p>
<p>This in mind, Jacob explained that LoanSnap works directly with consumers to get a “SMART Loan,” which he described as an improved version of a <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/home-equity-loan-line-credit-pros-cons?utm_source=goog&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=mr_mktg_paid_041223_mortgage_dsa:hi&amp;utm_term=adgrp_articles_146568270885&amp;utm_content=c&amp;mktg_hline=146568270885&amp;mktg_body=655394566731&amp;mktg_place=dsa-2007994209026&amp;mktg_link=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-bmsBhAGEiwAoaQNmj-kp9r3oeBDZ2FN2iadxftZOSkCKG6xbsRC4_PCVlkqKBwT9O3oahoCWH8QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">home equity line of credit, or a HELOC</a>. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Users should first go to the LoanSnap website and enter their name and address. The system will then look through thousands of options to find the best fit. Then one of our dedicated Loan Officers will reach out to discuss each option. If you qualify, then you will get access to the LoanSnap portal where you can upload documents necessary to process your mortgage. The whole process generally takes two weeks or less.”</p></blockquote>
<p>BitPay also offers a feature called “<a href="https://bitpay.com/bill-pay/">Bill Pay</a>” that allows users to make mortgage payments with Bitcoin and other well performing cryptocurrencies. According to BitPay’s blog post, Bill Pay can be used regardless if a loan provider accepts crypto payments.</p>
<p>In addition to these options, John Wingate, chief executive officer and founder of <a href="https://www.banksocial.io/">BankSocial</a> – a financial services company leveraging blockchain technology – told Cryptonews that BankSocial has two products that enable crypto holders to receive loans for large purchases. According to Wingate, BankSocial allows users to sell cryptocurrency directly to the company. The platform can then provide proof-of-funds and a user’s KYC and AML information when it comes to closing funds involving crypto sales.</p>
<p>In addition, Wingate explained that BankSocial offers a “leverage crypto loan,” which allows crypto holders with well performing assets – like Bitcoin or Ethereum – to use these as leverage for a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/nonrecourse-loan-vs-recourse-loan.asp">nonrecourse loan</a>. “For example, we will take your Bitcoin at a 60-70 percent leverage up to five years out and will give you a loan not tied to the asset of the house. That way if your crypto goes up during that time period, you can basically pay off your loan without ever having to sell the crypto,” said Wingate.</p>
<p>Loans and mortgages indeed play an important role for crypto holders wishing to purchase real estate. For instance, Jesse Grushack – a self-employed entrepreneur – told Cryptonews that he has been heavily involved in the blockchain sector since 2011 and that the majority of his money is in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Yet when it came to buying real estate, Grushack shared that he couldn’t obtain a traditional mortgage. Therefore, he looked for other solutions. Grushack said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-use-aave.htm">checked Aave</a> and saw they were offering 2.85 percent loans on ETH. Since I had the collateral, I was able to take out a loan in about 10 minutes, pull out the GUSD stablecoin, and transfer it to my bank within the hour.”</p></blockquote>
<p>While this process was easy enough for Grushack, he explained that the interest rate was dynamic. “When <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gemini-earn-users-face-potential-70-reduction-in-promised-bitcoin-payouts-under-proposed-reorganization-plan.htm">Gemini had issues with earn</a>, the GUSD rate skyrocketed to 78 percent. Just as long as I keep an eye on the collateral and keep my Aave score above 2.5, I can manage 7 percent interest.</p>
<p>While mortgages and loans help crypto holders complete real estate transactions, it’s also noteworthy that home-owners insurance may be available. Karayaneva shared that title insurance is applicable if buyers are closing with a crypto-friendly title company like <a href="https://propy.com/browse/the-worlds-first-blockchain-enabled-title-escrow/">Propy Title and Escrow</a>. Yet she pointed out that comprehensive insurance tailored explicitly for crypto real estate transactions is still in its nascent stages.</p>
<h2><b>Advantages and disadvantages of using crypto to buy a home</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While the notion of buying real estate using cryptocurrency may sound appealing to crypto investors, there are both pros and cons to consider.</p>
<p>For instance, Karayaneva noted that crypto payments enable global accessibility, allowing individuals across the globe to participate in real estate transactions. “This accessibility opens up investment opportunities to a broader global audience,” she said.</p>
<p>Faster transaction time is another major benefit of crypto payments. The use of smart contacts and blockchain technology enables automated processes that would otherwise take days to complete. Karayaneva shared that Propy has conducted NFT transactions that only took a matter of minutes for payment and title transfer processes.</p>
<figure id="attachment_146191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146191" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-146191 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873376-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-56-01.png" alt="" width="640" height="333" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873376-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-56-01.png 640w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873376-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-56-01-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703873376-screen-shot-2023-12-29-at-01-56-01-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-146191" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Propy</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, leveraging blockchain technology for real estate transactions provides security and transparency, as each transaction is publicly recorded on an immutable ledger. According to Karayaneva, this transparency enhances security and reduces the risk of fraud or manipulation, offering a higher level of trust in property ownership records.</p>
<p>Diversification of investments is another good reason to consider buying real estate using cryptocurrency. Real estate may even be considered by some as a more stable investment.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some disadvantages that may come about when deciding to purchase a home using cryptocurrency. The most obvious examples of this would be unwillingness from sellers to accept crypto payments. Price volatility and the daily fluctuations in crypto prices may also be viewed as a drawback. Understanding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-taxes.htm">taxation process</a> could also be complex.</p>
<p>Moreover, regulatory uncertainty around digital assets in the US and other regions of the world will likely impact the process of buying real estate with cryptocurrency. As such, it’s important for potential home buyers to work with licensed crypto-friendly companies and always do their own research.</p>
<h2><b>Embracing a new era in real estate</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Using cryptocurrency to purchase real estate will likely be a growing trend as interest in digital assets continues to increase. Being able to better understand the home buying process is therefore important for crypto investors and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>Moreover, while platforms like Propy, BitPay and Lofty seem to be gaining traction, other options are becoming readily available. For example, a Zillow-like website called “MyEListing.com” launched in April 2023, allowing homebuyers to easily search for real estate options in Texas that can be purchased using cryptocurrency. According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/myelisting-with-help-from-coinbase-commerce-creates-the-worlds-first-place-to-buy-and-sell-us-real-estate-with-crypto-301800932.html">press release</a>, MyEListing partners with Coinbase Commerce, allowing crypto transactions to close within one business day.</p>
<p>Everlodge is also an up and coming decentralized finance (DeFi) marketplace for travel properties. Crypto investors will soon be able to<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-btc-consolidation-boosts-everlodge-eldg-and-injective-inj.htm"> buy fractions of NFTs that represent ownership in properties offered by Everlodge</a>. Although this model is different from buying a home using crypto, the benefits of Everlodge include property ownership, receiving rental income, price appreciation, and more.</p>
<p>All things considered, using cryptocurrency to make home purchases is likely one of the best use cases for well performing cryptocurrencies, along with blockchain technology. To put this in perspective, Chu noted that homebuyers rarely buy real estate from large, centralized companies. Rather, the process is primarily peer-to-peer. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p> “Blockchains excel at trust-less, peer-to-peer transactions of assets and values above anything else, so the two really are a perfect fit. This is probably why you&#8217;re starting to see a proliferation of companies in this space, along with a large amount of interest from crypto holders.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Crypto scams over the years have involved <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/07/how-to-defend-yourself-against-pump-and-dumps/">pump and dump schemes</a>, Ponzi schemes such as OneCoin project led by the notorious CryptoQueen <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/ruja-ignatova/@@download.pdf">Ruja Ignatova,</a> as well as hacks such as Mt Gox, becoming more and more sophisticated.</p>
<p>This article wouldn&#8217;t be complete without the mention of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67281759">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> who was behind the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.</p>
<p>Now the question arises: could any of these scams have been prevented? It seems crypto is still very much a nascent asset class that is known to be relatively high risk and volatile. There are many notable scams that have occurred throughout its history.</p>
<p>Being aware of crypto scams is critically important for protecting oneself. Over the years due to the scams there has been increased regulatory scrutiny and oversight of the digital assets sector, potentially impacting the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It is important for the crypto community to work together to maintain trust and credibility.</p>
<h3><b>The Biggest Crypto Scams</b></h3>
<p>In 2014, one of the earliest scams involved the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox. This is one of the most infamous incidents. Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after claiming to have lost 850,000 Bitcoins (worth over $450 million at that time). This incident significantly impacted the reputation of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Next we have OneCoin – a project that was marketed as a revolutionary cryptocurrency, OneCoin was later revealed to be a Ponzi scheme. OneCoin first began operating in the US in or around 2015. Between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016. Its founders and promoters faced legal actions in various countries, and the scheme defrauded investors of billions of dollars. CryptoQueen Ruja Ignatova who was behind the project still remains a fugitive after disappearing six years ago. Ignatova is on the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/ruja-ignatova/@@download.pdf">FBI’s most wanted list. </a></p>
<p>In 2018, we saw Bitconnect operating as a high-yield investment program, it promised investors outsized returns. However, it was eventually exposed as a Ponzi scheme in 2018, leading to its collapse and significant losses for investors.</p>
<p>In the same year, PlusToken was launched &#8211; dubbed a multi-level marketing cryptocurrency wallet and exchange. It attracted millions of users and allegedly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/01/ringleaders-of-plustoken-scam-jailed-for-up-to-11-years/">defrauded investors</a> out of 14.8 billion yuan ($2.25 billion) worth of cryptocurrency in the eastern province of Jiangsu, China in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2019, QuadrigaCX which was Canada&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, collapsed following the sudden death of its founder, Gerald Cotten. It was later revealed that the exchange had lost access to its cold storage wallets containing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, leaving customers unable to access their funds.</p>
<h3><b>Tether Controversy </b></h3>
<p>Next we have Bitfinex and Tether –  There have been controversies and allegations surrounding the relationship between the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and the stablecoin Tether (USDT). Concerns have arisen regarding the backing of Tether&#8217;s reserves and its impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. In 2021, <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21">the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</a> fined both of the firms more than $42 million on allegations the USDT stablecoin was not fully backed.</p>
<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/do-kwons-usd-1m-bet-doesnt-look-good-as-luna-crashes.htm">collapse of Terraform Labs’ algorithmic stablecoins</a> wiped out $50 billion in valuation. This was the trigger that started the 2022 crypto winter. In May 2022, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-and-terraform-labs-court-filings-to-stay-confidential-prior-to-crypto-fraud-trial.htm">TerraUSD and Luna crashed,</a> taking billions of dollars of investor equity with them. Most recently new details have come to the surface regarding the high-profile crypto fraud case between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Terraform Labs. On December 20, Judge Jed Rakoff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a protective order that will keep material confidential leading up to the trial.</p>
<h3><b>FTX Collapse </b></h3>
<p>In 2023, a high profile scam involving Sam Bankman-Fried who dominated mainstream media headlines. He is responsible for the FTX collapse. Bankman-Fried was charged with stealing as much as $10 billion from FTX customers in order to finance his spending activities which included political contributions.</p>
<p>These are just a handful examples, and the cryptocurrency space has seen numerous other scams and fraudulent activities over the years. Investors should exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and be aware of the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3><b>Recognizing Red Flags</b></h3>
<p>Now the adage applies here – “if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.” So if you encounter any crypto promotion or offer that will make you rich overnight or seems so good it can&#8217;t possibly be true, your instincts will be spot on.</p>
<p>Investors should be aware of major red flags such as unrealistic promises, anonymous teams, lack of transparency, and pressure tactics. Here we talk through these red flags in more detail.</p>
<h3><strong>Question Complex Jargon</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto can be confusing for many but if a crypto project is throwing complex jargon at you – question it – by using overly complex language or technical jargon without clear explanations they may be trying to confuse or mislead potential investors. There is no such thing as stupid question so ask away and interrogate openly.</p>
<p>Next question to ask yourself before investing &#8211;  is there a clear use case for the project? If the project&#8217;s whitepaper lacks a clear use case, technical roadmap, or coherent business model, it may be cause for concern. Run for the hills.</p>
<h3><strong>Learn Super Sleuth Skills</strong></h3>
<p>Become a super sleuth and try to verify information &#8211; so any claims that cannot be verified, such as partnerships with reputable companies or endorsements from well-known individuals without evidence, should be approached with skepticism. Do your due diligence on the founders backing the project.</p>
<p>Question any security concerns –  projects with significant security vulnerabilities, past hacks, or a lack of robust security measures are high-risk.</p>
<p>There are still a number of ponzi or pyramid schemes out there in the market – any projects that rely on new investors&#8217; funds to pay existing investors, rather than generating legitimate returns from a sustainable business model, are classic red flags.</p>
<p>Question the project  if it promises unrealistic token distribution – this is when projects allocate a disproportionate amount of tokens to the team or founders, or have unclear token distribution mechanisms, then you may be right to suspect.</p>
<p>When online look for reviews – any negative reviews, reports of suspicious activities, or warnings from trusted community members and experts can indicate potential issues with a project.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s essential to conduct thorough due diligence, research the project and team, seek independent opinions, and consult trusted sources or advisors before investing in any cryptocurrency or participating in a crypto project.</p>
<p>Make sure you &#8220;DYOR&#8221; which is another popular term and stands for Do Your Own Research. This is a  common phrase used by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts.</p>
<h3><b>Protecting Yourself From Crypto Investments</b></h3>
<p>Understanding common scams and fraudulent tactics can educate newcomers and seasoned investors alike, fostering a more informed and resilient community. Large-scale scams such as FTX collapse can have broader economic implications, affecting market dynamics, investor sentiment, and the overall growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>It is important to do your research especially when it comes to any exchange before you buy crypto and look into cryptocurrencies before investing. Understand the level of risk you can take.</p>
<p>Please remain vigilant, share this guide with your network, and actively contribute to fostering a safer cryptocurrency community.</p>

<p>Popular cybersecurity company <a href="https://surfshark.com/about-us"><strong>Surfshark</strong></a> recently analyzed the 15 most popular crypto apps to find out how much data each collects. They found that nine of these use collected data to track their users. But it’s not just how much data is collected, but how it’s managed, Lead Researcher Agneska Sablovskaja told <em>Cryptonews</em>. She added that the company was particularly surprised by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-to-list-10-usdc-trading-pairs-on-its-spot-market-heres-more.htm"><strong>Binance</strong></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binanceus-launches-enhanced-usd-on-ramps-buy-sell-crypto-using-usdt.htm"><strong>Binance.US</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what the experts found.</p>
<h2>Data Privacy is Key in Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per Surfshark’s Sablovskaja, “data privacy stands as a cornerstone of trust, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrency. Our study reveals the data collection practices of leading crypto applications, aiming to foster vigilance and informed usage among individuals navigating these sensitive digital territories.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company selected 15 apps, with the most downloads in 2023 in Western countries, from the <strong>AppMagic</strong> platform.</p>
<p>The team collected data from each app&#8217;s <strong>Apple App Store</strong> page on November 7, 2023. Each page provides a list of 32 unique data points grouped into 12 categories. They initially <a href="https://surfshark.com/research/chart/crypto-apps-data-collection">published the report</a> on November 14.</p>
<p>However, talking with <em>Cryptonews</em>, the team re-checked the data this week, confirming that “all analyzed apps collect the same amount and types of data.”</p>
<p>Also, all analyzed crypto apps are still in the top 15 in Western countries.</p>
<p>The article notes a couple of differences that do exist below.</p>
<h2>The Most Data-Gobbling Crypto Apps</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Among the 15 popular crypto apps, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/robinhoods-crypto-revenue-hits-lowest-in-3-years-but-still-expands-crypto-operations-more-news.htm"><strong>Robinhood</strong></a> “stands out as the most data-hungry,” the report found. It collected 25 out of 32 possible user data points in November.</p>
<p>However, a difference found this week compared to November is that Robinhood now uses the data point &#8220;Device ID&#8221; to track the user. Per Surfshark,</p>
<blockquote><p>“This means that nine of the [fifteen] apps, not eight, use collected data to track the user.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The second data-hungriest app is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-com-gains-key-uk-regulatory-approval-as-electronic-money-institution.htm"><strong>Crypto.com</strong></a>. It collects 20 data points.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-says-an-anti-crypto-stance-is-a-bad-political-strategy-ahead-of-2024.htm"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a> follows with 18 data points.</p>
<figure id="attachment_145570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145570" style="width: 1168px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://infogram.com/robinhood-collects-the-most-user-data-while-trust-the-least-2023-1hmr6g7qvw0vo6n"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-145570" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703702282-robinhood_collects_the_most_user_data_while_trust__the_least_2023.jpg" alt="" width="1168" height="707" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703702282-robinhood_collects_the_most_user_data_while_trust__the_least_2023.jpg 1168w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703702282-robinhood_collects_the_most_user_data_while_trust__the_least_2023-300x182.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703702282-robinhood_collects_the_most_user_data_while_trust__the_least_2023-1024x620.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703702282-robinhood_collects_the_most_user_data_while_trust__the_least_2023-768x465.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703702282-robinhood_collects_the_most_user_data_while_trust__the_least_2023-150x91.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-145570" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Surfshark</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, some apps are more privacy-oriented, Surfshark found. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/okx-and-bybit-capitalize-as-binances-market-share-declines-more-news.htm"><strong>Bybit</strong></a> and Binance gather four data points each.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Trust</strong> collects only one out of the 32.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 10 of the 15 analyzed apps collect data linked to users’ identities. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm"><strong>Kraken</strong></a>, the report highlighted, collects 11 unique data points. Ten are linked to the user, including financial information, photos or videos, and product interaction data.</p>
<p>However, the main issue, argues the cybersecurity company, goes beyond the volume of data collected – it’s how that data is managed.</p>
<p>Previously eight – but with Robinhood, it’s now nine – of these top apps use collected data to track users. This can be done by sharing user data with third-party advertisers or data brokers.</p>
<p>Binance.US is at the top of the list here. In November, it used almost two-thirds of collected user data for tracking purposes. In comparison, Binance used only one data point to track its users.</p>
<h2>Binance Was a Surprising Case</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Speaking of Binance, Surfshark highlighted Binance.US as an interesting case. Sablovskaja told <em>Cryptonews</em> that “Binance brought some surprising findings.”</p>
<p>In November, the US-focused application was collecting four times more data than its global sister app Binance.</p>
<p>Binance.US collects 17 data points, compared to just four collected by Binance. And this is despite the fact that Binance.US has fewer features than the global version.</p>
<p>Binance.US also leads in data tracking among the 15 apps — it uses almost two-thirds of the data it collects for tracking purposes. This means that it’s likely shared with third-party advertisers or data brokers, the Lead Researcher said.</p>
<p>Per the report,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Binance seems to be more anonymous as it does not collect any contact information, whereas Binance.US collects it all — name, email address, phone number, and physical address.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But this is where the final difference since November appears, showcasing the changes in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In November, the global Binance app was still available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/binance-buy-bitcoin-crypto/id1436799971">US App Store</a>. But at the rechecking time, the team couldn’t find the page. “At the moment, it seems like this page does not exist anymore,” Surfshark said.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/top-charts/apps?tag=243575&amp;country=US&amp;store=2">AppMagic data</a>, in December, the global Binance app was not on the list of most downloaded apps in the US, even though in <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/top-charts/apps?tag=243575&amp;country=US&amp;store=2&amp;date=2023-11-01">November, it ranked 5th</a>, the company told <em>Cryptonews</em>.</p>
<p>Notably, <strong>Binance Holdings</strong>, its US affiliates, and founder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhaos-wealth-surged-by-25-billion-despite-legal-troubles-in-2023.htm">Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao</a> have been in scolding hot regulatory waters in a number of countries for months.</p>
<p>Specifically in the US, the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm">charged</a> all three earlier this year for multiple offenses, including “blatant disregard of the federal securities laws.”</p>
<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange and its founder were accused of “engaging in multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities and other investment schemes.”</p>
<p>Then, in late November, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Binance and CZ pleaded guilty</a> to violating US anti-money laundering laws in a $4.3 billion settlement with the <strong>US Justice Department</strong>, <strong>Treasury</strong>, and <strong>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</strong> (CFTC).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SEC has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cz-not-off-the-hook-as-sec-continues-binance-us-investigation.htm">continued investigating</a> Binance.US and CZ.</p>
<h2>Some Data Collection Is Necessary, But…</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Sablovskaja told <em>Cryptonews</em> that data collection might be necessary for the proper functioning of the app or compliance with local laws.</p>
<blockquote><p>“However, users should keep an eye out for apps that collect much more data than alternative apps, especially if this data is linked to the user and used for tracking purposes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She continued. Even if these apps have legitimate justifications for data collection and tracking, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/robinhood-data-breach/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9zdXJmc2hhcmsuY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKHCfbYd0y_HGbB8aNBG9S7JDzDt92SgjgzOT1GbPxQSDNKUNuBzqc4j8fWDYda7eXWmbsIgfzM20WYu9r75DM-y4Or-Kbjxw1OlaXiN8ZnPiy20If2A9GHj1OVr7kRsYlgZ1oTeLoMA5ccifoTzgAl5FNdduZEOUnaL-Sv2TIef">Robinhood’s 2021 data breach</a> and the US <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2023/11/08/kraken-to-release-account-data-for-certain-crypto-clients-to-irs/?sh=7bc518cc26d6">IRS’s request to Kraken</a> to disclose user data show that there’s no guarantee that the data shared with crypto apps will remain out of reach to third – and sometimes malicious – parties.</p>
<p>Notably, some apps are committed to upholding maximum user privacy, Sablovskaja opined. She highlighted Trust, saying that it collects just one data point (diagnostics) and does not use this data to track its users.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the best way for users to protect themselves and their privacy is by educating themselves on the data collection practices of the apps they use, the expert stated.</p>
