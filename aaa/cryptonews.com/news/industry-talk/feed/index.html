<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Domain registry company NJAL.LA aka ‘Njalla’ has be cast into the spotlight of cryptocurrency for their finessing of Mollars.com from the “Mollars Cryptocurrency Project.”   Now relocated to Mollars.CC, the project’s original domain shut down abruptly with no explanation.   The strange event worried some crypto investors, but a PSA was issued to clarify the issue.</p>
<p>Via twitter today, an answer to all those questioning what happened was shared <a href="https://twitter.com/mollarstoken/status/1753938447645991161?s=46&amp;t=1YWjgqonygeHG2g50IAGZg">via X (formerly twitter</a>).</p>
<h3>Why Mollars.com Switched to Mollars.CC</h3>
<p>“http://Mollars.com, the domain, was hijacked from us by a rogue domain registry service that has in their T&amp;C they actually own our domain.    We are fighting to get the domain back but until then, we&#8217;re focused on building http://Mollars.cc  as our new domain brand.”</p>
<p>This was only a part of the full tweet but after seeing this, the obvious thing for traders to do is research who is NJALLA domain registry and are they legit.    In a quick search of the company with the word scam or “Njal.la stealing domains,&#8221; the search results are shocking.</p>
<p>Apparently the ‘decentralized-like’ domain registry isn’t a registry at all, though they maintain the shell appearance of one.   Instead, the company buys domains for clients and puts it in their own name, retaining ownership of their domains without them knowing.</p>
<p>Unless however a client happens to read the ‘about us’ page — which really has nothing to do with the buying process typically.  On Njalla’s about us page the company explains &amp; virtually protects themselves against lawsuits without making it clear who owns the domain:</p>
<p>“For instance, when you register a domain name in our system, we can register with our own data. We will be the actual registrant of the domain &#8212; it&#8217;s not an ownership by proxy as found with all other providers. However, you will still have full control over the domain name. You can either use our information (and our nameservers) or you can go with your custom data. And you can move at any time. Simple, flexible.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slick description of the company, which is not made clear on the sales page to customers, has put the Mollars.com domain in jeopardy.   And not just Mollars, but hundreds of others are complaining about the company on SEO forums, <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/njal.la">TrustPilot</a>, and reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=njal.la">see here</a>) alike.</p>
<h3>Who Owns NJAL.LA?</h3>
<p>It’s also been discovered by some recently, the founder and owner of the company is none other than Peter Sunde. If you are unfamiliar with the name, he’s the co-founder of the scrupulous internet site, Pirate Bay.  Another project with a jaded past.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency supporters of the Mollars project however may be the biggest rival to the company they&#8217;ve ever faced.  Thousands of Investors can lose a small percentage of potential ROI gains from the loss of the domain.  A ‘.com’ tends to be viewed as more trustworthy than something like Mollars.CC, though ‘CC’ is more descriptive of Cryptocurrency.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mollars.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148851" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704768853-mollars-token-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="63" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704768853-mollars-token-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704768853-mollars-token-banner-300x37.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704768853-mollars-token-banner-150x18.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Presale investors may not be swayed, but generally no investor wants to see an entity <b><i>try</i></b> to put blemish on a ‘diamond gem’ they’ve found, no matter what the case.</p>
<h3>Investors Money Can’t Be Stolen from Mollars Token Presale Wallet</h3>
<p>As for the nearly half-a-million dollars raised thus far for the $MOLLARS token project, all investments are still secured. In the tweet made earlier today by Mollars developers, it was made very clear all investors’ funds remain unbothered by the Domain debacle.</p>
<p>“All funds are 100% safe. This event has done /does no harm to the actual token project nor the money contributed in the token presale,&#8221; reads a second line from the tweet.</p>
<p>The inexperienced may not realize how token presale funds are stored, but it’s not on the actual domain itself.  All cryptocurrency, even from Initial coin offerings, is stored in a crypto wallet who has a special key to access it.   Alongside that wallet key, the smart contract used to bridge payments, adds security to ensure funds go to the right place.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay &amp; Njal.la founder cannot access Mollars funds by stealing the Mollars.com domain.</p>
<h3>Why is Njal.la &amp; Peter Sunde stealing domains?</h3>
<p>The reason for stealing so many domains from clients is probably some sort of back-end profit to domain hijackers.   Once a domain’s brand has become big enough to generate hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars via type-in and SERPS, it has massive value.    Domains like Mollars.com can be resold on the black-market for massive amounts of money.</p>
<p>In highly competitive niches like cryptocurrency, Peter Sunde &amp; company could also profit by taking back-door payments from rival brands.    A 5-figure payment to ‘snipe’ a competitor’s domain is a lucrative business for a ‘fake domain registry’ company.</p>
<h2>Where to Buy Mollars Now?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Regardless, investors can visit <a href="http://www.mollars.cc">www.Mollars.cc</a> for the latest updates on the Bitcoin-alternative’s token presale.    The original domain may be returned to the creator of the Mollars’ token project in the future.</p>
<p>To date the $MOLLARS ICO has raised nearly $520,000 (USD) and is on track to selling all 4-million tokens of the available presale supply by the end of this month.</p>

<p>With blue-chip cryptocurrency markets choppy on Friday following the release of a bumper US jobs reports that saw macro traders pare back on Fed rate cut bets, Oasis Network (ROSE), Pendle (PENDLE) and Flare (FLR) are the best performers, making them the likely best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-whipsaws-around-43k-after-blockbuster-us-jobs-report-where-next-for-btc.htm">Bitcoin (BTC) swung either side of $43,000</a> while Ether (ETH) chopped either side of $2,300 on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders paring Fed rate cuts bets is a headwind for liquidity-sensitive assets like crypto.</p>
<p>But at the same time, net flows into recently launched spot Bitcoin ETFs are turning decisively positive.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-holds-3-billion-in-btc.htm">BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) hit $3 billion</a> in assets under management (AUM) on Friday, indicative of strong BTC demand.</p>
<p>As a result, neither the bulls nor bears were able to take control of blue-chip markets on Friday.</p>
<p>But looking elsewhere across the altcoin market, some smaller names are enjoying big gains.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best-performing altcoins on Friday, which could be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Oasis Network (ROSE)</strong></h3>
<p>Privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain Oasis Network (ROSE) is up around 13% in 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The price pump comes following a breakout above a downtrend that has been in play since late December 2023.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160986" style="width: 814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160986" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032.png" alt="Big potential gains make ROSE potentiall the best crypto to buy" width="814" height="708" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032.png 814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032-300x261.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032-768x668.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032-150x130.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160986" class="wp-caption-text">Big potential gains make ROSE potentially the best crypto to buy / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Technical analysis now suggests a strong likelihood of a near-term retest of resistance near $0.15.</p>
<p>That could mean quick 30% gains, with Oasis Network last around $0.115.</p>
<p>That potentially makes ROSE the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Pendle (PENDLE)</strong></h3>
<p>Pendle (PENDLE), an innovative future yield tokenization and trading protocol, punched to fresh all-time highs near $3 on Friday.</p>
<p>PENDLE is up nearly 6x from last summer’s lows under $0.50.</p>
<p>Its rally from its 2022 lows is even more impressive at over 80x.</p>
<p>But as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pendle/">CoinMarketCap</a>, which clocks PENDLE’s 24-hour gains at around 12%, its market cap remains modest at $686 million.</p>
<p>That leaves plenty of room for 10x or more gains as the asset tokenization narrative gains ground.</p>
<p>That potentially makes PENDLE one of the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Flare (FLR)</strong></h3>
<p>Data-focused layer-1 blockchain Flare (FLR) pumped up 11% in the last 24 hours, making it one of the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flare/">FLR</a> was last just under $0.025 after hitting its highest levels since May 2023.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency just broke key resistance at $0.2430, opening the door to swift gains into the $0.30s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160987" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016.png" alt="" width="817" height="708" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016.png 817w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016-300x260.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016-768x666.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016-150x130.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains.</p>
<p>But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With blue-chip cryptocurrency markets choppy on Friday following the release of a bumper US jobs reports that saw macro traders pare back on Fed rate cut bets, $DORK, $GME and $BEBE are the biggest crypto gainers today on decentralized exchange Uniswap.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-whipsaws-around-43k-after-blockbuster-us-jobs-report-where-next-for-btc.htm">Bitcoin (BTC) swung either side of $43,000</a> while Ether (ETH) chopped either side of $2,300 on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders paring Fed rate cuts bets is a headwind for liquidity sensitive assets like crypto.</p>
<p>But at the same time, net flows into recently launched spot Bitcoin ETFs are turning decisively positive.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-holds-3-billion-in-btc.htm">BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) hit $3 billion</a> in assets under management (AUM) on Friday, indicative of strong BTC demand.</p>
<p>As a result, neither the bulls nor bears were able to take control of blue-chip markets on Friday.</p>
<p>However, some number of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/5-small-cap-crypto-coins-to-accumulate-before-the-bitcoin-halving-in-2024.htm">small-cap cryptocurrencies</a> are almost always pumping and nearly always also take the mantle for the biggest crypto gainers each day.</p>
<p>That’s because their low level of liquidity means that relatively small buy pressure can easily result in fast exponential gains.</p>
<p>While blue-chip cryptocurrencies can offer good upside prospects, traders looking to make quick profits usually turn to low-cap markets.</p>
<p>That being said, here are some of the biggest crypto gainers today on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">web3’s</a> best-known decentralized exchange (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex.htm">DEX</a>) <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Biggest Crypto Gainers Today on Uniswap</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Dork ($DORK)</strong></h3>
<p>An Andrew Tate-themed shitcoin called Dork ($DORK) takes the spot of biggest crypto gainer today on <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0xae3359ed3c567482fb0102c584c23daa2693eacf">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>It was last up over 540% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>$DORK’s market cap was last around $4 million.</p>
<p>That’s according to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x537b8afa3d302e5c873922de7014d714f050af51?t=1706911593783">DEXTools</a>, which puts the token liquidity at around $825,000 with over 7,100 holders.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools’ security audit, the token has four concerning aspects to its smart contract.</p>
<h3><strong>DumbMoney ($GME)</strong></h3>
<p>A new meme coin called DumbMoney ($GME) has been pumping to fresh record highs in recent days.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x8e3fa615392688ddd9bf8f25d1f8dc744ac1a12c%5d">Uniswap</a>, it was last up around 50% in 24 hours.</p>
<p>That makes it one of the biggest crypto gainers today, with its market cap last around $2.2 million, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xde9155ff27223211e0923b41b009af1aebade709?t=1706911710595">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The token has nearly $150,000 in locked liquidity, reducing rug pull risk.</p>
<p>It also has three smart contract alerts.</p>
<h3><strong>BEBE ($BEBE)</strong></h3>
<p>Another shitcoin called BEBE ($BEBE) was enjoying an impressive 35% pump on Friday, making it one of the biggest crypto gainers today on <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0xec21890967a8ceb3e55a3f79dac4e90673ba3c2e">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xe6da0cbaedc5e1d0490ec2cda283b8d7f007319e?t=1706911842239">DEXTools</a>, the token’s market cap was last around $590,000, with around $108,000 in locked liquidity.</p>

<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Low-cap coins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>For those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023:</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Monday, August 7, 2023</em> – Mega Dice Casino is all in on crypto, expanding its listing of token accepted on the platform with 14 new coins, including BONK and PEPE.</p>
<p dir="auto">More coins accepted means more users for the fast-growing casino that has already made a name for itself as one of the top Telegram crypto casinos.</p>
<p dir="auto">Originally <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice Casino</a> boasted an impressive roster of 13 coins, including the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. Now, with another 14 added to the mix, the total comes up to 27, helping to cement Mega Dice among the first rank of crypto casinos.</p>
<p dir="auto">New additions to the Mega Dice token line-up are:</p>
<table style="height: 313px" width="376">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Bonk</td>
<td>DAI</td>
<td>Uniswap</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PEPE</td>
<td>Avalanche</td>
<td>Cronos</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tamadoge</td>
<td>Chainlink</td>
<td>EOS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Floki</td>
<td>Polygon</td>
<td>ApeCoin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shiba Inu</td>
<td>Polkadot</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">Those tokens join the original 13, which were: BCH, DOGE, USDT, BTC, SOL, TFG, XRP, BNB, ETH, LTC, USDC, TRX, and ADA.</p>
<p dir="auto">Adding new coins is not simply a matter of enhancing the convenience for users of the platform, who may have an array of available coins they may wish to use to deposit into the casino and sportsbook. Each new coin listing is like putting a key in the access door to onboard potentially tens of thousands more players that hold one of the many listed digital assets.</p>
<p dir="auto">In particular, the availability of hot trending coins, such as BONK or PEPE, makes Mega Dice a much more attractive gaming venue for holders of those tokens.</p>
<p dir="auto">Take BONK for instance. According to data on the decentralized exchange trading site DEXTools, BONK has 618k holders of the Solana-based token.</p>
<p dir="auto">Earlier buyers of BONK that held their coin will have missed out on the gain at the top of the market but are still sitting on an ROI in excess of 2,000%. That means there are many well-heeled BONK millionaires out there who will be looking to deploy their investment winnings to see if they can translate that winning streak to the Mega Dice casino and sportsbook.</p>
<p dir="auto">PEPE has 154,000 holders on DEXs, which of course, like with other tokens, doesn’t capture the holdings data on centralized exchanges.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Transfer crypto from your wallet and earn a 200% deposit bonus</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">All new depositors receive a 200% deposit bonus up to 1 BTC. To qualify for the bonus, you must deposit crypto valued at a minimum of 20 USD, EUR, or GBP.</p>
<p dir="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160977" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2.png" alt="" width="1600" height="841" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-300x158.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-1024x538.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-768x404.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-1536x807.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p dir="auto">Although the mobile and desktop versions of Mega Dice let you deposit regular money using payment methods including Wire transfer, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, for the moment the standalone Telegram experience is crypto-only.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice</a> also provides instant withdrawals, subject to terms and conditions, so you can always quickly access your winnings.</p>
<p dir="auto">The platform has an impressive collection of 6,000 games, covering offerings from all the top providers in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p dir="auto">The wide choice includes live dealer games, and favorites such as slots and table games, featuring poker, roulette, and all the other classics. There are also a host of specialty games to choose from, such as scratch cards, virtuals sports, video poker, bingo, and lucky numbers draw game Keno.</p>
<p dir="auto">Transfer your crypto funds from one of your existing wallets to the addresses created for you on Mega Dice, and you can immediately start playing thousands upon thousands of different games.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition to popular slots such as Gates of Olympus, Wanted Dead or Alive, and classic Novomatic titles such as Book of Ra, there’s a strong selection of live casino games by leading providers like Evolution Gaming and crypto fan favorites Plinko and Aviator by Spribe</p>
<p dir="auto">At Mega Dice, there really is something for everyone.</p>
<p dir="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160978" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3.jpg" alt="" width="845" height="1600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3.jpg 845w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-158x300.jpg 158w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-541x1024.jpg 541w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-768x1454.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-811x1536.jpg 811w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-150x284.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">And if you enjoy what you see and play, why not invite a friend? Each new customer you refer receives a 10% commission on all invited players’ wagers. Referral income is paid out monthly in USDT.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current champion referrer according to data shared on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice Casino</a> Telegram account is someone with the handle @ruso779673 who has tallied up a grand total of 1,076 referrals, earning themselves an additional $200 reward on top of the regular 10% commission.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Mega Dice business was launched in late 2023 and is owned and operated by MIBS B.V., which has a Master Gaming License issued by the Governor of Curacao.</p>
<p dir="auto">The gaming platform complies with all EU anti-money laundering rules. It also subscribes to Responsible Gambling good practice.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Mega Dice is leading the way on Telegram where it targets 700 million increasingly crypto-savvy users</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">In a breakthrough for crypto casino adoption, Mega Dice, in addition to being available on desktop and mobile, is leading the way by opening the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible on the Telegram app.</p>
<p dir="auto">Crypto casinos are a big business and soaring in popularity because of the use of blockchain tech to implement unique transparency and trust features. Mega Dice Casino is helping to create a new standard for measuring fairness in the industry, online and offline.</p>
<p dir="auto">The largest crypto casino in the world is thought to be Stake.com, with revenue in 2022 estimated at $2.6 billion, according to a recent report.</p>
<p dir="auto">With its market-beating offering, Mega Dice casino on <a href="https://t.me/megadicecasinobot">Telegram</a> is not just snapping at the heels of Stake.com; it is outdoing it as one of the leaders in the newest forum for targeting the gambling audience.</p>
<p dir="auto">Telegram was estimated to have around 700 million active users in 2022. It has become immensely popular in the crypto community because of its superior feature set compared to the likes of WhatsApp.</p>
<p dir="auto">With Telegram, developers can program bots to execute processes initiated by users sending text-based commands, prefaced by a forward slash.</p>
<p dir="auto">But with Mega Dice, you don&#8217;t even need to know the commands, as everything is accessible with the click of a button.</p>
<p dir="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160979" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4.png" alt="" width="1592" height="1272" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4.png 1592w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-300x240.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-1024x818.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-768x614.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-1536x1227.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-150x120.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1592px) 100vw, 1592px" /></p>
<h2 dir="auto">Onboarding to Mega Dice Casino is a breeze</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">The ease of use of Telegram bots is why the platform is already a favorite among the crypto community, making Mega Dice Casino a rising star.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mega Dice on Telegram means no KYC. Because Telegram users verify account uniqueness through their telephone number, onboarding to use Mega Dice on Telegram couldn’t be smoother.</p>
<p dir="auto">A Telegram account is all you need to get up and running with Mega Dice.</p>
<p dir="auto">Simply go to <a href="https://t.me/megadicecasinobot" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://t.me/megadicecasinobot&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1706995367098000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ARaE0fmDxbnBSVyvl1GJn">https://t.me/megadicecasinobot</a>, click ‘start’, and it opens a connection to the web app where you can deposit Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, or Dogecoin into the wallet addresses created for each deposit currency.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Friday, February 2nd, 2024</em> – Meme Kombat ($MK) has raised nearly $8 million for its battling iGaming ecosystem, which will see meme characters go toe-to-toe in its battling arena.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Web3 gaming platform is a first-of-its-kind offering as far as meme battling goes. But the innovation doesn’t stop there. Meme Kombat will also enable players to wager on the outcome of the bouts, in a novel twist that is already proving that it appeals to a wide crypto audience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat</a> has a hard cap target of $10 million, which explains why the fundraising is picking up such a strong head of steam at this juncture. In the last stage of the presale, contributors are now in a race against time to secure their stake in the future of crypto gaming.</p>
<p dir="auto">Native token $MK is on sale at the cheap price of $0.279 as the ICO approaches the finishing line. The rate at which funds have been amassed has grown at a rate of more than 2,500% over the past eight weeks alone.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/a-guide-to-igaming-and-high-risk-dapps-5254.htm">iGaming</a>, wagering and meme coins constitute a triumvirate of perhaps the most closely watched and lucrative sectors of the crypto industry.</p>
<p dir="auto">Helping to encourage contributions is news from the Meme Kombat team, promising a forthcoming $25k giveaway – not that any further encouragement is required judging by the way fundraising is powering ahead.</p>

<p dir="auto">Meme Kombat allows token holders to deposit their tokens in order to take part in the battling and wagering. From their activity on the platform, players can secure various rewards in addition to their winnings from wagering on the outcome of the meme character fights.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is nothing else quite like Meme Kombat on the market today, which is no doubt its core appeal to the ICO’s contributors. The project will launch with an 11-character Season 1, to be followed up with Season 2 at a later date.</p>

<p dir="auto">Meme Kombat’s Season 1 will be available after the presale is sold out and the project is launched. There are 11 meme characters you can battle with in Season 1: Milady, Baby Doge, Doge, Floki, Kishu, Mong, Pepe, Pepe2, Shiba, Sponge and Wojak.</p>
<p dir="auto">Season 2 meme characters will be out just before Season 1 wraps up. But the story doesn’t end there for Meme Kombat. There are ambitious plans in the works, as hinted at in its marketing materials.</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, according to the Meme Kombat website, “the project has plans for further expansion, potentially adding new game modes, partnerships, and other exciting developments.”</p>

<h2 dir="auto">How Meme Kombat is the perfect fit for crypto enthusiasts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">Meme coins continue to attract buyers who clearly are sold on its vision, and in particular the potential of a decentralized application that could have wide appeal across the multi-billion dollar meme coin space and beyond.</p>
<p dir="auto">Increasingly, crypto investors are homing in on projects with real-world use cases that can attract a large and engaged customer base – Meme Kombat does exactly that. To reiterate, the project targets three of the hottest segments in crypto: gaming, betting and meme coins.</p>
<p dir="auto">Data from listings site CoinGecko values the GameFi sector in market cap terms at $20.7 billion. Another key metric shows that gambling tokens are valued at circa $700 million and growing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Meanwhile, CoinGecko estimates the worth of the meme coins sector at around $20 billion. Meme Kombat has the perfect market fit for this total addressable market that can be measured in tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pick your winner. This would be a fierce battle<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2694.png" alt="⚔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/dk0ZKzD7LL">pic.twitter.com/dk0ZKzD7LL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) <a href="https://twitter.com/Meme_Kombat/status/1752904512631677106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="auto">Meme Kombat’s total token supply is 120,000,000, of which thirty percent is allocated for staking and battle rewards, 10 percent for community rewards, and ten percent for decentralized exchange liquidity. Fifty percent of the total token supply is on sale in the ICO.</p>
<p dir="auto">Prospective contributors to the presale will be comforted to hear that Meme Kombat’s smart contract is fully security audited and no major issues have been detected.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another thing Meme Kombat has going for it is the quality of its art, as shown on its social media properties. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">Meme coins</a> live and die by the vibrancy of their communities – irreverent humor and engaging artwork are key parts of making that pitch to new community members.</p>
<p dir="auto">All the signs indicate that the project’s polished and professional team of designers (and developers) has got a handle on the meme zeitgeist, as you can see from the X postings above.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ultimately then, Meme Kombat is in the enviable position of appealing to all types of meme coin communities. So whether followers of Pepe, Shiba Inu or Sponge, there’s something for everyone at Meme Kombat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the price of Binance Coin (BNB) continues recovering from the recent low of $298, crypto traders have turned their attention to accumulating one new BEP-20 token ahead of its launch. eTuktuk, a green crypto startup building eco-friendly electric vehicle infrastructure in developing countries, has caught traders’ interest thanks to its ongoing presale momentum.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/surge-in-bnb-chain-activity-backs-11-rally-but-can-bnb-push-above-300">Binance Smart Chain activity reviving</a> alongside BNB’s price uptick, eTuktuk’s native BEP-20 token TUK could be a savvy investment opportunity. The presale provides an opportunity for investors to acquire TUK at $0.026 per token currently.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk">Visit eTukTuk Here</a></strong></p>
<h2>Decentralized Platform For Sustainable Electric Tuk-Tuks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
eTuktuk&#8217;s goal is to transform urban transportation in regions where <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/assets/users/kirchstetter/Apte%20et%20al%2C%20Particles%20in%20Auto-Rickshaw%20Exhaust%2C%20Atm%20Env%202011.pdf">polluting gas-guzzling auto rickshaws</a> known as tuk-tuks dominate the streets. These infamous three-wheeled taxis running on dirty two-stroke engines contribute immensely to air pollution and carbon emissions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>eTuktuk proposes replacing conventional tuk-tuks with locally manufactured electric models powered sustainably through solar-charged EV stations. This infrastructure will allow drivers to operate eco-friendly vehicles while earning income by providing riders with affordable zero-emission transportation.</p>
<p>The startup will also tap into the benefits of decentralization, transparency, security, and reduced fees by incorporating blockchain technology and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a> to optimize coordination and payments between EV suppliers, drivers, and riders in a sharing economy framework.</p>
<h2>BEP-20 Token TUK Rewards Up To 300% APY</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A key part of eTuktuk’s ecosystem is its BEP-20 token TUK which will enable various functions like EV reservations, ride-hailing, and frictionless payments on the platform. TUK will work as a utility token for transacting between drivers and riders.</p>
<p>Additionally, TUK holders will be able to earn staking rewards of up to 300% APY by staking their holdings, potentially adding to the appeal for accumulating and holding TUK long-term.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="eTukTuk Powering the Future of Electric Vehicles - New 10x Potential Cryptocurrency?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8gjq8Vum9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In recent days, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/">the BNB price</a> has shown signs of recovering after steep declines in the broader crypto market sell-offs since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. As the native currency of Binance Smart Chain picks up, BEP-20 tokens launching on the network like TUK stand to benefit.</p>
<p>As the presale approaches its $850,000 target raise, the chance to acquire TUK at the current $0.026 price point is closing quickly. Once the target is hit, the next launch phase will commence and see an increased TUK price per the project’s outlined schedule.</p>
<p>Traders looking to diversify into an eco-friendly BEP-20 utility token with pronounced real-world use cases are indicating that TUK could be one of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-altcoins.htm">the best altcoins to buy</a> now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LAMBO has become the latest Solana meme coin to enjoy a massive listing on the Raydium DEX this week, with its price experiencing a 1000x surge yesterday.</p>
<p>However, as is usually <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-memecoins-continue-freefall-of-over-70-after-december-boom.htm">the case with most Solana meme tokens</a>, LAMBO has since corrected heavily, with <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/BnY6hivjcCQXFyD7DBB4w4DdmJ6j6tNZCF3JUHf2tFDS?t=1706874534819">its price currently down by 52%</a> in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Such a reduction doesn&#8217;t bode well for the token&#8217;s future, and with other new coins offering stronger fundamentals and more utility, most traders will probably prefer to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Indeed, one new altcoin gaining lots of momentum right now is Sponge (SPONGE), which is in the process of launching the second version of its token, with millions already staked in it.</p>
<h2>Latest Solana Meme Coin &#8216;LAMBO&#8217; Pumps Up 1000x in 24 Hours</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The name may change, but the pattern remains more or less identical, with LAMBO pumping heavily on the day of its listing.</p>
<p>Of course, it has since declined very steadily, and despite a brief recovery earlier this morning, now seems to be heading downwards in a linear fashion.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160644" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160644" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160644" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875015-solana-meme-coin-lambo-price-chart.png" alt="Solana meme coin LAMBO price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875015-solana-meme-coin-lambo-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875015-solana-meme-coin-lambo-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875015-solana-meme-coin-lambo-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875015-solana-meme-coin-lambo-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875015-solana-meme-coin-lambo-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875015-solana-meme-coin-lambo-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875015-solana-meme-coin-lambo-price-chart-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160644" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>As with pretty much every other miniscule-cap Solana meme token, LAMBO&#8217;s trading volume has all-but disappeared.</p>
<p>It therefore has really no where else to go but down, with its low volume and liquidity exposing it dangerously to further dumps.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It also seems that Crypto Twitter has ceased hyping it up already, with the most recent tweets dating to yesterday.</p>
<p>As such, most traders would do well to avoid LAMBO at all costs, despite what they may hear about Solana meme coins.</p>
<h2>This Low Cap Gem Might Be Next</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The big issue with LAMBO is that, like many Solana meme coins, it lacks the fundamentals and utility to prevent a terminal decline after its initial surge.</p>
<p>For this reason, traders should probably seek out newer coins with some kind of use case, as well as with a genuine following and online community.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/sponge">Sponge (SPONGE)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency first listed – and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sponge-best-crypto-buy-today-new-meme-coin-spongebob-might-100x-1.htm">boomed</a> – </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">on major exchanges in April 2023.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very close to launching the second version of its token, <span style="font-size: medium;">SPONGE V2, with the current </span>version<span style="font-size: medium;"> being discontinued on Monday February 5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The main rationale for the update is that Sponge V2 will feature a revamped and more profitable staking model, while it will also serve as the native token of a play-to-earn racing game.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The new P2E game will provide players with the opportunity to compete with each other and rank on a global leaderboard, with the most successful players receive SPONGE tokens as a reward.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more bullishly, the token&#8217;s new staking model will provide bigger rewards.</p>
<p>Its APY currently stands at 245%, but this can rise even higher depending on how many tokens users stake and for how long.</p>
<p>Claiming the second version of SPONGE is easy: holders of SPONGE V1 can go to <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/sponge">the official Sponge website</a> and stake their old tokens, while those without any SPONGE V1 can simply buy the newer coin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jupiter <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/JUPUSDT">has gained by 6.5%</a> in the past 24 hours, with the JUP price rising to $0.6265 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole gains by 2% today.</p>
<p>Despite this lift, JUP remains down by a massive 75% from the all-time high it record on Wednesday, when the Solana-based DEX utility token listed for the first time.</p>
<p>It has, however, recovered by 11% from the all-time low it recorded yesterday, suggesting that it may be about to recover.</p>
<p>But if it doesn&#8217;t, there are plenty of other new coins on the horizon, with stake-to-mine platform Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) raising $10 million as it prepares to launch.</p>
<h2>Is Jupiter About to Crash? JUP Price Drops 75%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After suffering a crash yesterday, JUP has regained some momentum, with its indicators pointing to further gains at the moment.</p>
<p>Its relative strength index (purple) has risen to 70 again this morning, after spending much of yesterday below 50.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160613" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160613" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160613" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706871572-jup-price-chart.png" alt="JUP price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706871572-jup-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706871572-jup-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706871572-jup-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706871572-jup-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706871572-jup-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706871572-jup-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706871572-jup-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160613" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>This indicates a recovery of interest in the token, as does its volume, which remains high for a new token, at around $400 million.</p>
<p>The reason why JUP commands so much volume already is that numerous major exchanges have already listed it, including Binance, KuCoin and OKX.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Hype for JUP is strong because it&#8217;s the native token of Jupiter, a Solana-based decentralized exchange and liquidity aggregator.</p>
<p>According to DappRadar rankings, <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi">Jupiter is currently the biggest DeFi platform at the moment in terms of unique active wallets</a>, comfortably exceeding the UAW count for its nearest rival, PancakeSwap.</p>
<p>And given how well Solana and its entire ecosystem has been doing in recent months, demand for Jupiter&#8217;s services and its token is understandably quite high.</p>
<p>It may have declined by close to 75% since reaching an early record high upon listing, but its recovery today suggests that it could be on the road to recovery.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="JUPITER Exchange (JUP) Crypto IS LIVE | JUP Price Prediction" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-sHqgS1gnw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>However, such a recovery may take time, although with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">the next Bitcoin halving now on the horizon</a>, it shouldn&#8217;t be too long.</p>
<h2>This Other Crypto Just Smashed Past $10.1 Million</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While JUP looks like it should recover, it&#8217;s not certain that it will recover to its current ATH anytime soon.</p>
<p>This arguably leaves traders with the need to look elsewhere if they want to expose themselves to market-beating gains, with there currently being a wide selection of promising new projects and alts.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">One of the best new tokens is </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en" rel="sponsored">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Ethereum-based stake-to-mine platform that has raised more than $10.1 million since opening its presale a couple of months ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Bitcoin Minetrix is exciting because it offers retail investors the chance to mine Bitcoin (BTC) by doing little more than staking its native token, BTCMTX.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">By staking BTCMTX, users receive tokenized mining credits, which they can redeem in order to have miners mine Bitcoin on their behalf.</span></p>
<p>This puts them in line to receive a share of mined BTC, while staking will also provide them with a regular supply of freshly issued BTCMTX tokens.</p>
<p>Such a potentially lucrative setup has proven instrumental in attracting investors to Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s presale, which is now entering its final phases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink has surged by 15% in the past 24 hours, with <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LINKUSD">the LINK price</a> reaching $17.91 on a day when the wider crypto market has risen by 2%.</p>
<p>LINK is now up by an impressive 29% in the past week and 16% in the last 30 days, with the utility token also having gained by 146% in the past year.</p>
<p>Yet its momentum looks like it&#8217;s about to peak, potentially bringing a correction in the coming days and/or weeks.</p>
<p>Traders may therefore do well to investigate promising alternatives, with innovative ERC-20 coin Meme Kombat on course for big listings after raising $8 million in its presale.</p>
<h2>Is It Too Late to Buy Chainlink? LINK Price Blasts Up</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
LINK&#8217;s chart definitely shows considerable momentum right now, and it may be that this momentum continues for one or two days.</p>
<p>Yet the coin&#8217;s indicators do also suggest that things are close to peaking, with its relative strength index (purple) touching 70 today, close to overbought territory.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160564" style="width: 4310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160564" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868340-link-price-chart.png" alt="LINK price chart." width="4310" height="2236" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868340-link-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868340-link-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868340-link-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868340-link-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868340-link-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868340-link-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706868340-link-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 4310px) 100vw, 4310px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160564" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, LINK&#8217;s current price has shot beyond its 30-day average (yellow), which in turn is racing further above the 200-day average (blue).</p>
<p>Again, this signals overheating, meaning that a correction may have to follow soon enough.</p>
<p>One encouraging sign, however, is that LINK&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume has jumped considerably, reaching $1.8 billion today.</p>
<p>This represents a 500% increase compared to where the volume was only a few days ago, indicating a strong bounce in interest.</p>
<p>Indeed, the past few days had brought news of some large LINK transfers, with January 30 witnessing a transfer <em>from </em>Binance worth $22 million.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Aside from the fact that the market is gradually becoming more bullish, Chainlink&#8217;s recent fortunes are also the result of growing usage.</p>
<p>Its blockchain serves as an &#8216;oracle&#8217; network for other blockchains and cryptocurrency platforms, providing reliable data with applications in DeFi, Web3 and other areas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely to continue attracting more usage as the wider cryptocurrency sector returns to consistent growth, something which can only push the LINK price higher over time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s likely to reach $25 by the spring, and potentially $50 by the end of the summer.</p>
<h2>Unique Gaming and Staking Model Propels MK Token</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Because LINK may be too hot right now and close to correcting, many traders may prefer to turn to alternatives, particularly newer coins that have yet to enjoy initial growth spurts.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-top-crypto-presales-2024-unveiling-most-anticipated-calsona-gxcce/">a growing selection of such alts</a> in the market this year, with several holding presales that have enabled them to gain momentum in the buildup to their listings.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a> is <span style="font-size: 16px;">an ERC-20 coin that has raised close to $8 million in its hugely presale.</span></p>

<figure class="&quot;media&quot;"></figure>
<figure class="&quot;media&quot;"></figure>
<p>Meme Kombat&#8217;s presale has been so successful because the platform offers something unique within the meme coin category.</p>
<p>Namely, it&#8217;s also a social gambling platform, with users able to bet on the results of AI-generated battles between meme characters.</p>
<p>The use of AI means that results will be randomized, while the use of smart contracts ensures transparency and fairness.</p>
<p>Players can place bets using MK tokens, something which will feed demand for the coin, while winnings will also come in the form of MK tokens.</p>
<p>On top of this, MK holders can stake the coin, earning themselves a passive income, which comes in addition to any price gains and winnings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ever-evolving world of investment, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are finding a new lucrative avenue – digital asset flipping. This emerging trend sees investors who once solely focused on the volatile crypto markets now venturing into the realm of social media, where flipping digital properties like accounts and pages is yielding substantial returns. Amidst a period of stagnation in the cryptocurrency sector, savvy investors are diversifying their portfolios by tapping into the dynamic world of social media assets. <a href="https://swapd.co/">SWAPD, a platform renowned for facilitating large-scale digital transactions</a>, has become a focal point for these investors, where deals ranging from $200,000 to $300,000 are not out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>The shift from cryptocurrency to digital asset flipping is a strategic move for investors seeking new opportunities in the face of crypto market uncertainties. Over the past few years, the crypto market has experienced a mix of dramatic highs and lows, leading to a sense of stagnation among many investors. In contrast, the market for social media assets – encompassing Instagram accounts, YouTube channels, Twitter profiles, and more – is witnessing a surge. The appeal of this market lies in its relative stability compared to the highly speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the potential for high returns on relatively small investments makes it an attractive proposition for those looking to diversify their investment strategies.</p>
<p>SWAPD stands out as a prime example of where these high-stake transactions are taking place. The platform has carved out a niche in facilitating the sale and purchase of premium social media accounts, with a particular focus on security and transparency. Transactions in the range of six-digits, once considered extraordinary, are becoming increasingly common on SWAPD. This is indicative of the significant value being placed on high-quality digital assets and the confidence investors have in this market.</p>
<p>The process of digital asset flipping in the social media sphere involves identifying undervalued accounts with potential, purchasing them, and then enhancing their value through strategic content curation, audience engagement, and growth tactics. Once the account reaches a higher value, it is sold for a profit. This model is particularly appealing to crypto investors who are accustomed to navigating online platforms and analyzing market trends. The skills honed in the crypto market – such as risk assessment, trend analysis, and timing the market – are equally applicable in the world of digital asset flipping.</p>
<p>Moreover, the shift to digital asset flipping represents a broader trend in the investment world where digital properties are increasingly being viewed as viable and valuable assets. In a digital age where online presence and influence translate to real-world value, owning a popular social media account is akin to holding a piece of prime real estate in the virtual world.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that, like any investment, digital asset flipping comes with its risks. The volatility of social media platforms, changes in algorithms, and policy updates can all impact the value of these digital assets. Hence, investors venturing into this space need to approach it with the same level of due diligence and strategic planning as they would with any other investment.</p>
<p>The transition of crypto investors into the realm of digital asset flipping marks a significant shift in the investment landscape. Platforms like SWAPD are at the forefront of this trend, providing a secure and efficient marketplace for high-value transactions. As the digital world continues to evolve, the convergence of different investment avenues like cryptocurrency and social media assets is likely to create new opportunities and challenges for investors. This shift underscores the growing importance of versatility and adaptability in the modern investment strategy.</p>

<p>A new cryptocurrency project focused on developing environmentally sustainable transportation solutions has gathered considerable attention in its ongoing crypto presale fundraising event. The initiative, called eTuktuk, has so far raised over $730,000 from presale participants looking to acquire the project&#8217;s ERC-20 token before its official launch.</p>
<p>With presale momentum indicating strong interest in the crypto startup&#8217;s mission and potential, some analysts speculate that eTuktuk could be one of the best altcoins to buy into early.</p>

<h2>Electric Vehicles to Replace Polluting Tuk-Tuks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
eTuktuk&#8217;s goal is to transform urban transportation infrastructure in developing nations <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-hurts-poorest-most">plagued by high levels of air pollution</a>. Specifically, the project wants to replace traditional auto rickshaws commonly known as tuk-tuks with electric vehicles powered by renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>Tuk-tuks are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/11/the-two-stroke-engine-widespread-in-the-developing-world-and-with/625935/">notorious for their inefficient two-stroke engines</a> that emit high amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. eTuktuk will swap these fossil fuel-burning tuk-tuks with zero-emission electric models charged using solar power.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Beyond manufacturing clean electric tuk-tuks, the crypto startup plans to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/electric-vehicle-charging-payments-go-crypto-with-innovative-new-startup-next-big-thing-1.htm">build EV charging systems</a> and incorporate blockchain technology for security, efficiency, and scalability as adoption spreads. The roadmap also includes offering digital identities and financial services via partnerships, especially to serve economically disadvantaged groups.</p>
<h2>Token Staking Rewards Up to 298% APY</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
eTuktuk’s native ERC-20 token TUK will enable various functions within the ecosystem such as EV reservations, ride-hailing, and payments between drivers and riders.</p>
<p>Holders who stake their TUK tokens can passively earn up to 298% APY. This incentive furthers the appeal of acquiring TUK both for presale participants and future adopters looking for the best altcoin to buy for staking income.</p>
<h2>Is eTukTuk the Best Altcoin to Buy Now?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As a crypto startup centered on environmental sustainability, eTuktuk has captured noteworthy presale momentum in recent weeks by tapping into surging investor appetite for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/greenest-cryptocurrency.htm">greener cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p>With the presale&#8217;s original $650,000 goal swiftly exceeded with over $730,000 raised so far, eTuktuk is set to conclude its presale funding stage soon. The token price will be $0.026 during presale but will increase when the next launch phase goes live.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Early stakers enjoy higher returns as APY adjusts with participation, encouraging early adoption and a fair, enticing incentive structure for all. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ab.png" alt="💫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/pMrXEZzB3f">pic.twitter.com/pMrXEZzB3f</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Once the presale wraps up,  TUK may become one of the best altcoins to buy considering its pronounced <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/evolution-of-enterprise-blockchain-into-real-world-utility-and-use-cases.htm">real-world utility</a> and eco-friendly ethos that caters to pressing climate change concerns.</p>
<p>Early adopters can gain exposure to a crypto startup merging green technology, sustainability, and blockchain&#8217;s efficiency and security to reform transportation infrastructure across developing nations. For environmentally-conscious investors, TUK could be one of the best altcoins to buy right now while it&#8217;s still early.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Thursday, February 1st, 2024</em> – Meme coin Sponge has announced the discontinuation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge">Sponge V1</a> as it accelerates its migration to the SPONGE V2 Polygon version of the digital asset.</p>
<p dir="auto">The pivot to a solid architecture for gaming, which the fast-growing and scalable Polygon network offers, provides the last piece in the puzzle, following the news released in January of the project’s migration plans.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sponge’s team has decided to bring forward its plans in response to a recent malicious attack on its liquidity pool. All $SPONGE V1 holders are being moved to the more secure, efficient (faster) and cheaper to transact $SPONGE V2 on the Polygon network.</p>
<p dir="auto">This strategic shift not only aims to limit the attack&#8217;s impact but will also expedite the launch of a fully decentralized Play-to-Earn game with significantly lower transaction fees.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, MATIC transactions typically cost between 0.1 and 0.5 MATIC ($0.077-$0.38), while Ethereum transactions are around $2.5 to $20. Sponge gamers will be able to look forward to huge potential on-chain savings.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge">Visit Sponge V2</a></p>
<h2 dir="auto">When will the transition to SPONGE V2 start and end?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">The transition to SPONGE V2 will take place on Monday February 5th at 11:00pm UTC, marking a significant milestone in the platform’s journey towards a more secure and efficient blockchain environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Effective immediately, $SPONGE V1 will be phased out, rendering it worthless post-February 5th. This decision comes as a direct response to the attack to protect the Sponge community’s interests and assets the uppermost priority.</p>
<p dir="auto">The need to move at pace was also necessitated by the original contract design in which the liquidity was set to unlock on February 6th.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Strategic advantages of the accelerated transition to SPONGE V2 on the Polygon Network</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">Sponge is expediting the move of SPONGE V1 holders to SPONGE V2, hosted on the Polygon network.</p>
<p dir="auto">The need for a swift and seamless transition has the fortuitous consequence of speeding up the strategic migration.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge">Sponge</a> upgrade process thus should be seen not purely as a response to the attack, but also as a forward-looking move to leverage Polygon’s lower transaction fees for Sponge’s Play-to-Earn game.</p>
<p dir="auto">Polygon is what is known as a Layer 2 network because it sits on top of an existing blockchain – in this case – in order to provide enhancements, usually associated with scalability, as measured in transactions per second (tps).</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, Polygon can scale to a tps of as much as 7,000 tps while Ethereum languishes on 1–25 tps. Polygon can theoretically achieve 65,000 tps, although real-world bottlenecks may prevent this, depending on the server architecture and other factors.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Sponge took immediate action to mitigate harm</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">In response to the recent security breach, Sponge reacted quickly to effectively create a cordon sanitaire to insulate token holders from negative impacts and to limit any potential damage to its network.</p>
<p dir="auto">Although the team, for security reasons, has not revealed any details about the exploit or vector of attack, robust counter-measures and rigorous static analysis testing to identify and close any other potential vulnerabilities have been implemented on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p dir="auto">Still, the price of the token suffered as a result of the negative news. However, the <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xf935f557e06a7d040dea4691f90c9a755301818b">SPONGE</a> price has returned to the support levels it was comfortably sitting at in December, creating a new near-term bottom for the price.</p>
<p dir="auto">At one level this does not matter because the V1 coin is being retired, but its termination price is an important point of price discovery for the new SPONGE V2, which is currently being staked in large numbers.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">What token holders need to do now – stake SPONGE V1 today for a seamless transition</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">Sponge is working closely with its exchange partners to suspend all trading of SPONGE V1 on the 5th of February at 11:00 PM UTC.</p>
<p dir="auto">Holders of SPONGE V1 on centralized exchanges are urged to withdraw and stake their tokens through the Sponge website before the cutoff to earn APY and claim SPONGE V2.</p>
<p dir="auto">For those holding SPONGE V1 in non-custodial wallets, staking through the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge">Sponge website</a> is also recommended.</p>
<p dir="auto">For decentralized holders, staking before February 5th ensures the receipt of staking APY as usual. Non-custodial holders who do not stake by this deadline will be transferred to a 0% APY staking contract from a snapshot taken at 11:00pm UTC on February 5th.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the Sponge community members who have already staked their SPONGE V1 tokens, there will be a seamless transition. These staked tokens will automatically be transferred to the new Polygon staking contract.</p>
<p dir="auto">To date, $3.36 million worth of SPONGE V1 has been staked and is currently earning an APY of 244%.</p>
<p dir="auto">SPONGE V1 launched at a price of $0.000025 and is at the time of writing priced at $0.000509 – that amounts to a ROI of 2,034%.</p>
<p dir="auto">The possibility of SPONGE V2 exploding in price to surpass the previous SPONGE V1 all-time high of $0.0012 on January 8th are extremely high, given the network transition to Polygon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FORK Coin has rocketed by more than 69,000% in the past 24 hours, with the new Solana-based meme token reaching a record high of $0.032 earlier this morning.</p>
<p>Trading on the Raydium decentralized exchange in a pairing with Solana (SOL), FORK has quickly become one of the hottest trending coins in the market after listing today.</p>
<p>Yet as recent history has shown with extremely small-cap meme tokens, it may not be able to sustain its growth beyond the next one or two days.</p>
<p>However, even if it does crash back down to Earth, there are other more promising coins in the market right now, with Sponge (SPONGE) looking set to rally in the near future after it completes the rollout of the second version of its token.</p>
<h2>FORK Coin is Up 69,000%: Will It Crash Soon?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While it has been tradable for only a day, FORK remains relatively stable at the moment, with its price not crashing completely after reaching an ATH earlier this morning.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160181" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160181" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160181" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706798170-fork-coin-price-chart.png" alt="FORK Coin price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706798170-fork-coin-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706798170-fork-coin-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706798170-fork-coin-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706798170-fork-coin-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706798170-fork-coin-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706798170-fork-coin-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706798170-fork-coin-price-chart-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160181" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>One concerning sign, however, is that its volume has already dried up, declining steadily since the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p>This is worrying because low liquidity often leaves coin&#8217;s vulnerable to sudden and dramatic swings, which in FORK&#8217;s case could be a dramatic swing downwards.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also strange in itself, given that FORK has gained by close to 70,000% today, with few newcomers willing to get involved despite its massive surge.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is despite the fact that Crypto Twitter seems awash with posters bigging up the token, <a href="https://twitter.com/itsvinnydee/status/1753037021516603855">predicting that it could be the next WIF or BONK</a>.</p>
<p>Because of its extremely low volumes, new traders should approach FORK Coin with considerable caution, preparing themselves for the possibility that it could crash soon.</p>
<h2>Traders are Watching This Other Crypto Now</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As a safer alternative to FORK, traders may want to consider new altcoins with actual use cases and stronger fundamentals.</p>
<p>There are many, many such coins in the market right now, including various presale coins that have been gaining momentum as they prepare to list.</p>
<p>And one of the most promising at the moment is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/sponge">Sponge (SPONGE)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency first listed </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">on major exchanges in April 2023, when </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sponge-best-crypto-buy-today-new-meme-coin-spongebob-might-100x-1.htm">it rallied by upwards of 150%</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s now in the process of rolling out the second version of its coin, SPONGE V2, with the first version set to be discontinued on February 5.</p>
<p>SPONGE V2 will come with a new and improved staking model, and it will also serve as the native token for a play-to-earn racing game.</p>

<p>By playing this forthcoming game, players will compete to rank on a global leaderboard and earn rewards in the form of SPONGE V2 tokens.</p>

<p>And given that the first version of its coin did so well, there&#8217;s no reason why SPONGE V2 won&#8217;t have a similarly big opening once it gains its initial batch of listings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celestia has barely moved in the past 24 hours, with <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TIAUSDT.P">the TIA price</a> standing at $16.66 as the wider market suffers a 1% loss.</p>
<p>TIA remains up by 8% in a week and by 23% in a month, with the layer-one token down by 17% since hitting an all-time high of $20.16 a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>The coin has seesawed since reaching this record high, struggling to set a new peak as the cryptocurrency market experiences similar indecisiveness.</p>
<p>Now, traders are wondering whether a move to the downside is coming.</p>
<p>Yet, as uncertain as it has been in recent weeks, there are other promising coins to diversify into, with new stake-to-mine platform Bitcoin Minetrix raising more than $10 million in its presale.</p>
<h2>Is Celestia About to Crash? TIA Price Drops 10%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
TIA&#8217;s chart is in a largely bearish position right now, with its indicators suggesting that further falls could be coming in the near term.</p>
<p>Most notably, it looks like its current price could be about to drop below its 30-day moving average (yellow), a move that can undermine market confidence.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160117" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160117" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160117" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706793911-tia-price-chart.png" alt="TIA price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706793911-tia-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706793911-tia-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706793911-tia-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706793911-tia-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706793911-tia-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706793911-tia-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706793911-tia-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160117" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, TIA&#8217;s relative strength index (purple) has been hovering around the 50 mark for nearly two weeks now, underlining how it&#8217;s struggling to regain clear momentum.</p>
<p>The coin&#8217;s trading volume also highlights its struggles, given that it has fallen from $850 million in early January to $200 million today.</p>
<p>This indicates a loss of market interest in the token, which rallied strongly between mid-November and mid-January on the basis of new exchange listings.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Now, it seems that the dust has settled a little, with holders taking profits over the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>What will push the TIA price in the medium- and long-term is the growth of its native platform, Celestia.</p>
<p>This is a new &#8216;modular&#8217; blockchain, designed to scale in proportion to the number of users on its network.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://celestia.org/what-is-celestia/">technology sounds promising</a>, but it remains very young and has so far attracted no major adoption or use, despite <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/celestia-project-skyrockets-to-370m-valuation-after-highly-anticipated-launch.htm">launching its mainnet in late October</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://defillama.com">it doesn&#8217;t currently have any entry on DefiLlama</a>, suggesting no or very little total value locked in.</p>
<p>For this reason, its price could be relatively quiet for the next few months, failing to return to previous heights until it racks up some real-world usage.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Minetrix Surpasses $10 Million Milestone</h2>

The cryptocurrency market is currently spoilt for promising new projects, with Celestia being one of the latest.</p>
<p>And it isn&#8217;t the only one, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-crypto-watch-2024-top-5-cryptocurrencies-high-calsona-f8pve">several exciting new altcoins</a> currently holding their presales and gaining momentum as they prepare to list.</p>
<p>The best example of this is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en" rel="sponsored">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a>, an<span style="font-size: 16px;"> Ethereum-based stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $10 million in its heavily subscribed token offering.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The reason why investors are going for Bitcoin Minetrix in a big way is that its platform is promising to overhaul Bitcoin mining for the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">That is, its platform will enable users to mine Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native token, BTCMTX.</span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s all users have to do, with staking earning tokenized mining credits, which they can then spend on purchasing Bitcoin hashing power.</p>
<p>As a result, they will receive a share in mined BTC, while they&#8217;ll also gain staking rewards in the form of freshly issued BTCMTX.</p>
<p>It therefore promises to be a highly lucrative platform, and when coupled with its ease of use, it should attract plenty of users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TAOUSDT">TAO price</a> has dropped by 4.5% in the past 24 hours, slipping to $434.98 after reaching an all-time high of $479 yesterday.</p>
<p>Despite this fall, TAO remains on a strong upswing in the medium-term, up by 27% in a week and by 62% in the last 30 days, as interest in decentralized AI platforms continues.</p>
<p>Yet today&#8217;s slip raises the possibility that it may have begun a correction, and could be in line for further falls in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>This means that traders may be better off looking at alternatives for big gains in the time being, with Meme Kombat (MK) raising $7.8 million in its presale as it readies itself to list.</p>
<h2>Is It Too Late to Buy Bittensor? TAO Price Keeps Rising</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It looks like TAO is experiencing a predictable correction after setting a record high last night, with its indicators all beginning to cool off.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple), for instance, is dipping hard after reaching 80 yesterday, with plenty of space to fall further before there&#8217;s any risk of overselling.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160067" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160067" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160067" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706792122-tao-price-chart.png" alt="TAO price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706792122-tao-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706792122-tao-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706792122-tao-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706792122-tao-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706792122-tao-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706792122-tao-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706792122-tao-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160067" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>TAO&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) is also showing signs of slowing down, although it remains much higher than its 200-day average (blue), suggesting that the coin remains within an expansionary phase.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the token&#8217;s trading volume remains high relative to previous levels, at around $25 million compared to $3 million at the start of last month.</p>
<p>Based on such factors, it&#8217;s reasonable to conclude that TAO will return to growth after a comparatively brief correction.</p>
<p>Its price is well above its support level (green), which is very likely to resist any severe drop.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since I bought <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TAO&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$TAO</a> about a year ago I thought it had a shot at going to something like 50B+ market cap at the top of the cycle.</p>
<p>I’ve just noticed it’s made another ATH. Still no major CEX listing.</p>
<p>Decentralized AI is such a simple idea and narrative for this bull run.</p>
<p>&mdash; Aylo (@alpha_pls) <a href="https://twitter.com/alpha_pls/status/1752103919470174599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What&#8217;s particularly bullish about TAO is that it hasn&#8217;t been listed by any of the really big exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s now the 33rd biggest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, with its rise founded largely upon the promise of a decentralized machine learning network.</p>
<p>However, even <a href="https://bittensor.com/whitepaper">its whitepaper</a> doesn&#8217;t make it entirely clear how such a network will work or how it will attract real-world use, even if AI is becoming an increasingly more prominent part of the global economy.</p>
<p>As such, the TAO price may continue to rise strongly in the medium-term, helped by any bull market that may follow from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">the next Bitcoin halving</a> (due around April).</p>
<p>But its longer term success remains somewhat indeterminate, and will stem from whether it can convert its early hype into something real.</p>
<h2>Rising as New Meme Coin Gains Popularity</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Given TAO&#8217;s longer term question marks, as well as the fact that it&#8217;s currently a little too hot, some traders may aim to diversify into alternatives.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-top-crypto-presales-2024-unveiling-most-anticipated-calsona-gxcce/">a wide selection of promising new alts and presale tokens</a> in the cryptocurrency market right now, with many looking like they could rally big soon.</p>
<p>Near the top of any list of hyped new tokens is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="//cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat%5C%22" rel="sponsored">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 coin that has raised $7.8 million in its successful presale.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have successfully conquered the $7.8 million mark in the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MK</a> presale<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2694.png" alt="⚔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<figure class="&quot;media&quot;"></figure>
<p>Not just a meme token, Meme Kombat is also a social gambling platform, on which users will be able to bet on the results of AI-generated battles between meme characters.</p>
<p>Because it uses AI to generate battles, results will be randomized and fair, with players able to bet against each other or against the platform itself.</p>
<p>Likewise, the use of blockchain and smart contracts will ensure full transparency, with winnings paid automatically.</p>
<p>Another bullish feature is that holders will be able to stake MK tokens, earning themselves a passive income in the process.</p>
<p>This could take plenty of MK tokens out of circulation, and combined with demand for the token in order to place bets, its price could rise strongly over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TG.Casino, the latest newcomer to the crypto GambleFi scene is blowing away the opposition by exceeding all expectations, making its $TGC token probably the best pick in this red-hot crypto sector.</p>
<p>Already the top-licensed gambling platform on popular bot platform Telegram, <a href="https://tg.casino/">TG.Casino</a> is rolling out new features that are grabbing the attention of traders and gamers alike.</p>
<p>Chief among them is the new web version of the casino which will likely lead to an explosive acceleration in new user growth. A much-awaited full-screen display mode for Telegram users is live.</p>
<p>The price is in a classic bullish cup-and-handle pattern in an invitation to traders to buy as the price is set to test and surpass its launch debut intra-day high of $0.33.</p>
<figure id="attachment_159893" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159893" style="width: 908px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-159893" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783683-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-34-25.png" alt="tg casino" width="908" height="558" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783683-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-34-25.png 908w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783683-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-34-25-300x184.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783683-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-34-25-768x472.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783683-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-34-25-150x92.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-159893" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy TradingView via TGC/USDT trading pair data on <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x85aa97537837514a9229fcaeb66eeef7242122bf"><i>DEXTools</i></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the current price of $0.25 all presale buyers are in the money, especially those early investors who were able to lock in the $0.125 opening offer price</p>
<p>In a reminder of the truth of legendary value investor Benjamin Graham’s quote that, to paraphrase, in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine, TG.Casino fits the bill.</p>
<p>Short term, buyer demand is trumping sellers to propel the $TGC token price higher. Over a medium term longer term viewing, the fundamentals will shine through, as early growth metrics released by the team on January 29th show.</p>
<h2>Expectations smashed as players wager $155 million in a month</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Players have wagered more than $155 million – a level of activity especially impressive in what is typically a slow month after the Christmas splurge by consumers.</p>
<p>It is a strong indicator <a href="https://tg.casino/">TG.Casino</a> is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>On that, active player numbers have now crossed the 4,500 mark as the adoption pace picks up.</p>
<p>Word of mouth is thought to be a big part of the traction success, buttressed by a digital advertising campaign that continues to target key crypto-facing properties.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, cumulative unique users of GambleFi coins on Ethereum hit 74,683 on January 22nd, according to data compiled by <a href="https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/gamblefi">Dune</a> of the tokens it tracks.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159898" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783772-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-35-59.png" alt="dune" width="894" height="336" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783772-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-35-59.png 894w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783772-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-35-59-300x113.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783772-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-35-59-768x289.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706783772-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-35-59-150x56.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" />Meanwhile, total deposits have surpassed $14 million, an indication of the level of community trust the platform has already carved out for itself in a matter of weeks.</p>
<h2>Full-screen gaming going live is a big hit with Telegram users</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Back on the features release front, the <a href="https://t.me/c/1955884145/297428">Telegram full-screen display</a> feature has been met with enthusiasm as it makes gameplay so much more engaging.</p>
<p>Players are now enjoying a more immersive, all-encompassing gaming experience with the full-screen mode.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t tried out the new look, full-screen mode means favorite games can be enjoyed with enhanced visuals as the entire screen becomes the playground for maximum impactfulness.</p>
<p>Full-screen mode also provided <a href="https://tg.casino/">TG.Casino</a> designers with the opportunity to streamline the gaming experience, making the user interface (UI) even more friendly. With this new feature.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the platform’s UI designers have taken the time to optimize every element to ensure what the team describes as “the best possible experience, ensuring easy navigation and gameplay”.</p>
<p>All of this has the effect of elevating the casino experience.</p>
<p>By visually enhancing the games it improves player focus as they immerse themselves in the more personalized casino environment.</p>
<p>After all, it is the thrills and spills of the game that draw in the players and keep them coming back for more – full-screen lets players lose themselves in the jeopardy of the moment for a more fulfilling gaming experience.</p>

<h2>Success breeds success because of a highly experienced leadership team that knows the gambling  industry inside out</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
TG.Casino is making a name for itself because of its solid business execution – that’s not happened by accident.</p>
<p>The platform is run by highly experienced casino professionals with extensive contacts and relationships with key executives in the casino profession.</p>
<p>This is no fly-by-night company looking to cash in on the latest trend, only to lose interest, or worse to run off with players and token holders’ hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>Behind every good business are driven executives with a commitment to doing right by their customers by continually improving as they execute on their mission.</p>
<p><a href="https://tg.casino/">TG.Casino</a> is dead serious about taking on and beating the opposition, and its customers and token holders are the big winners.</p>
<p>Achieving its mission goals – to become the No.1 crypto casino and to challenge the legacy gambling incumbents too – is helped by incentives to join its fast-growing community of players.</p>
<p>Standout exclusive offers include 25% cashback on net losses every week when you play with $TGC token. That’s just one of the ways in which everyone is a VIP at TG.Casino.</p>
<h2>Look out Rollbit token – are traders migrating from RBL to TG.Casino token?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Rollbit token ($RBL) price has dropped to its lowest price in three months, and that has traders pondering whether the launch of $TGC could be the main reason for that.</p>
<p>TG.Casino launched its $TGC token ICO on September 23rd 2023 and it started trading on decentralized exchanges on January 4th.</p>
<p>A look at the daily price chart shows the price of Rollbit token on a trending descent since November last year.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159909" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706784106-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-41-28.png" alt="TG casino chart" width="1526" height="1066" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706784106-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-41-28.png 1526w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706784106-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-41-28-300x210.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706784106-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-41-28-1024x715.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706784106-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-41-28-768x536.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706784106-screenshot-2024-02-01-at-10-41-28-150x105.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1526px) 100vw, 1526px" />By contrast, TG Casino has a unique buyback mechanism that supports its token price, as the cup-and-handle pattern highlighted earlier in this article proves.</p>
<p>The initial $500,000 budgeted for <a href="https://t.me/TGCasinoNews/61">buybacks</a> hasn’t been used. Rather, the continuing monthly buybacks funded from casino profits mean the $TGC price enjoys long-term support.</p>
<p>Not to be ignored are key opinion leaders such as <a href="https://x.com/EricCryptoman/status/1742945330306400333">Eric Cryptoman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PRINTMYMINT">Print</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wizardofsoho/status/1712958474772939068">Wizard of Soho</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/realdogen">Dogen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Poe_Ether">Poe</a>, who all bought into the coin.</p>

<p>Tamadoge has kickstarted the next era for its play-to-earn ecosystem, announcing the accelerated launch of its $TAMA V2 token on the Polygon network.</p>
<p>The strategic move comes in the wake of a recent hack that targeted the project&#8217;s liquidity pool. This has prompted a swift and decisive response from the <a href="https://tamadoge.io/">Tamadoge</a> team, revealing the upcoming secret plan of migrating to a V2 token.</p>
<p>This decision addresses immediate security concerns while alluding to a possible roadmap update.</p>
<h2><b>The Huge Upside of Upgrading to Polygon</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tamadoge&#8217;s transition to Polygon marks a pivotal moment in its roadmap. In response to the unfortunate hack, the team is not just moving to a new network but also replacing the existing ERC-20 token entirely.</p>
<p>A move to Polygon was originally planned to be announced after delivery of the Tamadoge Pursuit game via a bridge, marking the end of the current phase of the roadmap. However, the game will instead be delivered after launching the V2 token, which is now the main priority for reasons of security and improved user experience.</p>
<p>Polygon operates as a Layer 2 scaling solution or sidechain, functioning in parallel with the Ethereum blockchain. This setup facilitates rapid transactions and minimal fees, making it perfectly suited for gaming applications. Additionally, it capitalizes on the liquidity and robust security framework of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Consequently, the transition from Ethereum to Polygon represents a transformative shift for $TAMA V2 users, significantly enhancing their gaming experience by combining speed, efficiency, and security.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159648" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738483-a16b7f79dd0882ef56dbdf37395e45b9.png" alt="" width="602" height="597" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738483-a16b7f79dd0882ef56dbdf37395e45b9.png 602w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738483-a16b7f79dd0882ef56dbdf37395e45b9-300x298.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738483-a16b7f79dd0882ef56dbdf37395e45b9-150x149.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738483-a16b7f79dd0882ef56dbdf37395e45b9-64x64.png 64w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738483-a16b7f79dd0882ef56dbdf37395e45b9-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<h2><b>How the $TAMA V2 Migration Process Works</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To ensure a hassle-free transition for its user base, the <a href="https://tamadoge.io/">Tamadoge</a> team has laid out four steps to seamlessly switch all holders to V2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Deployment of the New Token Contract:</li>
</ol>
<p>The team will deploy an upgraded Polygon contract with additional security features, including blacklist and pause functions, to provide a safer experience for the Tamadoge community moving forward.</p>
<p>2. Staking Contract Upgrade:</p>
<p>Next, the Staking Contract will be upgraded. All staking balances and associated rewards will be carried over to the new contract on Polygon. Users will need to simply connect their wallets to view their staked tokens after the switch.</p>
<p>3. Conversion on Centralised and DeFi Holders:</p>
<p>For those holding tokens on centralized exchanges, there will be an automatic conversion to the new token. Concurrently, DeFi and Non-Custodial holders will receive an airdrop of the new token, ensuring a smooth transition for all.</p>
<p>4. Liquidity Pool Addition and Trading Access:</p>
<p>Finally, alongside the Airdrop and CEX transition, the liquidity pool will be restored on Polygon, creating a tradable pair that matches the pre-hack V1 price. This will ensure that everyone gains trading access simultaneously.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159649" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738555-7593651672be31be576ac21eea46fc5c.png" alt="" width="590" height="590" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738555-7593651672be31be576ac21eea46fc5c.png 590w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738555-7593651672be31be576ac21eea46fc5c-300x300.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738555-7593651672be31be576ac21eea46fc5c-150x150.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738555-7593651672be31be576ac21eea46fc5c-64x64.png 64w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706738555-7593651672be31be576ac21eea46fc5c-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<h2><b>Addressing the Hack – A Safer More Secure TAMA</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://tamadoge.io/">Tamadoge</a> project faced a significant challenge when its developer wallet was targeted in a coordinated attack.</p>
<p>When the hackers exploited a contract vulnerability to access the Tamadoge liquidity pool, the team acted swiftly to limit the hack&#8217;s scope.</p>
<p>This was done by removing liquidity from decentralized exchanges and working with exchange partners to halt trading temporarily. Additionally, the staking and token pages on the Tamadoge website were also disabled as a precaution.</p>
<p>A thorough investigation is being conducted to understand the hack&#8217;s root cause.</p>
<p>Due to this incident, previously unannounced project plans are now being accelerated in order to enhance security and functionality.</p>
<h2><b>Tamadoge&#8217;s New Future on Polygon is Bright</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As Tamadoge embarks on its new journey with Polygon, there&#8217;s palpable excitement within the community, fueled by the team hinting at additional steps in the roadmap.</p>
<p>The community is abuzz with speculation: What new features and expansions will Tamadoge introduce? How will this transition shape the future of the ecosystem? These questions mark an exciting phase of anticipation and potential for Tamadoge.</p>
<p>The decision to postpone the release of the Tamadoge Pursuit game, while initially met with disappointment, is now seen in a new light. This pause is viewed as a strategic step, allowing the team to fully leverage the benefits of the Polygon network and integrate these into the gaming experience.</p>
<p>The anticipation for the game has only grown, as users look forward to an even more enhanced, seamless, and engaging play-to-earn experience on the Polygon platform.</p>
<p>There are many benefits of the Polygon chain for the <a href="https://tamadoge.io/">Tamadoge</a> ecosystem. It opens a realm of new possibilities where users can now look forward to significantly lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>Faster transaction speeds on Polygon mean a smoother, more responsive gaming experience, which is crucial for real-time play-to-earn games. Moreover, the integration with Polygon&#8217;s staking contract is set to offer more rewarding experiences for players.</p>
<p>Integral to the migration is a heightened focus on security. Polygon network&#8217;s robust architecture offers enhanced security features, which are crucial in protecting users&#8217; assets and ensuring the integrity of the play-to-earn ecosystem.</p>
<p>This transition to a more secure environment reflects Tamadoge&#8217;s unwavering commitment to safeguarding its community and fortifying trust among its users.</p>
<p>Poised to redefine the play-to-earn landscape, the future of Tamadoge on Polygon is shaping up to be a thrilling chapter in the project&#8217;s story. Its latest strategic pivot is, therefore, a testament to Tamadoge&#8217;s resilience, adaptability, and dedication to delivering an exceptional and secure gaming experience to its community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELMO token has gained by as much as 70,000% since listing on the Raydium DEX a couple of days ago, with the new Solana-based coin reaching a record high of $0.001251 yesterday.</p>
<p>This makes ELMO the latest in a long line of SOL-based meme coins to have stormed the charts in recent months, yet it has already begun to fall away, with its price declining by 38% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Such a steep drop-off introduces the possibility that ELMO may have already peaked and that it could have begun a long and largely irreversible decline.</p>
<p>However, there are other new tokens in the market with stronger fundamentals, with the popular Sponge (SPONGE) token launching the second version of its coin as it prepares to release a play-to-earn game.</p>
<h2>ELMO Token Is Up 69,458%, But Already Falling</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While ELMO has fallen quite dramatically in the past few hours, its chart offers some hope in that it has already recovered once from a big drop.</p>
<p>As readers can see below, the Elmo-themed meme token reached a couple of peaks during the middle of yesterday, before crashing towards the early hours of this morning.</p>
<figure id="attachment_159292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159292" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-159292" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706704143-elmo-token-price-chart.png" alt="ELMO token price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706704143-elmo-token-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706704143-elmo-token-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706704143-elmo-token-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706704143-elmo-token-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706704143-elmo-token-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706704143-elmo-token-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706704143-elmo-token-price-chart-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-159292" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it staged a comeback a few hours later, almost topping its current record high.</p>
<p>Yet it has fallen back down again, inviting doubts as to whether it can stage another temporary comeback, let alone a sustained recovery.</p>
<p>For this reason, it would be somewhat risky to invest in the ELMO token at this point, even if buying the dip is often a good idea with much more established – and fundamentally stronger – cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Indeed, analysis suggests that around 25% of all ELMO tokens are held in the token&#8217;s main contract, highlighting a risk of a big dump.</p>
<p>So even if it may recover again for a brief period, traders should prepare for the possibility that it will continue to fall soon afterwards.</p>
<h2>Crypto Analysts Say This Lesser Known Crypto is Next</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
And it&#8217;s not even necessary to invest in extremely risky tokens such as ELMO, at least not when there are other high-potential coins that also offer something in the way of actual utility.</p>
<p>A very good example of such a token is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/sponge">Sponge (SPONGE)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that is currently in the process of rolling out the second version of its token.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Already <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SPONGEUSDT">up by 42% in the past month</a>, it originally listed on exchanges in April 2023, when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sponge-best-crypto-buy-today-new-meme-coin-spongebob-might-100x-1.htm">it rallied by more than 150%</a>.</span></p>
<p>The second version of its coin, known as SPONGE V2, will feature a new and more rewarding staking model, while it will also be the native token for a new play-to-earn game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/RNDRUSDT">Manta price</a> has dived by 10% in the past 24 hours, falling to $3.17 as the wider crypto market endures a 2.5% loss today.</p>
<p>Despite this fall, MANTA remains up by 13% in the past week, as well as 57% up since the layer-two coin listed earlier in the month.</p>
<p>Yet it has lost 17% since it reached a record high three days ago, with the possibility remaining of further pain to come in the shorter term.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t the only high-potential new token in the market, however, with Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) raising over $10 million as it gears up for what could be a big launch.</p>
<h2>Is Manta Network Going to Crash? MANTA Price Drops 5% as New Cloud Mining Project Lures Global Investors</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Based on MANTA&#8217;s chart, it looks like the new altcoin is in the middle of a correction, with its indicators all crashing.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple), for example, dropped below 30 earlier this morning, a sign of very strong selling pressure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_159230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159230" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-159230" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706700082-manta-price-chart.png" alt="Manta price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706700082-manta-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706700082-manta-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706700082-manta-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706700082-manta-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706700082-manta-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706700082-manta-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706700082-manta-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-159230" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, its short-term moving average (yellow) has begun dropping steeply towards its long-term average (blue), again providing a clear sign of a correcting price.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting though is that its support level (green) has just resisted a fall below $3.15, suggesting that the coin may not fall much further.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s particularly encouraging for such a new token is that its trading volume is relatively high, at $320 million.</p>
<p>It was even higher at various points earlier in the month, reaching $600 million and even $800 million after listing, volumes which exceeded those for numerous more established tokens.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>One of the reasons why interest in MANTA was so high is that the Manta Network has quickly become one of the biggest Ethereum-based layer-two networks in crypto.</p>
<p>It currently <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Manta">accounts for $466 million in total value locked in</a>, more than TVLs for Cardano and Bitcoin, for example.</p>
<p>Its TVL has grown by nearly 2,500% since the middle of December, a strong sign of network adoption.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And this is likely to continue, with the Manta Network providing a more simplified platform for deploying applications that use zero-knowledge proofs.</p>
<p>As such, the MANTA price could reach $4 in the next few weeks, before hitting $6 by the summer.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As bright as Manta&#8217;s future seems, it isn&#8217;t the only new altcoin that&#8217;s showing plenty of promise right now.</p>
<p>In fact, there&#8217;s a very wide variety of new tokens that are gaining momentum, with several presale coins looking as though they&#8217;re on course for very big listings in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Probably the likeliest candidate amongst the current crop to do well is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en" rel="sponsored">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a>, an<span style="font-size: 16px;"> Ethereum-based stake-to-mine platform that has raised $10 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s presale has been a success because its platform offers something fairly unique, which is the ability to mine Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native token, BTCMTX.</span></p>
<p>Doing this earns users tokenized mining credits, which they can then use to claim Bitcoin hashing power.</p>
<p>In turn, users will receive a share in mined BTC, which could be about to rise strongly in price, given that the next Bitcoin halving is coming in April.</p>
<p>On top of this, stakers will receive a steady income in the form of BTCMTX.</p>
<p>Combined with its user-friendly interface, the profitability of Bitcoin Minetrix could make it a very big hit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/RNDRUSDT">RNDR price</a> has risen by 3.5% today, pushing to $4.60 as the cryptocurrency market suffers a 1% dip in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This movement means that RNDR has gained by 21% in a week and by 2% in a month, with the altcoin also sitting on a very healthy 275% gain in a year.</p>
<p>Much of its recent growth has followed from its ongoing migration to Solana, with major exchange Coinbase recently announcing its intention to list the Solana-based version of the token in the near future.</p>
<p>Yet Render&#8217;s performance may have put it in an overbought position, so traders may prefer to invest in smaller cap alternatives at the moment, with Meme Kombat&#8217;s (MK) increasingly successful presale suggesting that it could rally vigorously soon.</p>
<h2>Is It Too Late to Buy Render? RNDR Price Blasts Up</h2>

RNDR&#8217;s indicators suggest that it&#8217;s regaining momentum after a fortnight-long lull, with its relative strength index (purple) rising to 60 overnight.</p>
<p>This signals growing buying pressure and demand, as does the fact that the coin&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has begun rising again, putting further distance between itself and the 200-day average.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also encouraging that RNDR&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume has jumped from around $60 million a few days ago to $250 million as of writing.</p>
<p>Again, this suggests that traders are going for the alt in a big way, and there&#8217;s one clear short-term trigger for today&#8217;s rise: Coinbase.</p>

<p>The US-based major exchange <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/blog/increasing-transparency-for-new-asset-listings-on-coinbase">has added Render to its roadmap for listing</a>, indicating that it will soon list the token.</p>
<p>However, it should be added that it will be listing the newer Solana-based version of the coin, with Render in the process of fully migrating from Ethereum to Solana.</p>
<p>This transition – which ultimately will see the ERC-20 version of the coin become inactive – has been another key factor in Render&#8217;s recent joys, with the coin basically doubling in price since mid-November.</p>
<p>Another big reason for RNDR&#8217;s fortunes is that the market believes the Render Network will attract increasing adoption, particularly as AI becomes a bigger and bigger part of the global economy.</p>

<p>If so, the RNDR price could reach $6 by the summer and potentially pass its current ATH ($8.78) by the end of the year, particularly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/expect-massive-inflows-to-follow-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-but-bull-market-is-still-in-question-experts-say.htm">if the wider market enters a bull phase</a>.</p>
<h2>Innovative Meme Coin Raises $7.7 Million</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As strong as RNDR looks now, it&#8217;s arguable that its rise is another example of a &#8216;buy the rumor, sell the news&#8217; event.</p>
<p>As such, some traders may feel more comfortable turning to newer tokens already, with the market boasting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-top-crypto-presales-2024-unveiling-most-anticipated-calsona-gxcce/">a wide selection of promising new alts and presale tokens</a>.</p>
<p>One of the hottest right now is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="//cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat%5C%22" rel="sponsored">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 coin that has raised $7.7 million in its soon-to-be-finishing presale.</span></p>

<p>What makes Meme Kombat innovative as a meme token is that it&#8217;s also a social gambling platform, providing users with the opportunity to bet on the results of AI-generated battles between meme characters.</p>
<p>Users place bets using the MK token, with the platform paying out winnings in the form of MK as well.</p>
<p>Holders can stake MK for a passive staking income, which comes in addition to any winnings.</p>
<p>Importantly, the use of AI will ensure that results are completely random, while the use of blockchain and smart contracts will also ensure full transparency.</p>
<p>Such a setup helps to explain why Meme Kombat&#8217;s presale has already done so well, with investors also drawn by its use of memes, which have proven so effective in boosting cryptos over the years.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also promising that Meme Kombat has already established a strong online following, with <a href="https://twitter.com/Meme_Kombat/status/1752181484759224550">its Telegram channel boasting close to 10,000 members already</a>.</p>
<p>Its sale will end once it raises $10 million, with newcomers still able to join by going to <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="//cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat%5C%22" rel="sponsored">the official Meme Kombat website</a>.</p>
<p>It has reached its final presale price of $0.279, yet it could rise much, much higher once it lists in the coming weeks.</p>
