										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple executive chairman and co-founder Chris Larsen has taken to social media to clarify reports of the payment protocol being hacked on Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Larsen&#8217;s Accounts Hacked</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“Yesterday, there was unauthorized access to a few of my personal XRP accounts (not<a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple"> @Ripple</a>) – we were quickly able to catch the problem and notify exchanges to freeze the affected addresses,” <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislarsensf/status/1752702297971532258">Larsen posted to X</a>. “Law enforcement is already involved.”</p>
<p>Before Larsen&#8217;s clarification, X user ZachXBT posted data detailing the hack, which totaled more than $112.5 million worth of stolen XRP.</p>
<p>“So far the stolen funds have been laundered through MEXC, Gate, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, HitBTC, etc.,” ZachXBT posted.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It appears <a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Ripple</a> was hacked for ~213M XRP ($112.5M)</p>
<p>Source address<br />rJNLz3A1qPKfWCtJLPhmMZAfBkutC2Qojm</p>
<p>So far the stolen funds have been laundered through MEXC, Gate, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, HitBTC, etc <a href="https://t.co/HKGYsLQeMv">pic.twitter.com/HKGYsLQeMv</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1752694489905528943?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>XRP Dips in Value</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Following news of the hack, the price of XRP plummeted by more than 5%. The token’s value was able to course correct slightly, however, with the cryptocurrency <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">down by 4%</a> as of late Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>It appears as though Ripple users’ accounts have been untouched by hackers at the moment.</p>
<p>Despite this, not everyone on social media was pleased with Larsen’s statement regarding the hack.</p>
<p>“So if Zach never reported it,” one X user wrote in response, “you wouldn’t tell the public?”</p>
<p>“Totally completely separate entities… *wink* *wink*,” ZachXBT replied.</p>
<h2>Crypto Hacks–A Recurring Problem Beyond Ripple</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
News of Larsen’s accounts being hacked is part of an ongoing security issue, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-lost-127m-to-hackers-in-january-2024-more-crypto-news.htm">Immunefi statistics</a> revealing nearly $127 million went into the hands of hackers and fraudsters across 19 specific incidents in January 2024 alone.</p>
<p>The number marks a drastic increase in crypto losses year-over-year, with January 2024’s total six times the amount taken illegally in January 2023. DeFi has been the primary target for hackers and fraudsters throughout the first month of 2024.</p>
<p>Just three weeks ago, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/x-confirms-us-secs-official-account-was-indeed-hacked.htm">(SEC) X account was hacked</a> shortly before the federal agency approved spot bitcoin ETFs, prompting further scrutiny from the crypto community.</p>
<p>“I do think the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, is a political liability in the United States,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/ripple-ceo-calls-us-sec-chair-gary-gensler-a-political-liability.html?taid=65a656a3e3a6540001804cba&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter%7Cmain%5C%22">Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC</a>. “And I think he’s not acting in the interests of the citizenry, he’s not acting in the interests of the long-term growth of the economy, and I don’t understand it.”</p>
<p>Ripple and the SEC have experienced gridlock with each other before, with a judge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-receives-permission-to-file-sur-reply-to-correct-factual-mischaracterization-by-the-sec.htm">partially ruling in favor of Ripple’s argument</a> that XRP is not a security during a lawsuit brought forward by the federal agency in July 2023.</p>
<p>“I think at some point there will be a new chair of the SEC, and I think that will be a good thing for the American people,” Garlinghouse stated.</p>

<p>Popular Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Abracadabra Money fell victim to a platform attack on January 30.</p>
<p>Announcing the incident on its <a href="https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell/status/1752286636740579440">official X (formerly Twitter) handle</a>, the DeFi protocol stated that it is aware of an exploit on its platform that involved ‘certain cauldrons on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/forget-ethereum-this-rival-token-priced-at-0-09-will-reach-16-in-2024.htm">Ethereum</a>.’ Its engineering team is investigating the situation, they noted.</p>

<h2><strong>The Financial Impact on Abracadabra Money</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In an effort to mitigate the impact of the crypto theft, the Abracadabra <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-dao.htm">decentralized autonomous organization</a> (DAO) treasury will be buying back its Magic Internet Money (MIM) tokens from the market for burning.</p>
<p>While the platform has been forthcoming about the platform hack, it did not disclose how much in funds were stolen by the malicious actor.</p>
<p>Providing further details on the hack, <a href="https://twitter.com/CyversAlerts/status/1752286446776451346">Cyvers Alerts revealed on social media</a> that the perpetrator managed to abscond with $6.5 million in crypto assets. This resulted in over 2,740 Ether tokens being illicitly withdrawn from the Abracadabra Money platform&#8217;s wallet address.</p>
<p>Around $4 million out of the pilfered loot was then transferred to a new Ethereum-based wallet address.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to blockchain security and analytics firm Peckshield, the hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1752296539085840869">executed</a> the cyberattack using an initial 1 Ether funded through the US-sanctioned crypto mixing protocol Tornado Cash.</p>
<h2>Crypto Thefts Dipped 54% in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Abracadabra Money is a non-custodial stablecoin DeFi lending protocol that enables users to deposit various crypto assets as collateral and receive its MIM token in return.</p>
<p>Subsequently, users can trade or lock up these DeFi tokens on other <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-build-decentralized-application-dapp.htm">decentralized application</a> (dApp) platforms to generate passive income.</p>
<p>The recent hack on the platform is not an isolated event but rather part of a trend in the crypto industry, particularly within the DeFi sub-sector.</p>
<p>Since its launch in August 2020, smart contract-backed financial systems have consistently been targeted by various cyber threat groups.</p>
<p>In 2021 alone, <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2022-defi-hacks/">DeFi projects incurred losses exceeding $3.2 billion</a>, primarily within the blockchain-based financial system.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-hacking-stolen-funds-2024/#:~:text=Hacks%20of%20DeFi%20protocols%20largely,in%20DeFi%20hacks%20in%202022.">total losses in 2022 decreased to $3.1 billion</a>, the trend has continued to decline in the past year. According to a Chainalysis annual report, total crypto losses in 2023 amounted to $1.7 billion, indicating a considerable 54.3% drop from the previous year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Funds stolen from crypto platforms in 2023 fell 54.3% to $1.7 billion. This is mostly due to a drop in DeFi hacking, which drove the increase in stolen crypto that we saw in 2021 and 2022. However, there still were several large DeFi hacks in 2023. <a href="https://t.co/s8Ix982HR2">pic.twitter.com/s8Ix982HR2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Chainalysis (@chainalysis) <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1750156780657680864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite the drop in fiat value stolen, the report highlighted a slight increase in the number of cyber threats compared to 2022. In 2022, there were 219 cyber threats, which rose to 231 in 2023, according to the blockchain security firm.</p>
<p>The report also delves into the role of bad actors, with the North Korea-backed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-koreas-lazarus-group-moves-1-2m-bitcoin-from-coin-mixer-to-holding-wallet.htm">Lazarus Group</a> notably standing out. Chainalysis revealed that this cyber threat group accounted for $1 billion out of the $1.7 billion total losses and launched a record number of 20 attacks.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Value lost in DeFi hacks declined by 63.7% YoY. <a href="https://twitter.com/mgimenezaguilar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mgimenezaguilar</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/HalbornSecurity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HalbornSecurity</a> shared potential reasons behind this decline, citing DeFi security improvements, but also the overall drop in DeFi TVL, which may have reduced funds available to steal.</p>
<p>&mdash; Chainalysis (@chainalysis) <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1750156783518122388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Giving reasons behind a lower loss ratio, Chainalysis stated that better security measures and lower amounts of digital assets in the DeFi space played important roles.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>Known for his role as Commander William Riker in Star Trek, Frakes has a bevy of directing titles under his belt, including </span><i><span>Burn Notice</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Roswell</span></i><span>, and two </span><i><span>Star Trek</span></i><span> films. Garzik, who previously worked as a<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-history/"> prominent developer of Bitcoin</a> Core and, opened NextCypher in 2022.</span><span>&ldquo;I launched NextCypher to capitalize on the appetite for innovative, high-quality genre entertainment,&rdquo; Garzik </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/jonathan-frakes-deathlands-jeff-garzik-tv-adaptation-1235803252/"><span>told Deadline</span></a><span>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see the market aligning with our vision of producing smartly budgeted, and exceptional content for a global audience.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2>&#8220;Hope, romance, and resilience in the face of adversity&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>Originally published in 1986, </span><i><span>Deathlands</span></i><span> takes place in a post-apoclyptic world and follows a group of survivors who must band together as they utilize telportation techynology to traverse their unforgiving landscape.</span><span>&ldquo;With a series that is gritty, suspenseful, and action-packed, with a sense of hope, romance, and resilience in the face of adversity, I cannot imagine anyone better to bring </span><i><span>Deathlands </span></i><span>to the screen than visionary director, Jonathan Frakes,&rdquo; Altman told Deadline.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled to have him onboard to ensure the series will be appointment television for viewers everywhere.&rdquo;</span><span>Currently, shooting is scheduled for this spring in Bulgaria. Garzik is serving alongside Thomas P. Vitale as executive producer, with Mark A. Altman as both showrunner and executive producer. International sales are being Tai Truesdell and Bertrand Reignier of Rogue Wave Entertainment, with casting by Christine Sheaks.</span><span>&ldquo;One of the things that I find so compelling about </span><i><span>Deathlands</span></i><span> is that it&rsquo;s a series about hope and the chance to build a better world,&rdquo; Frakes told Deadline. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about the opportunity to bring this show, combining feature-level action and compelling character drama, to the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>There&#8217;s more action-packed series to come from Garzik</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>Yet, Deathlands is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-report-highlights-resurgence-in-defi-and-nft-sectors.htm">just the tip of the iceberg</a> for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">Web3 production studio</a>.&nbsp;</span><span>NextCypher is also developing another sci-fi series about a woman who loses her memory on a quest to &ldquo;save the outcasts of society from a deadly conspiracy that threatens to destroy the future.&rdquo;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><i><span>Deathlands</span></i><span> is an ideal launchpad for us, especially considering the success of similar post-apocalyptic series based on successful IPs like </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span> and the eagerly anticipated </span><i><span>Fallout,&rdquo; </span></i><span>Garzik said.</span><span>A release date is yet to be announced.</span><br style="font-weight: 400"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent statistics <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/artificial-intelligence/worldwide">show</a> that the artificial intelligence (AI) market size is expected to reach over $3 billion this year. Therefore, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that a number of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/ai-crypto-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto-focused companies have started to incorporate AI</a> into their products.</p>
<h2><b>Why companies are combining crypto with AI</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Jacqueline Burns-Koven, head of cyber threat intelligence for Chainalysis – a blockchain analysis firm – told Cryptonews that Chainalysis has started thinking about ways to use AI to make compliance, risk, investigations and growth products better for customers. “Like any business, we stand to benefit by utilizing AI to improve how we work across the business; by making it faster and more efficient,” Burns-Koven said.</p>
<p>Crypto tax software provider ZenLedger also <a href="https://www.zenledger.io/blog/zenledger-and-april-revolutionize-tax-filing-with-end-to-end-experience-for-crypto-traders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently</a> announced a partnership with april – an AI-powered financial company – to use AI to simplify the tax filing process for users. Pat Larsen, co-founder and CEO of ZenLedger, told Cryptonews that ZenLedger’s new product will leverage april’s technology to route taxpayers through a single flow, combining federal and state, and then deciding which question to ask next. “This is in contrast to traditional tax filing software that asks questions of the user in the order the forms are completed, and then parses out federal and state forms into separate sections, often duplicating the same questions in each,” Larsen said.</p>
<p>Daniel Marcous, CTO and co-founder of april, told Cryptonews that AI has been instrumental to april’s ability to build a tax product covering many common tax scenarios, including income from crypto and digital assets. According to Marcous, april uses a process called “tax-to-code” in which large language models (LLMs) have been trained to read tax documents and then turn those into software code which is then reviewed and edited by a team of tax engineers.</p>
<p>AI is also helping power a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. Nick Emmons, co-founder and CEO of Upshot – an AI infrastructure company – told Cryptonews that Upshot is building a decentralized network where different AI models can learn from each other. According to Emmons, having models learn off each other will create a meta intelligence across an AI-powered network. In turn, this will make networks more performant and intelligent compared with individual models being used.</p>
<p>Emmons explained that Upshot’s AI model is powering a number of DeFi use cases. For example, he explained that AI can create efficiencies for price feeds for long-tail crypto assets, or digital assets that don’t often trade but exist in liquid settings. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“AI becomes a useful tool for being able to produce more frequent price updates based on different information, not just an asset changing hands. This means that we can now start to bring a much larger universe of assets into the DeFi design space.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To put this in perspective, Emmons explained that Upshot will soon introduce “watch perps” generated by AI-enabled watch feeds. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“An individual watch is incapable of producing a real enough time feed to build a market around it. AI models can process a lot of information at once, so you can start to produce highly accurate and high frequency price feeds to turn digital assets into on-chain, tokenized representations. This will expand the universe of digital assets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, Emmons pointed out that AI-powered DeFi vaults are coming to fruition. A DeFi vault acts as a pool of funds with an auto-compounding strategy that manages and performs tasks based on predefined on-chain conditions. Yet Emmons noted that this is problematic given that most on-chain activity is limited when it comes to compute power. “As such, the yield a user can generate is limited,” he said.</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, Emmons noted that AI models can be applied to make sense of information more efficiently. “AI can be used to codify strategies that can be brought on-chain in the form of vaults. This can then be used for market making and more.”</p>
<p>Although this use case is still in its infancy, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240116356253/en/RoboNet%E2%80%99s-Vaults-Bring-AI-Powered-Strategies-to-DeFi-and-NFTs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RoboNet</a> is an AI-powered DeFi protocol for long-tail and fungible asset markets. RoboNet is powered by Upshot and allows for the creation of on-chain vaults managed by machine learning models that generate yield through automated liquidity optimization strategies.</p>

<h2><b>Challenges combing AI with crypto</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While AI can help crypto products perform more efficiently, there are still a number of challenges to consider. For example, Emmons pointed out that when AI is leveraged for building DeFi protocols, the creators behind those models need to be trusted, otherwise a number of issues could occur. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bias and manipulation can arise, which is why it’s important to reimagine the AI stack in decentralized form factors. Different models can keep other models in check to create less bias and a more transparent source of intelligence.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Emmons explained that <a href="https://protocol.ai/blog/zero-knowledge-proofs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZK proofs</a> can also help verify machine learning models. “Upshot recently released a product like this where we verified the output of our flagship price prediction model inside a ZK circuit. This provides assurance and computational integrity for permissionless protocols.”</p>
<p>Marcous added that he believes generative AI working alongside tax experts and engineers mitigates risk since a human is involved. “At april, we conduct a rigorous testing process on the entirety of the product and have to pass tests with the Internal Revenue Service and state authorities before launching,” he said.</p>
<p>While these tactics may be helpful, the lack of regulations around the use of AI will likely present ongoing challenges. For instance, understanding whether or not AI is being applied for the best interest of users versus investors or the creators of machine learning models remains difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Due to this, certain countries have started to establish organizations to enforce AI regulations. For example, the president of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, recently issued a law to establish the Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Council (AIATC). An <a href="https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/en/government-affairs/in-his-capacity-as-ruler-of-abu-dhabi-uae-president-issues-law-establishing-artificial-intelligence-and-advanced-technology-council/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> from the Abu Dhabi government noted that, “the council will be responsible for developing and implementing policies and strategies related to research, infrastructure and investments in artificial intelligence and advanced technology in Abu Dhabi.”</p>
<p>United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler also recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gary-gensler-warns-about-ais-impact-to-financial-systems-doesnt-touch-on-cryptocurrency.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned about the dangers that AI could pose</a> to the traditional financial sector. Given this, more regulatory clarity around AI will likely be implemented in the U.S. in the future.</p>
<p>All of these developments are important, as Emmons believes that AI will eventually be incorporated into every critical function of society. In the meantime, he pointed out that the crypto sector will likely incorporate forms of AI that have already been implemented in traditional financial systems. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is because crypto is a financial innovation, so this type of AI can be more conducive with financial applications. Also, classical types of machine learning models are more attractive and compatible with these verifiable form factors, so cryptographic tooling that can be built around those will be able to come online faster than generative AI models.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of open-source technology provider <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/komodo/"><strong>Komodo Platform</strong></a>, talked to <em>Cryptonews</em> about the current crypto investment sentiment, incoming &#8220;major&#8221; institutional investments, and the renewed rise of decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unstoppable-and-push-protocol-launch-token-gated-chat-more-crypto-news.htm">DeFi</a>).</p>
<p>The expert further shared interesting insights into major themes that will define 2024, non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-25-january.htm">NFT</a>) use cases leading to increased interest, the US SEC Chair&#8217;s disinterest in the crypto industry&#8217;s opinion, and more.</p>
<p>Read on to learn what he told us.</p>
<h2>Investors are Enthusiastic, But Cautious</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency space is not easy to predict as it&#8217;s ever-changing. That said, Stadelmann shared that for most retail investors, enthusiasm is driven by the potential of crypto. At the same time, caution persists due to market volatility and regulatory uncertainties.</p>
<p>When it comes to institutional investors, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has created a wave of optimism and signals growing confidence that crypto will only gain more momentum over the next few years.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Stadelmann noted that the crypto market’s short-term trends remain tied to macroeconomic factors. These significantly influence investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Speaking of hard-to-predict areas: crypto market&#8217;s price trends and news events. However, Stadelmann said there are some possible themes to consider.</p>
<p>As said, the US <strong>Securities and Exchanges Commission</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-blames-social-media-account-hack-on-sim-swap-attack-in-fake-bitcoin-etf-post.htm">SEC</a>) finally approved the first round of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/castle-fund-just-because-bitcoin-etfs-are-allowed-doesnt-mean-theyll-succeed.htm">ETFs</a>) in January. Per the CTO,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Although the initial hype around this news has since faded, major investments from institutions are only beginning.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, throughout February and the rest of 2024, we’ll see more of these large players from TradFi start to enter the crypto space.</p>
<figure id="attachment_156731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156731" style="width: 2401px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-156731" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes.png" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes.png 2401w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-300x157.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-1024x537.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-768x403.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-1536x806.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197433-bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption-text">The daily volume (in USD) for spot bitcoin ETFs. Source: theblock.co</figcaption></figure>
<p>Therefore, we&#8217;ll soon see to what extent institutional investors and ETFs factor into the market’s price movement.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note the anticipation building around the next <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">Bitcoin halving</a>, expected in April.</p>
<p>Halvings typically signal the start of a new bull market cycle for BTC – but also for altcoins. It will be interesting to see, Stadelmann said, if BTC and/or altcoins can reach new all-time highs post-halving.</p>
<h2>DeFi Market Poised to Grow Again</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Things have significantly changed for DeFi between 2022 and 2024. And the shift goes beyond crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/expect-massive-inflows-to-follow-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-but-bull-market-is-still-in-question-experts-say.htm">market</a> prices.</p>
<p>The bear market of 2022 brought numerous challenges to many DeFi projects, Stadelmann said. This includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-atm-vulnerability-fixed-hackers-could-have-gained-full-control.htm">vulnerabilities</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-setback-smart-contract-exploit-results-over-200-ethscriptions-being-nabbed.htm">smart contract exploits</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/regulatory-uncertainty-makes-poloniex-deeply-frustrated-3887.htm">regulatory uncertainties</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>And these remain major concerns in 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also during 2022, DeFi&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) went from more than $150 billion to less than $40 billion. However, as of January 2024, TVL has rebounded to $55 billion at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The CTO opined,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The space appears poised to grow once again.”</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_156727" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156727" style="width: 1192px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-156727" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama.png" alt="" width="1192" height="330" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama.png 1192w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama-300x83.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama-1024x283.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama-768x213.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706197215-tvl-defillama-150x42.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1192px) 100vw, 1192px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-156727" class="wp-caption-text">Source: defillama.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another noteworthy shift since 2022 has been the maturation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-dominates-with-nearly-50-of-ethereum-layer-2-total-value-locked.htm">Layer 2</a> (L2) blockchain networks, which has increased scalability and reduced transaction costs. DeFi applications on these networks are now usable from a cost perspective, said the expert.</p>
<p>Also, cross-chain interoperability developments have contributed to a more united DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Major Themes for 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We’ve already noted the potential future movements in crypto prices, investment sentiment, and DeFi markets.</p>
<p>But 2024 has much more to offer. Stadelmann listed the year’s major themes. He said these will gain more importance even beyond 2024 as the crypto space matures.</p>
<p>First and foremost, he said, is the interoperability among different <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-association-addresses-sen-warrens-criticism-of-crypto-hires.htm">blockchain</a> networks.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the blockchain space diversifies, the need for users to trade across blockchains will only continue to increase.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the CTO’s opinion, more users will turn to peer-to-peer (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/p2p-crypto-platform-paxful-resumes-operations-led-by-delaware-lawyer-heres-latest.htm">P2P</a>) bridge solutions, like the one offered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/last-minute-crypto-gift-ideas-for-tech-natives-and-newcomers.htm"><strong>Komodo Wallet</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Next: L2s will continue to grow and witness accelerated adoption. More users are moving into the DeFi space and are using decentralized apps (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ledger-removes-bug-allowing-popular-decentralized-applications-to-be-compromised-heres-the-latest.htm">dapps</a>) more frequently. Hence, it is critical to alleviate Layer 1 congestion and reduce transaction costs by processing a significant portion of transactions off-chain.</p>
<p>Stadelmann said that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The ongoing development and adoption of L2 solutions signify a crucial step towards achieving mainstream scalability for blockchain technology.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Gary Gensler is Not Interested in Crypto Industry’s Opinion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The central theme for 2024, Stadelmann said, is the pursuit of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-senator-says-lack-of-regulatory-clarity-driving-crypto-outside-us.htm">regulatory clarity</a>. And greater certainty will, hopefully, create a catalyst for accelerated market growth.</p>
<p>Governments and regulatory bodies globally are increasingly engaging with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptocurrency-industry-spends-record-18-96-million-in-federal-lobbying-so-far-in-2023.htm">the crypto industry</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Stadelmann recently <a href="https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/01/08/open-letter-gary-gensler-decision-define-sec-legacy/">wrote an open lette</a>r to SEC Chair <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gary-gensler-warns-about-ais-impact-to-financial-systems-doesnt-touch-on-cryptocurrency.htm">Gary Gensler</a>. Asked if Gensler is interested in hearing the crypto industry’s opinions, Stadelmann replied that he doesn’t think so.</p>
<p>One positive move from Gensler’s administration was the approval of new ETFs. And yet,</p>
<blockquote><p>“After years of delays, the main factor for approval was likely political pressure from capital-rich institutions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, we have seen very little movement to protect investors or make crypto more accessible to investors, he said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SEC enforcement actions against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-faces-sec-pressure-for-financial-transparency-in-ongoing-legal-saga.htm"><strong>Ripple</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/judge-to-address-in-binance-case-are-cryptocurrencies-securities-under-u-s-law.htm"><strong>Binance</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-gives-coinbase-shot-at-full-dismissal-in-sec-case.htm"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm"><strong>Kraken</strong></a> have stunted the potential growth of the crypto industry. And while the agency has clear evidence against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-likens-binance-ftx-expresses-concern-over-crypto-industry.htm"><strong>FTX</strong></a> and “other industry players that have blatantly hurt investors,” argued Stadelmann, Gensler decided not to focus on these issues.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>NFT Use Cases Wil Result in More Interest</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finally, non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/magic-eden-rewards-top-nft-news-today-24-january.htm">NFTs</a>), despite discussions of their decline, are here to stay.</p>
<p>Stadelmann said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am optimistic about their future in 2024 and beyond. The NFT market has undergone a major shift in focus, expanding beyond digital art to include gaming, virtual real estate, and metaverse-related assets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Industries will continue to adopt NFT technology. Subsequently, use cases will diversify and lead to renewed interest.</p>
<p>“I predict we’ll see NFT become more integrated with real-world assets, which will provide unique experiences that go beyond simple digital ownership,” the CTO opined.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Why Don’t We Have DeFi Simplicity Yet?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It’s been said for years that simplicity and ease of use are the answer to DeFi’s adoption issues. Stadelmann argues that achieving this goal has proven to be a difficult task.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle is the inherent complexity of DeFi processes involving <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/liquidity-pool-comprising-paypals-pyusd-stablecoin-on-curve-locks-135-million-in-value.htm">liquidity pools</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-yield-farming.htm#:~:text=Yield%20farming%2C%20to%20put%20it,they%20come%20with%20high%20risk.">yield farming</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Balancing user-friendly interfaces with the intricacies of blockchain technology presents a non-stop challenge.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some potential solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhance user education through comprehensive tutorials; e.g. users taking the time to learn about the fundamentals of blockchain technology and how to use specific DeFi platforms;</li>
<li>simplify the DeFi onboarding process for crypto newcomers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Komodo Wallet, for example, recently added a <a href="https://app.komodoplatform.com/#/fiat">fiat on-ramp</a>, lowering the barrier to DeFi market participation. Users can directly buy crypto with fiat instead of signing up for a centralized exchange account and learning how to transfer assets on-chain.</p>
<h2>Year of the Dragon Brings New Roadmap</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Stadelmann couldn’t share any specific Komodo’s plans for 2024, but said that it will focus on enhancing blockchain interoperability to unify the DeFi space.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We plan to release our 2024 roadmap on Chinese New Year, which falls on February 10, 2024, as it marks the beginning of the Year of the Dragon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, in December, the platform added the above-mentioned fiat on-ramp to Komodo Wallet (web) that supports providers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brazils-central-bank-pix-joins-ramp-networks-payment-solutions.htm"><strong>Ramp</strong></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-banxa-and-cardanos-yoroi-wallet-enable-in-app-fiat-on-off-ramping-bybit-reveals-personality-based-trading-nft-usdt-competition.htm"><strong>Banxa</strong></a>, which support bank transfers, <strong>Apple Pay</strong>, <strong>Visa</strong>/<strong>Mastercard</strong> cards, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In collaboration with Warner Music Group (WMG), Polygon Labs has unveiled the two grant recipients for the inaugural Web3 Music Accelerator program. The initiative, announced in June 2023, aims to foster innovation at the intersection of Web3 and the music industry.</p>
<p>The Web3 Music Accelerator program offers endorsements from WMG and Polygon Labs, strategic advice, networking opportunities, and marketing and promotion support, and it is backed by blockchain infrastructure developers like CertiK, Coinflow, and Tatum.</p>
<p>Over 120 applications were submitted for the program, and the selected projects were chosen based on various criteria, including nurturing artist-fan communities, decentralized music production and distribution systems, ticketing solutions, collectibles and merchandise, and integrating music with interactive technology and gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wmg.com/news/warner-music-group-and-polygon-labs-announce-recipients-of-the-inaugural-web3-music-accelerator-program-to-power-the-next-great-evolution-of-the-music-industry-through-blockchain-technology">According to WMG</a>, the first recipient is <strong>MITH</strong>, a fan engagement platform that enables artists to unlock AI-driven insights and analytics while maintaining ownership of their first-party data on audiences. It aims to provide a comprehensive view of each fan, enhancing the connection between artists and their audiences.</p>
<p>The second recipient is the <strong>Muus Collective</strong>, which develops fashion-centric experiences, including mobile games, entertainment, and digital collectibles. This project explores the music industry&#8217;s convergence of fashion and digital experiences.</p>
<p>Jilian Rothman, Vice President of New Business and Ventures at WMG, emphasized the importance of providing meaningful ways for artists and fans to connect and enabling fans to express their fandom. He said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;MITH and Muus Collective are the perfect platforms to launch with WMG and Polygon Labs’ Web3 Music Accelerator because of their fan-first approaches to building communities across music and fashion. Providing meaningful ways for artists and fans to connect, and fans to express their fandom are at the core of WMG’s mission. We’re looking forward to seeing these companies grow, and exploring mutually beneficial innovation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Brian Trunzo, head of business development for North America at Polygon Labs, expressed excitement about witnessing decentralized innovation moving toward mainstream adoption. He said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re excited to see how quickly decentralized innovation is moving toward becoming fully mainstream, with forward-thinking projects uniting artists and creators with their numerous fans in never-before-seen ways. Both MITH and Muus Collective are best-in-class platforms redefining what’s possible in fan community engagement, and we are thrilled to welcome them as part of the Web3 Music Accelerator program.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Polygon Accelerates Web3 Music Platform Development with Warner Music Group Partnership</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last June, Warner Music Group (WMG) and Polygon Labs <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/warner-music-polygon-labs-unleash-power-of-blockchain-for-music-innovation-1.htm">launched a pioneering music accelerator program</a>, setting the stage to propel and co-support promising developers who are building the future of the music industry on Polygon protocols.</p>
<p>The Polygon ecosystem introduced a Developer Support Cohort to bolster this initiative, strategically designed to enhance accessibility to critical blockchain infrastructure, products, and services for select accelerator projects. This exclusive cohort consists of infrastructure and service providers committed to supporting the endeavor by offering special benefits such as discounts, vouchers, and premium services.</p>
<p>Polygon looks primed to become a hub for music-related Web3 projects. On December 6, the global entertainment giant Warner Music Group partnered with Polygon Studios and e-commerce and interactive platform builder LGN.io to build a Web3 music platform called LGND Music.</p>
<p>LGND Music, launched in January 2023, was designed to be a music and collectibles platform that supports &#8220;digital collectibles from any blockchain in a proprietary player,&#8221; enabling users to play their digital collectibles on the go. Around the same time, Polygon collaborated with Mastercard to initiate a Web3 accelerator program for musicians seeking to enter the space.</p>
<p>Web3 music platforms could disrupt the music industry and unlock new opportunities for creators and artists to innovate and monetize their content. Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/infographics/music-streaming/">forecast</a> that the global music industry could be worth $131 billion by 2030, and a significant portion of that could be integrated into Web3 environments.</p>

<p>On January 23, the nonprofit organization behind the <strong>Avalanche blockchain</strong> network announced a $100 million fund to support meme coins and other community coins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avax.network/blog/avalanche-foundation-eligibility-criteria-framework-for-community-coins">As described in their statement</a>, the Avalanche Foundation views meme coins as having high community value due to the culture and engagement they create. Through its <strong>Culture Catalyst</strong> program, the Foundation will deploy capital into select meme coins that meet established eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>&#8220;We note that meme coins generally have high community value because of the engagement, community spirit, and culture that they engender, which goes beyond the humor and virality that they embody,&#8221; stated the Foundation. &#8220;The Foundation embraces the full spectrum of creativity, culture, and camaraderie in the blockchain space.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">As you know, Avalanche Foundation has previously announced that it will invest in meme coins under the Culture Catalyst program. Today, the Foundation announced the Eligibility Criteria Framework for these. Moreover, they have named the meme coins much more beautifully: Community… <a href="https://t.co/AkP4qmDG6b">pic.twitter.com/AkP4qmDG6b</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Strict Eligibility Criteria for Meme Coin Fund</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With its new fund, the Avalanche Foundation will nurture the meme coin culture by providing capital to community coins that foster engagement.</p>
<p>Members must meet the following 11 criteria to become eligible for the meme coin fund:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fairly Launched</strong>: No team allocations, renounced contract ownership, locked liquidity, purchase limits to prevent whale abuse</li>
<li><strong>Snipe Bot Resistant</strong>: Whitelist opportunities for active Avalanche community members</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>: Verified contracts, audits, community vetting of creators, use of <a href="https://dexscreener.com/">tools like DexScreener</a></li>
<li><strong>High Holder Count</strong>: At least 2,000 unique holders</li>
<li><strong>Low Concentration</strong>: Top 100 holders owning less than 60% supply</li>
<li><strong>Broad Liquidity Provisioning</strong>: Large, locked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-5-liquidity-staking-programs-you-should-keep-an-eye-out-for-updated-february-2022.htm">liquidity pools</a> at launch</li>
<li><strong>High Liquidity</strong>: At least $200,000 in liquidity</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Providers</strong>: 50+ providers unless liquidity is renounced/burned</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Lifespan</strong>: In existence for at least one month</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Market Cap</strong>: At least $1 million fully diluted market cap</li>
<li><strong>Daily Trading Volume</strong>: Average of at least $100,000 daily volume for 2 weeks</li>
<li><strong>Native to Avalanche</strong>: Only exists on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/">Avalanche blockchain</a></li>
</ul>
<p>“The eligibility criteria are designed to identify community coin projects that show stability, growth potential, and a commitment to fair practices in the crypto world,” the announcement read.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Support Reflects Avalanche’s Commitment</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Avalanche Foundation will conduct the funding on an ongoing basis, allowing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">new projects</a> to potentially participate when ready. While meeting the criteria doesn’t guarantee funding, it communicates Avalanche’s values.</p>
<p>By supporting meme coin projects that meet its criteria, the Avalanche Foundation seeks to accelerate the development of a thriving culture and community on its blockchain. Memecoins and NFTs are seen as bringing creativity and camaraderie to the space.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Foundation’s meme coin fund is expected to boost Avalanche’s competitiveness in <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/decentralized-finance-defi-transformative-potential-and-associated-risks.htm">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi), as it offers incentives for projects to build on the ecosystem.</p>
<p>With $100 million now committed, the organization hopes to strengthen the Avalanche community by strategically nurturing viral meme coins and community tokens exhibiting staying power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Product development studio Pontem is launching an AI-powered chatbot dubbed Pontem.ai, capable of operating like a &ldquo;full-scale AI crypto assistant.&rdquo;
</p>
<h2>A crypto trader&rsquo;s best friend</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/pontem-launches-pontemai-an-ai-powered-chatbot-compatible-with-metamask-gmail-facebook-x-and-all-major-aptos-wallets-302040450.html">a press release from Pontem</a> on Tuesday, the chatbot can answer questions on emerging news and topics throughout the crypto ecosystem while even educating users on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/yield-farming-liquidity-mining-staking-and-their-risks.htm">how to buy NFTs, use yield farming, stake, and more</a>.</p>
<p>Currently in its beta version, Pontem.ai will require some additional development before it is formally released to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;The basic ChatGPT model doesn&#8217;t know what happened in crypto after September 2021, so any AI crypto project requires a lot of additional training,&rdquo; Said Alejo Pinto, co-founder of Pontem.
</p>
<h2>&ldquo;A valuable up-to-date resource for the industry&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Pontem&rsquo;s chatbot will eventually possess the capability for image generation, allowing users &ldquo;to display a price chart or other technical indicator for a specific coin on the timeframe they need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The product development studio states that Pontem.ai &ldquo;has a wider set of features than the few other <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chaingpt-facilitates-the-launch-of-the-gt-protocol-bringing-ai-powered-auto-trading-to-crypto.htm">crypto chatbots </a>currently in the market&rdquo; as a majority &ldquo;limit information that can be asked to their own product or ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re using a mix of curated data that includes Pontem&#8217;s own content, on-chain data, content by Aptos Foundation, and top blockchain projects that cover Move, Ethereum DeFi, and more,&rdquo; Pinto continued. &ldquo;By continuously testing the model through feeding it new data loops, we feel we have created a valuable up-to-date resource for the industry.&#8221;
</p>
<h2>Pontem completes successful seed round</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
This past week, Pontem announced <a href="https://pontem.network/posts/pontem-raises-6m-from-lightspeed-faction-aptos-foundation-pantera-capital-10-more">that it had raised $6 million</a> in its latest funding round, with investors such as Wintermute, Kraken Ventures, Lightspeed Faction, Pantera Capital, Aptos Foundation, Shima Capital, and more contributing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pantera is excited to be investing into Pontem and help fuel the Move and Aptos ecosystem,&rdquo; Managing Partner at Pantera Capital, Paul Veradittakit, said. &ldquo;We believe the team has been doing a tremendous job of building the necessary financial and technical infrastructure to bring consumers and developers to the decentralized web.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A press release from Pontem claimed the latest funding round &ldquo;will help us keep building pioneering products with Move and Move VM &ndash; both for the Aptos ecosystem and beyond.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Pontem plans to integrate the chatbot with its other inventions, Liquidswap AMM and Pontem wallet, in order to create a &ldquo;more intuitive user experience of on-chain trading and analysis.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Decentralized exchange Uniswap</strong> has unveiled a new security tool called Permit2 today to give users more control over their digital assets and prevent hackers from exploiting vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Permit2 addresses the “infinite token allowance” flaw that has put user funds at risk, <a href="https://t.co/vBJnBnUxCy">according to a statement from Uniswap Labs</a>. This vulnerability stems from the common practice in crypto of users granting smart contracts permission to access tokens so they can interact with <strong>decentralized apps</strong>.</p>
<p>While useful, the unlimited token allowance can be abused by hackers to infinitely drain wallets undetected. Uniswap’s upgrade hopes to seal this vulnerability before the <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/c/v4-launch/12">launch of Uniswap v4</a>.</p>
<h2>Empowering Users, Curbing Hackers</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A key feature of Permit2 is enabling users to set time limits on token approvals, so third parties can only access funds for a specific period. This gives users more oversight.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recent exploits have continued to show that infinite token allowances put user funds at risk.</p>
<p>Permit2 is a free, public good built to prevent these exploits, enabling:</p>
<p>+ Time-bound token allowances<br />+ Reusable token approvals<br />+ Gas savings across apps</p>
<p>How to integrate Permit2…</p>
<p>&mdash; Uniswap Labs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f984.png" alt="🦄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@Uniswap) <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1747759207527383439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Additionally, the tool introduces reusable token approvals to simplify transactions without requiring users to repeatedly grant access. Permit2 also utilizes signature-based approvals to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-use-layer-2-solutions-save-ethereum-fees-optimism.htm">reduce gas fees</a> when transferring tokens.</p>
<p>By putting users back in control, the tool will prevent the kind of infinite withdrawals by hackers that were possible with unlimited allowances. Uniswap designed Permit2 to be <strong>open-source</strong> to maximize community benefit.</p>
<h2>Prioritizing Uniswap Security</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The proactive <strong>security upgrade</strong> comes as Uniswap is preparing to roll out <strong>Uniswap v4</strong> and its new <strong>Hooks</strong> feature for developers. With <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap">over $4.3 billion in assets</a> flowing through its decentralized exchange, shoring up protections has become a priority.</p>
<p><strong>Uniswap’s dominance</strong> in decentralized trading means increased caution against hackers is imperative. This latest permit-based approval tool is one of many steps to ensure users can trade securely. Uniswap’s security focus combined with planned enhancements could establish its leadership in the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decentralized-finance-defi-explained-5134.htm">Decentralized finance</a> is still developing the security infrastructure necessary for the future. For now, users should exercise caution when accessing these services.</p>
<p>Leading DeFi platforms like Uniswap will likely continue rolling out advanced protections against hacking and exploitation, and users stand to be the ultimate beneficiaries of these security improvements.</p>

<p>A Reddit user recently fell victim to an elaborate <strong>cryptocurrency phishing scam</strong>, losing the equivalent of $250,000 in ether (ETH) after responding to a <strong>fake airdrop</strong>.</p>
<p>The scam first came to light when the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/18mfuj3/did_i_just_lose_100_eth_on_my_wallet/">Redditor posted details of the incident</a> on the social platform last December. In the post, the victim explained that they had 100 ETH deposited into Aave for lending purposes to generate interest. Shockingly, the user then noticed that 100 ETH had been transferred out of their account unknowingly.</p>
<h2>Crypto Scam Transfers 100 ETH to Scammer’s Wallet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“I am shivering right now,&#8221; the post stated. &#8220;I had about 100 ETH deposited into Aave for lending to accrue interest and I just noticed that 100 AAVE ETH is transferred out of my account. Please help.”</p>
<p>The Redditor explained that the theft occurred after interacting with what appeared to be a legitimate <strong>Frames airdrop</strong>.</p>
<p>“This was a quarter million dollar life lesson I hope you learn from,” responded one user, urging more caution with fake airdrops. &#8220;Chasing pennies into dark alleys with a wallet full of hundreds&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Airdrops are common events in which cryptocurrencies distribute <strong>free tokens</strong> into holders’ wallets. But fraudsters have increasingly used <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-scammers-swipe-123k-in-steth-from-nest-wallet-founder-in-fake-airdrop.htm">fake airdrops to phish credentials</a> and siphon funds from unsuspecting victims.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="HOW TO IDENTIFY SCAM TOKENS | FAKE AIRDROP" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXrDPwiB6QM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe265398bc6ea0a4ae1de43de6e0fad81c205013b#tokentxns">The scammer’s wallet</a> shows a pattern of sending worthless fake tokens to other wallets. But the 100 ETH theft was by far the biggest score for the bad actor.</p>
<p>Other successful scams linked to the same wallet include smaller amounts of tokens like <strong>PEPE</strong>, <strong>RIO</strong>, and <strong>PAAL</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Redditor was never able to recover their lost ETH, which is now <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">worth over $250,000</a>. The scammer’s wallet address has since been labeled as “Fake_Phishing270904” to warn other users of its shady activities.</p>
<h2>How Investors Can Stay Protected</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Here are some tips for investors to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/this-is-how-you-protect-crypto-in-your-wallet-according-to-expert-mark-venables.htm">safeguard crypto assets against theft</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid interacting with suspicious links or websites</li>
<li>Use secure and <strong>reputable crypto exchanges</strong></li>
<li>Enable <strong>2-factor authentication</strong> on accounts</li>
<li>Store the majority of holdings in <strong>cold storage</strong> or <strong>hardware wallets</strong></li>
<li>Keep seed phrases and passwords offline in secure locations</li>
<li>Be wary of fake airdrops and giveaways</li>
<li>In case of airdrop hunting, use <strong>burner wallets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, users must exercise added caution against old and emerging crypto scam tactics. Taking preventative measures will help investors avoid the misfortune of the Reddit user who lost a quarter million dollars in ETH. Staying informed and alert is a crypto investor&#8217;s best defense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Game software development company Animoca Brands has begun the phased launch of its decentralized chess strategy video game, Anichess, in partnership with Norwegian chess grandmaster, Magnus Carlsen, the company announced today.
</p>
<h2>A &ldquo;spellbinding strategy game&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
According to a Tuesday press release from Animoca Brands, the company describes its latest release as a &ldquo;spellbinding strategy game that combines the core rules of chess with a rich, captivating story&rdquo; while featuring &ldquo;magic spell mechanics&rdquo; that will offer &ldquo;a range of offensive, defensive and counter tactics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>News of the game&rsquo;s initial release follows the company&rsquo;s June 2023 <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/anichess-completes-over-subscribed-usd1500000-seed-round-to-develop-innovative-chess-game" rel="sponsored">seed round funding announcement</a> that saw over $1.5 million raised for Anichess&rsquo; development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In its current first phase of launch, <i>Anichess</i> immerses players in a solo adventure in which they must use unique magical spells (e.g. transforming any non-royal piece into a knight) to solve daily chess puzzles,&rdquo; the press release reads in part. &ldquo;By completing these daily challenges, players can collect Orbs of Power game assets that provide in-game utility, such as unlocking new challenge puzzles that offer greater rewards. &ldquo;
</p>
<h2>Carlsen helps bring innovation to chess</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.anichess.com/" rel="sponsored">Available free-to-play at Anichess.com</a>, the game currently boasts player-versus-environment gameplay, however, player-versus-player gameplay is expected later in quarter one of 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited that <i>Anichess </i>is bringing innovation to chess with spells and strategy gaming elements that provide a refreshing chess experience,&rdquo; said <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-chess-players-to-compete-for-usd-100k-worth-of-bitcoin-10352.htm">Magnus Carlsen</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/animoca-brands-and-lympo-partner-with-play-magnus-group-on-chess-inspired-blockchain-game-anichess-1.htm">A leader in Web3 chess gameplay</a>, Anichess has amassed a number of key Grandmaster partnerships inside the chess world, including Anish Giri, David Howell, David Ant&oacute;n Guijarro, Sopiko Guramishvili, and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By working closely with partner chess Grandmasters and game designers, <i>Anichess</i> seeks not only to cater to a large global community of chess enthusiasts, but also to widen the chess horizon and tap into new audiences, including those who enjoy strategy games but do not play chess regularly,&rdquo; Animoca Brands states.
</p>
<h2>Anichess ushers in a new chess era</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Moreover, Anichess is suitable for a variety of skill levels in order to &ldquo;deliver an experience that makes chess <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">more engaging and accessible</a> to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Anichess</i> revolutionizes the classic royal game by fusing traditional strategy and gameplay with the innovative elements of spellcasting, a fantasy storyline, and Web3 functionality,&rdquo; said co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, Yat Siu. &ldquo;We are thrilled to partner with Chess.com and to have Magnus Carlsen and other impressive chess talent with us as we pioneer this new dimension of chess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Future developments pertaining to Anichess may be found on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/anichess" rel="sponsored">the game&rsquo;s official discord</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/trax-raises-2-9m-in-decentralised-funding-round-302034973.html" rel="sponsored">According</a> to the press release, following the completion of the raise, TRAX will operate as a decentralized autonomous organization (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/1inch-dao-votes-to-hire-permanent-legal-counsel-for-decentralized-nature-challenges.htm">DAO</a>).</p>
<p>Holders of TRAX&#8217;s new governance token, TRAX, will democratically control it. The funds will stay in TRAX DAO&#8217;s treasury, allowing TRAX holders to decide how best to utilize them.</p>
<p>TRAX completed its raise on 23 December 2023, amassing a treasury of over 314,000 ICP, or approximately $2.9m at the time of the raise.</p>
<p>Following price action, on January 15, the treasury was valued at approximately $4 million.</p>
<p>TRAX is a content aggregator and social marketplace helping artists build a digital space for their superfans. Its goal is to give artists the opportunity to grow their communities and increase revenue through exclusive content and events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fans are naturally more partial to supporting their favorite artists, but major music platforms have yet to reflect this nuance in their algorithms and pricing structure,&rdquo; the announcement argued.

<h2>Bitget Promotes Gender Diversity in Web3 with $10 Million Commitment</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Crypto exchange <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-fundraising-fell-70-per-quarter-last-year-female-startups-receive-6-3-bitget.htm">Bitget</a></strong> unveiled the <strong>Blockchain4Her</strong> initiative aimed at promoting gender diversity and inclusivity in the blockchain industry, with a $10 million commitment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/bitget-blockchain4her-project-empowers-women-with-10-million-commitment-to-promote-gender-diversity-in-web3-302035374.html" rel="sponsored">Per</a> the press release:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Despite the industry&#8217;s progress and increasing inclusivity, significant gender bias persists.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Bitget recently conducted a study that revealed limited gender diversity in the blockchain funding market. It showed that female-led blockchain startups secured only 6% of the total funding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a forward-thinking and global blockchain-based economy, the prevalence of gender bias significantly restricting opportunities is an unacceptable issue,&rdquo; the exchange said.</p>
<p>As part of the Blockchain4Her initiative, Bitget will launch incubation programs for female entrepreneurs. They will provide comprehensive support, mentorship, and resources, empowering women to navigate and succeed in the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>Additionally, Blockchain4Her will host pitch competitions for female-founded startups, offering them a platform to showcase their innovations and secure potential investments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it will feature an experience called Women in Blockchain Summit &amp; Awards, serving as a platform to celebrate and recognize the outstanding achievements of women in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>Finally, Bitget will invite industry leaders to join as ambassadors for the Blockchain4Her program.</p>

<p>Moody&rsquo;s Investor Services, a credit ratings and research provider, on Monday, highlighted the inherent tech risks associated with growing tokenized funds.</p>
<p>Moody&rsquo;s DeFi and Digital Assets expert team flagged the <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/DeFi-Digital-Assets-Cross-Region-Growing-adoption-of-tokenized-Sector-In-Depth--PBC_1390238" rel="sponsored">need for additional expertise</a> in managing tokenized funds. Tokenized investment funds tech providers often have &ldquo;limited track record,&rdquo; contributing to the increased risk.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The entities involved on the technology side often have limited track records, increasing the risk that in the case of bankruptcy or technological failure, payments may be disrupted.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Further, there is also potential for exposure of the fund collateral to the volatility of other digital assets like stablecoins.</p>
<p>The team emphasized that public blockchains, used by some tokenized funds, are &ldquo;exposed to technological risks, cyberattacks and governance issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report proposed that &ldquo;a robust contract audit process is beneficial&rdquo; to overcome potential tech and cyberattack issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, Moody&rsquo;s research stressed the need for expertise in fields such as token issuance and redemption, maintaining on-chain investors&rsquo; registers and whitelisting wallets in compliance with KYC and AML checks.
</p>
<h2>Tokenized Funds: Carving Out a Niche in Finance</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Analysts at the credit-rating agency have observed the rapidly growing adoption of tokenized funds, signaling &ldquo;untapped market potential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report attributed the growth fueled by funds that invest in government securities. Furthermore, per <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64c178af8c7b9aa0bb415c9f/652d2dc5ea81432d2a35f1d2_The%20State%20of%20Tokenization%20by%2021.co.pdf" rel="sponsored">Dune Analytics Tokenization Report</a> 2023, the total value of tokenized funds invested in government securities and issued on public blockchains, exceeded $800 million, triple the growth in 2023.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tokenized funds&#8217; potential applications extend beyond merely enhancing asset liquidity,&rdquo; the experts wrote. &ldquo;These funds have a variety of other possible functions, including serving as collateral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November 2023, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-explores-fund-tokenization-for-personalized-portfolio-management.htm">JPMorgan and Apollo partnered</a> with several blockchain firms to explore fund tokenization for managing extensive client portfolios. In October, leading Swiss asset management bank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ubs-tokenized-money-market-fund-goes-live-ethereum-blockchain.htm">UBS debuted</a> its first live pilot of a tokenized money market fund on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> blockchain in Singapore.</p>

<p>The Technology Advisory Committee of the US <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/judge-approves-settlement-binance-to-pay-1-5-billion-to-cftc-cz-to-pay-150-million-fine.htm">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> (CFTC) has taken a significant step in addressing the challenges posed by decentralized finance (DeFi) by voting to submit a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10106/TAC_DeFiReport010824/download">report</a> urging the government and industry to prioritize understanding and regulating the sector.</p>
<p>The report, believed to be the first substantial analysis of DeFi by a government advisory committee, outlines key recommendations for policymakers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">And here’s the report itself. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Among the suggestions is a call for increased knowledge about DeFi, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of decentralized financial systems. The report also advocates for the enhancement of enforcement effectiveness to ensure timely regulatory responses.</p>
<h2>CFTC effort to inform ongoing debates in the US</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/romerostatement010824b">statement</a> published on the CFTC’s website, CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero said the report is a result of “hard work” to study DeFi and that it is intended to “inform ongoing policy debates in the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and regulators including the CFTC.”</p>
<p>The recommendations include a call to assess existing federal and state regulatory frameworks related to DeFi and identify areas where regulations need to be expanded to address emerging risks.</p>
<p>The report represents a significant departure from traditional regulatory approaches, signaling a recognition of the unique challenges presented by decentralized financial systems.</p>
<h2>‘Groundbreaking effort’ in understanding DeFi</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Justin Slaughter, Policy Director at crypto firm Paradigm and a member of the CFTC Technology Advisory Committee, noted that the report is a groundbreaking effort in surveying both the opportunities and risks associated with DeFi.</p>
<p>In a post on social media platform X, Slaughter called it “arguably the most comprehensive review of DeFi by any U.S government agency thus far.”</p>
<p>He added that the report represents a “major step forward for policymaking on DeFi,” and said policymakers can consider it as a “first cut at a map as they navigate policymaking for DeFi.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Following a thorough discussion, <a href="https://twitter.com/CFTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CFTC</a>’s TAC has adopted its report on DeFi nearly unanimously (14-1).

<p>On Thursday, <strong>Binance</strong> warned it may soon delist 10 prominent <strong>privacy coins</strong>, including Monero, Zcash, and Horizen due to regulatory concerns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-extend-the-monitoring-tag-to-include-ant-firo-kp3r-mdx-mob-reef-vai-xmr-zec-zen-and-remove-the-seed-tag-for-gmx-sushi-on-2024-01-04-fd710b5e647c480ab9fe2d87e3cd4b39">In a statement</a>, Binance said these tokens received a “<strong>monitoring tag</strong>” and could fail to meet <strong>listing requirements</strong> related to team commitment, network security, trading volume, and other factors.</p>
<p>“Tokens with the Monitoring Tag exhibit notably higher volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens. These tokens are closely monitored, with regular reviews conducted,&#8221; Binance stated. &#8220;Keep in mind that tokens with the Monitoring Tag are at risk of no longer meeting our listing criteria and being delisted from the platform.”</p>
<p>The announcement immediately impacted prices, with <strong>Monero</strong> falling 5% and <strong>Zcash</strong> 12% in the past day <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/privacy/">according to CMC data</a>.</p>
<h2>Regulators Raise Concerns Over Privacy Coins&#8217; Anonymity</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Privacy coins allow users to conceal wallet balances, transaction details, and other information. This has attracted <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-seizure-record-doj-crypto-tracing-monero/">scrutiny from global regulators</a> worried about potential illicit usage.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/588630">Binance said it would remove privacy coins</a> in order to comply with European laws. Critics suggested the latest warnings are tied to ongoing high regulatory attention.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Dark Side of Monero" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMtg5JPPKRQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Binance now requires traders of these tokens to pass periodic quizzes on risks, a move some view as another attempt to discourage usage due to compliance pressures.</p>
<p>“The monitoring tag has been placed on FIRO along with other privacy coins due to increased regulatory pressure, including from MiCA, recent initiatives from U.S. regulators and compliance to Binance&#8217;s settlement with the U.S. DoJ,” Firo co-founder <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/270282/binance-monitoring-tag-monero-zcash">Reuben Yap said in an interview with The Block</a>.</p>
<h2>Loss of Exchange Access Harms Liquidity and Discoverability</h2>

Last week, <a href="https://www.okx.com/help/okx-to-delist-several-spot-trading-pairs-12-29">rival exchange OKX also revealed plans to delist</a> major privacy coins Zcash and Monero by January 5. OKX said these assets no longer align with listing standards.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm">Centralized exchanges</a> are increasingly limiting or removing privacy tokens, but there are still options for users wishing to trade them.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex.htm">Decentralized platforms like Uniswap</a> allow access with no KYC requirements. <strong>Bisq</strong> and <strong>LocalMonero</strong> operate without controlling user funds. Volumes on these platforms remain far below larger centralized exchanges, however.</p>
<h2>Advocates Clash With Regulations on Anonymity</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Privacy coin proponents such as the <strong>American Civil Liberties Union</strong> argue that <a href="https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/legal-documents/cbdcs_fed_reserve_-_money_and_payments_comment_letter.pdf">financial anonymity is a human right</a>, providing protection from surveillance, <strong>identity theft</strong>, and other risks.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="🛡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It&#39;s essential for Binance to recognize the significance of privacy coins. Privacy is a fundamental right, and crypto should uphold it.</p>
<p>&mdash; Mccoy Lucila (@LucilaMcco49087) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucilaMcco49087/status/1741271449900364173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The SEC asserted that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-defi-20211109">lack of transparency inherently enables crime</a>, however. Authorities have flagged privacy coins in <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/library/files/hsgac-majority-cryptocurrency-ransomware-report_executive-summary/">several high-profile cases involving ransomware</a>, <strong>theft</strong>, <strong>illegal drug sales</strong>, and <strong>terror financing</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2023, the IRS criminal investigation division offered a <a href="https://www.coinbureau.com/news/crack-monero-irs-six-figure-reward-trace-xmr/">reward of up to $625,000 for tools to analyze privacy coin transactions</a> and trace owners.</p>
<p>Finding the appropriate balance between individual privacy and law enforcement access is continuing to stir debate within the community.</p>
<p>Whatever the ultimate outcome, the regulatory tide may be turning against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-privacy-coins-features-and-differences-2725.htm">anonymous cryptocurrencies</a>, at least when it comes to availability on prominent centralized trading platforms like Binance and OKX.</p>

<p><b>Blockchain technology</b> is witnessing a major shift—one that promises to reshape how we think about and interact with <b>digital ledgers</b>. We&#8217;re talking about the emergence of parallelized <b>Ethereum Virtual Machines</b> (EVMs), a development that may redefine transaction processing in blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs offer an alternative to how blockchain networks currently manage and process transactions. By reducing congestion, especially during periods of high demand, <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fanl/papers/parallel-icse22.pdf">parallel execution</a> offers a more streamlined and efficient experience for users.</p>
<h2>Understanding Parallelized EVMs and Their Impact on Blockchain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Historically, the execution of operations in blockchain networks has followed a <b>sequential pattern</b>. Each transaction within a block is processed one after the other, demanding comprehensive validation from the network. While this method has underpinned the robust and secure nature of blockchain technology, it has not been without its drawbacks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What Is The EVM In 2 Minutes (Ethereum Virtual Machine)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTlT3I-Iy5o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4274&amp;context=thesesdissertations">Sequential processing</a> is both energy-intensive and places a high workload on network validators. The result has often been <b>high transaction costs</b> and a <b>less efficient user experience</b>—issues that have frequently been cited as barriers to wider <b>blockchain adoption</b>.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs transform the consensus process by enabling multiple operations to be executed simultaneously. The parallel execution capability greatly increases the <b>network&#8217;s throughput</b>, enhancing the overall performance and <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/89f5c7cd-c139-486c-8f35-00f15d7b21fe/content">scalability of the blockchain</a>.</p>
<p>With Parallelized EVMs, blockchain networks can handle more transactions in a shorter period, effectively addressing <b>congestion issues</b> and <b>slow processing times</b> that have often plagued traditional blockchain systems.</p>
<p>The impact extends to various aspects of blockchain technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>It offers a more <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/10005208/10102454.pdf">energy-efficient approach</a> to transaction processing. By reducing the workload on validators and the network at large, parallelized EVMs contribute to a more <b>sustainable blockchain</b> ecosystem.</li>
<li>The enhanced scalability and increased throughput directly translate to reduced transaction fees. Users benefit from a more <b>cost-effective</b> experience, making blockchain platforms more accessible and appealing to a broader audience.</li>
<li>The ability to process multiple transactions concurrently rather than sequentially means <b>decentralized applications</b> (dApps) can operate more seamlessly, even during periods of high network demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technological advancement not only improves the user experience but also opens new possibilities for complex and high-volume applications on the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Parallelized EVMs in Ethereum and Beyond</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The benefits of parallelized EVMs are not confined to Ethereum alone. They are also being integrated into other blockchain platforms, such as Solana, which is known for its <a href="https://solana.com/news/case-study-pyth">high throughput and low latency</a>.</p>
<p>By adopting a parallelized EVM on a platform like Solana, the potential for scalability and performance is magnified. This integration allows for a seamless execution of transactions across multiple nodes concurrently, greatly enhancing the network&#8217;s capacity to handle large volumes of transactions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CT saying parallelized chains are the future</p>
<p>Parallelized chains are the *present*. </p>

<p>Just try. <a href="https://t.co/31SCcpN7KD">pic.twitter.com/31SCcpN7KD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; GJ Flannery (@GJFlannery19) <a href="https://twitter.com/GJFlannery19/status/1736955357014946282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This advancement is particularly crucial for a wide range of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-build-decentralized-application-dapp.htm">decentralized applications</a>. Whether it&#8217;s in the DeFi, gaming, decentralized autonomous organizations, or <strong>decentralized exchanges</strong>, the adoption of parallelized EVMs will ensure that these applications can operate efficiently without overwhelming the network.</p>
<p>This is a critical factor in ensuring the long-term viability and success of dApps, as it addresses <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/24941/blockchain-and-the-scalability-challenge-solving-the-blockchain-trilemma">one of the biggest challenges they face</a>: scalability.</p>
<h3>The Developer&#8217;s Role in Maximizing Benefits</h3>
<p>The successful implementation and optimization of parallelized EVMs are heavily reliant on the foresight and skill of developers. To fully harness the <a href="https://suipiens.com/blog/understanding-parallel-execution-in-blockchain/">capabilities of parallelized technology</a> in blockchain, developers must integrate considerations for parallel processing from the inception of their projects.</p>
<p>This is particularly crucial when designing <strong>smart contracts</strong> and data structures, as these elements play a key role in determining whether transactions can be executed in parallel.</p>
<p>In the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>, the design must accommodate parallel execution to ensure different transactions can operate independently without interference. For example, if a smart contract utilizes the same data structure for various transactions, it restricts the possibility of <strong>parallel processing</strong>. Developers must carefully structure their contracts and associated data to avoid such limitations.</p>
<p>The requirement for thoughtful design extends to <strong>data structures</strong> as well. Effective use of parallelized EVMs necessitates data structures that support <strong>independent transactions</strong>. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of transaction processing but also ensures that the full potential of parallelized technology is leveraged.</p>
<p>The role of developers, therefore, is not just about coding but also about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37902833/">architectural planning</a> and strategic thinking. By designing with parallel processing in mind, developers can create dApps that are not only novel but also capable of operating at an unprecedented scale and efficiency.</p>
<p>This proactive approach is essential in unlocking the power of parallelized EVMs, making blockchain technology more <strong>adaptable, efficient, and scalable</strong>.</p>
<h2>Comparing Parallelized EVMs with DAG</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As a scalable blockchain technology, parallelized EVMs represent a major advancement. It&#8217;s instructive to compare them with other scalable technologies, however, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34460402/">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a>, to appreciate their unique contributions and potential in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>DAG presents an alternative approach to achieving scalability. Unlike traditional blockchains that chain blocks in a linear sequence, DAG structures allow <a href="https://hedera.com/learning/distributed-ledger-technologies/directed-acyclic-graph">transactions to be linked in a graph format</a>, where multiple transactions can be added concurrently.</p>
<figure id="attachment_145839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145839" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-145839 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt.png" alt="Directed Acyclic Graph vs Blockchain" width="1227" height="323" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt.png 1227w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-300x79.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-1024x270.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-768x202.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-150x39.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1227px) 100vw, 1227px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-145839" class="wp-caption-text">Image by <a href="https://www.cbcamerica.org/blockchain-insights/dag-the-dlt-directed-acyclic-graph-for-enterprise-blockchain">Central Blockchain Council</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This structure substantially reduces the time needed for transaction confirmation and increases the network&#8217;s ability to handle <strong>high transaction volumes</strong>. DAG technology is known for its low transaction fees and high scalability, making it an attractive choice for applications requiring fast and efficient transaction processing.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs offer distinct advantages over DAG, however, particularly in the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-ethereum-dapp-games-1979.htm">Ethereum-based applications</a>. While DAG excels in transaction speed and scalability, it does not inherently support smart contracts and decentralized applications in the same way Ethereum does.</p>
<p>They retain the robust smart contract capabilities of Ethereum while enhancing scalability and efficiency through parallel processing. This makes them particularly suitable for complex decentralized applications that require both smart contract functionality and high transaction throughput.</p>
<p>Additionally, parallelized EVMs maintain compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a critical consideration for developers and users already entrenched in Ethereum-based applications. This compatibility ensures a smoother transition and integration for existing dApps, which is a challenge in DAG-based systems that often require major modifications to existing applications.</p>
<h2>Spotlight on Projects Developing Parallelized EVMs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The evolution of parallelized EVMs is not occurring in isolation. Several projects are leading the charge of this technological shift, each contributing unique insights and advancements to the blockchain world. Three such projects—SEI, Neon EVM, and Monad—are working to integrate the technology into their platforms, setting new benchmarks in blockchain scalability and efficiency.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has recently seen growing interest in an <strong>emerging trend</strong>—the development of <strong>parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines</strong> (EVMs). <strong>Parallelized EVM</strong> technology is promising major improvements in <strong>blockchain scalability</strong> through parallel transaction processing. But is the hype justified or is this just another crypto fad?</p>
<h2>Focused Attention on Parallelized EVM Trend</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128749">An EVM</a> is the software that handles computation and data storage on the <strong>Ethereum blockchain</strong> network. The EVM processes <strong>smart contract</strong> code and executes transactions on the network. Ethereum&#8217;s EVM utilizes sequential transaction ordering, however, which limits its <strong>ability to scale</strong>.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs seek to break this bottleneck by enabling parallel transaction execution across multiple processors. This allows for higher throughput and lower latency compared to sequential processing.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2024 will be the year of the parallel evm &#8211; rooting for everyone working on this problem incl. monad/sei/polygon and other teams that I forget. </p>
<p>also excited for our own internal efforts there and pushing the boundaries on database design</p>
<p>&mdash; Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) <a href="https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1734253305847767385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As New York-based crypto investment firm DBA co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_charb">Jon Charbonneau explains</a>, there are two main approaches for building parallelized EVMs—<strong>deterministic</strong> and <strong>speculative parallel execution</strong>. The deterministic method uses predefined transaction ordering to avoid conflicts, while speculative scheduling speculatively runs transactions in parallel, managing conflicts as they arise.</p>
<p>Proponents argue that parallelized EVMs can optimize <strong>blockchain performance</strong> and efficiency. By splitting workloads across multiple processors, these parallelized systems can handle far greater transaction volumes, enabling <strong>greater application scalability</strong>, and reducing network congestion and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/high-gas-fees-alert-binance-wallet-records-840000-abnormal-ethereum-charges.htm">high gas fees</a> during peak usage.</p>
<h2>The Promise of Faster, More Efficient Blockchains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Parallelized EVM projects have rapidly grown in popularity as the crypto market focuses on their potential benefits. Leading projects like <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sei/">SEI</a> and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neon/">NEON</a> have seen surging adoption and valuations this year.</p>
<p>The crypto community views these technologies as crucial for addressing fundamental <a href="https://www.academia.edu/92613223/Scalability_Issues_of_Blockchain_Technology?f_ri=922887">limitations in blockchain scalability</a>. As <strong>decentralized apps (DApps)</strong> and user bases expand, parallel execution is seen as critical for meeting demands.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think many established L1s/L2s are now facing existential crisis from inscription spamming causing gas like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$AVAX</a> to go to $50-$100 per tx, completely destroying their core values.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs can open the door to sophisticated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) products not feasible on current networks. By powering faster and <strong>cheaper transactions</strong>, these could enable the next generation of blockchain technology.</p>
<h2>Technical Hurdles and Adoption Risks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Building functioning parallelized systems requires overcoming complex technical obstacles, however. Ensuring predictable, conflict-free parallel execution across thousands of <strong>decentralized nodes</strong> is challenging.</p>
<p>There are also questions about <strong>ecosystem adoption</strong>. While <a href="https://polynya.medium.com/why-the-transition-to-rollup-centric-ethereum-is-a-years-long-journey-f1e25c200660">Ethereum is transitioning to integrate optimized rollup</a> technologies, it can take time. And some applications may be difficult to migrate.</p>
<p>The rise of parallelized EVMs and rollups represents a key juncture for blockchain tech. These innovations address innate limitations in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.826/www/notes/HO19.pdf">sequential transaction processing</a> that have long-constrained performance.</p>
<p>If successfully implemented, parallelized EVMs could future-proof blockchain networks. They could provide the pathway for Ethereum and other crypto networks to keep pace with soaring demands.</p>
<p>While technical and adoption risks exist, the crypto market is betting on parallelized EVMs becoming a cornerstone of the next-generation Web3 infrastructure. Their success could determine whether blockchains can truly scale to mainstream levels.</p>

<p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which sets standards for securities market regulation globally, has issued policy recommendations for the supervision of decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<p>On December 19, IOSCO unveiled <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD754.pdf">nine policy recommendations</a> aimed at regulating the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. This guidance comes as regulators worldwide grapple with the challenges of regulating DeFi, an industry that lacks a centralized body subject to traditional supervision.</p>
<p>These recommendations, part of a comprehensive approach initiated last year, seek to foster greater consistency in regulatory oversight both within and across jurisdictions. Notably, IOSCO had previously published recommendations for regulating crypto markets in September.</p>
<p>In its latest report, IOSCO highlights the need for governments to identify those responsible for innovative financial applications within the DeFi space and regulate them similarly to traditional finance. While some of the recommendations may appear standard, their significance lies in the detailed treatment provided for each.</p>
<p>For instance, Recommendation 7 emphasizes the enforcement of applicable laws and guides on assessing regulators&#8217; powers, tools, and resources to address potential evasion by DeFi or other market participants.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation benefiting investors and markets, IOSCO underscores the necessity of addressing market integrity and investor protection concerns arising from technological developments in DeFi.</p>
<p>These recommendations, aligned with IOSCO&#8217;s Crypto-Asset Roadmap, complement those issued for Crypto and Digital Assets (CDA) markets in November 2023. Following a lifecycle approach, the principles-based and outcomes-focused recommendations aim at DeFi products, services, activities, and arrangements. They adhere to IOSCO&#8217;s globally accepted standards for securities market regulation.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes that many existing international policies, standards, and regulatory frameworks for traditional financial markets are applicable to DeFi due to their similar economic functions and activities. In cases where current rules don&#8217;t directly apply, IOSCO suggests modifying them to ensure proper regulation.</p>
<h2><b>IOSCO urges Global Cooperation for Consistent Regulation</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
IOSCO&#8217;s guidance on DeFi covers key aspects such as identifying responsible individuals, establishing clear disclosure requirements, and enforcing applicable laws. The definition of responsible persons includes those &#8220;exercising control or sufficient influence over a financial product offered, financial service provided, or financial activity engaged in by the DeFi arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IOSCO&#8217;s overarching goal is to promote consistency in the regulation and oversight of crypto-asset markets, emphasizing the need for uniformity in regulating crypto-asset and securities markets within individual jurisdictions. The recommendations stress the importance of enhanced cooperation among regulators to address cross-border challenges, enforce regulations, and supervise DeFi participants engaging in global crypto-asset activities across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>With these recommendations in place, IOSCO is now shifting its focus towards implementation, capacity building, and providing technical assistance to regulators adopting the suggested frameworks. While the recommendations are not directly aimed at market participants, IOSCO strongly encourages all crypto-asset market participants to thoroughly consider the expectations outlined in the recommendations and supporting guidance, especially in the conduct of regulated and cross-border activities.</p>
<p>Having completed the recommendations, IOSCO is set to shift its focus to monitoring, regulatory capacity building, and providing technical assistance to its over 130 member authorities, which collectively regulate 95% of the world&#8217;s financial markets.</p>
<p>The board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) includes 35 regulators and top executives, including heads of prominent regulatory bodies such as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), among others.</p>
<p>In 2022, IOSCO released <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bis-says-stablecoin-issuers-must-provide-information-management-structure-status-of-reserves.htm">comprehensive reports</a> on various aspects of the crypto landscape, covering topics such as DeFi, stablecoins, and the role of influencers. The organization has consistently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-standard-setter-recommends-more-investor-protection-following-turmoil-over-past-year.htm">advocated for national regulators</a> to enhance their supervisory capacities in response to the evolving nature of the crypto industry.</p>

<p>The core development team behind the proof-of-work (PoW) fork of Ethereum announced on Tuesday its decision to dissolve EthereumPOW&#8217;s centralized structure in favor of complete decentralization.</p>
<h2>Transition to Fully Decentralized EthereumPOW Underway</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://medium.com/@ETHW/ethw-core-dissolution-statement-46f6ab80924">According to the announcement</a>, the <strong>EthereumPOW </strong>core team will be disbanded in order to achieve <strong>full autonomy</strong>. Going forward, EthereumPOW will rely solely on <strong>PoW consensus</strong> and <strong>decentralized governance</strong> &#8220;to become a deity-less public chain.&#8221; This move hands over governance of the <strong>EthereumPOW blockchain</strong> to its community of users and miners.</p>
<p>Servers supporting the network will be transferred to <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/onedao-finance">OneDAO</a>, a <strong>decentralized protocol</strong> on the <strong>Harmony blockchain</strong>. OneDAO will provide transitional maintenance for <strong>EthereumPOW</strong> until long-term ecosystem partners can be established.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is good news. They have fulfilled their original commitment. towards decentralization</p>
<p>&mdash; Chuong (@chuongbitcoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/chuongbitcoin/status/1737119895941505241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Lead <strong>EthereumPOW</strong> developer Jadal Page explained the reasoning behind relinquishing centralized control.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have explored and validated the feasibility of ETHW operating independently without Core’s support, confirming the fundamental technical and operational conditions for ETHW in such a scenario,&#8221; Page wrote in the announcement.</p>
<h2>Decentralization Hoped to Reinvigorate the Ethereum Fork</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <strong>Ethereum hard fork</strong> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ethw-goes-live-6674485">occurred in September 2022</a>, just before the main Ethereum blockchain transitioned from PoW consensus to a more energy-efficient <strong>proof-of-stake model</strong> following the <strong>Merge upgrade</strong>.</p>
<p>Some developers and miners unhappy with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-report-ethereums-centralization-increased-post-merge-shanghai-upgrades.htm">the perceived centralization and loss of revenues</a> created EthereumPOW to preserve the original PoW-based Ethereum. Since its launch, the forked token <strong>ETHW</strong> has struggled to gain adoption, however.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143613" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg" alt="" width="975" height="396" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg 975w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap-300x122.jpeg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap-768x312.jpeg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap-150x61.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grayscale-abandons-post-merge-ethereum-005655194.html">Grayscale decided against supporting ETHW</a> in September, citing a lack of liquidity and custodial support. This removed a major source of potential demand. As a result, ETHW has declined from its launch price of $100 to around $2.59 currently.</p>
<p>By dissolving centralized control and embracing <strong>community governance</strong>, the EthereumPOW team hopes to reinvigorate the network. OneDAO will provide technical assistance during the transitional period as the developers step back. Still, success will ultimately hinge on whether the cryptocurrency community chooses to adopt EthereumPOW over the dominant <strong>Ethereum PoS</strong> blockchain.</p>
