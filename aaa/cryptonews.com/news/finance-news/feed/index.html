										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), the savior of failed Signature Bank, has witnessed a sharp decline of 40% in its shares.</p>
<p>The bank&#8217;s shares took a hit on Wednesdau after the decision to cut dividend to strengthen its capital and the announcement of an unexpected loss, according to a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.ft.com/content/858c4184-981d-49fb-b21c-31e6eaa1633d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report by the Financial Times</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p>NYCB has been regarded as one of the success stories amidst the regional banking turmoil of 2023 that saw the <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/another-bank-down-crypto-friendly-signature-bank-closed-over-systemic-risk-concerns-what-does-this-mean-for-crypto.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">downfall of Signature Bank</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hsbc-acquires-silicon-valley-bank-uk-for-ps1-safeguard-customers-taxpayers-whats-going-on.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Silicon Valley Bank</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and First Republic.</span></p>
<h2>New York Community Bancorp Acquired Signature Bank&#8217;s Assets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Signature bank was one of the major crypto banks that offered fiat and banking services to crypto startups.</p>
<p>The lender was shut down on March 12, 2023, after depositors withdrew large sums of money on the heels of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).</p>
<p>At the time, NYCB, based in suburban New York, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">acquired a significant portion</span></a> of Signature Bank&#8217;s assets, including deposits and loans, totaling nearly $13 billion.</p>
<p>This move initially garnered positive investor sentiment, boosting NYCB&#8217;s stock prices.</p>
<p>However, the bank&#8217;s fourth-quarter results, announced recently, shattered these optimistic expectations.</p>
<p>During the final quarter of 2023, NYCB reported a loss of $260 million, a stark contrast to the $164 million gain in the same period the previous year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>This reaction was caused by a sudden loss (-$ 260 million) in latest quarter and a 70% cut in dividends. <a href="https://t.co/QOINeTqINq">https://t.co/QOINeTqINq</a> <a href="https://t.co/3GsSF4fmnu">pic.twitter.com/3GsSF4fmnu</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Hawkeye1812Z (@Hawkeye1745) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hawkeye1745/status/1752774925947932741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The unexpected loss was primarily attributed to a rise in anticipated loan losses, particularly associated with loans connected to office buildings. Bank executives highlighted the impact of challenging conditions in the office real estate market.</p>
<p>Thomas Cangemi, the CEO of NYCB, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q4-2023-york-community-bancorp-081055752.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">explained during an analyst call</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the bank had reduced its dividend to comply with banking regulations triggered by the Signature acquisition. </span></p>
<p>This acquisition pushed NYCB&#8217;s assets over $100 billion, subjecting it to stricter capital requirements.</p>
<p>Consequently, the bank experienced a significant decline in share prices, with a closing drop of 38% and an earlier dip of up to 46%.</p>
<p>The KBW Regional Bank index also saw a decline of 6%, affecting other smaller banks in the sector.</p>
<h2>NYCB Stress-Tests its Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The unexpected losses prompted NYCB to conduct rigorous stress-testing of its commercial real estate loan portfolio, including the portion acquired from Signature Bank.</p>
<p>As a result, the bank revised its estimate of expected losses on office loans, taking into account nationwide weaknesses in the office market and potential shocks from payment and interest rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>Alexander Yokum, an analyst at CFRA, downgraded NYCB&#8217;s shares to a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating, expressing reduced confidence in management&#8217;s ability to efficiently integrate recent acquisitions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our diminished view reflects falling confidence in management’s ability to integrate its recent acquisitions in an efficient manner.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>NYCB also reported a decrease of nearly half a percentage point in its net interest margin, attributed to the need to raise additional funds and liquid assets to meet heightened regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bank admitted that the integration of the Signature acquisition would likely take longer than initially expected, possibly extending into the next year.</p>
<p>Despite this delay, Cangemi reassured analysts that the acquisition was progressing well and praised the performance of the teams involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ai-could-spark-the-next-financial-crisis-sec-chair-gary-gensler-says-0d604b81" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">previously warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to the next financial crisis. Gensler once again elaborated on this topic during a virtual fireside chat hosted by the non-profit advocacy organization Public Citizen on Jan. 17.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gensler spoke in depth about how AI can manipulate markets and investors, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-head-warns-against-ai-washing-the-high-tech-version-of-greenwashing-6ff60da9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">warning against “AI washing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,” algorithm bias and more. As the conversation began, Gensler also clarified that the topics he would be addressing would only pertain to traditional financial markets. This was evident after the panel moderator asked Gensler if he “coined” the term AI washing, to which Gensler responded, “Well, you said ‘coin’ and this is a crypto free day, so it’s not that.” </span></p>
<h2><b>Gensler warns about AI fraud and manipulation</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Gensler then proceeded to explain that AI washing refers to investor or employee interest occurring when making claims about a new technology model. “If an issuer is raising money from the public or just doing its regular quarterly filing, it’s supposed to be truthful in those filings,” he said. According to Gensler, the SEC has found that when new technologies come into play, issuers must be truthful about their claims, detailing the risk and how those risks are being managed and mitigated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The SEC Chair also noted that because AI is built into the fabric of financial markets, there needs to be ways to ensure that humans behind these models are not misleading the public. “Fraud is fraud, and people are going to use AI to fake out the public, deep fake, or otherwise. It’s still against the laws not to mislead the public in this regard,” said Gensler. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gensler added that AI was to blame for a fake blog post that </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fake-news-gary-genslers-resignation-exposed-coinlivehq#:~:text=Initially%2C%20smaller%20crypto%20outlets%2C%20including,to%20the%20SEC%20for%20clarification%2C" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced his resignation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in July of 2023. Most recently, the SEC’s official X account was associated with </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/x-confirms-us-secs-official-account-was-indeed-hacked.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">fake news noting the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which Gensler attributed to a system hack rather than AI. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a> twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.</p>
<p>&mdash; Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1744833049064288387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, Gensler mentioned that AI has enabled a new form of “</span><a href="https://www.yodeck.com/news/what-is-narrowcasting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">narrowcasting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.” According to Gensler, narrowcasting allows AI-enabled systems to target specific individuals based on data from connected devices. While this shouldn’t come as a surprise, Gensler warned that if a system puts a robo advisor or broker dealer interest ahead of investor interest, a conflict arises. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such issues may also lead to concerns around algorithm bias. According to Gensler, AI can be used to select things like which resumes to read when applicants apply for jobs, or who may be eligible for financing when it comes to buying a home. This in mind, Gensler pointed out that data used by algorithms can reflect society biases. He said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are a couple of challenges embedded in AI because of the insatiable desire for data, coupled with the computational work, which is multidimensional. That math behind it makes it hard to explain the algorithm&#8217;s final decisions. It can predict who has better credit, or it might predict to market in one way or another, and how to price products differently. But what if that is also related to one&#8217;s race, gender, or sexual orientation? This is not what we want, and it&#8217;s not even allowed.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While this presents a challenge, Gensler pointed out that this will be resolved over time due to the fact that humans are setting the </span><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/parameters-and-hyperparameters-aa609601a9ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">hyperparameters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> behind algorithms. For instance, Gensler noted that individuals must take on the responsibility of understanding why AI-based algorithms perform in certain ways. “If humans can’t explain why, then what responsibilities do you have as a group of people deploying a model to understand your model? I think this will play out in a number of years, and ultimately into the court system,” said Gensler. </span></p>
<h2><b>Centralized AI poses risk for financial sector at large</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">All things considered, Gensler commented that he thinks AI itself is net positive to society, along with the efficiency and access it can provide in financial markets. However, Gensler warned that one of the biggest looming risk to consider with AI is centralization. “The thing about AI is that everything about it has similar economics of networks, so that it will tend toward centralization. I believe it&#8217;s inevitable that we will have measured on the fingers of one hand, large based models and data aggregators,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result of very few large based models and data aggregators coming into play, Gensler believes that a “monoculture” will likely occur. This could mean that hundreds or thousands of financial actors may rely on a central data or central AI model. Gensler further pointed out that financial regulators don’t have oversight to central nodes. He said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The whole financial sector indirectly will be relying on those central nodes, and if those nodes have it wrong, the monoculture goes one way. This places risk in society and on the financial sector at large.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gensler added that he will continue to raise awareness amongst his international colleagues about the challenges around AI and the impact these will likely have on traditional financial systems. “The awareness is rising, but I will stick to our lane of financial services and securities law,” he said.</span></p>

<p>The controversial <strong>crypto tax reporting requirements</strong> within the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law in 2021 are now in effect as of January 1.</p>
<p>These new <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/all-actions?overview=closed#tabs">Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules</a> mandate that <strong>cryptocurrency brokers</strong> <strong>report personal information</strong> on digital asset transactions over $10,000, including customers&#8217; names, addresses, and social security numbers, within 15 days.</p>
<p>While the goal is <strong>increased transparency</strong> and <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/irs-criminal-investigation-unit-is-taking-on-more-crypto-tax-cases-1.2007089">reduced tax avoidance</a>, the rules have drawn criticism for being vague and difficult to comply with.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coincenter.org/new-crypto-tax-reporting-obligations-took-effect-on-new-years-day/#:~:text=The%20Infrastructure%20Investment%20and%20Jobs,the%20IRS%20about%20that%20transaction.">According to Jerry Brito</a>, executive director at cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center, many crypto users &#8220;will find it difficult to comply&#8221; with the &#8220;tricky&#8221; reporting requirements without further IRS guidance.</p>
<h2>Uncharted Territory for Crypto Investors and Regulators</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For investors transacting through <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bullish-sentiment-grows-as-centralized-exchanges-see-record-outflows-in-12-months.htm">centralized exchanges</a> like <strong>Coinbase</strong> or <strong>Kraken</strong>, compliance will fall on the platform operator. But for peer-to-peer deals or mining proceeds, the responsibility shifts to the individual.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New crypto tax reporting obligations took effect on Jan 1. </p>
<p>If you receive $10k or more in crypto you now have an obligation to report the transaction (including names, addresses, SS numbers, etc.) to the IRS within 15 days under threat of a felony charge. <a href="https://t.co/wyRsfJEpMo">pic.twitter.com/wyRsfJEpMo</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jerry Brito (@jerrybrito) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1742246479593382207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Brito raised questions about specifics such as which parties will be responsible for reporting in scenarios like miner rewards over $10,000 and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex.htm">decentralized on-chain exchanges</a>. He argued that without more clarity, some filers may attempt compliance but risk accidentally committing a felony in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you engage in an on-chain decentralized exchange of crypto for crypto and you therefore receive $10,000 in cryptocurrency, who do you report?&#8221; Brito questioned. &#8220;And by what standard should you measure whether an amount of a particular cryptocurrency is equivalent to more than $10,000?&#8221;</p>
<p>Brito also talked about the privacy implications of the tax reporting rules now taking effect. Requiring brokers to collect and share personally identifiable information on customers&#8217; crypto transactions with the IRS poses <strong>cybersecurity and identity theft</strong> risks, he contends.</p>
<p>The enhanced <strong>1099-B</strong> tax reporting requirements for digital asset transactions over $10,000 were <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-taxes/whats-new-crypto-tax-regulation">initially set to begin in January 2023</a> but were pushed back a year over confusion regarding the rules.</p>
<p>In August 2023, <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-suggestions-to-address-uncertain-tax-treatment-of-digital-assets/">Coin Center proposed that the IRS establish a de minimis exemption</a> for smaller crypto transactions. The new requirements have gone into effect without such an exemption in place, however.</p>
<p>Now the provisions are in effect, meaning crypto brokers must begin sending comprehensive reports to the IRS for all applicable 2024 transactions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

Amid the confusion surrounding the reporting rules, before they took effect, the <strong>U.S. Treasury Department</strong> stated they planned to release more guidance to aid in compliance. No formal guidelines have yet been issued, however, leaving filers unsure how to properly report anonymous or decentralized crypto transactions of over $10,000.</p>
<p>The goal of the increased <strong>crypto tax reporting</strong> is to close the tax gap — the difference between taxes owed and collected — which <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/rebuilding-irs-would-reduce-tax-gap-help-replenish-depleted-revenue-base#:~:text=Former%20IRS%20Commissioner%20Charles%20Rossotti,figure%20could%20exceed%20%241%20trillion.">the IRS estimates to be about $1 trillion per year</a>. Whether these controversial new requirements on crypto brokers will improve voluntary tax compliance and revenue collection is unclear. For now, cryptocurrency investors transacting over $10,000 should prepare for the IRS to receive detailed personal data on their 2024 transactions.</p>

<p>Singapore’s regulatory body the<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg"> Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)</a>  plans to begin piloting the digital currency “E-CNY” – also known as the digital yuan, in collaboration with China to encourage tourism spending.</p>
<p>The two countries first signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work together back in 2020. No timeline was given for when the digital currency would be trialled.</p>
<p>The digital currency project is developed by the People’s Bank of China, MAS and the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China– the digital currency will allow travellers from both countries to use E-CNY for tourism spending in both Singapore and China, said the regulatory body in a press release.</p>
<p>The discussions around the E-CNY took place at the 19th Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation in Tianjin earlier today – the event was co-chaired by Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Lawrence Wong, and the People’s Republic of China Executive Vice Premier of the State Council, Ding Xuexiang.</p>
<h3><b>What is the “E-CNY”</b></h3>
<p>The digital currency is China’s digital version of the yuan and it is not a decentralized currency – It is designed mainly for domestic retail payments at present. The new digital currency meets the public’s demand for cash in the digital economy era, <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap123_e.pdf">according to the BIS</a> – it will support the development of retail payment infrastructures and aims to improve payments.</p>
<p>Over the years China has been trailing the currency domestically – eventually, the country plans to explore pilot cross-border payment programmes.</p>
<h3><b>Singapore Sees No Future For Private Crypto </b></h3>
<p>Recently Singapore’s central bank’s managing director, Ravi Menon, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-central-bank-chief-sees-no-future-for-private-crypto.htm">emphasized</a> that private cryptocurrencies falling short of fundamental financial service tests will eventually fade from the monetary scene – He outlined his vision for the future monetary system, highlighting three key components: central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized bank liabilities, and well-regulated stablecoins.</p>
<p>“It has been a fruitful year of financial cooperation between Singapore and China. MAS welcomes the new initiatives in digital finance and capital markets connectivity, as these will catalyse new financial flows between our financial centres, and deepen trade and economic relations between our economies,” said Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director, MAS, in a press release.</p>
<p>The two countries also announced they would launch an exchange-traded funds (ETF) link between the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE).</p>
<p>In terms of travel, the two countries Singapore and China will put in place a 30-day mutual visa exemption agreement early next year &#8212; as the two countries agreed to further upgrade a trade pact between them, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-china-plan-reciprocal-30-day-visa-free-entry-media-2023-12-07/">reports Reuters. </a></p>

<p>Switzerland-based exchange traded product (ETP) provider 21Shares has confirmed its chief operating officer Lucy Reynolds, has left the firm.</p>
<p>Before joining 21Shares Reynolds was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-reynolds-89362940/">head of product management</a> at WisdomTree and joined 21Shares in 2020 – Reynolds was unavailable for comment on her departure from the firm.</p>
<p>Hany Rashwan the CEO of 21Shares told Cryptonews.com there is no change in senior management or cause for concern and that Lucy’s departure was “a mutual decision and has been in the works for at least six months so we’re just following the transition plan we designed together.”</p>
<p>At one point 21Shares<a href="https://21shares.com/research/two-billion-aum-threshold"> reached</a> $2 billion in assets under management with products listed on several European exchanges the provider continues to dominate the market. In March this year, 21Shares closed six of its crypto ETPs due to limited investor demand.</p>
<h2>Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF approval decision coming in January</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
21Shares is collaborating with Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest and has a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-and-21shares-amend-bitcoin-spot-etf-application.htm">application in the pipeline.</a></p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed deciding to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF and has been inundated with filings from approximately a dozen issuers, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-revises-bitcoin-etf-model-to-appease-sec-concerns.htm">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fidelity-submits-revised-application-for-bitcoin-etf-amid-increasing-confidence-regarding-approval.htm">Fidelity</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-race-intensifies-as-wisdomtree-invesco-both-file-submissions-within-24-hours-joining-blackrock.htm">Invesco</a>.</p>
<p>On November 20 the S-1 filing for the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF was amended regarding custody arrangements and asset valuation. Market watchers took the change as a positive sign as it indicated ongoing discussions with the SEC to bring the application in line with the regulator&#8217;s expectations. The updated filing also revealed the fee for the ETF will be 80 bps, the same as the fee proposed by BlackRock for its iShares Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have a fee! That’s new. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARKB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ARKB</a> will charge 80bps. First issuer to disclose this. <a href="https://t.co/KCfGYvc356">pic.twitter.com/KCfGYvc356</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A recent Bloomberg Intelligence analyst note put the probability for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF at 90%. A decision on the Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF is due on January 10.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">People asking me if we changed odds. No, we still holding line at 90% odds of approval by Jan 10 (aka this cycle), the same odds we&#39;ve had for months (before it was cool/safe).

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Over the past 30 days the price of bitcoin has surged 25% to $43,300, partly due to rising optimism that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved. A green light from the SEC would be a seal of approval for the nascent crypto sset class, opening up the market to billions of dollars in new money from institutional and retail investors.</p>

<p>The <strong>UK Treasury Committee</strong> released a report on December 2, advising the <strong>Bank of England</strong> to proceed cautiously with plans for a <strong>retail digital pound</strong>, citing concerns that its introduction <strong>could spark bank runs</strong> and destabilize the financial system.</p>
<p><a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42395/documents/210641/default/">In their report</a>, the cross-party group of MPs urged the central bank to impose <strong>strict limits on individual holdings</strong> of a digital currency, arguing lower thresholds could reduce risks of large-scale outflows from commercial bank deposits.</p>
<p>The committee warned that <strong>easy conversion</strong> of deposits into digital pounds could see consumers quickly withdraw funds at times of economic stress, increasing the <strong>likelihood of bank failures</strong>.</p>
<h2>Mitigating the Threat of Bank Runs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Treasury Committee said while the introduction of a <strong>central bank digital currency</strong> (CBDC), or digital pound, could provide <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/063/2023/011/article-A001-en.xml#:~:text=CBDC%20has%20special%20aspects%20that,lower%20costs%20and%20greater%20accessibility.">useful benefits to the economy</a>, these would need to clearly outweigh any <strong>risks posed to financial stability</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why do we need a limit for how many digital pounds I can hold?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VQ5VMiPLkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Members called for <strong>additional safeguards</strong> to mitigate threats of destabilizing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bloomberg-analyst-crypto-faced-its-own-set-of-bank-runs-alongside-wider-economy.htm">bank runs</a>, including setting <strong>maximum individual holdings</strong> below the proposed £10,000 to £20,000 limits.</p>
<p>The thresholds could then be <strong>gradually increased over time</strong> as authorities monitor the impact on commercial bank funding and lending rates.</p>
<h2>Privacy and Data Protection Concerns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Treasury Committee report also stressed the need for robust <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/people-want-data-privacy-but-don-t-always-know-what-they-re-8165.htm">privacy protections</a> within any digital pound framework.</p>
<p>It stated that primary legislation for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-residents-flags-privacy-concerns-in-digital-pound-consultations-bank-of-england.htm">UK CBDC</a> should <strong>prohibit the government</strong> or the central bank from <strong>accessing data</strong> for any purpose beyond law enforcement needs.</p>
<p>While the Bank of England has said it <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2023/2023/enabling-innovation-through-a-digital-pound">does not intend to use transaction data</a> for policy or regulatory purposes, the MPs said <strong>clear legal parameters</strong> are still required.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury Committee further advised the Bank of England to maintain an open mind on whether a retail digital pound is necessary.</p>
<p>It concluded that policymakers must gather <strong>solid evidence</strong> of clear <strong>economic benefits</strong> before deciding to introduce a digital version of the currency.</p>
<p>According to the report, the project should only move forward if authorities are confident that associated risks can be effectively managed.</p>
<p>For now, the Bank of England is <strong>still in the design phase</strong> as it continues analyzing the complex considerations around a potential CBDC.</p>
<p>Any final decisions are unlikely <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67590468">before the latter half of the decade</a>, pointing to a slow and cautious approach to developing a retail digital pound.</p>

<p>The list includes innovators like the co-founders of Injective Labs, the co-founder of Fractal, the co-founders of Toku, and leaders from financial establishments including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/apple-ends-partnership-with-goldman-sachs-as-tech-giant-expands-into-lending.htm">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-report-highlights-resurgence-in-defi-and-nft-sectors.htm">JPMorgan</a>. This representation of young crypto pioneers on Forbes&#8217; list demonstrates the vital role digital assets and blockchain technology are playing in shaping modern financial services and solutions.</p>
<h2>Young Visionaries Transforming Crypto &amp; Blockchain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Eric Chen and Albert Chon, cofounders of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/eric-chen-ceo-of-injective-labs-building-finance-specific-blockchains-current-state-of-defi-ep-263.htm">Injective Labs</a>, lead a blockchain platform that&#8217;s made significant strides in the decentralized finance space. Their Injective blockchain has processed over 300 million transactions, totaling nearly $13 billion, at an average cost below 1 cent. Supported by investors like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-in-philippines-binance-is-operating-without-a-license-heres-the-latest.htm">Binance</a> Labs and Mark Cuban, they raised $57 million. This January, they launched a $150 million fund, backed by crypto giants like Pantera Capital, to further propel decentralized finance.</p>
<p>Kenneth O’Friel and Dominika Stobiecka co-founded Toku, specializing in helping crypto startups manage token-based employee compensation and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/this-supreme-court-case-and-irs-broker-rule-together-could-redefine-crypto-taxation.htm">tax regulations</a> across over 100 countries. Their clients include notable firms like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/derivatives-trading-protocol-dydx-chain-commences-rewards-distribution-after-greenlight-from-community.htm">dYdX</a> and Protocol Labs. In March, Toku raised $20 million in a round led by Blockchain Capital.</p>
<p>Sei Labs, co-founded by Jeff Feng and Jayendra Jog, focuses on enhancing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">crypto</a> trading on its specialized blockchain. Developed in response to the 2021 GameStop frenzy, Sei offers faster transaction times than Ethereum and has quickly grown since its August launch, backed by $35 million from investors. The platform already boasts an estimated 7 million active wallets.</p>
<h2>The 2023 List</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Forbes&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2023/finance">2023 list</a> also featured numerous crypto and blockchain leaders.</p>
<p>Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap Labs, transformed an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum</a>-based concept into one of the most popular crypto applications. After working as an analyst at Siemens, Adams contributed to the development of Uniswap exchange in 2018, pioneering the use of automated market makers for decentralized cryptocurrency trading. Uniswap has amassed millions of users and earlier this year achieved a significant milestone, surpassing $1 trillion in lifetime trading volume.</p>
<p>Starting as an equity research analyst at Credit Suisse, Ria Bhutoria later joined the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-market-dominance-hits-18-month-low.htm">stablecoin</a> issuer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-signs-mou-with-sbi-holdings-to-expand-usdc-in-japan.htm">Circle</a> to develop their research platform. By 26, she rose to the position of Director of Research at Fidelity Digital Assets, managing $4.5 trillion in assets. Committed to diversity in the crypto space, Bhutoria invests in female and nonbinary founders through the decentralized collective Komorebi, alongside her work at Castle Island.</p>
<h2>&#8217;30 Under 30&#8242; On Chain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This year’s “30 Under 30” list was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/forbes-latest-under-30-list-data-will-be-listed-on-ethereum.htm">live</a> on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-l2-protocol-blast-faces-scrutiny-as-paradigm-raises-concerns-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Ethereum blockchain</a>, marking a new milestone as the publication marched onto web3.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forbes is at the forefront of marrying traditional media with cutting-edge technology. By launching the Under 30 list on the Ethereum blockchain, we&#8217;re not just recognizing the influential young leaders; we&#8217;re also demonstrating the vast, untapped potential of blockchain technology in the realm of data storage and security,&#8221; said Vadim Supitskiy, Forbes’ Chief Digital and Information Officer.</p>

<p>Although still below the all-time high of $342.98 in November 2021, Coinbase&#8217;s recent performance is noteworthy.</p>
<p>The surge follows comments by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong from earlier this week saying the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">settlement imposed on Binance</a> by the US Department of Justice marks a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-binance-settlement-marks-a-turning-point-for-crypto.htm">turning point for crypto</a>.</p>
<p>“The enforcement action against Binance, that’s allowing us to kind of turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of history,” Armstrong said.</p>
<h2>New bullish phase for crypto?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, the rise in the stock price also comes amid a broader bullish trend for the crypto market.</p>
<p>In the past month, COIN, has outperformed major assets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-the-united-states.htm">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ethereum.htm">Ethereum</a>, gaining more than 70%.</p>
<p>Already, COIN’s outperformance of spot crypto prices has given Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest to rebalance the holdings for its exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on Bitcoin and crypto.</p>
<p>Ark recently sold $5.3 million worth of Coinbase shares while acquiring about $1.2 million in Robinhood shares.</p>
<p>Following the sale, Coinbase and Robinhood constitute 13% and 4%, respectively, of the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF portfolio.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Coinbase&#8217;s stock performance has often mirrored the overall volatility in the crypto market.</p>
<p>When crypto prices rise, COIN tends to benefit, and when prices decline, its shares follow suit, and investors are therefore paying close attention now that COIN appears to outperform the major crypto assets.Top of FormBottom of Form</p>

<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s ARK Invest continues to make moves in the crypto sector, trimming its Coinbase stake while adding to its Robinhood position. The asset management firm sold nearly $5.3 million worth of Coinbase shares on Monday from its ARK Fintech Innovation ETF as the crypto exchange&#8217;s stock price hit a 19-month high.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/264917/cathie-wood-ark-invest-sells-coinbase-buys-robinhood#:~:text=Ark%20also%20bought%20143%2C063%20shares%20of%20Robinhood%2C%20worth%20around%20%241.2,Generation%20Internet%20fund%20on%20Friday.">ARK Invest bought $1.2 million in Robinhood stock</a>, its fifth purchase of the trading app company this month. The trades come as cryptocurrencies show signs of recovering from a brutal 2022 bear market.</p>
<h2>ARK Invest Trimming Coinbase After Big Jump</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
ARK Invest <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/11/28/ark-invest-sells-526m-coinbase-shares-as-price-hits-19-month-high/">offloaded 43,956 Coinbase shares on November 28</a> as the stock closed at $119.77, its highest point since April 2021. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COIN/">Coinbase’s share price</a> surged over 55% in November amid improved crypto market sentiment.</p>
<p>The $5.26 million Coinbase sale marks ARK&#8217;s largest dump of the crypto exchange&#8217;s shares since late July. Cathie Wood&#8217;s firm <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/coinbase-stock-cathie-wood-ark-invest-sell-50-million-of-coinbase-stock-cash-in-on-ripple-lawsuit-rally/">sold over $100 million worth of Coinbase</a> shares in July as prices traded around $90.</p>
<p>ARK Invest has also been offloading shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a cryptocurrency investment vehicle. On November 24, ARK&#8217;s <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/grayscale-gbtc-shrinking-discount">Next Generation Internet ETF sold 94,624 GBTC</a> shares worth around $3 million.</p>
<p>The sale comes after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-wood-ark-sells-over-700k-gbtc-shares-in-past-month.htm">ARK dumped nearly 700,000 GBTC shares</a> over the past month. However, the sales may not indicate ARK is less bullish on Bitcoin.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1728079592785682654">According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas</a>, ARK is likely selling GBTC to rebalance its weightings as the fund has surged 76% since August. ARK still aims to maintain a 9% allocation to GBTC despite the sales.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not defending ARK&#39;s btc predictions, but re its portfolio they like to sell winners (and vice-versa) to maintain desired weightings. Since <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GBTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$GBTC</a> is up 76% since Aug so ARK *has* to sell many shares to keep a 9%-ish weighting. And even w that selling its weighting has gone up.. <a href="https://t.co/juFYmOxyOs">pic.twitter.com/juFYmOxyOs</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1728079592785682654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;Since GBTC is up 76% since August ARK has to sell many shares to keep a 9%-ish weighting. And even with that selling, its weighting has gone up,&#8221; Balchunas noted on X.</p>
<h2>Cathie Wood Loading Up On Robinhood</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While cutting its Coinbase and GBTC stakes, ARK Invest continues to accumulate <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD/">shares of Robinhood</a>, the commission-free trading app popular among retail investors.</p>
<p>ARK purchased <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/cathie-wood-juggles-crypto-portfolio-adds-robinhood-offloads-5m-of-this-stock-amid-multi-month-high-bitcoin-etf-hype-1032853232">143,063 Robinhood shares worth $1.2 million</a> on Monday as the stock traded near $8.50. The investment makes ARK&#8217;s fifth Robinhood buy this month as the once high-flying company&#8217;s shares remain depressed.</p>
<p>ARK Invest has snapped up over 1.6 million Robinhood shares in 2023, representing a vote of confidence in the troubled firm. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/business/robinhood-layoffs.html">Robinhood laid off 23% of its staff in August 2022</a>, and an additional <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/personal-finance/2023/robinhood-cuts-7-of-workforce-amid-slowdown-in-trading-volumes/#:~:text=Robinhood%20laid%20off%209%25%20of,a%20slowdown%20in%20customers'%20trading.">7% in June 2023</a> amid continuously declining monthly active users and trading activity.</p>
<p>However, Robinhood&#8217;s <a href="https://financefeeds.com/robinhood-doubles-crypto-volumes-now-pays-5-interest/#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20trading%20volumes,by%2092%25%20to%20%242.3%20billion.">crypto trading volume spiked in October by 92%</a> even as its overall monthly users dropped. The company&#8217;s crypto-friendly platform could benefit from renewed interest in digital assets.</p>
<p>In addition, ARK has also been buying up shares of SoFi, the crypto-friendly banking app. On November 27, ARK&#8217;s <a href="https://fintel.io/sob/us/sofi">Fintech Innovation ETF acquired 252,421 SoFi shares</a>.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, ARK has purchased 1.6 million <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/">SoFi shares</a> worth $11 million at today&#8217;s prices. The buys signal ARK&#8217;s ongoing interest in crypto-adjacent stocks.</p>
<p>Cathie Wood and ARK Invest appear to be hedging their bets, trimming Coinbase and GBTC exposure while continuing to build Robinhood and crypto-related positions. The moves reflect ARK&#8217;s flexibility and willingness to adjust its strategies quickly.</p>
<p>With crypto and fintech stocks highly volatile, ARK seems intent on capturing gains while still maintaining stakes should the sector heat up again. As cryptocurrencies emerge from a bitter bear market, ARK&#8217;s agility could serve it well.</p>

<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to adopt a dovish monetary policy stance in 2024, according to projections published by Deutsche Bank on Monday. Analysts predict the Fed will cut interest rates by at least 100 basis points from current levels of around 5.25-5.50%.</p>
<h2>Easing Policy As Inflation Rate Descends</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://think.ing.com/articles/g10-fx-outlook-2024-the-dollars-long-goodbye/">ING expects the Fed to ease policy</a> next year as economic growth and inflation rates decelerate. The central bank aggressively hiked rates over the past year to combat surging consumer prices. With inflation expected to moderate, the Fed will have the capacity to cut rates and support the economy.</p>
<p>The accommodative stance would weaken the U.S. dollar, providing a tailwind for risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/dollar-slips-dovish-fed-speak-dials-down-rate-expectations-2023-10-10/">dollar tends to decline when the Fed adopts a dovish stance</a>, incentivizing investors to move into higher-yielding assets.</p>

<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/p-500-deutsche-bank-forecasts-152458650.html">The Fed is forecasted to deliver the biggest rate cuts</a> in 2024. Traders are betting on a decline of at least 100 basis points from this year&#8217;s peak levels, according to Deutsche Bank Research. Other central banks like the Bank of England and European Central Bank are also likely to cut rates, but less aggressively than the Fed.</p>
<p>The expected policy easing comes after the Fed raised <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/09/jerome-powell-fed-isnt-confident-its-done-enough-to-curb-inflation.html#:~:text=Big%20picture%2C%20the%20federal%20funds,do%20so%2C%E2%80%9D%20Powell%20said.">its benchmark rate from near zero in March 2022</a> to a current range of over 5.25% to 5.5%.</p>
<h2>Fed&#8217;s Monetary Policy Pivot to Support Growth</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-27/economists-see-stubborn-us-core-inflation-keeping-rates-higher">Economists widely expect inflation to continue descending</a> as supply chain pressures ease and demand moderates. Lower inflation will enable the Fed to pivot toward supporting economic growth and employment rather than solely focusing on price stability.</p>
<p>While the base case is for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-but-more-hikes-still-on-the-table-here-is-how-bitcoin-btc-reacted.htm">Fed rate cuts</a> and dollar weakness, risks are still present. Any reacceleration in inflation would force the Fed to reconsider easing policy. Analysts also point to potential shocks like higher oil prices, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/why-is-chinas-economy-slowing-down-could-it-get-worse-2023-09-01/">slower Chinese growth</a>, or stronger U.S. economic data as threats to expectations for a weaker dollar.</p>
<p>For now, traders are pricing in a dovish shift by the Federal Reserve in 2024. As the most influential central bank globally, the Fed’s monetary policy stance often sets the tone for risk sentiment and asset prices worldwide. The projected easing cycle presents a constructive backdrop for stocks and cryptocurrencies next year.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is set to initiate the second phase of its digital Hong Kong Dollar project next year, focusing on the exploration of innovative applications and reinforcing collaborations across the financial industry.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.hk01.com/tag/50745">Fintech Foresight Seminar</a> held by Hong Kong 01, HKMA Chief Fintech Officer <a href="https://www.hk01.com/%E8%B2%A1%E7%B6%93%E5%BF%AB%E8%A8%8A/962938/%E6%95%B8%E7%A2%BC%E6%B8%AF%E5%85%83-%E9%87%91%E7%AE%A1%E5%B1%80%E5%91%A8%E6%83%A0%E5%BC%B7-%E4%B8%8D%E6%9C%83%E9%96%89%E9%96%80%E9%80%A0%E8%BB%8A-%E5%86%80%E8%88%87%E6%A5%AD%E7%95%8C%E7%99%BC%E6%8E%98%E6%96%B0%E7%94%A8%E4%BE%8B">Nelson Chow stated</a> that Hong Kong’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cbdcs-not-yet-ready-for-mainstream-says-mastercard-expert.htm">central bank digital currency (CBDC)</a> has <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2023/20231030e3a1.pdf?utm_source=coinspaidmedia&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hong-kongs-e-hkd-pilot-starts-second-phase">completed its first phase</a> and will proceed to the next phase in 2024.</p>
<h2>Digital Hong Kong Dollar&#8217;s Second Phase</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Building on the groundwork laid in the e-HKD Pilot Program’s initial phase, the HKMA’s forthcoming step will delve into real-world applications of the digital Hong Kong Dollar, seeking to integrate it within the broader economic framework.</p>
<p>Like the United Kingdom or other developed countries and regions, Hong Kong is still in the phase of testing CBDC. Chow said, “Hong Kong is definitely not falling behind; it is among the leading group conducting research. The e-HKD Pilot Program is of research value to other central banks as well.”</p>
<p>This announced second phase will prioritize the assessment of the digital currency’s potential impact on everyday transactions, while also leveraging partnerships with banking institutions and fintech companies to expand its practical use and acceptance.</p>
<p>According to Chow, e-HKD can add significant value to the retail payment ecosystem, including programmability, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapores-central-bank-expands-asset-tokenization-initiatives-under-project-guardian.htm">tokenization</a>, and instant settlement, to facilitate faster, more cost-effective, and inclusive transactions, which is beneficial for new economic and financial activities, such as web3 transactions.</p>
<h2>HKMA&#8217;s Cautious Path to e-HKD</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chow added that the pilot program consists of predefined small-scale tests. Before a large-scale implementation can take place, further research is required to determine whether the associated benefits exist.</p>
<p>It was also reiterated by Chow that even the second phase is planned, there is currently no final decision on when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-uncertain-on-e-hkd-issuance-says-retail-cbdc-needs-more-study.htm">e-HKD</a> will be launched. The outcome of the test phases and the development needs of both local and international markets will be considered for the ultimate decision.</p>

<p>Mastercard’s expert Ashok Venkateswaran has expressed skepticism about the current viability of widespread central bank digital currencies (CBDC), claiming that the broad adoption of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapores-monetary-authority-to-expand-wholesale-cbdc-pilots.htm">CBDC</a> could be “difficult,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/17/mastercard-says-wide-adoption-of-cbdcs-is-difficult.html">according to CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>Venkateswaran, Mastercard’s Blockchain and Digital Assets Lead for Asia-Pacific, discussed the complexities surrounding the implementation of CBDCs during the <a href="https://www.fintechfestival.sg/">Singapore FinTech Festival</a>. He pointed out that for CBDC to be successful, they must be as accessible and spendable as traditional cash.</p>
<p>“The difficult part is adoption. So if you have CBDCs in your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-cold-wallets.htm">wallet</a>, you should have the ability for you to spend it anywhere you want – very similar to cash today,” said Venkateswaran.</p>
<p>However, implementing CBDCs would require substantial infrastructure development, a process that would involve considerable time and investment.</p>
<p>“[Building infrastructure to facilitate that] takes a lot of time and effort on a part of the country to do that. But a lot of the central banks nowadays have gotten very innovative because they are working very closely with private companies like ours, to create that ecosystem,” said Venkateswaran.</p>
<h2>Global CBDC Reality: Progress and Challenges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although the International Monetary Fund Managing Director <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/11/15/sp-111423-the-digital-finance-voyage-a-case-for-public-sector-involvement">Kristalina Georgieva</a> stated that CBDCs are “a safe and low-cost alternative” to cash and can “replace cash which is costly to distribute in island economies,” the complete implementation rate is relatively low.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">Atlantic Council</a>, 130 countries representing 98 percent of global economy are exploring central bank digital currencies. Yet only 11 of them have fully launched a digital currency. And even if a CBDC were introduced, consumers would still be “so comfortable using today’s type of money” that “there isn’t enough justification to have a CBDC,” Venkateswaran claimed.</p>
<p>On Nov.7, <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2023/mastercard-demonstrates-how-existing-commercial-bank-rails-could-drive-adoption-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdcs-in-the-future/">Mastercard announced</a> that it has completed the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) e-HKD <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kNwwURAAl4">Pilot Program</a>, showcasing its capability to power or assist in launching digital currencies like e-HKD.</p>

<p>Switzerland’s fifth largest cantonal bank, St.Galler Kantonalbank (SGKB), has partnered with SEBA Bank to offer custody and trading services for Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>SGKB announced that the service is initially available to a select group of wealth-management clients at SGKB with future plans to expand the offering to retail customers soon.</p>
<p>Christian Bieri, Head of B2B and Custody Solutions at SEBA Bank, said in an <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/260183/swiss-bank-launches-bitcoin-and-ether-custody-and-trading-services-in-partnership-with-seba">interview with The Block</a>, “St.Galler Kantonalbank and SEBA signed the contract earlier this year, after a short implementation project, SGKB is now ready to offer access to cryptocurrencies to a selected group of clients.”</p>
<p>Bieri stated that the bank currently focuses on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-surge-to-36000-driven-by-microstrategy-fomc-advocates.htm">bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-eth-rockets-up-8-2000-eth-incoming.htm">Ethereum</a> with an intent to include more cryptocurrencies based on clients’ demand. “In a first step bitcoin and ether, other currencies will follow shortly,” said Bieri.</p>
<p>This move marks SGKB’s first step into the digital asset space, driven by growing client interest in cryptocurrencies. The bank sees this move as a way to meet the clients’ evolving financial preferences.</p>
<figure id="attachment_125783" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-125783" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-125783 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698920521-glvr-falk-kohlmann.jpg" alt="Falk Kohlmann" width="1600" height="1069" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698920521-glvr-falk-kohlmann.jpg 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698920521-glvr-falk-kohlmann-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698920521-glvr-falk-kohlmann-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698920521-glvr-falk-kohlmann-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698920521-glvr-falk-kohlmann-1536x1026.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-125783" class="wp-caption-text">Falk Kohlmann / Source: SGKB</figcaption></figure>
<p>Falk Kohlmann, Head of Market Services at SGKB, shared his positive outlook on the collaboration. “Thanks to our cooperation with SEBA Bank, we’ve implemented a straightforward initial setup, which allows us to learn and grow well aligned to our clients’ needs,” Kohlmann said.</p>
<p>The partnership reflects a wider trend in Switzerland, with more banks expanding their service portfolios to include <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-1-rollbit-theta-network-neo.htm">cryptocurrency offerings</a>. Started with private and high-profile individuals, these services are now opening up to retail customers, labeling a significant shift in the Swiss banking sector’s convention towards digital assets.</p>

<p>As financial institutions worldwide explore the adoption of digital currencies, Hong Kong&#8217;s stance on its own <strong>Central Bank Digital Currency</strong> (CBDC), known as <strong>e-HKD</strong>, remains cautious. A <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/10/20231030-3/">recently published report</a> by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) highlights both the opportunities and challenges surrounding the implementation of a <strong>retail CBDC</strong> in the special administrative region.</p>
<p>Though the HKMA recognized <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3222209/how-can-hongkongers-benefit-e-hkd-consumers-can-draw-comfort-its-security-higher-returns-and-even">the potential advantages of e-HKD</a>—including faster and more cost-efficient transactions—the authority concluded that <strong>more research is necessary</strong>. This uncertainty comes despite <strong>Hong Kong&#8217;s clear ambitions</strong> to solidify its reputation as a virtual asset hub, demonstrated by its granting of the first set of licenses for cryptocurrency trading platforms earlier this year.</p>
<h2>Potential Advantages of Retail CBDC: More Than Just Digital Money</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The HKMA&#8217;s recently concluded Phase 1 of its pilot program was implemented to evaluate the <strong>feasibility and potential benefits</strong> of e-HKD. The pilot highlighted <strong>three primary areas</strong> where a retail CBDC could add value: programmability, tokenization, and <a href="https://thepaymentsassociation.org/article/atomic-settlements-the-next-regulatory-challenge/#:~:text=Atomic%20settlements%20allow%20simultaneous%20and,of%20partial%20or%20incomplete%20transactions.">atomic settlement</a>. These features could bring in a <strong>more efficient and inclusive financial ecosystem</strong> in Hong Kong, potentially redefining how transactions are conducted.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hong Kong&#39;s Monetary Authority explores the potential of a retail digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) in its CBDC pilot&#39;s phase 1.</p>
<p>E-HKD may enhance payment systems with programmability, tokenization, and faster transactions, but further investigation is needed.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBDC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CBDC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; TheLuwizz (@theluwizz) <a href="https://twitter.com/theluwizz/status/1719013315543007375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The authority also cautioned that the pilot programs involved a limited number of firms and were conducted in a controlled environment, however. As such, whether these advantages would scale effectively in a broader, real-world context still needs investigation.</p>
<h2>Roadblocks and Concerns: An Uncertain Path Forward</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While <strong>Phase 1 yielded promising results</strong>, the report also identified &#8220;<strong>minor frictions</strong>&#8221; that could become more prominent or even unacceptable in a larger-scale implementation. The HKMA mentioned that understanding the implications of these frictions is essential for the next phase of research, especially in a bustling financial center like Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The need for additional investigation is not solely confined to understanding these frictions. It extends to fully grasping <strong>how a retail CBDC might fit</strong> into Hong Kong&#8217;s existing financial ecosystem and its role in facilitating new forms of economic transactions while <strong>maintaining financial stability</strong>.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Framework and Next Steps: What Lies Ahead for Hong Kong and Retail CBDC?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hong Kong has not been idle in its quest to become a leading player in the digital asset industry. Earlier this year, it initiated a new regulatory regime and has since <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-aims-thrive-as-an-international-crypto-hub-despite-global-scrutiny.htm">awarded licenses to cryptocurrency trading platforms</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Project e-HKD</strong>, initiated in 2021, is another step in that direction. The HKMA now plans to &#8220;explore new use cases for an e-HKD and delve deeper into select pilots.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the report, the ultimate decision to issue a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/could-hong-kong-monetary-authority-launching-cbdc-help-digital-yuan-go-global.htm">retail CBDC in Hong Kong</a> will depend on market development and the outcome of further in-depth studies. Further intensive research will determine whether the e-HKD can bring about the envisioned benefits without compromising Hong Kong&#8217;s financial stability.</p>

<p>Kraken will provide user data to the IRS after a legal battle over crypto tax reporting.<em> Image by <a class="blue science-text js-contributor-link" href="https://stock.adobe.com/ca/contributor/205445908/michael-o-keene?load_type=author&amp;prev_url=detail" data-ingest-clicktype="details-contributor-link">Michael O&#8217;Keene</a>, Adobe Stock.</em>Major <strong>U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Kraken</strong> will provide limited user information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <strong>next month</strong> following a court order received in June. The data concerns specific Kraken users who conducted <strong>transactions over $20,000</strong> between 2016 and 2020.</p>
<h2>IRS Gains Limited Access to Kraken User Data</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/notice-of-irs-information-request?lid=fja75vrbc5d0">legal battle between Kraken and the IRS began in May 2021</a> when a federal court authorized the tax agency to serve a John Doe summons on Kraken. The goal was to <strong>identify potential tax evaders</strong> among the exchange&#8217;s users. Kraken initially pushed back on the broad request.</p>
<p>After multiple rounds in court, Kraken successfully convinced the court to substantially <strong>reduce the scope of information</strong> it must produce, as well as the number of affected users.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-kraken-ordered-submit-user-transaction-data-irs-heres-latest.htm">According to the June court order</a>, Kraken must provide names, birthdates, taxpayer IDs, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and transaction histories for users with over $20,000 in transactions in any single year from 2016 to 2020.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="IRS crackdown! Kraken ordered to reveal user data in major cryptocurrency investigation - 259" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slnDJ7njvCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The original IRS request</strong> covered more extensive user data including <strong>IP addresses</strong>, <strong>employment information</strong>, sources of wealth, <strong>net worth</strong>, and banking details. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/kraken-ordered-to-turn-over-its-users-information-to-the-irs#:~:text=The%20judge%20rejected%20IRS%20demands,United%20States%20of%20America%20v.">The court denied the IRS</a> access to this information.</p>
<p>The number of affected <strong>Kraken users was lowered to 42,017</strong>, down from the original 59,331 the IRS sought information on. <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/kraken-begins-notifying-customers-it-will-send-their-data-to-the-irs-this-november">Kraken notified impacted users via email</a> this week that it expects to share the covered <strong>data with the IRS</strong> in early November.</p>
<p>This development represents the latest example of tensions between crypto exchanges and government tax authorities. In 2018, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/02/26/coinbase-tells-13000-users-its-sending-their-data-to-the-irs/">Coinbase shared details on approximately 13,000 users</a> with the IRS after receiving a similar summons.</p>
<h2>IRS Targets Crypto Exchanges to Uncover Potential Tax Evaders</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The IRS has also targeted other major crypto firms such as <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/court-authorizes-service-john-doe-summons-seeking-identities-us-taxpayers-who-have-used-0">Circle and Poloniex with John Doe summons</a> to uncover <strong>potential tax evaders</strong> among their user bases.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/irs-violated-privacy-in-coinbase-summons-dispute-groups-argue">industry experts argue these summons undermine user privacy</a> and overreach into <strong>sensitive personal finance data</strong>. Others contend <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/biden-administration-unveils-new-crypto-tax-reporting-rules-2023-08-25/">the tax agency is within its rights to request transaction information</a> relevant to enforcing tax compliance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Cryptocurrency taxation is a complex issue given the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/23/crypto-tax-compliance-remains-minefield-as-irs-leaves-key-questions-unresolved/">lack of clear guidelines from the IRS</a> on how different types of crypto activity should be reported. For now, the responsibility falls on users to properly track and document their transactions.</p>
<h2>Tax Implications for Crypto Traders as Scrutiny Increases</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The latest Kraken order should be seen as a reminder for <strong>U.S. cryptocurrency traders</strong> to ensure tax obligations are met. <strong>Failure to report income</strong> and capital gains from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/10/31/will-your-crypto-trading-lead-to-an-irs-audit/">crypto investing can potentially trigger IRS audits</a>, penalties, and interest charges.</p>
<p>Consulting with a <strong>qualified crypto tax specialist</strong> is recommended for users unsure of how to handle tax reporting. Software tools to generate transaction reports can also help traders gather necessary data.</p>
<p>Maintaining accurate records is key. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets">The IRS treats digital assets as property</a>, meaning capital gains taxes apply. Exchanges of one coin for another is a taxable event. While the regulatory situation creates challenges, crypto users should make a good-faith effort to comply with tax rules to avoid problems.</p>
<p>The Kraken situation illustrates how exchanges face pressure to provide user data. As <strong>cryptocurrency adoption</strong> grows, government scrutiny around taxation will likely increase. Users should prepare now to avoid issues later.</p>

<p>According to a Tuesday release from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), <strong>BlackRock Advisors LLC</strong> has agreed to a <strong>$2.5 million penalty</strong> for failing to accurately describe investments in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>The development is of particular interest as it coincides with speculation around <strong>BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF</strong>.</p>
<h2>What Did BlackRock Get Wrong?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-226">According to the SEC</a>, from 2015 to 2019, BlackRock&#8217;s Multi-Sector Income Trust made substantial investments in Aviron Group, a firm that specialized in developing advertising plans for films. Despite the firm&#8217;s role in the trust&#8217;s portfolio, BlackRock mischaracterized Aviron as a &#8220;<strong>Diversified Financial Services</strong>&#8221; entity in multiple annual and semi-annual reports. Additionally, BlackRock claimed higher interest rates paid by Aviron than were actually the case. The discrepancies were later <strong>identified and corrected</strong> by BlackRock in 2019.</p>

<p>The recent charge occurred amid heightened scrutiny from the SEC over firms dealing with cryptocurrency assets&#8211; and the SEC&#8217;s action against BlackRock could have larger <strong>implications for crypto regulation</strong>. This is particularly important since BlackRock, along with other financial institutions, is waiting for the SEC&#8217;s decision on their respective Bitcoin ETF applications. While BlackRock has corrected its reporting inaccuracies, the charge raises questions about how the SEC views the firm&#8217;s <strong>managerial competencies</strong>, especially as it waits for approval for its crypto investment products.</p>

<p>Today,<strong> Grayscale Investments</strong> announced a partnership with the UK-based global index provider <strong>FTSE Russell</strong> to introduce the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sector Index Series. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/grayscale-crypto-sectors-setting-a-standard-for-the-crypto-asset-class">The index hopes to bring clarity</a> to the fast-growing, yet often misunderstood crypto asset market by offering a <strong>structured framework</strong> for measuring the performance of different digital assets.</p>
<h2><strong>The Framework: Identifying Five Distinct Sectors</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-investments-partners-with-ftse-russell-roll-out-crypto-sector-index-series.htm">FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors Index Series</a> have been classified into five distinct categories: <strong>Currencies</strong>, <strong>Smart Contract Platforms</strong>, <strong>Financials</strong>, <strong>Consumer and Culture</strong>, and <strong>Utilities and Services</strong>. </p>
<p>Each sector provides a lens through which investors can better comprehend the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency market</a>. Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell plan to reassess these sectors quarterly to keep pace with the dynamic crypto asset class.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>&#8220;Investors have increasingly expressed interest in diversifying beyond crypto&#8217;s largest assets &#8211; Bitcoin and Ethereum &#8211; and many look to Grayscale to better understand this robust, evolving asset class,&#8221; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/grayscale-launches-crypto-indices-partnership-with-ftse-russell-2023-10-24/">CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>In traditional finance, currencies serve three main functions: they are a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mark-cuban-says-crypto-is-a-store-of-value-redditors-right-t-9087.htm">store of value</a>, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. Similarly, the <strong>Currencies</strong> sector in the index focuses on crypto assets that perform these functions, such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, Litecoin, and Ripple.</p>
<h3><strong>Role of Smart Contracts in Crypto</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Smart Contract Platforms</strong>, a key part of the crypto sector, have been gaining attention since <strong>Ethereum&#8217;s launch</strong> in 2015. These platforms have expanded the range of possibilities within the cryptocurrency market. They serve as the foundation for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp">decentralized applications</a>, which can range from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <strong>Uniswap</strong> to gaming environments like <strong>The Sandbox</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/5-projects-enabling-smart-contract-development-on-bitcoin.htm">Smart contract platforms</a> offer an edge <strong>against centralization</strong>, often leveraged by tech giants, by creating a decentralized environment that aligns the incentives between developers and users.</p>
<h3><strong>Financials: Liquidity in Crypto Economy</strong></h3>
<p>Another sector under the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors is <strong>Financials</strong>, focusing on applications that facilitate borrowing, lending, and trading of crypto assets <strong>peer-to-peer</strong>. These platforms often offer more efficient and <strong>cost-effective transactions</strong> compared to traditional financial services. </p>
<p>The Financials sector, in essence, provides the economic backbone to the crypto economy by facilitating liquidity and efficient capital allocation.</p>
<h3><strong>Consumer and Culture: From Art to Ownership</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Consumer and Culture</strong> sector covers applications that affect creative industries like entertainment, art, and media. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/nft/">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</a> are the driving force in this sector, offering new forms of ownership and changing how value is perceived in digital assets.</p>
<p><strong>Governance tokens</strong> are also part of this sector, facilitating decentralized decision-making processes within protocols or applications.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<h3><strong>Utilities and Services: The Core Elements of Crypto Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Utilities and Services</strong> sector is described as integral to the functioning of the crypto ecosystem. This sector includes applications that provide real-time connections to <a href="https://blockchainoraclesummit.io/oracles-as-a-catalyst-for-bridging-real-world-assets-on-chain/">real-world assets through oracles</a>, enhance asset liquidity through <strong>liquid staking solutions</strong>, and offer various consumer services through decentralized networks. These services help strengthen the overall crypto architecture, making it more robust and versatile.</p>
<p>Tokens in the Utilities and Services sector also enable investors to pool their resources, lowering the barriers for network participation. The sector includes other services like wallets, bridges, and payment systems, which are instrumental in <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/the-future-of-defi-integrating-traditional-finance-and-decentralized-finance/">integrating crypto applications with the traditional financial ecosystem</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact on Investment Strategies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors index provides a reliable roadmap for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/four-investment-strategies-to-make-day-trading-less-risky-9024.htm">investment strategies</a> in the crypto market. For example, assets linked to smart contract platforms and the &#8220;Financials&#8221; sector could be of particular interest for those focusing on <strong>blockchain&#8217;s capability</strong> to streamline and advance traditional systems.</p>
<p>The new index could serve as an integral part of <strong>investment planning</strong> for those interested in the dynamism of crypto assets, offering timely information that adapts to the market&#8217;s volatile nature.</p>
<p>In short, Grayscale Investments&#8217; partnership with FTSE Russell to introduce the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sector Index Series represents a major step in structuring the crypto asset market. By categorizing crypto assets into distinct sectors and committing to regular updates, this initiative could provide investors with a reliable framework for understanding this complex and continually evolving asset class. </p>
<p>The indices also showcase the growing integration of crypto assets into the global financial system, marking them as more than a speculative investment but as components of broader economic structures.</p>

Although the exact value of the transaction and the identity of the seller are undisclosed, the deal represents a milestone in the application of <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/article-time-for-central-bank-digital-currencies-to-prove-their-worth/"><strong>CBDCs in global trade</strong></a>.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/Taur19/status/1715560783776456861"></oembed></figure><p>The Chinese government has expressed interest in broadening the <strong>international scope</strong> of its currency, the renminbi. Using the Digital Yuan for large-scale global commodities like crude oil could bolster this strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>As of the end of June, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-digital-yuan-transactions-seeing-strong-momentum-says-cbank-gov-yi-2023-07-19/">the Digital Yuan trading volume reached 1.8 trillion yuan</a> ($250 billion), contributing to <strong>0.16% of the cash in circulation</strong>, according to data revealed earlier this year.</p><h2><strong>China&#8217;s Lead in the CBDC Arena</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>China&#8217;s CBDC is among the most advanced in the world. Most major economies are exploring the development of their own central bank digital currencies, but China seems to be ahead in actual implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>The former governor of the People&#8217;s Bank of China disclosed that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-digital-yuan-hits-250-billion-transaction-volume-central-bank-governor-reports.htm">the total transaction count for the Digital Yuan had reached 950 million</a> as of July 2023. Additionally, the country has integrated <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/digital-rmb-smart-contracts-cbdc/">smart-contract functionality into its CBDC</a>, expanding its utility.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh-jX8AwpZI"></oembed></figure><p>The Digital Yuan&#8217;s <strong>increasing transaction volumes</strong> and <strong>advancements</strong> indicate its readiness for broader applications. While its primary focus has been domestic, its cross-border potential is attracting increased interest.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Implications for the Future</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The <strong>PetroChina deal</strong> might serve as a precursor for more global commodities trades using CBDCs.</p><p>Additionally, the transaction showcases <strong>China&#8217;s growing influence</strong> in the digital currency arena, particularly at a time when the country is also working to accelerate the development and application of its CBDC through initiatives like the <a href="https://www.nfcw.com/2023/10/23/386190/china-offers-financial-incentives-for-companies-moving-into-shenzhens-digital-yuan-zone/">digital yuan industrial park in Shenzhen</a>.</p><p>The PetroChina transaction offers a tangible example of how digital currencies like the Digital Yuan could be incorporated into the <strong>global trade framework</strong>. The deal showcases the <strong>viability of CBDCs</strong> in large-scale, international transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>As CBDCs evolve, the integration into various sectors, including the energy market, will likely be a key metric in evaluating their success and utility. This event, therefore, could serve as an additional data point for analysts, policymakers, and industry leaders who are gauging the practical implications of <strong>digital currencies in international trade</strong>.</p>

The topics that dominated the conversation were the strength of the labor market, ongoing inflation, and the Fed&#8217;s monetary policy.</p><p>The discussion held importance in light of the upcoming <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm">Federal Open Market Committee</a> meeting scheduled for October 31-November 1.</p><h2>Inflation: The Balancing Act</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Jerome Powell&#8217;s remarks came at a crucial time when <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c59d1a0c-9cda-4749-9c5b-dd7691b46f0a">inflation in the US</a> has been a dominant concern. Powell observed that inflation remains elevated, above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target of 2%.&nbsp;</p><iframe loading="lazy" title="WATCH LIVE: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announces interest rate decision" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsNJyjoCzxs?start=374&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>He pointed out that a return to this target level may necessitate below-trend growth and some adjustments in labor conditions. He also indicated that the effects of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-raises-interest-rates-by-25-bps-maintains-optionality-further-hikes-here-how-crypto-reacted.htm">previous interest rate hikes</a> by the Fed may not have fully trickled down into the economy.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Achieving this goal might require a period of below-trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions,&#8221; Powell said.</p><h2>Labor Markets and Economic Strength: A Mixed Bag</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The Chairman acknowledged the vigor of the US economy, referring specifically to the tight labor market. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-picks-up-august-wages-gains-slow-2023-09-01/">the unemployment rate has stayed stable at 3.8%</a> despite interest rate increases since March 2022. This defies expectations, as the economy has been performing above its anticipated <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-lower-2023-08-30/">annual growth rate of 1.8%</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;The unemployment rate remains stable at 3.8%, showcasing an economy performing above the anticipated growth rate of 1.8% annually,&#8221; Powell commented.&nbsp;</p><p>He also flagged evidence of the labor market returning to pre-pandemic levels, however, suggesting that the market may be cooling.</p><h2>Financial Conditions: Market Reactions and Future Moves</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Powell drew attention to recent market developments, particularly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-federal-reserve-economy-interest-rates-79fdf75d519ec3d05c8dd485552834e3">the spike in bond yields</a>, suggesting that such increases have tightened financial conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Powell said, &#8220;Higher market-based interest rates could do the same job as Fed rate increases if sustained over time.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the Chairman was cautious about future policy measures, stating that the Federal Reserve is &#8220;proceeding carefully&#8221; in assessing the necessity for any additional rate hikes.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/_lenapetrova/status/1715049377478390059[/embed]<p>TradeStation Global head of market strategy <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/fed-s-powell-live-coverage-of-pivotal-speech-as-bond-yields-surge/card/powell-walking-middle-line-between-hawk-and-dove-strategist-VZ1tPPIymK15O5LGS8Vo">David Russell observed</a>, &ldquo;Jerome Powell continues to walk a middle line between hawk and dove. The Fed still isn&rsquo;t sure whether it&rsquo;s done enough.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/fed-s-powell-live-coverage-of-pivotal-speech-as-bond-yields-surge/card/powell-tries-to-calm-markets-economist-says-KRkK8eqh1xmUZbSKuOeQ">Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial</a>, commented, &#8220;Powell&#8217;s aim was to calm markets,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the economy is no longer on a strong growth trajectory.&#8221;</p><p>As the Federal Open Market Committee meeting looms on the horizon for October 31 to November 1, Jerome Powell stressed the Federal Reserve&#8217;s cautious approach to future policy decisions. The expectation is that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/personal-finance/2023/10/12/inflation-rate-update/">the benchmark policy rate will stay within the 5.25% to 5.5% range</a> for the upcoming meeting.</p><p>Subsequent to Powell&#8217;s speech, the stock market exhibited volatility with both gains and losses recorded. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s quantitative tightening measures and federal deficit outlook also prompted shifts in Treasury yields.</p><p>Overall, Jerome Powell&#8217;s discussion at the Economic Club of New York offered insights into the state of the US economy. It also provided an understanding of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s cautious stance toward policy changes, emphasizing its need to balance economic strength with prevailing concerns about inflation.&nbsp;</p>

The letter was addressed to National Security Advisor <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSullivan46">Jake Sullivan</a> and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/Brian-Nelson">Brian Nelson</a>, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Department of the Treasury.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Department of the Treasury announced new sanctions today against entities and individuals linked to Hamas, including a Gaza-based business accused of acting as a bitcoin conduit for terrorists.&nbsp;</p><h2>Terrorism and Crypto Connection Under Scrutiny</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://www.publicnow.com/view/520547C0C5647D3E486BD83387954A1820A4E5EE?1697640449">The congressional letter</a> questioned the effectiveness of current measures to deter the use of digital assets for financing terrorism. The lawmakers, including key members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, specifically referenced <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-cash-to-crypto-global-finance-maze-israels-sights-2023-10-16/">Hamas&#8217;s solicitation of bitcoin donations</a> in the lead-up to its attacks on Israel.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-armed-wing-announces-suspension-bitcoin-fundraising-2023-04-28/">Hamas announced in April 2023 that it would cease accepting Bitcoin donations</a> due to the transparency of the blockchain network, however, revealing that most of their donations have been carried out through traditional banking systems.</p><p>&ldquo;Given the clear and present danger posed by the financing of these and other militant organizations, we ask the Administration to provide additional details on its plan to prevent the use of crypto for the financing of terrorism,&rdquo; the letter read.</p><p>Despite the urgent tone of the letter, efforts to regulate crypto funding for terrorist activities have been relatively subdued. Senator Warren has been a strong advocate for the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/download/crypto-aml-one-pager_72623">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023</a>, co-sponsored by Senator Roger Marshall.
