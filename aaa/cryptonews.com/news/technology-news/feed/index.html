<p>Solana Mobile’s recently announced <strong>Chapter 2</strong> <strong>web3 phone</strong> has seen skyrocketing demand, with preorders selling out within the first day of the launch announcement.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://two.solanamobile.com/">Solana Mobile Chapter 2</a> phone was announced earlier this week as a cheaper follow-up to the company&#8217;s first web3 phone, <strong>the Saga</strong>. Chapter 2 is being offered initially at $450, less than the $599 price tag for the Saga.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2 Sales to Eclipse Saga&#8217;s First Year</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Solana Labs</strong> co-founder Raj Gokal told TechCrunch that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/18/solana-mobiles-second-phone-announcement-drives-buying-frenzy/">Chapter 2 hit its seven-day sales goal</a> in just the first 24 hours. An impressive 25,000 preorders came in within the first day, followed by 30,000 orders in the first 30 hours after the launch.</p>
<p>This is a massive increase compared to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solanas-smartphone-saga-needs-25000-user-base-to-attract-developers.htm">Saga, which saw lackluster demand</a> when it debuted mid-last year with a $1000 price point. The Saga didn’t gain popularity until its price was dropped to $599 and it started offering <strong>crypto rewards</strong> to owners through decentralized apps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solana Mobile Chapter 2 with Referrals and Airdrops" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4UflFkFqqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>SAGA gained popularity almost overnight when the decentralized app <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-saga-phone-fetches-5000-on-ebay-amid-bonk-meme-coin-frenzy.htm">Bonk announced it would provide 30 million BONK</a> tokens to SAGA owners for free. At the time, the 30 million BONK tokens were worth more than the $599 cost of the SAGA phone, which meant users could essentially get the SAGA device for free just by claiming their BONK crypto reward.</p>
<p>The promotion catalyzed a sales frenzy, with <a href="https://blockonomi.com/bonk-fever-how-a-meme-coin-mania-sold-thousands-of-solanas-crypto-phones-overnight/">SAGA selling out in just two days</a> after the Bonk announcement as crypto fans rushed to claim their <strong>free tokens</strong> along with the phone.</p>
<p>Now, Chapter 2 is set to eclipse 12 months’ worth of Saga sales in its first week alone, demonstrating the outstanding interest in Solana Mobile’s new cheaper web3 phone.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Driving the Preorder Frenzy?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are several factors contributing to the red-hot demand for Chapter 2 presales.</p>
<p>Firstly, the phone offers similar web3 capabilities to the Saga at a more affordable $450 price point. This combines with crypto fans’ growing awareness of the benefits offered by web3 phones like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm">built-in crypto wallets</a> and access to <strong>decentralized apps</strong>.</p>
<p>Secondly, the success of BONK promotion for the Saga has built anticipation that the new phone will offer even more lucrative incentives.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can’t wait for Chapter 2 <a href="https://twitter.com/solanamobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@solanamobile</a> <a href="https://t.co/xtEqTraVn3">pic.twitter.com/xtEqTraVn3</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Big Joe (@SolanaMoJo) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaMoJo/status/1747804862530601374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While Chapter 2 won’t have the <a href="https://solanamobile.com/rewards">Saga’s genesis token</a> for redeeming rewards, Solana Mobile has hinted at “building on this experience” with partnerships with crypto projects offering incentives to new phone owners.</p>
<p>Lastly, Solana Mobile designed Chapter 2 to enable greater flexibility for developers and users in the web3 space. With no restrictions on supported tokens or NFTs, and no platform fees, crypto projects have a greater incentive to partner with Solana Mobile.</p>
<h2>Can Solana Mobile Sustain the Hype Around Chapter 2?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The key question is whether Solana Mobile can sustain interest and sales momentum for Chapter 2 leading up to its slated launch in early 2025.</p>
<p>The company will need to deliver on its promises of crypto incentives for Chapter 2 owners. The demand might turn out to be merely hype that will fizzle out, especially with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8765604/">tech fans’ tendency to have short attention spans</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless, the staggering early preorder numbers demonstrate the surging mainstream appeal of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vertu-introduces-metavertu2-a-revolutionary-web3-and-ai-smartphone-how-does-it-work.htm">web3 phones</a>. If Solana Mobile can capture and hold people’s imagination, Chapter 2 could start a new chapter of rapid growth for web3 mobile adoption.</p>

<p>Ethereum&#8217;s upcoming upgrade, &#8220;Cancun-Deneb&#8221; (also known as &#8220;Dencun&#8221;), is set to begin testing on January 17, as per an <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/860/commits/8a92d6d21f38d498922a1bb78d32e40a8f207653">official note published</a> on the Ethereum Github repository.</p>
<p>According to the latest Ethereum All Core Developers Consensus Call report, Ethereum developers have confirmed their progress towards launching a Goerli shadow fork for testing the Cancun/Deneb upgrade with all clients. This testing phase is expected to be initiated within the next one to two weeks.</p>
<p>The initial testing will take place on the Goerli testnet, followed by implementation on the Sepolia testnet on January 30 and the Holesky testnet on February 7.</p>
<p>The Cancun/Deneb upgrade is currently undergoing testing on Devnet 12, where all execution layer (EL) and consensus layer (CL) client combinations, including the Prysm client, have been integrated. The MEV-Boost software has been activated for most client combinations, with the exception of those involving the Prysm client.</p>
<p>The introduction of a shadow fork is part of the testing process, serving as a smaller-scale test fork that focuses on specific improvements needed before implementing the Dencun upgrade on the main protocol.</p>
<p>However, the Ethereum team has not yet specified when Dencun will be deployed on the mainnet. The Dencun upgrade includes several tools designed to reduce fees, enable new features for bridges and staking pools, and limit the use of self-destruct operations on smart contracts.</p>
<p>After testing, the next goal will be to distribute the changes on the mainnet around the end of February, although these dates are subject to change depending on the outcome of the testnet forks.</p>
<h2><b>Ethereum&#8217;s Deneb-Cancun Upgrade Introduces Proto-Danksharding for Enhanced Scalability and Reduced Transaction Costs on Layer 2 Networks</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/will-cancun-upgrade-give-ethereum-eth-the-much-needed-pump-experts-believe-retik-finance-retik-will-still-give-10x-better-returns.htm">upcoming Ethereum upgrade</a> is set to introduce changes to the two mainnet layers of Ethereum: the execution layer, overseeing smart contract execution, and the consensus layer, focusing on blockchain consensus through staking.</p>
<p>Specifically, the upgrade for the execution layer will be named Cancun, while the consensus layer upgrade will be referred to as Deneb, collectively forming the Deneb-Cancun upgrade.</p>
<p>A key feature of the Deneb-Cancun upgrade is Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844), also known as proto-danksharding. EIP-4844 aims to enhance Ethereum&#8217;s scalability, surpassing the current capabilities of Layer 2 solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-eth-vs-retik-finance-retik-how-will-these-two-giants-perform-in-2024.htm">EIP-4844</a> is designed to enable Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and retrieve off-chain data, addressing the data and storage requirements of blockchain applications. Once activated, EIP-4844 is expected to reduce transaction costs on Layer 2 rollup solutions, including Optimism and Arbitrum, compared to their current rates.</p>
<p>This proposal also allows layer-2 rollup networks to temporarily store certain transaction data using a new format called &#8220;blobs.&#8221; These blobs can be deleted after 18 days, providing a potential reduction in transaction fees on layer-2 networks.</p>
<p>Initially, before Shapella, developers had decided to postpone the inclusion of EIP 4844 in the context of updates, given its complexity, preferring to focus on ETH withdrawals in staking.</p>
<p>However, Ethereum developers have delved into the technical details of EIP 4844.</p>
<p>Other proposals in the Dencun upgrade include EIP-1153, introducing a &#8220;transient storage&#8221; system to reduce fees further, and EIP-4788, enhancing transparency by storing the root of each Beacon chain block in a smart contract that applications can query. The data from EIP-4788 is expected to be utilized in new features for bridges and staking pools.</p>
<h2><b>Concerns Arise Over Potential Delay in Ethereum&#8217;s Dencun Upgrade Deployment on Mainnet</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In an Ethereum consensus-layer meeting held a month ago, concerns were raised about the potential delay in deploying the Ethereum upgrade known as &#8220;Dencun &#8221; on the mainnet. Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation highlighted the absence of the upgrade on public testnets like Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky.</p>
<p>Beiko pointed out that if Dencun wasn&#8217;t launched on a public testnet before the November 2023 Devconnect developer conference, the mainnet deployment might be delayed beyond the Christmas holidays, possibly into 2024.</p>
<p>Factors such as the readiness of the software code, testing across Ethereum&#8217;s execution and consensus layers, and the preparedness of multiple client teams were deemed critical for Dencun&#8217;s mainnet deployment. At the time of the meeting, the upgrade work was in the &#8220;devnet phase,&#8221; with plans to test on a localized developer network called &#8220;Devnet 9&#8221; before transitioning to the public testnet phase.</p>
<p>Dencun would represent the first major update since the release of Shapella earlier this year, which allowed for ether withdrawals in staking (ETH) from the blockchain. Ethereum upgrades typically undergo several months of testing before being deployed to the mainnet. The previous upgrade, codenamed &#8220;Shapella,&#8221; began testing on February 7 and was launched on the mainnet on April 12.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@zooko/a-new-era-for-me-personally-eae2de3a936e">Zooko Wilcox</a>, the creator of the privacy-oriented blockchain network Zcash, is stepping down as CEO of Electric Coin Co., the primary developer behind Zcash. Wilcox has served as the project&#8217;s leader since its creation in 2015.</p>
<p>The decision was made by the Board of Directors, which includes Alan Fairless, Michelle Lai, Zaki Manian, Christina Garman, and Wilcox himself.</p>
<p>Josh Swihart, who has been with Electric Coin Company (ECC) for five and a half years, will be taking over as the new CEO. Swihart previously served as the company&#8217;s marketing director for seven months in 2018 and has been the Senior Vice President of Growth for the past two years.</p>
<p>Swihart is noted for his leadership skills in finding product-market fit, unlocking partnerships, improving Zcash usability, and increasing adoption. Swihart, who took a four-month break from ECC to work as a part-time investor at Denver Angels in Colorado, is seen as having a strong entrepreneurial, technical, and product background. ECC expressed confidence in Swihart&#8217;s leadership, emphasizing his vision for ECC and his passion for Zcash.</p>
<p>Swihart, in a blog post, mentioned that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/zcash-extends-rally-after-proof-of-stake-plan-twitter-shills.htm">Zcash&#8217;s focus</a> in the &#8220;new season&#8221; would be to &#8220;find product-market fit.&#8221; He outlined near-term priorities, including iterating more quickly, increasing Zcash&#8217;s utility, and making Electric Coin Company financially sustainable.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Wilcox reflected on his time building Zcash, describing it as an incredible experience. He noted the difficulty of separating Zcash from his identity and emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy distinction between the two.</p>
<p>Wilcox, upon stepping down as the CEO of Electric Coin Company, expressed his intention to take a couple of months to reflect on how he can best contribute. He noted that Zcash&#8217;s role in human history is much bigger than that of any individual.</p>
<p>He added that any commitment he makes in the future would need to include Zcash because, in his view, the Zcash community represents &#8220;freedom&#8217;s best hope.&#8221; This underscores his continued dedication to the principles and goals of Zcash, even as he transitions to a different role within the organization. Wilcox will continue to serve as a director on the board of the Bootstrap Project, the parent company of ECC.</p>
<p>The transition in leadership comes as Zcash continues to play a significant role in advancing privacy-centric technologies in the blockchain space.</p>
<h2><b>Zcash&#8217;s zk-SNARK: Pioneering Privacy in Blockchain Transactions Faces Market Fluctuations Amid CEO Change</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Zcash network, launched in 2016 as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, is renowned for its privacy features, notably the &#8220;shielded addresses&#8221; or &#8220;z-addresses&#8221; that enable encryption on one or both sides of a blockchain transaction. Zcash relies on a mathematical proof known as zk-SNARK, derived from zero-knowledge cryptography, marking one of the hottest trends in blockchain architecture in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/master/rtd_pages/basics.html#project-history">Zcash&#8217;s technical documentation</a> explains that zk-SNARK allows the owner of a z-address to selectively disclose transaction details to trusted third parties using a view key.

<p>Ethereum is one of the most widely used blockchain networks globally. Recent <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/64d01c8d3e922f69b35d7f0a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findings</a> from CoinMarketCap show that Ethereum has the highest number of total developers, accounting for 16% of all developers in the crypto sector.</p>
<figure id="attachment_142932" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142932" style="width: 1274px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-142932 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm.png" alt="" width="1274" height="716" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm.png 1274w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-1024x575.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1274px) 100vw, 1274px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-142932" class="wp-caption-text">Source: CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, the Ethereum network has also become extremely prone to security exploits. Blockchain security firm Beosin <a href="https://medium.com/@Beosin_com/q3-2023-global-web3-security-report-aml-analysis-crypto-regulatory-landscape-9f4c646ca71" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> in its “Global Web3 Security Report &#8221; that crypto investors lost $282.96 million to rug pulls during quarter three of this year. The report further noted that phishing schemes generated $66.15 million during the same time period. According to findings from Beosin, the Ethereum blockchain underwent the most losses and incidents overall.</p>

<h2><b>Updated framework for reviewing smart contract code</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chaals Nevile, technical program director at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) — an organization that aims to drive the use of enterprise ethereum as an open standard — told Cryptonews that there are known problems within Ethereum that are impacting the ecosystem’s security. “The most obvious problem is that the Solidity compiler – which outputs byte code and other artifacts needed for deployment of smart contracts – has bugs. As the compiler evolves, old bugs are fixed, but new ones are also created,” said Nevile.</p>
<p>In order to address this and other challenges, the EEA established the “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-advances-with-standards-for-smart-contract-security-audits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EthTrust Security Levels Working Group in November 2020</a>.” In August 2022, the group released the publication of the “EthTrust Security Levels Specification v1.” This specification has since served as a framework for developers, organizations and customers leveraging and reviewing smart contract code written in Solidity, Ethereum’s main programming language.</p>
<p>Yet as the Ethereum network continues to advance, Nevile pointed out that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification required updates to reflect ongoing and new security developments. “For instance, the v1 specification covers bugs up to about the year 2022, yet new bugs were discovered after we released v1,” he said.</p>
<p>This in mind, Nevile shared that today the EEA announced the release of<a href="http://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Version 2.0 of its EthTrust Security Levels Specification</a>. Neville noted that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2 addresses issues such as newly discovered bugs in the <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solidity compiler</a>, treatment of rounding errors, more vigorous treatment of read-only reentrancy attacks and more.</p>
<p>Updates are critical, as the Ethereum ecosystem has fallen victim to security exploits in the past due to these specific issues. For instance, Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin – a security firm building an open-source framework to secure smart contracts – told Cryptonews that “<a href="https://neptunemutual.com/blog/the-story-behind-the-dao-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The DAO</a>” hack occurred due to reentrancy. “The DAO Hack was the original big hack on Ethereum that happened in 2016 and got everyone thinking more about security. This was a classic case of reentrancy,” Lewellen said. The DAO hack resulted in a loss of $3.64 million in ETH.</p>
<p>Nevile explained that <a href="https://medium.com/@zokyo.io/read-only-reentrancy-attacks-understanding-the-threat-to-your-smart-contracts-99444c0a7334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reentrancy</a> occurs when a developer starts a smart contract and then requests for the program to do something different while it is in the middle of running code. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Essentially this means that a program is halfway through running code, but then something else is asked of it. As a result, the two requests could get mixed up. A program hacker can then use this mix up as an opportunity to steal people&#8217;s money or change the prompt of things.”</p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Will an industry standard be widely adopted? </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Aware of the severity behind such incidents, Lewellen pointed out that OpenZeppelin leverages the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework to prevent such security vulnerabilities from occurring. “We use this framework as a pre-audit assessment for many of our clients. This allows clients to know that we are checking for certain instances during the audit process.”</p>
<p>This industry standard seems to be helpful, as an anonymous OpenZeppelin client revealed to Cryptonews that EthTrust is what the company had been lacking in the past. The source said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We failed our previous security audit because we didn&#8217;t have clear guidance on what security requirements we were missing. We feel much more confident going into our next audit after reviewing the EthTrust requirements and implementing them in our codebase.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet Nevile commented that while feedback for the EthTrust standard v1 has been positive, it remains challenging getting developers and organizations to know that such an open standard exists. He also noted that the framework is best suited for newer Ethereum projects. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Projects like Uniswap, Aave and others may look at these specifications and find them to be useful, but for the most part it&#8217;s common knowledge for them. Projects that are just now being developed and going to production on Ethereum will likely find these specifications to be valuable.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the question remains whether or not such an industry standard will help prevent security exploits on Ethereum moving forward. John Wingate, founder and chief executive officer of BankSocial – a financial services company that leverages blockchain technology – told Cryptonews that the changing nature of industry standards is problematic. “Standards are always changing; languages are always depreciating methods, variables, data types, and object types,” he said.</p>
<p>This concern in mind, Nevile shared that version 3 of the EthTrust specification is already in the works. “We are roughly 16 months between publications. I think that 12 to 18 months is a frequent enough revision to ensure that we don’t fall out of date.”</p>
<p>Although this may be, Wingate believes that repeatable, automated testing is the only way to make sure decentralized applications are adhering to best practices that may prevent security exploits. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This means being able to set your platform up to have regular, automated, code testing. When the source code, or compiler is known to have a bug, the automation tool can be updated and then everyone gets the benefit of scanning for the exploits.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple has decided to terminate its credit-card partnership with Goldman Sachs as the tech giant pushes deeper into consumer lending.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple recently submitted a proposal to Goldman Sachs, outlining its intention to exit the contract within the next 12 to 15 months, according to a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-pulls-plug-on-goldman-credit-card-partnership-ca1dfb45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report from The Wall Street Journal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The termination encompasses the entire consumer partnership, including the credit card launched in 2019 and the savings account introduced this year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The decision marks a rapid reversal for a program that, just over a year ago, was extended until 2029 and was expected to be a cornerstone of Goldman Sachs&#8217; foray into the mainstream consumer market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, things took a turn for the worse for Goldman Sachs towards the end of last year when it incurred significant losses in its attempts to establish a comprehensive consumer operation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By early this year, Goldman Sachs had informed Apple of its intention to offload the partnership. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Typically, the merchant, in this case, Apple, holds a controlling role in such collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goldman Sachs has engaged in discussions with American Express regarding the possibility of transferring the program to the renowned card giant. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, American Express has raised concerns about certain aspects of the program, including its loss rates, and it remains uncertain whether these discussions have progressed further. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Synchrony Financial Shows Interest in Apple&#8217;s Credit Card Program</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Synchrony Financial, the largest issuer of store credit cards in the U.S., has also shown interest in assuming control of the credit-card program. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Synchrony has long sought to position itself as an issuer with close ties to tech companies, boasting partnerships with industry giants such as Amazon and PayPal. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, Synchrony originally competed against Goldman Sachs for the Apple credit-card program.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For Apple, this development poses a setback for its services business, which has become increasingly crucial as iPhone sales plateau. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the Goldman partnership likely represents only a small portion of Apple&#8217;s revenue stream. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the September quarter, Apple reported a negligible annual decline in overall sales, while services revenue grew by approximately 16%.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For Goldman Sachs, the partnership&#8217;s demise represents a significant step back from its failed attempt to diversify beyond serving corporate clients and the ultra-rich. The bank is now refocusing on its core clientele.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple&#8217;s Relationship with Goldman Sachs Face Challenges From Beginning</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/apple-and-goldman-sachs-considered-stock-trading-feature-for-iphones-until-market-downturn-was-crypto-included.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">relationship between Goldman Sachs and Apple</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> faced challenges from the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple&#8217;s advertisements stating that the card was not from a bank reportedly irritated certain Goldman executives. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Moreover, Apple insisted on approving nearly all applicants, leading to increased loan losses for Goldman. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple&#8217;s requirement to send cardholders&#8217; bills at the beginning of the month also caused significant customer service challenges for Goldman, as most card programs stagger bill distribution to avoid overwhelming call volumes.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some Goldman executives privately attribute regulatory scrutiny faced by the bank to its association with Apple. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last year, Goldman disclosed that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was investigating its credit card account management practices, including billing error resolutions and cardholder refunds. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Federal Reserve has also been examining Goldman&#8217;s broader consumer-lending business.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> In response, Goldman has initiated Project Blue, an internal effort focused on addressing regulatory issues, and has been reassigning employees from consumer lending to support this endeavor.</span></p>

<p>Top management of artificial intelligence company, OpenAI, are scrambling to “reunify” the organization following the dramatic ousting of co-founder, Sam Altman.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/openai-in-intense-discussions-to-unify-company-memo-says">a report by Bloomberg News</a>, OpenAI&#8217;s Vice President for Global Affairs, Anna Makanju, assured employees that the company has “a plan we are working towards.”</p>
<h2>&#8220;Intense discussions&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the report, OpenAI executives are “continuing to go over mutually acceptable options” as they attempt to navigate more discussions today.</p>
<p>“These intense discussions can drag out, and I know it can feel impossible to be patient,” Makanju allegedly stated.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s board of directors announced Altman’s firing on Friday, claiming that he “was not consistently candid in his communications.”</p>
<p>“The board no longer has confidence in his ability to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-linked-anthropic-declines-openais-merger-and-leadership-offer.htm">continue leading OpenAI</a>,” read an announcement Friday from the company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OpenAI president and co-founder, Greg Brockman, quit following news of Brockman’s firing.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoins-wld-gains-6-as-sam-altman-joins-microsoft-to-lead-its-new-ai-research-team.htm">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced a partnership</a> with Altman and Brockman “to lead a new advanced AI research team.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success,” posted Nadella.</p>
<h2>Employees threaten to walk</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since Altman’s abrupt firing, over 700 OpenAI employees signed a letter to the company’s board of directors demanding they resign and reinstate Altman.</p>
<p>“Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI,” the letter to the board reads in part. “We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgment and care for our mission and employees.”</p>
<p>Alongside the letter, employees began posting the sentiment “OpenAI is nothing without its people” en masse on X.</p>
<p>Among those tweeting their support of the ousted duo was chief technology officer, Mira Murati, who was elected to take over as interim CEO following Altman’s exit. Murati ultimately resigned, with OpenAI giving former executive of livestreaming platform Twitch, Emmett Shear, the role.</p>
<h2>&#8220;I will do everything I can to reunite the company&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“I loved <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-altmans-departure-from-openai-triggers-a-sharp-decline-in-worldcoins-value-whats-going-on.htm">my time at OpenAI</a>,” <a href="https://twitter.com/sama">Altman posted following his departure</a>. “It was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. Most of all I loved working with such talented people.”</p>
<p>OpenAI’s chief scientist and the man widely reported to be a leading force behind Altman’s exit, Ilya Sutskever, tweeted remorse for their decision on Monday.</p>
<p>“I deeply regret my participation in the board&#8217;s actions,”<a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028"> said the company’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever</a>. “I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we&#8217;ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.”</p>

<p>505 OpenAI employees have signed a letter demanding the board of directors at the artificial intelligence company step down following the sudden ousting of co-founder, Sam Altman, on Friday.</p>
<h2>Over 500 OpenAI employees threaten to walk</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Kara Swisher, a podcaster for New York Magazine, <a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1726599700961521762%7Ctwgr%5E344ad80d8216d3b38dc0c3ac4f945d0b93fbd4f9%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fopenai-staff-board-resign-after-sam-altman-ousting-report">tweeted the signed employee declaration</a> on Monday morning. In it, hundreds of staff threaten to leave their positions for a new Microsoft AI subsidiary spearheaded by Altman and Greg Brockman, another co-founder of OpenAI.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-titans-are-stacking-this-dark-horse-ai-token-as-sam-altman-joins-microsoft-whats-going-on.htm">CEO of Microsoft</a>, Satya Nadella, <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122">tweeted out that his organization hired Altman and Brockman</a> “to lead a new advanced AI research team.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources they need for their success,” wrote Nadella. </p>
<p>“Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAl,” the letter reads in part. “We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgment and care for our mission and employees.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the employees state that they “will take this step imminently, unless all current board members resign” and it “reinstates Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.”</p>
<h2>A turbulent few days</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Altman <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoins-wld-gains-6-as-sam-altman-joins-microsoft-to-lead-its-new-ai-research-team.htm">was fired from the company he helped develop Friday</a>, with the board of directors alleging he “was not consistently candid in his communications.”</p>
<p>“The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,” read an announcement Friday from the company. </p>
<p>Brockman, who was serving as president of OpenAI, quit on Friday following the news.</p>
<p>“I continue to believe in the mission of creating safe AGI that benefits all of humanity,” Brockman wrote in a message to the company.</p>
<p>“I loved <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-altmans-departure-from-openai-triggers-a-sharp-decline-in-worldcoins-value-whats-going-on.htm">my time at OpenAI</a>,” tweeted Altman. “It was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. Most of all I loved working with such talented people.”</p>
<h2>What comes next for the troubled company</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Emmett Shear, co-founder of live streaming service, Twitch, will take over as interim CEO. </p>
<p>Previously, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, Mira Murati was elected to the position before she signed her name alongside other members of staff threatening to walk unless Brockman and Altman were reinstated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nadella stated that Microsoft would continue its collaboration with OpenAI while simultaneously collaborating with Altman and Brockman.</p>
<p>“We look forward to getting to know Emmett Shear and OAI&#8217;s new leadership team and working with them,” Nadella wrote. </p>
<p>On Monday morning, OpenAI board member, Ilya Sutskever, <a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028">tweeted his remorse over their decision</a>.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3710368/apple-gets-ready-for-app-sideloading-in-europe.html">recent report by Computer World</a>, Apple is planning to allow iPhone users in the EU to install apps from outside the official App Store to comply with the region&#8217;s new Digital Markets Act. This potential change has raised concerns among cybersecurity experts about an increase in phishing attacks targeting crypto users.</p>
<h2>Security Firms Sound Alarm on Phishing Attack Risks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Apple has not officially confirmed the policy change, <a href="https://decrypt.co/117172/apple-external-ios-apps-crypto-nfts">multiple reports have indicated</a> since 2022 that the company is preparing for it. Cybersecurity firms warn this could expose iPhone users to greater risks, however.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple will allow iPhone users in the EU to sideload apps starting in the first half of 2024 to comply with new regulations!</p>
<p>Sideloading will allow users to downloads apps from the internet and third-party app stores</p>
<p>Should Apple allow users to sideload apps outside of the EU?… <a href="https://t.co/A2et1ppmjK">pic.twitter.com/A2et1ppmjK</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Apple Hub (@theapplehub) <a href="https://twitter.com/theapplehub/status/1724024583823802774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In a recent report, <a href="https://slowmist.medium.com/fake-skype-app-phishing-analysis-35c1dc8bc515">blockchain security firm SlowMist explained</a> that Android users in China have already suffered major financial losses from phishing attacks linked to fake apps installed outside the Google Play Store. They caution that iPhone sideloading could lead to similar &#8220;phishing attacks, asset theft, account password theft, and other risks&#8221; targeting crypto investors.</p>
<h2>Experts Advise Caution With Sideloaded Apps</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
David Schwed, COO of blockchain security company Halborn, said in an interview that <a href="https://decrypt.co/206156/apple-iphone-app-sideloading-could-increase-risk-phishing-attacks">sideloaded apps may contain malicious code</a> disguised as legitimate software. He explained that the iOS protections like sandboxing &#8220;might not fully mitigate the risks posed by skillfully crafted, deceptive applications designed to exploit user trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an October 2021 whitepaper, even Apple acknowledged that sideloaded apps <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps_A_Threat_Analysis_of_Sideloading.pdf">make it easier for cybercriminals to distribute malware</a> more widely. The company argued that attackers could trick users into sideloading by making apps appear to come from the App Store.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Clicked A Phishing Link? Here’s What Happens And What To Do Now" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-NfumQCiVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>To protect themselves from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-projects-lose-51-million-in-attacks-in-october.htm">phishing attempts</a>, experts advise crypto users to avoid unknown links, watch for phishing URLs, and double-check before entering passwords or authorizing transactions. Opting for apps from official sources like Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play Store reduces the chance of downloading harmful software.</p>
<p>While iPhone sideloading may become mandatory in the EU, whether Apple will expand the policy globally is unclear. For now, crypto investors would be wise to exercise caution if given the option to install apps outside the App Store. The convenience may come with increased phishing risks.</p>

<p><strong>Ritual</strong>, a startup building a decentralized platform for artificial intelligence, has raised <strong>$25 million</strong> in a seed funding round. The funding was led by venture capital firm <strong>Archetype</strong>, with participation from <strong>Robot Ventures</strong> and <strong>Canonical</strong>.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup seeks to provide <a href="https://mgiep.unesco.org/article/can-artificial-intelligence-help-us-achieve-universal-quality-education">universal access to AI</a> technology. Currently, innovation and access to high-quality AI like large language models is <strong>concentrated at big tech companies</strong> like Google, Microsoft, and Meta. Ritual wants to change that by building an open, <strong>decentralized network</strong> for hosting, training, and running AI models.</p>
<p>&#8220;The consolidation of AI among a small group of powerful companies poses a significant threat to the future of technology,&#8221; said Niraj Pant, co-founder of Ritual <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/11/08/two-former-polychain-partners-fundraise-25-million-ritual-decentralize-ai/">in a press release</a>. &#8220;We founded Ritual to end the ecosystem&#8217;s reliance on the few, to open access to this critical infrastructure, and ensure a future of building better AI.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Democratizing Access to Cutting-Edge AI</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

AI instances can spend several days befriending someone, usually an elderly or vulnerable person, only to end up scamming them.&nbsp;</p>

Specifically, the tech giant has shown great interest in the metaverse.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Microsoft has recently&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microsoft-pulls-plug-industrial-metaverse-team-heres-what-happened.htm">discontinued</a>&nbsp;its Industrial Metaverse Core team, a four-month-old project aimed to encourage the use of the metaverse in industrial environments. The company also laid off employees working on the project, which amounts to about 100 people.</p><h2>More Browsers Offer Crypto Wallets as Adoption Grows</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Microsoft Edge is not the first web browser to include a crypto wallet. A number of other major web browsers have recently added support for built-in crypto wallets as adoption grows.&nbsp;</p><p>Opera has been supporting cryptocurrency since 2018, initially adding the feature on mobile before extending it to the desktop in 2019. More recently, the browser&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-opera-challenges-brave-browser-with-push-further-into-crypto-how-do-they-compare.htm">strengthened</a>&nbsp;its push into crypto by adding browser wallet support for multiple new blockchain networks, including Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Ronin (RON).</p><p>Similarly, Brave has had its own crypto wallet known as the Brave Wallet built into it since November 2021. The wallet supports all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains and Ethereum Layer 2 chains with both standard ERC-20 tokens and NFTs on the ERC-721 standard.</p><p>In January last year, the browser said it had&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/privacy-focused-browser-brave-hits-50m-monthly-active-users.htm">passed 50 million</a>&nbsp;monthly active users, with more than 8 million users actively earning rewards in the form of BAT tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>This puts Brave well behind Opera in terms of overall popularity, but given that the browser only launched in 2017, user growth has undeniably been strong in recent years.</p><p>Meanwhile, users of other browsers like Mozilla, Firefox, and Google Chrome can install third-party cryptocurrency wallets such as Metamask to be able to use Web3 applications.&nbsp;</p>

Oncyber supports accessing NFTs from different wallets and different chains such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and more.</p><p>A teaser video shows that with a line of text dropped into the Magic Composer, Oncyber can automatically change the look and color of the sky, drop in an artist&rsquo;s NFT works from your connected crypto wallet, customize the look and size of picture frames in the world, and more.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing a GPT-powered AI tool for text to world building <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br><br>here’s a sneak peek, where your creativity can flow from your brain to web3D. <br><br>stay tuned for public access — notifs on <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1fae1.png" alt="🫡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, <br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f53d.png" alt="🔽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for early access <a href="https://t.co/0GzkpYoMBC">pic.twitter.com/0GzkpYoMBC</a></p>&mdash; ᴏɴᴄʏʙᴇʀ (@oncyber) <a href="https://twitter.com/oncyber/status/1636149910629421056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>In a recent interview, Oncyber founder and CEO Rayan Boutaleb&nbsp;<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/openai-gpt-helping-turn-text-215959415.html">said</a>&nbsp;that this is merely the first version of the tool. Boutaleb claimed that the next iterations of the tool would give artists additional power to turn their dreams into a 3D canvas. He said:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the next iteration, what we want is for people to port any hallucination or dream they have into a 3D canvas, and just directly see the result of what they might imagine and change things up. It&rsquo;s a first step towards a very big end result, which we are not that far off from.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Boutaleb claimed that they adopted AI technologies to find another way to help users unlock their creativity on the platform. There&rsquo;s a disconnect between the power of Oncyber&rsquo;s game-like engine and the visual user interface, he added.&nbsp;</p><p>More robust AI functionality is on the horizon, too. Boutaleb said that in time, he hopes to add more complex generative features, such as the ability to generate bespoke or modified 3D architecture simply by typing out a request. Over time, Oncyber&rsquo;s goal is to have &ldquo;less and less boundaries/limits&rdquo; for users, he added.</p><p>In a recent tweet, Oncyber asked interested users to join the waitlist for a beta experience and start testing the product as soon as Monday, March 20. However, Boutaleb said it won&rsquo;t be long before Magic Composer reaches public users.</p><h2>Crypto Projects Integrate AI to Enhance User Experience</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Aside from Oncyber, a number of other crypto and Web3 projects have integrated AI technologies into their services and products in a bid to enhance user experience.</p><p>As reported,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-ai-projects-are-rise-but-how-long-can-they-last-learn-why-metropoly-better-investment.htm">AI-powered</a>&nbsp;Web3-focused search engine Kaito&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chatgpt-is-helping-this-new-project-take-crypto-search-to-the-next-level-a-game-changer-for-the-industry.htm">raised $5.3 million</a>&nbsp;in a seed fundraising round earlier this year in a bid to increase the size of the team and speed up product development.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, US exchange PayBito has announced its intentions to integrate ChatGPT to improve its market analysis, fully identify its future trends, and open up even more to new trading opportunities.</p><p>&ldquo;The integration of ChatGPT will add value and improve the user experience. The artificial intelligence-based tool will enable traders to make informed decisions with accurate information,&#8221; Raj Chowdhury, CEO of PayBito, said at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Together, they&rsquo;ll be able to collaborate on new projects and make money in ways not previously possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>He specifically mentioned that creators can use NFT to give a verifiable way for fans to own unique videos, photos, art, and even experiences. However, Mohan insisted that they need to approach these new technologies &#8220;responsibly.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;And across all these formats, you&rsquo;ll see even more ways to help creators make money and build a business,&#8221; he added, noting that new technologies like NFTs could open up new streams of revenue not only for creators but also for fans and viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>Mohan also touched on the subject of the metaverse, claiming that they are &#8220;thinking big&#8221; about how to make viewing more immersive. He noted that this will likely first impact gaming, where they would try to bring more interactions to games and make them feel more alive.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, Wojcicki stepped down from YouTube after nine years at the helm, outlining plans to start a &ldquo;new chapter&rdquo; focused on family, health, and personal projects. During her tenure, she oversaw the pivotal introduction of the revenue-sharing model, among other things.</p><p>A Stanford graduate, Mohan joined Google in 2008 as its chief product officer at YouTube. He was involved with some of the biggest developments and changes in the platform, including YouTube Shorts and Music.</p><p>YouTube&#8217;s sister company Google has also made a foray into the world of cryptocurrencies and Web3. Last year, the company&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/google-cloud-enter-blockchain-node-world-with-new-service.htm">announced</a>&nbsp;the launch of a cloud-based service for Ethereum projects and developers called the Blockchain Node Engine.&nbsp;</p><p>While Ethereum became the first blockchain to be supported by Blockchain Node Engine, the tech giant revealed the following month that it would expand its Blockchain Node Engine to the Solana Blockchain as well, a feature set to launch in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>Furthermore, Google&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-news-summary-coinbase-partners-with-google-cloud-for-crypto-payments-cnn-kills-vault.htm">partnered</a>&nbsp;with Coinbase to allow users to pay for cloud services using crypto. A select number of customers would be able to pay for its Cloud services using cryptoassets such as Bitcoin starting this year.&nbsp;</p>

The malware also inflates the victim&#8217;s device and executes the payload, which is either the GO variant of Laplas Clipper malware or MortalKombat ransomware.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;The loader script will run the dropped payload as a process in the victim&rsquo;s machine, then delete the downloaded and dropped malicious files to clean up the infection markers,&#8221; the report detailed.&nbsp;</p><p>Talos noted that a usual vector of attack for the criminals has been a phishing email in which they impersonate CoinPayments, a legitimate global cryptocurrency payment gateway.&nbsp;</p><p>To make the emails look even more legitimate, they have a spoofed sender, &ldquo;noreply[at]CoinPayments[.]net&rdquo;, and the email subject &ldquo;[CoinPayments[.]net] Payment Timed Out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>On this specific occasion, a malicious ZIP file is attached with a filename resembling a transaction ID mentioned in the email body, which allures the victim to unzip the malicious attachment in order to view the contents, which is a malicious BAT loader.</p><h2>Ransomware Threats Rise while Revenue Declines</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Ransomware and cybersecurity attacks continue to increase. However, victims have been increasingly unwilling to pay attackers their demands, according to a recent report by Chainalysis, which revealed that ransomware revenues for attackers plummeted 40% last year.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that North Korean hacking groups account for a huge portion of illicit cyber activities. Just recently, South Korean and United States intelligence agencies&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-north-korean-ransomware-threat-major-institutions-detected-say-south-korea-us.htm">warned</a>&nbsp;that Pyongyang-based hackers are trying to hit &ldquo;major international institutions&rdquo; with ransomware attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>In December 2022, Kaspersky also&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kaspersky-report-north-korean-hackers-impersonating-crypto-vcs-new-phishing-scam.htm">revealed</a>&nbsp;that BlueNoroff, a subgroup of the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus, is impersonating venture capitalists looking to invest in crypto startups in a new phishing method.&nbsp;</p>

The company wants to prioritize shorter-term projects over those needing longer to generate meaningful revenue, the report said, citing a person familiar with the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>The Industrial Metaverse team, internally referred to as &#8220;Project Bonsai,&#8221; focused on how to use artificial intelligence and digital technologies to enable people to interact with and optimize physical goods, assets, places, processes, and equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>Launched in October, the team worked with clients in health care, retail financial services, and energy, among other industries, in building the components that industrial customers can use.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that Microsoft already had some major customers in the Industrial Metaverse space, including Mercedes Benz and Coca-Cola. A spokesperson for the company has reportedly said:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Microsoft remains committed to the industrial metaverse. We are applying our focus to the areas of the industrial metaverse that matter most to our customers and they will see no change in how they are supported. We look forward to sharing additional information in the future.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The layoffs are part&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685420/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-confirms-plan-to-lay-off-10000-workers.html">of a plan to cut off 10,00 workers announced by CEO Satya Nadella</a>&nbsp;earlier this month. The move comes as Microsoft faces macroeconomic uncertainty and slowing growth amid a global stock market rout and heightened fears over a hard economic landing.&nbsp;</p><p>The metaverse is a shared, immersive, online 3D space where users can interact with each other and with computer-generated objects and avatars. Major tech companies such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms (META) have already shown interest in developing the metaverse.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, Robin Seiler, who oversees Microsoft&#8217;s mixed-reality operations,&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/mixed-reality-blog/microsoft-committed-to-hololens-2-and-mixed-reality/ba-p/3732405">gave assurances</a>&nbsp;that it was committed to continuing some of its mixed-reality products, including Microsoft Mesh and the HoloLens 2 headset.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the assurances came shortly after Microsoft had ended its AltspaceVR meeting solution for avatars, along with eliminating its entire team that was building its Mixed Reality Toolkit, which is now a separate open source project.</p><p>While it is still early for the metaverse to become a reality, the concept has already found a great amount of traction across some jurisdictions. According to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://coinkickoff.com/meta-verdict/">survey</a>, Florida residents show the highest interest in exploring the metaverse, with 670 searches per 1,000 people.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Orlando and Miami have used 3D and virtual reality (VR) technologies to recreate their cities in the metaverse.</p>
