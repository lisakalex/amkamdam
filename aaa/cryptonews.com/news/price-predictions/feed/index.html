<p>With its price at $96.50, despite a 2.50% dip over the past day, Solana&#8217;s substantial $1.3 billion trading volume underscores its growing prominence.</p>
<p>Holding a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">commanding market capitalization</a> of $42.07 billion and a circulating supply of 436 million SOL coins, the digital asset showcases significant momentum.</p>
<p>This surge in activity and investor interest places Solana in a pivotal position for future market dynamics, prompting speculations about its trajectory and comparisons with leading cryptocurrencies.</p>

Analyzing the 4-hour chart, the pivot point is identified at $97.69, suggesting a nuanced balance point for future price directions.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance levels are positioned at $100.03, $102.56, and $105.47, indicating potential ceilings for upward price movements.</p>

<p>Conversely, support levels are found at $94.91, $92.96, and $90.66, marking thresholds for possible pullbacks.</p>
<p>The technical indicators present a mixed sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42 hints at a slight bearish momentum, suggesting a lack of strong buying pressure at the moment.</p>

<p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) standing at $98.40 further underscores the current bearish trend, as the price resides below this average.</p>
<p>Chart patterns reveal a symmetrical triangle breakout below the $97.69 level, indicating a potential continuation of the selling trend.</p>
<p>This is further confirmed by the presence of a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern below the pivot, reinforcing the bearish outlook for Solana.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Solana exhibits bearish tendencies below the $97.69 threshold.</p>

<h2>DogWifHat Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a 4-hour chart analysis, DogWifHat&#8217;s pivot point aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.26296, signifying a potential turning point for its price actions.</p>
<p>If momentum continues, immediate resistance levels at $0.28172 and $0.29998 await, with a more distant target at $0.31969.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Should the trend reverse, DogWifHat may find support at $0.24037, with further potential fallbacks at $0.20340 and $0.18421.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a moderate 55, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressures.</p>
<p>However, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.29419 indicates a bearish divergence, as the EMA stands above the current price point.</p>

<p>DogWifHat has completed a critical 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, coinciding with a downward trendline that could resist upward movements.</p>
<p>Additionally, the appearance of a Doji candle followed by a bearish engulfing pattern signals a potential reversal of the recent uptrend.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the current trend for DogWifHat is subject to change, the asset exhibits bearish tendencies as long as it remains below the $0.26296 threshold.</p>

<p>Solana (SOL) price predictions are turning increasingly bullish, with the cryptocurrency still substantially below its December peaks, but with chart analysis hinting at upside price risks and widely followed crypto personality Arthur Hayes commenting that it may be time to “get back on the Solana train”.</p>
<p>Hayes made the post earlier this week when Solana was trading in the $94s.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think it might be time to get back on the train fam. Maybe after a few US banks bite the dust this weekend. <a href="https://t.co/SxCwK3BVYB">pic.twitter.com/SxCwK3BVYB</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1752972890843283660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Solana price has since risen to end Friday around $100.</p>
<p>Hayes caveated his comment by saying “maybe after a few US banks bite the dust this weekend”.</p>
<p>He was likely referring to a recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-regional-bank-stocks-brace-final-trading-session-painful-week-2024-02-02/">resurgence of concerns about regional banks in the US</a>.</p>
<p>NYBC’s share price plummeted this week after an ugly earnings release, weighing on the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.KRX'">KRW Regional Banking Index</a>.</p>
<p>The index started the week above 109 but closed the week under 100, its lowest since mid-December.</p>
<p>Troubles in the US banking sector prompted a huge rally in crypto markets in March 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and cryptocurrencies more broadly were viewed as a safe-haven alternative to the fractional reserve banking-based traditional financial system.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin would probably lead if the bank crisis returns, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> is also a strong candidate to perform well.</p>
<h2><strong>Solana Price Predictions – Where Next for SOL?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bank troubles could become an increasingly important theme in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In early March, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-allow-emergency-bank-lending-program-expire-march-11-2024-01-25/">the Fed is axing a liquidity support program</a> it first launched in March 2023 to help troubled regional lenders.</p>
<p>The end of the so-called Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) could beset new issues for the sector.</p>
<p>And that could drive cryptocurrencies like Solana’s price higher.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Solana price is likely to benefit from positive technicals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/missed-solana-sol-this-new-cryptocurrency-is-about-to-skyrocket.htm">Solana</a> price recently broke above a key short-term downtrend.</p>
<p>It also recently saw a strong bounce from its 21 and 50DMAs.</p>
<p>This bounce comes after it also bounced from key long-term support in the $77-80 area earlier this month.</p>
<p>Technical analysis suggests a strong likelihood of a near-term rally towards December highs around $125.</p>

<p><a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardano (ADA)</a> has recently demonstrated remarkable resilience, overturning its previous downtrend to secure a 16% increase, settling at $0.52 after a brief descent to $0.43 on January 23.</p>
<p>This fluctuation was primarily attributed to the broader market&#8217;s reactions to the BTC ETF approval, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>Yet, Cardano&#8217;s robust recovery to $0.50 by January 27, fueled by optimistic market sentiment and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s steady interest rates, hints at a potential surge towards the $0.60 mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>U.S. Economic Strength Boosts Dollar, Weighs on Cardano</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The recent U.S. economic data indicating strong employment growth and rising consumer sentiment has bolstered the dollar, creating a challenging environment for cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA).</p>
<p>The increase in average hourly earnings to 0.6% and a robust <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/nonfarm-payrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-farm employment change of 353K signal</a> a potentially tighter monetary policy to curb inflation, strengthening the dollar.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A stronger dollar typically exerts downward pressure on cryptocurrencies, as it enhances the appeal of holding fiat currency over digital assets.</p>
<p>Consequently, despite the optimistic economic indicators, Cardano may face headwinds as the strengthened dollar could deter investment in ADA, potentially impacting its price trajectory negatively.</p>
<h2>Cardano Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-prediction-as-ada-dumps-7-5-can-ada-hit-1-in-2024.htm">Cardano (ADA</a> has experienced a nearly 4% increase in the last 24 hours, reaching $0.508, with a trading volume of approximately $422.6 million.</p>
<p>Ranked #8 by market capitalization, Cardano boasts a valuation of about $18.01 billion, emphasizing its prominence in the crypto market with a circulating supply of 35.43 billion ADA, out of a total 45 billion.</p>
<p>In the 4-hour chart analysis, the pivot point is marked at $0.514, indicating a potential shift in momentum. Resistance levels are identified incrementally at $0.524, $0.535, and $0.548, suggesting upward barriers.</p>
<p>Support, conversely, is found at $0.504, with further levels at $0.495 and $0.484, marking zones of buyer interest.</p>

<p>Technical indicators reinforce the bullish sentiment, with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.509 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 65, both signaling a robust buying trend.</p>
<p>Cardano&#8217;s current trajectory is bullish, particularly above the $0.509 mark, underscoring a positive outlook for ADA as it navigates through key technical levels.</p>

<p>Jupiter (JUP) price predictions remain optimistic one day after the tokens initial airdrop, despite the price having dropped substantially from its recent high.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/jupiter">CoinGecko</a>, the JUP price is 70% down from its high of $2.00 at current levels near $0.59.</p>
<p>Jupiter is a decentralized exchange (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex.htm">DEX</a>) aggregation service on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> and is one of the blockchain’s leading protocols.</p>
<p>It has recently been challenging <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">leading multi-chain DEX Uniswap</a> for the top spot in terms of DEX trading volumes.</p>
<p>The first stage of its highly anticipated token airdrop went live on Wednesday, with the protocol releasing a first tranche of 13.5% of the token supply.</p>
<p>Nearly 1 million Solana wallets were eligible to receive tokens, making it one of the largest airdrops in history.</p>
<p>The airdrop also went ahead without any major hiccups on either Jupiter’s website or the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>JUP’s market cap was last around $800 billion, with a fully diluted market cap of close to $6 billion.</p>
<p>That’s roughly the same as Uniswap’s fully diluted market cap, which was last just over $6 billion, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>That makes Jupiter the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jupiter-price-prediction-as-solana-airdrop-creates-a-new-crypto-unicorn-how-to-check-jup-eligibility.htm">latest crypto unicorn</a>, defined as protocols worth over $1 billion.</p>
<h2><strong>Jupiter Price Prediction – Are 5x Gains Possible?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Jupiter price remains vulnerable to a further pullback.</p>
<p>That’s because optimism in the market often becomes excessive following the launch of a new asset.</p>
<p>That’s been seen time and time again throughout the history of stock IPOs, as well as crypto token launches.</p>
<p>Traders who FOMO’d in at an unreasonably high price may see their losses rises and throw in the towel.</p>
<p>But once weak hands and short-term speculators are washed out, the Jupiter price has a strong chance of rebounding.</p>
<p>The Solana blockchain has been experiencing spectacular growth in recent months.</p>
<p>Traders have been flocking to the blockchain for benefit from airdrop hunting and meme coin opportunities.</p>
<p>But they appear to be sticking around thanks to the blockchain’s ultra-low fees, fast transaction finality times and diverse and well-developed suite of web3 applications.</p>
<p>As a leading protocol on Solana, Jupiter is set to benefit as Solana adoption rises.</p>
<p>Indeed, Jupiter is likely to once again secure a multi-billion-dollar market cap this bull market.</p>
<p>5x gains for the Jupiter price and a fully diluted market cap of tens of billions shouldn’t be discounted in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Investors who believe in Solana and Jupiters long-term future should consider dollar-cost averaging (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/dca-crypto-bots/">DCAing</a>) into the latest price dip.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While things are looking great for Jupiter, investors should consider alternative investments to diversify.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains ought to consider an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy – <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Solana (SOL) price is holding firmly above key short-term support levels and eyeing a retest of $100 amid optimism about a recent strengthening of network activity, as indicated by total SOL transfer volumes on the network nearly reaching a stunning $1 trillion in January.</p>
<p>Last around $98, the Solana price is up 6% from earlier session lows in the $92.50 region.</p>
<p>Crypto prices were pressured during late Wednesday and early Thursday trade by this week’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-faith-immaculate-disinflation-narrative-put-test-2024-01-31/">hawkish Fed policy announcement</a>.</p>
<p>But optimism about strong network fundamentals and positive recent technical developments have seen the Solana price rebound strongly.</p>
<p>As per data presented by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/solana">TheBlock</a>, the number of active addresses on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> has bene shooting up in recent days.</p>
<p>The 7DMA was last at 842,000, while the 7DMA of daily new addresses was last around 520,000.</p>
<p>That’s a new record high.</p>
<p>The 7DMA of daily value moved on-chain has also shot up to $44 billion, its highest since late 2022.</p>
<p>The explosion in on-chain activity comes amid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jupiter-price-prediction-as-solana-airdrop-creates-a-new-crypto-unicorn-how-to-check-jup-eligibility.htm">Jupiter’s successful JUP token airdrop</a> on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Jupiter is a Solana-based decentralized exchange liquidity aggregator and one of the blockchain’s most popular decentralized finance applications.</p>
<p>The airdrop event released 13.5% of the token’s total 10 billion supply and immediately created a new crypto unicorn.</p>
<p>JUP has a fully diluted market cap of nearly $6 billion.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Solana network held up perfectly under the strain of airdrop-related activity.</p>
<p>The recent surge in interest for the blockchain is a sign of its growing adoption.</p>
<p>That, combined with recent bullish technical developments, means <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-approaches-100-can-sol-beat-its-all-time-high.htm#:~:text=We%20expect%20Solana%20to%20test,closely%20for%20any%20reversal%20signals.">Solana price predictions</a> are likely to remain optimistic.</p>
<h2><strong>Solana Price Prediction – Where Next for Solana (SOL)?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chart analysis suggests that the Solana price’s next stop is a retest of last year’s highs in the $126 area.</p>
<p>That’s because SOL recently broke a downtrend and bounced a retest of its 21 and 50DMAs in the $93-95 area.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160377" style="width: 1778px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160377" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706825648-sol-1.png" alt="Solana (SOL) Price Chart / Source: TradingView" width="1778" height="712" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706825648-sol-1.png 1778w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706825648-sol-1-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706825648-sol-1-1024x410.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706825648-sol-1-768x308.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706825648-sol-1-1536x615.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706825648-sol-1-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1778px) 100vw, 1778px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160377" class="wp-caption-text">Solana (SOL) Price Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>That could mean fast and easy gains in the region of 30% for Solana from here.</p>
<p>But that could be just the beginning for the Solana price.</p>
<p>Indeed, SOL remains over 60% lower versus its 2021 record highs in the $260s.</p>
<p>But with adoption clearly fast on the rise and a broader crypto bull market in full swing, the Solana price could be on course to blast past its prior record levels.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be out of the question for Solana to reach a market cap of $200 billion this bull market cycle.</p>
<p>That could mean 5x gains for the Solana price.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While things are looking great for Solana, investors should consider alternative investments to diversify.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains ought to consider an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy – <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BONKUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bonk price</a>, a cryptocurrency that has been making headlines in the digital asset market, is currently facing a challenging period. Despite the broader bearish market sentiment, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bonk-price-prediction-as-volume-outperforms-shib-can-bonk-overtake-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bonk</a> has witnessed an 8% decline in its price over the last 24 hours, now trading at $0.00001097.</p>
<p>This downturn is accompanied by a decreased trading volume of $80.78 million.  However, interestingly, technical indicators are hinting at a potential bullish reversal. Market analysts speculate that BONK might be in a consolidation phase, poised for an upward trajectory.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The current bearish trend in Bonk&#8217;s price is largely attributed to the intensified selling pressure that is prevalent across the cryptocurrency market, impacting various altcoins.</p>
<p>As of today, Bonk&#8217;s price stands at $0.000011 with a 24-hour trading volume of $83,247,675, marking a 3.70% decrease. Its current position in the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bonk1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> rankings is #91, with a live market cap of $665,389,628.</p>
<h2>Impact of Bearish Crypto Market on Bonk Coin Price</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The current bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market has notably influenced the price of Bonk Coin. This downturn is reflected in the global crypto market cap, which experienced a significant 24-hour decline of nearly 8.50%, falling to $1.51 trillion.</p>
<p>A key event contributing to this trend was Bitcoin&#8217;s drop below $43,000, prompted by the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to maintain interest rates amid speculation of a possible rate cut in March. This caused Bitcoin to lose momentum after a brief surge in its value.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a5.png" alt="💥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />BREAKING: The FED leaves the intrest rates unchanged!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs by major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity has shown promise in alleviating some of the market&#8217;s selling pressures.</p>
<p>These developments, coupled with the high demand for new offerings in the crypto space, suggest a potential shift in market dynamics.</p>
<p>Additionally, the anticipation of Bitcoin&#8217;s halving in April and the potential support from U.S. political and fiscal policies contribute to a more optimistic outlook for the leading cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Despite these potentially positive influences, the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market continues to weigh heavily on the price of Bonk Coin.</p>
<h2>Bonk Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bonk-price-prediction-following-meme-coin-sectors-recovery-can-bonk-reach-1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BONK&#8217;s current price</a> stands at $0.00001044, marking a decrease of 1.88% in the last 24 hours. In terms of market positioning, BONK&#8217;s ranking and market capitalization are noteworthy, with the latter expressed in billions. The 4-hour chart offers a comprehensive view of the asset&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>Key price levels to monitor include a pivot point at $0.0000110, serving as a potential reversal zone. Immediate resistance is found at $0.0000118, with subsequent levels at $0.0000126 and $0.0000135.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support lies at $0.0000097, followed by $0.0000089 and $0.0000080.</p>

<p>Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI stands at 33, suggesting a bearish momentum under the typical threshold of 50. The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $0.00001140, hovering around the current price level.</p>
<p>Chart analysis reveals a downward trendline, extending resistance near $0.00001102. This pattern suggests a bearish sentiment, especially if the price remains below this critical level.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall trend for BONK appears bearish as long as the price stays below the $0.00001102 mark. A break above this level could alter the market outlook.</p>

<p>Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator Jupiter just launched a massive airdrop of its native Jupiter (JUP) token, with the Jupiter price subsequently storming higher to turn the protocol into crypto’s latest unicorn.</p>
<p>A crypto unicorn is defined as a project/token with a market cap of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/AUgbdzNob9S8MiVHm4Qruqz3VsZGoqtMZnSzv45juDbL">DEXTools’</a>, the Jupiter price was last around $0.65, giving it a market cap of just under $1 billion.</p>
<p>But given just 1.35 billion tokens are currently circulating out of a total of 10 billion, the protocol’s fully diluted market cap was last around $7.18 billion.</p>
<p>The Jupiter airdrop went live at 1000 am EST.</p>
<p>On decentralized exchanges, the Jupiter price quickly pumped around 70% from around $0.41.</p>
<p>As per a <a href="https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/marqu/%F0%9F%90%88-jupiter-jup-airdrop-mock-jup-mock-usdc-wen-solana-network-performance-jupiter-jup-airdrop-mockjup-mockusdc-wen-solana-network-performance-F3eGb_">Flipside dashboard</a>, 47.3% of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-based-jupiter-to-distribute-1-billion-jup-tokens-in-upcoming-airdrop.htm">1 billion airdropped JUP tokens</a> have been claimed by eligible wallets.</p>
<p>As per Airdrop Official, 955,000 wallets were eligible to receive JUP tokens.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><strong>How to Check JUP Eligibility?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Solana network users can check their availability to receive free JUP tokens via <a href="https://solana-airdrop-checker.solworks.dev/">Solana Airdrop Checker. </a></p>
<p>All they need to do is post their Solana wallet address into the space and hit enter.</p>
<p>The website will then tell them what, if any, Solana airdrops they are eligible for.</p>
<p>If eligible, Solana users can head over to <a href="https://lfg.jup.ag/">Jupiter’s LFG Launchpad</a>, connect their wallet and claim their tokens.</p>
<h2><strong>Jupiter Price Prediciton – Where Next for JUP?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Given the JUP token is only on its first day of trade, chart analysis is very unhelpful for trying to predict the future Jupiter price.</p>
<p>Looking at the protocol’s tokenomics and fundamentals is a better starting point.</p>
<p>On the day of its token launch, <a href="https://station.jup.ag/stats/day">Jupiter’s DEX volume surpassed $1 billion</a> for the first time this month.</p>
<p>Weekly trading volumes could this week recover back to the highs seen in December around $4-5 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-jupiter-dex-surpasses-uniswap-a-new-high-for-sol-incoming.htm">Those are big trading volumes</a>, worthy of a DEX with a market cap in the multiples of billions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the future path of Jupiter’s trading volumes will likely have the greatest impact on the Jupiter price’s long-term outlook.</p>
<p>But potential investors should remember the ever-present risk that airdrop hype has resulted in an over-inflation of the JUP price.</p>
<p>That could leave JUP ripe to a short-term pullback.</p>
<p>If the Jupiter price falls back towards $0.40, this could be a nice dip for the longer-term bulls to buy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ripple (XRP) price has rebounded back above $0.51 following downside earlier in the day on concerning reports that a key Ripple Labs executive had been hacked for XRP tokens worth over $100 million.</p>
<p>Concerns about the security of XRP creator <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-labs-initiates-plan-to-repurchase-285-million-stake-from-early-investors.htm">Ripple Labs</a> XRP holdings, combined with concerns that hackers could dump their ill-gotten token on the market pressured the XRP price to as low as the $0.4850s, down nearly 5% on the day at the time.</p>
<p>But at current levels, the XRP price is back to trading flat on the day as more details emerge.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The news was first reported by crypto analyst @ZachXBT.</p>
<p>He noted via a tweet on X that 213 million <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> tokens had been sent to various exchanges.</p>
<p>Ripple’s co-founder and executive Chris Larsen responded to the tweet by confirming that his personal accounts had been compromised.</p>
<p>However, he noted that exchanges had already been notified to freeze affected addresses and law enforcement are already involved.</p>
<p>That appears to have eased some concerns about a sudden dump of stolen <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-pumps-16-eyes-test-of-yearly-highs-near-1-0-as-crypto-community-discusses-potential-99-9-victory-for-ripple-versus-sec.htm">XRP</a> tokens onto the market.</p>

News that a top executive of a major crypto project has been hacked for assets worth north of $100 million is hardly a confidence booster.</p>
<p>News that a top executive of a major crypto project has been hacked for assets worth north of $100 million is hardly a confidence booster for any cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>With the XRP price having dipped below a pennant structure in place since last summer, more downside could be coming.</p>
<p>Downside levels that XRP bears might be targeting include the September/October double lows at $0.45 and at $0.433 and $0.41.</p>

<p>But with momentum in the broader crypto market looking positive, any dips might remain short-lived.</p>
<p>Ripple Labs is likely to continue its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-legal-defeats-stockpile-concerning-ripple-legal-chief.htm">winning momentum versus the US SEC</a> this year.</p>
<p>And macro conditions are likely to improve when the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/five-signs-feds-pivot-is-underway-before-even-single-rate-cut-2024-01-26/">Fed starts cutting interest rates</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TAOUSDT/">Bittensor ($TAO)</a> emerges as a beacon of progress and potential, particularly within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. As of late, $TAO has demonstrated an impressive upward trend, steadfastly maintaining its position around the $465.70 mark.</p>
<p>This surge is not only remarkable for its 40% increase during the previous week and over 26% surge as of now in the current week. Moreover, TAO has exhibited an extraordinary 550% uplift over the past three months, catapulting its value from $50 to $465.</p>
<p>Such growth positions $TAO as one of the most promising altcoins in the current market, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This surge in Bittensor&#8217;s value is closely linked to the burgeoning activity of developers on its network, which saw a significant 37% increase in a single day.</p>
<p>Amidst a backdrop of crypto market rebounds and economic uncertainties, $TAO stands out, dominating the AI cryptocurrency market and signaling a potential new era for digital assets.</p>
<h2>Bittensor Price Prediction</h2>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The four-hour chart reveals pivotal price levels for Bittensor. The pivot point stands at $435.61, serving as a baseline for current trading dynamics. Resistance levels are observed at $469.14, $487.99, and $509.01, indicating potential ceilings in price movement. Conversely, support levels are found at $405.55, $382.67, and $349.84, outlining areas where price declines may halt.</p>
<p>Technical indicators provide further insights. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 60, suggesting a moderately bullish momentum without venturing into overbought territory. The MACD indicator presents a value of 2.95 against a signal of 27.89, implying a bullish trend as the MACD line hints at crossing above the signal line.</p>
<p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $392.00, underscoring a solid upward trajectory from recent price levels.</p>

<p>Chart patterns indicate that TAO is buoyed by an upward trendline, with a current support just above the $420 mark. A potential break below this level could lead to tests of lower support zones. However, a bullish engulfing pattern forming over the trendline suggests an inclination towards buying, though a double top formation near $469.14 could present resistance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall trend for Bittensor appears bullish above the pivot point of $435.61. The short-term forecast anticipates the asset testing the immediate resistance at $469.14 in the coming days, provided it maintains its momentum above the pivotal support.</p>

<p><a href="http://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-prediction-as-10000-new-smart-contracts-added-can-ada-overtake-solana.htma">Cardano price prediction</a> remains bearish as <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD/">ADA</a> is securing its position as the 9th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As we embark on this analysis dated January 30, Cardano&#8217;s current market standing and price dynamics come into focus.</p>
<p>Trading at approximately $0.523345, ADA has seen a marginal decline of 0.75% over the past day. Despite this slight dip, the trading volume of $487.7 million underscores a vibrant market activity.</p>
<p>With a robust <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/">market capitalization</a> of $18.54 billion and a circulating supply of 35.42 billion ADA coins, out of a possible 45 billion, the currency&#8217;s resilience and growing adoption hint at an intriguing future.</p>
<p>This analysis aims to unravel the factors driving Cardano&#8217;s ascent in the crypto hierarchy and explore whether its current valuation and market trends signal a broader trend of increasing adoption and investor confidence.</p>
<h2>Cardano Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The 4-hour chart provides a granular view of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-prediction-as-ada-dumps-7-5-can-ada-hit-1-in-2024.htm">ADA&#8217;s price action</a>, revealing critical levels that could dictate its short-term trajectory. The pivot point, a key indicator of market sentiment, is positioned at $0.5330.</p>
<p>Resistance levels are observed at $0.5520, $0.5760, and $0.6000, marking potential hurdles for upward movement. Conversely, support levels at $0.5100, $0.4860, and $0.4610 offer cushions that could prevent further declines.</p>
<p>The technical indicators shed light on the underlying market dynamics. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 71, flirting with overbought territory, which could signal a potential pullback.</p>
<p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.4960 underscores a bullish undercurrent, as the current price remains above this moving average.</p>

<p>Chart patterns offer additional insights. A downward trendline acts as a resistance level around the $0.5330 mark. The consistent closure of candles below this level suggests a continuation of the downtrend.</p>
<p>This pattern, coupled with the positioning of the RSI and EMA, presents a nuanced view of Cardano&#8217;s market posture.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall trend for Cardano is bearish below the $0.5330 threshold. The intersection of technical indicators, support and resistance levels, and chart patterns points to a market that is grappling with bearish pressures in the short term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) price predictions remain uninspiring, despite an uptick in trading volumes to above $400 million in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Dogecoin price was last changing hands just above $0.08, with the 21DMA at $0.0809 acting as a magnet.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin">CoinGecko</a>, 24-hour trading volumes for the world’s largest meme coin by market capitalization was last around $400 million.</p>
<p>That’s a jump from trading volumes seen towards the end of last week.</p>
<p>Between Thursday and Sunday, Dogecoin didn’t clock daily trading volumes of more than $300 million, as per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOGE-USD/history?p=DOGE-USD">Yahoo Finance data</a>.</p>
<p>The uptick in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a> trading volume comes as the broader market picks up.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) hit two-week highs near $44,000 on Tuesday as concerns about Grayscale selling fade and bullish bets return.</p>

<p>Other altcoins have been doing even better, with the Solana (SOL) price up over 25% in 7 days, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/%5d">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>But while the Dogecoin price is up around 10% from its 2024 lows under $0.075, its price action remains subdued.</p>
<p>Since breaking below its Q3 2023 uptrend in early January, the Dogecoin price has been languishing in a downtrend.</p>
<p>The 50DMA and downwards trendline coincide around $0.087.</p>
<p>For Dogecoin price predictions to turn more bullish, Dogecoin would need to pop above this resistance zone.</p>

<h2><strong>Dogecoin Price Prediction – Is $1 DOGE Possible?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Dogecoin’s very short-term outlook remains downbeat thanks to technicals.</p>
<p>But assuming that the broader crypto bull market continues, dips probably won’t last too long or be too deep.</p>
<p>Indeed, as risk appetite across the crypto market increases this year in wake of spot crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gbtc-outflows-topped-2-2-billion-last-week-outweighing-all-spot-bitcoin-etf-gains-coinshares.htm">ETF approvals</a>, the Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">halving</a>, a rate-cutting cycle from the Fed and potential political and fiscal tailwinds in the US on election year, Dogecoin is a good candidate to perform well.</p>
<p>That’s particularly true in light of the fact that Dogecoin largely failed to keep pace with Bitcoin and Ether’s big price pumps in 2023, meaning that Dogecoin might represent a comparatively favorable value bet.</p>
<p>Dogecoin briefly reached a market cap of $82 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>Assuming the cryptocurrency can surpass this level in 2024 or 2025, DOGE stands a chance of reaching $1.</p>
<p>There are currently around 142 billion Dogecoins in issuance, meaning DOGE would have to reach a market cap of $142 billion for each token to be worth $1.</p>
<p>Dogecoin price bulls will be hoping that Elon Musk’s X helps DOGE on its path to $1.</p>
<p>X is teasing the launch of a new payments platform.</p>
<p>Musk, a long-time Dogecoin supporter, has teased that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-doge-hits-8-month-highs-on-elon-musks-plans-to-raise-1-billion-for-x-ai-can-doge-hit-1.htm">Dogecoin could play a role in X’s future payments system</a>.</p>
<p>Dogecoin could be a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-dogecoin-a-good-investment.htm">strong investment choice for 2024</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Better Meme Coin Alternative to Dogecoin</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Dogecoin’s bloated market cap means it is a highly risky bet, with limited upside potential and big downside risk.</p>
<p>All meme coins are risky, but some up-and-coming project’s at least offer a strong possibility of 100x gains.</p>
<p>One such project that has been closely followed by analysts at Cryptonews.com is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge">Sponge V2</a>.</p>
<p>Sponge V2 is the reincarnation of the legendary Spongebob Squarepants-themed $SPONGE token, which reached a market cap of nearly $100 million earlier in 2023 and delivered gains to its earlier investors in the region of 100x.</p>
<p>$SPONGE token holders will be able to stake their tokens to receive an equivalent amount of $SPONGEV2 tokens, as well as to start earning staking rewards (paid out in $SPONGEV2) with a minimum APY of 40%.</p>
<p>Around $4 million worth of $SPONGE tokens have already been staked and are gaining an APY of over 300%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price currently up close to 10% from its recent lows, some bulls are questioning whether a new rally is starting.</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu price was close to $0.000000925, having bounced from a triple low it tested under $0.0000085 last week.</p>
<p>The rally in the Shiba Inu price comes as the broader cryptocurrency market picks up.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) hit two-week highs near $44,000 on Tuesday as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-going-to-zero-as-grayscale-sends-10000-btc-to-coinbase-best-altcoins-to-invest-in-right-now.htm">concerns about Grayscale selling fade</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-pumps-above-43000-as-btc-bulls-regain-control-heres-what-to-watch-this-week.htm">bullish bets return</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite the recent bounce, the Shiba Inu price bulls can’t get too excited just yet.</p>
<p>That’s because the Shiba Inu price hasn’t yet been able to break above a key short-term resistance zone.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-175-million-in-volumes-come-in-where-next-for-shib.htm">Shiba Inu price predictions</a> are to turn substantially more bullish, this is the zone to watch.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Price Needs to Break Above This Zone If New Rally to Start</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shiba Inu’s 21DMA and a downtrend from its December highs both coincide around $0.00000940.</p>
<p>This is the key resistance level to watch.</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu price briefly pushed above here on Tuesday, reaching as high as the $0.00000960s.</p>
<p>But it has since pulled back.</p>
<p>A sustained breakout above here will be needed for price bets to get more bullish.</p>
<p>If a bullish breakout is confirmed, SHIB could quickly pump back to December highs near $0.000012.</p>
<p>That would present upside of nearly 30% from current levels.</p>
<figure id="attachment_158897" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158897" style="width: 1782px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-158897" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706633436-shib-1.png" alt="Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Chart" width="1782" height="711" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706633436-shib-1.png 1782w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706633436-shib-1-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706633436-shib-1-1024x409.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706633436-shib-1-768x306.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706633436-shib-1-1536x613.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706633436-shib-1-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1782px) 100vw, 1782px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-158897" class="wp-caption-text">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s pretty good.</p>
<p>But Shiba Inu’s market cap is already bloated at around $5.5 billion, limiting the chance of exponential growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, the launch of Shiba Inu’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-shibarium-upgrades-trigger-4240-burn-rate-surge-a-new-era-for-shib.htm">Shibarium layer-2 blockchain</a>, which was designed to act as a home for the Shiba Inu web3 ecosystem, has so far been a dud.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Shibarium">DeFi Llama</a>, despite launching five months ago, it has only been able to garner a trade value locked (TVL) of around $833,000.</p>
<p>A lack of capital inflows into the protocol are indicative of a lack of adoption.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu thus remains a highly risky bet, with limited upside potential and big downside risk.</p>
<p>All meme coins are risky, but some up-and-coming projects at least offer a strong possibility of 100x gains.</p>
<p>One such project that has been closely followed by analysts at Cryptonews.com is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge">Sponge V2</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Better Meme Coin Alternative to Shiba Inu</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Sponge V2 is the reincarnation of the legendary Spongebob Squarepants-themed $SPONGE token, which reached a market cap of nearly $100 million earlier in 2023 and delivered gains to its earlier investors in the region of 100x.</p>
<p>$SPONGE token holders will be able to stake their tokens to receive an equivalent amount of $SPONGEV2 tokens, as well as to start earning staking rewards (paid out in $SPONGEV2) with a minimum APY of 40%.</p>
<p>Around $4 million worth of $SPONGE tokens have already been staked and are gaining an APY of over 300%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana (SOL) price predictions have sudden become much more bullish in wake of the cryptocurrency breaking above key technical resistance levels, and amid a surge in on-chain activity that saw Solana’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter surpass Uniswap in terms of 24-hour trading volume over the weekend.</p>
<p>The Solana price moved back above $100 on Monday for the first time in 11 days.</p>
<p>It has now broken convincingly back to the north of its 21DMA and a downtrend that had been in play going back to the December highs in the $120s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_158204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158204" style="width: 1784px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-158204" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706553261-screenshot-2024-01-29-133408.png" alt="Solana (SOL) Price Chart / Source: TradingView" width="1784" height="713" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706553261-screenshot-2024-01-29-133408.png 1784w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706553261-screenshot-2024-01-29-133408-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706553261-screenshot-2024-01-29-133408-1024x409.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706553261-screenshot-2024-01-29-133408-768x307.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706553261-screenshot-2024-01-29-133408-1536x614.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706553261-screenshot-2024-01-29-133408-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1784px) 100vw, 1784px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-158204" class="wp-caption-text">Solana (SOL) Price Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/jupiter#:~:text=Jupiter%20is%20a%20decentralized%20cryptocurrency,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">CoinGecko</a>, 24-hour volumes on Jupiter were last around $585 million.</p>
<p>That’s barely behind the multi-chain <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/biggest-crypto-gainers-today-on-uniswap-tucker-frog-loong.htm">Uniswap</a> protocol’s <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/jupiter#:~:text=Jupiter%20is%20a%20decentralized%20cryptocurrency,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">24-hour volumes of $620 million</a>.</p>
<p>Uniswap is lauded as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">Decentralized Finance</a> industry’s best success stories.</p>
<p>So the fact that Jupiter has caught up is a big deal for the protocol, as well as for the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>For reference, the recent surge in Jupiter trade activity has mostly been driven by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-based-jupiter-to-distribute-1-billion-jup-tokens-in-upcoming-airdrop.htm">airdrop related excitement</a>.</p>
<p>Jupiter will an airdrop of 40% of the supply of its native JUP token on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jupiter volumes have also been high recently after it launched an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-solana-meme-coin-wen-airdropped-to-1-million-wallets-heres-how-to-check-eligibility.htm">airdrop of a joke meme coin called WEN</a> to poke fun at Solana users who had been incessantly asking when Jupiter would drop its JUP token, and to act as a test run of the JUP airdrop.</p>
<p>27% of the unclaimed WEN supply was just burnt, as per <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/5RYZKA3SfpDh7oboumkY6fpms7AdmHiqwxEc3nbTdHxoNxZYPPuHYyhx7wL6WunmXBpZfMA4r5ZWJtq3XdJdN6Yg">solscan</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Solana Price Prediction – A New High for SOL Incoming?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Jupiter-fuelled airdrop hunting is helping to power on-chain activity on Solana back to new yearly highs.</p>
<p>As per data presented by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/solana">The Block</a>, the 7DMA of new addresses on Solana just hit a new record high above 450,000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 7DMA of active addresses is fast heading back to yearly highs at 1,000,000.</p>
<p>Likewise, the 7DMA of value moved on chain is also rebounding and was last at just under $40 billion.</p>
<p>Positive on-chain trends plus positive technical developments suggest a strong likelihood that the Solana price quicky hits new highs.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-approaches-100-can-sol-beat-its-all-time-high.htm">Price predictions</a> are thus bullish, with traders targeting a return to the $120 for the Solana price.</p>
<p>If the Solana price is able to break above here, a quick retest of the April 2022 highs in the $140s is likely.</p>

<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Solana coins can offer huge potential returns.</p>
<p>But diversification is your friend in the wild crypto markets.</p>
<p>For those looking for a strong probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BONKUSD">Bonk price</a> has dropped by 6% in the past 24 hours, with the meme token falling to $0.00001171 on a day when the wider market drops by a less dramatic 0.5%.</p>
<p>BONK remains up by 7.5% in the past week, yet it has declined by 17.5% in the last 30 days, with January having been a largely negative month for the coin.</p>
<p>However, it continues to sit on a 1,000% gain in the last 12 months, and with its trading volume often outperforming that of its rival Shiba Inu (SHIB), it&#8217;s likely to experience further rallies soon.</p>
<h2>Bonk Price Prediction as Volume Outperforms SHIB – Can Bonk Overtake Dogecoin and Shiba Inu?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bonk&#8217;s chart continues to look pretty flat, with its indicators struggling to recover from more than a month of overselling and stagnation.</p>
<p>For instance, BONK&#8217;s 30-day average has been declining slightly over the past couple of weeks, and has failed to rise since January.</p>
<figure id="attachment_157920" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157920" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-157920" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706527848-bonk-price-chart.png" alt="Bonk price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706527848-bonk-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706527848-bonk-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706527848-bonk-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706527848-bonk-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706527848-bonk-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706527848-bonk-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706527848-bonk-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157920" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a clear sign of a loss of momentum, with the coin&#8217;s relative strength index (purple) telling us something very similar.</p>
<p>Indeed, the RSI remains below 50 and is struggling to rise any higher, suggesting a lack of interest from buyers at the moment.</p>
<p>BONK&#8217;s volume supports this view, since while the coin has traded more heavily than SHIB and DOGE in recent months, its volume currently stands at only $75 million.</p>
<p>This is minuscule in comparison to major tokens (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum Solana), and it also represents an 85% decline compared to how heavily BONK traded in mid-January.</p>
<p>One reason for BONK&#8217;s underperformance in recent weeks is that whales seem to have forgotten about the coin, with no big buys happening since earlier in the month.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://solscan.io/account/3RieTyY7uM1KducnoBgjPvc1kpna94DSrCCaxz5a1ns6#splTransfers">one whale who continues to hold onto about $3.5 million of the coin</a>, yet other than this, not much has happened in the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>It seems that many traders have moved onto other meme tokens, with WEN being the latest Solana-based flavor of the month altcoin.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Having said that, the market as a whole is also flatlining right now, so a return to bullishness may help the Bonk price recover.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">Bitcoin halving in April</a> could lift prices across the board, for example, with BONK potentially able to return to $0.000030 by the end of spring.</p>
<h2>Newer Meme Tokens for Newer Rallies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For those worried that BONK&#8217;s best days may already be over, there are other newer tokens emerging that look ready to rally in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>One prime candidate for big returns is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/sponge">Sponge (SPONGE)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that originally listed &#8211; and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sponge-best-crypto-buy-today-new-meme-coin-spongebob-might-100x-1.htm">surged</a> &#8211; in April 2023.</span></p>
<p>Yet now it&#8217;s in the process of launching the second version of its coin, which comes with a new staking model and will also serve as the native token for an exciting new play-to-earn game.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">10 exchanges not enough? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpongeV2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpongeV2</a> will be listed on BIGGER AND BETTER exchanges! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>&mdash; $SPONGE (@spongeoneth) <a href="https://twitter.com/spongeoneth/status/1749839548702494999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The new game will be a multiplayer racer, enabling players to compete against each other to see who can rank the highest on a global leaderboard.</p>
<p>It will have a free and also a paid version, with those who rank the highest receiving SPONGE V2 as a reward,</p>
<p>Holders of SPONGE V1 can claim V2 tokens by visiting <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/sponge">the official Sponge website</a> and staking their older version, while non-holders can simply buy SPONGE V2 outright.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPONGE Meme Coin 100X CRYPTO?! 30% PUMP! (BIG POTENTIAL!!?)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iv50B1_AJG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>And once they&#8217;ve claimed their V2 tokens, they will have them staked until the new coin is officially launched, with <a href="https://twitter.com/spongeoneth/status/1750831716137369985">holders earning a higher rate</a> if they leave their tokens locked up for longer.</p>
<p>Taken with Sponge&#8217;s appeal as a meme token and its already-strong following, SPONGE V2 could really rally hard once it goes live in the next few weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOGEUSD">Dogecoin price</a> has jumped by 2.5% in the past hour, rising to $0.08049 following a poor weekend for the meme coin and the wider crypto market.</p>
<p>Despite this morning&#8217;s lift, DOGE recent bad fortunes mean that it&#8217;s flat in the past 24 hours, down by 2% in a week and also down by 10% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>It has also declined by 10% in the past hour, a percentage that underlines the poor 2023 it had, especially in contrast to other major tokens.</p>
<p>However, while DOGE has disappointed, the market has oversold for too long, so today&#8217;s move may be the start of a rebound.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Prediction as Bearish Sentiment Looms – A Downward Trend in Store?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
DOGE&#8217;s indicators have been in the red for so long that it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising that the meme token has just begun a resurgence.</p>
<p>Most notably, its relative strength index (purple) had languished below 50 (if not 40) since the beginning of the year, although has risen today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_157841" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157841" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-157841" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706523528-dogecoin-price-chart.png" alt="Dogecoin price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706523528-dogecoin-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706523528-dogecoin-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706523528-dogecoin-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706523528-dogecoin-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706523528-dogecoin-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706523528-dogecoin-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706523528-dogecoin-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157841" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much the same goes for its 30-day moving average (yellow), which has slid gradually since the New Year, with only a brief interruption for when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-heres-how-crypto-executives-reacted.htm">the SEC approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>As such, it&#8217;s entirely credible to claim that now is as good a time as any for a Dogecoin comeback, especially when its 2023 was so bad.</p>
<p>Its support level (green) has held up well in recent weeks, suggesting that it had reached a bottom and was ready to return to growth.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about the past hour&#8217;s spike is that it has come amid a pretty low 24-hour trading volume for DOGE, a volume which has declined from over $1.3 billion in mid-January to only $325 million today.</p>
<p>This could be spun as a positive sign, however, in that the Dogecoin price could rise even higher once bigger volume arrives.</p>
<p>Yet so far, there&#8217;s no sign that whales are much interested in accumulating the meme coin, with the last big transfer being <em>to </em>a trading platform last week.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This all said, the wider market&#8217;s return to bullishness in the coming months will help push DOGE even further, potentially to $0.20 by the summer.</p>
<p>On top of this, <a href="https://fr.cryptonews.com/news/x-2024-paiements-peer-to-peer.htm">X has stated its aim of introducing peer-to-peer payments on its platform this year</a>, a move which could bring DOGE to the social network.</p>
<p>And if it does, DOGE is likely to surge.</p>
<h2>Alternative Meme Coins for Bigger Rallies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While DOGE is likely to see a resurgence sooner or later, there&#8217;s every chance that this it could arrive later, leaving traders having to look elsewhere if they want quicker gains.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s a healthy supply of newer tokens and meme coins in the market right now, including several presale coins that have been generating plenty of momentum and hype.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">One of these is </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="//cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat%5C%22" rel="sponsored">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 coin that has raised just more than $7.6 million over the past couple of months.</span></p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, Solana appears to be in a bullish phase, contingent upon maintaining above the pivot point of $93.99.</p>
<p>The immediate term outlook is cautiously optimistic. We expect Solana to test the resistance at $97.40 in the coming days.</p>
<p>A successful breach of this level could pave the way for further gains, potentially aiming for the next resistance at $99.89.</p>
<p>However, it is essential to monitor closely for any reversal signals. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and shifts in sentiment can occur rapidly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cardano (ADA) price is rebounding on Friday after hitting multi-month lows earlier in the week under $0.45.</p>
<p>The rebound mostly reflects an upturn in prices across the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The Cardano price was last up by a similar margin.</p>
<p>The rebound in the Cardano price could also reflect strength in an important metric of the Cardano blockchain’s adoption.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/p_a6behjl6oc">Cardano Blockchain Insights</a>, the number of smart contracts issued on the blockchain has jumped by more than 10,000 this month.</p>
<p>Decentralized applications built on blockchains rely on smart contracts.</p>
<p>The jump in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a> smart contract deployment is thus indicative of accelerating dApp building activity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cardano/">Cardano</a> price’s latest rebound confirms that the 100DMA remains a strong area of support.</p>
<p>But price predictions are unlikely to turn substantially bullish until ADA is able to get back above its 21DMA at $0.516.</p>
<h2><strong>Cardano Price Prediction – Can ADA Overtake Solana?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For Cardano price predictions to turn bullish, ADA will also likely need to push above its recent short-term downtrend.</p>
<p>If it can manage that, a retest of recent highs in the $0.67 area is a strong possibility.</p>
<figure id="attachment_157503" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157503" style="width: 1781px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-157503" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada.png" alt="Cardano (ADA) Price Chart / Source: TradingView" width="1781" height="708" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada.png 1781w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-300x119.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-1024x407.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-768x305.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-1536x611.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1781px) 100vw, 1781px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157503" class="wp-caption-text">Cardano (ADA) Price Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>While Cardano stands a good chance of rallying back to yearly highs, it will be tougher to overtake Solana.</p>
<p>At roughly $40 billion, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana’s market capitalization</a> is well over double Cardano’s, which was last around $17 billion.</p>
<p>And a quick look at the respective cryptocurrency ecosystems suggests that the difference in valuation is warranted.</p>
<p>As per DeFi Llama, <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">Solana</a> has a TVL of nearly $4.5 billion, over 10 times <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">Cardano’s</a>.</p>
<p>Solana has a stablecoin market cap or nearly $2 billion, also 10 times that on Cardano.</p>
<p>DEX volumes on Solana were over $550 million in the past 24 hours to Cardano’s less than $7 million.</p>
<p>All said the Cardano blockchain will need to see a big increase in use and adoption to stand a chance of overtaking Solana’s valuation.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cardano offers big potential returns but comes with a lot of risk given its lack of adoption.</p>
<p>For those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BONKUSD">Bonk price</a> has jumped by 9% today, surging to $0.00001171 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole gains by 2.5% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This means that BONK is now down by 1.5% in a week and by 26% in the last 30 days, falling as part of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-was-a-sell-the-news-event-cryptoquant.htm">a market-wide sell-the-news reaction to recent Bitcoin ETF approvals</a>.</p>
<p>Yet the coin remains up an impressive 1,000% in the past year, underlining how strongly it performed in late 2023, as it became a vehicle for whales.</p>
<p>And with meme coins often benefitting disproportionately whenever the market recovers and rallies, the next few weeks could be big for BONK.</p>
<h2>Bonk Price Prediction Following Meme Coin Sector&#8217;s Recovery – Can BONK Reach $1?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It seems that, after an extended period of losses, BONK may have just begun a process of recovery, at least judging by indicators.</p>
<p>For example, its RSI (purple) has begun climbing steadily after falling just below 40 earlier in the week,</p>
<figure id="attachment_157224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157224" style="width: 4310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-157224" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706270093-bonk-price-chart.png" alt="Bonk price chart." width="4310" height="2236" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706270093-bonk-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706270093-bonk-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706270093-bonk-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706270093-bonk-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706270093-bonk-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706270093-bonk-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706270093-bonk-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 4310px) 100vw, 4310px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157224" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Given that the RSI had been subdued for around a month, it now seems that this rise signals a renewal of momentum.</p>
<p>BONK&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) is also showing improved signs, given that it had been falling towards the 200-day (blue) but has now flattened out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also highly likely that the coin&#8217;s current price will overtake the 30-day average very soon, forming a bullish cross that often signals further gains.</p>
<p>Having said that, trading volume remains low, at around $68 million, so there remains a chance that today&#8217;s modest improvements don&#8217;t continue for much longer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that few whales have been accumulating BONK in recent weeks, suggesting a loss of interest in the token.</p>
<p>But as we&#8217;ve reported before, <a href="https://solscan.io/account/3RieTyY7uM1KducnoBgjPvc1kpna94DSrCCaxz5a1ns6#splTransfers">one whale continues to sit on a kitty of around 314.8 billion BONK</a>, worth about $3.3 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This smart trader who made ~$6.9M on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BONK</a> spent 386 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$SOL</a>($40K) to buy 3.29B <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BONK</a> again today!</p>
<p>He accumulated 371.4B <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BONK</a> in 9 months at a cost of only 6,998 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$SOL</a>($276K) and sold half of the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BONK</a> during the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BONK</a> surge for 50,139 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$SOL</a>($5.2M).<a href="https://t.co/pOFRD2ndI8">https://t.co/pOFRD2ndI8</a> <a href="https://t.co/lkgGm13G0e">pic.twitter.com/lkgGm13G0e</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lookonchain (@lookonchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1744605955646783915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This suggests that bigger and savvier traders continue to expect that BONK will see further gains sooner or later, even if it has disappointed in recent weeks.</p>
<p>And seeing as how the market as a whole has recovered today, the overall outlook may become more bullish in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed, the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs may gradually see an increase in volumes and demand for BTC and crypto more generally, helping to push up the Bonk price as well.</p>
<p>From its current level of $0.00001171, it may reach $0.000020 in the next two or three months.</p>
<h2>New Meme Tokens with Strong Fundamentals</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One of the issues with BONK is that it lacks fundamentals, meaning there&#8217;s nothing supporting its price but the whims of the market and larger traders.</p>
<p>For this reason, traders may prefer to invest in meme tokens that not only have a strong following, but that also have some utility to back them up.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">A good example of this is </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="//cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat%5C%22" rel="sponsored">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 coin that has raised just over $7.4 million in its very popular presale.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have surpassed the $7.4 million mark in the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MK</a> presale<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f94a.png" alt="🥊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<figure class="&quot;media&quot;"></figure>
<figure class="&quot;media&quot;"></figure>
<p>What distinguishes Meme Kombat from the pack is that, aside from being a meme coin, it&#8217;s also social gambling platform on which users can bet on the results of AI-generated battles between meme characters.</p>
<p>Its use of AI will enables it to randomize battle outcomes, while the use of smart contracts will make battles and their results transparent.</p>
<p>Users can place bets against each other or against the game itself, using MK to do so.</p>
<p>They will also receive MK if they win, with the token open to staking, meaning that holders could find the coin very profitable.</p>
