<p>This comes amid news from the cryptocurrency trading platform Gemini, announcing the bankrupt company Genesis is proceeding with the sale of its trust assets. Interest in Bitcoin ETFs has been dampened by stringent due diligence processes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice has made headlines by accusing a couple of illegally mining cryptocurrency in a school district, amid wider investigations into the energy consumption of crypto activities. These events collectively paint a complex picture for investors considering Bitcoin&#8217;s future price movements.</p>

<h2>Genesis Trust Asset Sale Moves Forward</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With the goal of making money off of interests in Grayscale Ethereum trusts, cryptocurrency lender Genesis has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/crypto-exchange-gemini-says-bankrupt-genesis-moves-authorize-sale-trust-assets-2024-02-03/?taid=65be969c9d1e610001e8fcf4&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">submitted a motion</a> for asset sale to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p>Genesis wants to approve the sale of trust assets, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares, according to Gemini Trust Co.&#8217;s confirmation of the move.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On February 8, an expedited hearing is also requested in the motion. Genesis recently offered a liquidation plan to reimburse clients in cash or bitcoin as part of the settlement of an SEC lawsuit regarding its now-defunct Gemini Earn lending scheme.</p>
<p>Depending on the result, asset sales may have a favorable effect on market sentiment and, consequently, Bitcoin prices.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ETFs Face Due Diligence Hurdles</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
LPL Financial Holdings is slowing the <a href="https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1753830096191078578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adoption of Bitcoin ETFs</a> with its detailed due diligence, affecting nearly 19,000 financial advisers and $1.4 trillion in managed assets. This review aims to assess the ETFs&#8217; risks and potential before allowing investments.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Companies such as LPL Financial Holdings, one of the largest independent brokers in the United States, are currently reviewing recently approved Bitcoin ETFs to decide whether to offer them to the nearly 19,000 independent financial advisors who manage $1.4 trillion in assets.…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Expected to conclude in three months, this process will scrutinize the ETFs&#8217; performance and sustainability, possibly delaying the anticipated $10 billion inflow into Bitcoin ETFs in their first year.</p>
<p>This cautious approach could impact Bitcoin&#8217;s market perception and price.</p>
<h2>DOJ Targets Illegal Crypto Mining in School</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Two employees of the Patterson Joint Unified School District have been charged by the U.S. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/former-assistant-superintendent-and-former-it-director-patterson-joint-unified-school">Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> for allegedly running a cryptocurrency mining farm on school property, utilizing school resources, and inflating electricity expenses.</p>
<p>It is said that IT director Eric Drabert and assistant superintendent Jeffrey Menge bought expensive graphics cards and mined cryptocurrency on school premises.</p>
<figure id="attachment_161084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161084" style="width: 1419px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-161084 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1707028122-screenshot_151.jpg" alt="Former Assistant Superintendent and Former IT Director of Patterson Joint Unified School District Plead Guilty to $1 Million Embezzlement Scheme" width="1419" height="454" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1707028122-screenshot_151.jpg 1419w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1707028122-screenshot_151-300x96.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1707028122-screenshot_151-1024x328.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1707028122-screenshot_151-768x246.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1707028122-screenshot_151-150x48.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1419px) 100vw, 1419px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-161084" class="wp-caption-text">Source: justice.go</figcaption></figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>The accusations against Menge and Drabert include theft, with Menge allegedly stealing between $1 million and $1.5 million and Drabert allegedly stealing between $250,000 and $300,000.</p>
<p>This incident may affect the public&#8217;s impression of bitcoin operations as U.S. regulators are closely monitoring the energy usage of cryptocurrency miners.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s current technical landscape underscores a critical juncture, with the cryptocurrency trading around $42,885.

<p>On the downside, support is positioned at $42,535, followed by $41,950 and $41,395, marking pivotal zones for price stabilization.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 48, indicating a neutral market sentiment, while the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $42,710 slightly supports the current price level.</p>
<p>However, a symmetrical triangle breakout below $42,885 suggests an emerging selling trend, steering the short-term outlook towards bearish beneath this threshold.</p>

<p>This momentum coincides with US legislators scrutinizing the SEC&#8217;s cryptocurrency oversight, highlighting Bitcoin&#8217;s enduring appeal amidst regulatory debates.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to maintain interest rates in March, despite a hawkish outlook, introduces further variables into Bitcoin price forecasts.</p>
<p>Additionally, the imminent debut of Victoria VR&#8217;s Metaverse application for Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Vision Pro&#8217; signals a burgeoning synergy between innovative technologies and cryptocurrencies, potentially catalyzing Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trajectory.</p>

<h2>US Politicians Question SEC&#8217;s Cryptocurrency Regulations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The examination of the SEC&#8217;s cryptocurrency regulations by US politicians might not immediately influence Bitcoin (BTC) prices.</p>
<p>However, this scrutiny signals an increased legislative effort to shape cryptocurrency regulations, potentially impacting the broader regulatory framework.</p>

<p>This cautious stance, emphasizing rate adjustments only upon clear signs of sustainable inflation control, has significantly impacted the likelihood of an imminent rate cut, reducing it from a previously anticipated 65% to just over 50%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was overtaken in daily trading volume by BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF for the first time on Thursday, highlighting the legacy fund’s shrinking dominance over the Bitcoin (BTC) market.</p>
<p>The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) processed $300 million in trades, versus $290 million from GBTC, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1753165420482244632">Bloomberg Intelligence</a>. On flows, data from BitMEX Research shows that BlackRock increased its net assets by $163.9 million, while $182 million worth of BTC left Grayscale’s fund.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin ETF Flow &#8211; Day 15</p>
<p>All data out. Net flow of +$38.5m for day 15. Relatively quiet day it seems <a href="https://t.co/L478MuK9v1">pic.twitter.com/L478MuK9v1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1753303865452040414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“Total trading today was kind of a dud though at $924 million–first day below $1 billion in dollar volume for the group since launch,” Bloomberg ETF analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1753165420482244632">James Seyffart tweeted</a>.</p>
<h2>Is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Beating Grayscale?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Seyffart, it will be difficult to determine what the market’s Bitcoin “trading vehicle of choice” truly is until a day of noticeably high price volatility or volume comes. Since the selloff that followed the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-frenzy-begins-as-sec-finally-approves-first-spot-bitcoin-funds-bitcoin-remains-unresponsive.htm">launch of several Bitcoin spot ETFs</a> on January 11, there&#8217;s been no such day to speak of.</p>
<p>A clear trend towards Blackrock is taking shape, however. Multiple trading days this week began with BlackRock in the lead on volume before being narrowly surpassed by Graysclae later on.</p>
<p>Additionally, BlackRock has already received $3 billion in net inflows to its Bitcoin ETF within three weeks. Grayscale’s ETF has lost nearly $6 billion over that same period, with not a single day of net inflows.</p>
<p>Much of Grayscale’s early outflows were driven by the FTX bankruptcy estate selling GBTC, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-was-a-sell-the-news-event-cryptoquant.htm">sell-the-news traders</a>, and those cashing out on the now-restored <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-evaporating-and-traders-back-new-bitcoin-etf-token-with-more-than-2m-as-sellout-looms-and-sec-approval-bets-mount.htm">GBTC discount</a> against its underlying Bitcoin holdings.</p>
<h2>GBTC Fees Higher Than Competitors</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investors have another strong reason to continue offloading GBTC, however. The fund still charges a management fee of 1.5%, while most rivals offering an identical product are charging under 0.25% per year, including BlackRock.</p>
<p>As such, if the massive fund loses its liquidity advantage against BlackRock, it will offer nothing to customers that rivals can’t.</p>
<p>Regardless, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnhenshein has expressed confidence that the fund’s decision to keep its fee relatively elevated was the right one.</p>
<p>“I think from our standpoint, it may at times call into question their long-term commitment to the asset class,” he said last month regarding other funds’ low fees.</p>
<p>Next to Grayscale and BlackRock, Fidelity carries the next largest amount of Bitcoin under management at roughly $2.4 billion.</p>

<h2>Marathon Digital Buys Out Site Management Rights</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Top <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/02/02/2822731/0/en/Hut-8-concluding-managed-services-at-Kearney-Nebraska-and-Granbury-Texas-in-Q2.html">Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 said</a> in the release that it&#8217;s relinquishing Bitcoin mining sites in Kearney, Nebraska, and Granbury, Texas. The company revealed that the agreement was sanctioned after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-marathon-digitals-record-mining-boosts-btc-amid-etf-hopes.htm">Marathon Digital</a> paid a $13.56 million termination fee to own the property management rights of the two sites.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marathon Digital has agreed to pay Hut 8 a termination fee of $13.5 million to assume complete operational control of its recently acquired Bitcoin mining sites in Granbury, Texas, and Kearney, Nebraska.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Crypto</a> <a href="https://t.co/Iwd04Oeig3">pic.twitter.com/Iwd04Oeig3</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the meantime, Hut 8 is scheduled to continue providing management services in both sites until April 30, 2024, when the Marathon Digital team officially takes over. Marathon Digital is scheduled to pay the termination fee within 30 days after it passes the baton.</p>
<p>Speaking on the development, Hut 8 President Asher Genoot stated that an “orderly transition of operations” is expected in the coming months. Genoot also stated that the company&#8217;s new initiatives will be shared with the crypto public in the future.</p>
<p>Marathon Digital is an asset-light <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sets-bar-for-sustainability-over-50-powered-by-clean-energy-sources.htm">Bitcoin mining</a> infrastructure that ensures the validation of new transactions on the network. Validated transactions unlock block rewards, which are new Bitcoins released into circulation.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin mining company has stated that it wants to transition from an asset-light organization to a more hands-on mining operation. This mission has since been reflected after Marathon Digital purchased two additional Bitcoin mining sites from Generate Capital on December 19, 2023.</p>
<p>According to another <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1335/marathon-digital-holdings-enters-definitive-agreement-to">press release from Marathon Digital</a>, this acquisition cost the mining giant $178.6 million, or $458,000 per megawatts, to be paid in cash from the company’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>Marathon Digital provided more details, stating that the two mining sites would help the company generate 390 megawatts in capacity.</p>
<h2>Marathon’s Mining Capacity Now At 910 Megawatts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Marathon Digital’s Bitcoin mining site acquisition has already yielded dividends for the company. Previously, the mining firm had a mining portfolio of 584 megawatts of capacity, of which 3% was operated in sites owned by the company. Third parties hosted the remaining 97%.</p>
<p>With the acquisition of Generate Capital’s mining sites, Marathon Digital has seen its mining capacity skyrocket to 910 megawatts.</p>
<p>Speaking on this, <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1339/marathon-digital-holdings-announces-the-closing-of-its">CEO and Chairman Fred Thiel stated</a> that 45% of the mining capacity is operational in the mining sites it directly owns. On the other hand, 55% is being handled by third-party service providers.</p>
<p>Thiel also said that the company is working on integrating its entire portfolio in the next 18 to 24 months to meet its 5 Exahashes (Eh/s) capacity.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin bulls and bears are in a battle for supremacy in wake of the latest blockbuster US jobs report, with the Bitcoin price swinging on either side of the $43,000 level as traders assess the outlook for US monetary policy this year, and the potential impact on crypto.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price was last trading around $42,900, roughly flat on the day.</p>
<p>The latest US employment numbers showed that the US economy added 353,000 new employees in January.</p>
<p>That’s well above the expected gain of 187,000.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7% versus expectations for a rise to 3.8%.</p>
<p>Macro traders were thus forced to pare back on Fed rate cut bets, and this initially weighed on Bitcoin.</p>

<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">The Bitcoin price</a> dipped as low as the $42,500s as the US interest rate future market implied probability that the Fed cuts interest rates by 25 bps in March dropped under 20% from close to 40% on Friday, as per the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">CME’s Fed Watch Tool</a>.</p>
<p>Traders have also been pulling back on expectations for a rate cut by May.</p>
<p>The implied probability of no cuts by May leaped to nearly 30% on Friday from only around 6% on Thursday.</p>
<p>This time one month ago, markets implied a more than 70% probability of at least two rate cuts by May.</p>
<p>But stronger-than-expected CPI inflation, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-retail-sales-beat-expectations-december-2024-01-17/#:~:text=Retail%20sales%20are%20mostly%20goods,during%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic.'">retail sales</a>, consumer sentiment, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/moderate-us-economic-growth-expected-fourth-quarter-2024-01-25/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20Reuters%20survey,rate%20to%20a%202.8%25%20pace.">GDP</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-confidence-rise-two-year-high-january-2024-01-30/#:~:text=The%20Conference%20Board%20said%20on,from%20the%20previously%20reported%20110.7.">consumer confidence</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-openings-unexpectedly-rise-december-2024-01-30/'">JOLTs job opening</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-manufacturing-sector-cusp-recovery-january-ism-2024-02-01/">PMI</a> and now jobs data have all painted a picture of a US economy that is still very robust, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/strong-job-gains-may-deal-blow-fed-confidence-inflation-2024-02-02/">weakening the argument somewhat for rate cuts</a> over the course of the last month.</p>
<p>Macro headwinds can thus go some way to explaining Bitcoin’s pullback from earlier yearly highs above $49,000.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-going-to-zero-as-grayscale-sends-10000-btc-to-coinbase-best-altcoins-to-invest-in-right-now.htm">post-spot Bitcoin ETF approval profit-taking in Grayscale’s GBTC</a> was another major headwind.</p>
<p>The ETF has seen outflows of $6 billion since its conversion from a trust, <a href="https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-fund-flows-tool-result?tickers=GBTC&amp;startDate=2024-01-11&amp;endDate=2024-02-02&amp;frequency=DAILY">as per ETF.com</a>.</p>
<p>But those flows have slowed substantially this week to around $200 million per day.</p>
<p>And inflows into <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/navigating-spot-bitcoin-etfs-in-the-us-what-you-need-to-know.htm">newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> by the likes of BlackRock have outweighed GBTC outflows this week.</p>
<p>Indeed, news hit the wires on Friday that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-holds-3-billion-in-btc.htm">BlackRock’s ETF just hit the $3 billion in assets under management mark</a>.</p>
<p>That could have helped to lift Bitcoin sentiment at the time, lifting the price back to session highs above $43,400.</p>
<p>But the price has since dipped back under $43,000 as the Bitcoin bulls and bears continue to battle for supremacy.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Next for the Bitcoin (BTC) Price?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At current levels just under $43,000, the Bitcoin price remains trapped well within its multi-week $38,000-$49,000 range.</p>
<p>But price risks remain strongly tilted towards the upside in the medium term.</p>
<p>Yes, perhaps strong US economic data will prevent the Fed from cutting quite as soon as the market wants.</p>
<p>But with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prices-rise-moderately-december-inflation-trending-lower-2024-01-26/">YoY Core PCE inflation</a> well below the current interest rate, financial conditions are very tight.</p>
<p>Even if the economy continues to perform well, that means there is still potential room for rate cuts this year.</p>
<p>That means macro should remain a net tailwind for crypto market and the Bitcoin price this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ongoing inflows to newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs adds a new price-insensitive source of demand to the market.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">upcoming Bitcoin issuance rate halving</a> is about to slash sell pressure from Bitcoin miners.</p>
<p>A flood of new demand combined with a supply shock is a recipe for a much higher Bitcoin price.</p>
<p>Dips towards the bottom of Bitcoin’s recent price range will likely continue to be aggressively bought, as happened in January.</p>
<p>An eventual push back towards $50,000 is on the cards for the weeks/months ahead.</p>

<p>As per crypto analyst @CryptoWorldJosh, the ETF accumulated another 3,805 in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Since its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-sec-approves-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-1000000-btc-possible.htm">launch back on the 11<sup>th</sup> of January</a>, BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF has enjoyed strong net inflows.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-new-bitcoin-etf-debuts-strong-holding-over-120-million-in-btc.htm">BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF</a> has failed to attract at least $100 million in net inflows on only two trading days so far, as per ETF flow tracking website <a href="https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-fund-flows-tool-result?tickers=IBIT%2C&amp;startDate=2024-01-11&amp;endDate=2024-02-02&amp;frequency=DAILY">ETF.com</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Not the Only Success Story</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BlackRock’s new spot Bitcoin ETF isn’t the only success story in the past month.</p>
<p>Since the SEC gave 11 spot Bitcoin ETF products the green light, others have also been performing well.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) had attracted net inflows of close to $2.5 billion, as per <a href="https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-fund-flows-tool-result?tickers=FBTC&amp;startDate=2024-01-11&amp;endDate=2024-02-02&amp;frequency=DAILY">ETF.com</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as per <a href="https://blockworks.co/bitcoin-etf">Blockwork’s ETF tracker</a>, newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs from Ark 21Shares, Bitwise, Invesco/Galaxy, VanEck, Valkyrie, Franklin and WisdomTree have collectively attracted nearly $2 billion in assets under management (AUM).</p>
<p>Including Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), spot Bitcoin ETFs currently have around $28 in AUM.</p>
<h2><strong>Inflows Now Outweighing GBTC Outflows</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
GBTC converted from a trust product into a spot ETF in January <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gbtc-outflows-topped-2-2-billion-last-week-outweighing-all-spot-bitcoin-etf-gains-coinshares.htm">but has experienced outflows of around $6.1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Traders had bought <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-evaporating-and-traders-back-new-bitcoin-etf-token-with-more-than-2m-as-sellout-looms-and-sec-approval-bets-mount.htm">GBTC on masse throughout 2023</a> when it was trading at a big discount to net asset value (NAV).</p>
<p>Upon converting to a spot ETF, those traders were then finally able to redeem their GBTC at NAV.</p>
<p>Profit-taking on this trade was thus a large driver of GBTC outflows.</p>
<p>GBTC’s high fees relative to its competitors could be another factor driving rotation into newly launched spot Bitcoin ETF products.</p>
<p>As per ETF.com, GBTC outflows have dropped to around $200 million per day this week.</p>
<p>Inflows into the other newly launched ETFs is thus currently outstripping GBTC outflows, adding a new demand tailwind to the Bitcoin market.</p>

<p>Initially dipping to the $42,500 area, BTC has since rebounded, marking a spike of over 2% from Thursday&#8217;s low, indicative of a bullish sentiment among traders.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, paralleling Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience, continues to stabilize near the $2,300 threshold, further emphasizing the optimistic outlook within the crypto market.</p>

<p>Based on past cycles after the 2012, 2016, and 2020 halvings, Bitcoin saw substantial increases. If these patterns hold, Bitcoin could see a short-term correction post-April 2024 halving, aiming for a peak between April and October 2025.</p>

<h2><strong>US Labor Market Strengthens, Impact on Bitcoin and Ethereum Price</strong></h2>

Recent US labor market data <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveals a robust employment scenario</a>, with Non-Farm Employment Change exceeding expectations at 353K jobs added, surpassing the forecasted 187K.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, this positive economic data has bolstered the dollar, exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.</p>
<p>A stronger dollar often diverts investment away from cryptocurrencies, potentially affecting their market value.</p>
<h2>Legislative Effort Against SEC Rule Boosts Bitcoin Prospects</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A legislative push led by North Carolina Representative Wiley Nickel, with support from Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative Mike Flood, aims to challenge a SEC directive (SAB 121), which mandates banks to include customer crypto assets on their balance sheets.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">SAB 121 has been one of the biggest impediments to institutional adoption of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> and cryptocurrency.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Overturning this rule could simplify the process for institutions to embrace Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>This move, endorsed by the Chamber of Digital Commerce, is viewed as a step towards ensuring the SEC remains within its regulatory boundaries, potentially encouraging greater institutional engagement with digital assets.</p>
<p>Thereby, repealing SAB 121 is seen as a positive step to boost institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) standing at 56 and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 42,915, underscore a potential buying trend above the $42,850 level.</p>
<p>This technical setup suggests that Bitcoin is currently positioned for bullish momentum, provided it remains above this crucial support level.</p>

<p>In the latest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price prediction</a>, BTC has surged to $43,000 amid speculation over Tesla&#8217;s potential sale of its remaining Bitcoin holdings after forgoing $500 million in unrealized profits. Meanwhile, the Salvadoran president reaffirms his steadfast <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> adoption strategy, even as the country approaches its elections.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new report suggests that, against the backdrop of regulatory challenges, the cryptocurrency market continues to thrive in China. Amidst these unfolding narratives, the US Nonfarm Payrolls report looms large, poised to potentially influence investor sentiment and the subsequent price trajectory of Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Standstill; US Nonfarm Payrolls in the Spotlight;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As Bitcoin navigates through market fluctuations, all eyes are on the upcoming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-non-farm-payroll-data-announced-bull-market-starting-soon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data</a>, which could sway the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Analysts forecast the addition of 187K jobs, a dip from the previous 216K, while average hourly earnings are expected to grow by 0.3%, down from 0.4%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160482" style="width: 1074px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160482" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148.jpg" alt="NonFarm Payrolls" width="1074" height="527" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148.jpg 1074w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148-768x377.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148-83x40.jpg 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856493-screenshot_148-150x74.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1074px) 100vw, 1074px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160482" class="wp-caption-text">NonFarm Payrolls &#8211; Source: <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/non-farm-payrolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tradingeconomics.com</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The unemployment rate is projected to tick up slightly to 3.8% from 3.7%. These figures, alongside a slight downtick in consumer sentiment to 78.9, could signal economic headwinds, potentially affecting investor confidence and Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation in the short term.</p>

<h2>Tesla&#8217;s Bitcoin Dilemma: To Sell or Not?</h2>

<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark">
<p>The electric vehicle giant, Tesla, initial $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment in February 2021, when Bitcoin hovered around $37,000, not only boosted the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value but also marked a significant corporate endorsement. However, Tesla&#8217;s decision to offload roughly 10% of its <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.net/entities/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin holdings in March 2021</a>, at prices exceeding $60,000, seemed premature as Bitcoin&#8217;s price soared higher thereafter.</p>
<p>By June 2022, as Bitcoin&#8217;s value dipped below the $20,000 mark, Tesla further reduced its position, selling off a substantial portion of its holdings. Had Tesla maintained its original 43,200 Bitcoin cache, by early 2024, it would have amassed a value of nearly $2 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_160481" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160481" style="width: 1258px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160481" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856399-screenshot_149.jpg" alt="Tesla, Inc Bitcoin Holding" width="1258" height="665" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856399-screenshot_149.jpg 1258w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856399-screenshot_149-300x159.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856399-screenshot_149-1024x541.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856399-screenshot_149-768x406.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706856399-screenshot_149-150x79.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1258px) 100vw, 1258px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160481" class="wp-caption-text">Tesla Inc.

<p>Currently, with 9,720 Bitcoins left, Tesla&#8217;s stake is valued at approximately $400 million. The automotive titan&#8217;s next move in the cryptocurrency market is highly anticipated, as it has the potential to significantly influence Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation.</p>
<p>Whether Tesla will capitalize on the remaining Bitcoins or divest further could set a precedent, impacting investor sentiment and shaping Bitcoin&#8217;s financial narrative in the times ahead.</p>
<h2>El Salvador&#8217;s Unshaken Bitcoin Resolve</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
El Salvador&#8217;s vice president, Félix Ulloa, expressed confidence that if President Nayib Bukele is reelected on February 4, El Salvador will continue to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. The International Monetary Fund recommended that El Salvador reevaluate its Bitcoin rules during loan discussions, but Ulloa declared that El Salvador had no plans to do so. Enthusiasm for Bitcoin adoption has increased with the recent U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

<p>Ulloa stressed that plans pertaining to Bitcoin, such as the tax-free Bitcoin City and the provision of passports to investors who contribute $1 million in Bitcoin, would go on. El Salvador&#8217;s commitment to the national adoption of cryptocurrencies could be strengthened if its Bitcoin plan continues to be implemented, which would have a beneficial effect on BTC prices.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency&#8217;s Resilience in China</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chinese cryptocurrency fans are more likely to make sizable investments in digital assets than their counterparts in Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, according to a Kyros Ventures analysis, despite official limitations.</p>
<p>Over 70% of respondents in the five nations, according to the report based on a poll of 5,268 participants, said that cryptocurrencies made up more than half of their asset portfolios. Remarkably, 33.3% of Chinese investors own a significant stake in stablecoins, placing them second only to Vietnam (58.6%). Despite official limitations, the bulk of Chinese investors continue to favor centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>As China mulls changing its anti-money laundering laws to allow cryptocurrency transactions, there have been notable advancements in Asia&#8217;s cryptocurrency regulatory environment. These patterns might encourage more people in the area to learn about and invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belarusian and Cypriot national has been charged in the US for operating an unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e and money laundering conspiracy, according to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/foreign-national-charged-international-money-laundering-conspiracy-and-role-operation">Department of Justice (DOJ)</a>.</p>
<p>Aliaksandr Klimenka and Alexander Vinnik, allegedly controlled the digital currency exchange BTC-e, with others between 2011 and July 2017.</p>
<p>BTC-e primarily targeted the Russian market but had servers located in the US. The report alleges that the exchange facilitated transactions for cybercriminals globally. BTC-e was allegedly used to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking, fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Currently being held in custody, Klimenka was arrested in Latvia in December 2023 and made an appearance in San Francisco yesterday. If convicted, Klimenka faces a maximum of 25 years in prison.</p>
<p>The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs said it worked very closely with the Latvian government to secure the arrest of Klimenka. Allegedly, Klimenka also controlled technology firm Soft-FX, and the financial firm FX Open.</p>
<p>In May 2023, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/24/politics/alexander-vinnik-lobbies-potential-prisoner-swap/index.html">CNN reported</a> that lawyers for Vinnik, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/russian-bitcoin-extradited-us/index.html">Russian money launderer</a> were actively lobbying for their client to be included in any potential US-Russia prisoner swap for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-indicted-in-u-s-lobbies-for-freedom-through-a-prisoner-swap-8b15b7c8">detained Wall Street Journal</a> reporter <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/europe/evan-gershkovich-appeals-detention-russia-intl/index.html">Evan Gershkovich</a>. Vinnik was extradited from France to California back in 2022.</p>
<h2>No KYC Verification in Place</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“Despite doing substantial business in the United States, BTC-e allegedly was not registered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of Treasury, had no anti-money laundering process, no system for appropriate “<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-kyc-know-your-customer-process-explained.htm">know your customer</a>” or “KYC” verification, and no anti-money laundering program as required by federal law,” said the DOJ in the announcement.</p>
<p>KYC checks in the US crypto industry refer to the process of verifying the identity of customers to ensure compliance with regulations. This typically involves providing personal information such as name, address, and identification documents like a driver&#8217;s license or passport when opening an account on a crypto exchange or platform. KYC helps prevent money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities in the crypto space.</p>
<h2><b>US Cracking Down on Crypto Exchanges </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Lately, the US authorities have been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-cites-terraform-case-in-coinbase-and-binance-rulings.htm">cracking down</a> on illicit activity in cryptocurrency markets, especially exchanges operating in North America that do not follow legal requirements.</p>
<p>Most recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase for offering unregistered securities to customers among other allegations. Coinbase‘s chief legal officer Paul Grewal <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-chief-legal-officer-criticizes-u-s-gao-for-lack-of-analysis-on-cryptocurrency-sanctions-risk.htm">criticized</a> the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) following its recent report describing crypto as a tool for foreign entities to evade sanctions.</p>
<p>Both exchanges are in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC.</p>
<p>There is concern being expressed that the push by U.S. lawmakers for stringent regulations in the cryptocurrency industry is driving business overseas, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-regulatory-approach-pushing-crypto-overseas-new-21shares-report-says.htm">reports</a> Julia Smith from Cryptonews, citing a 2024 market outlook report from ETP provider 21Shares.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange OPNX launched by Three Arrows Capital co-founders has announced it will “officially cease operations and shut down in February 2024.”</p>
<p>The exchange said in an email it will cease all operations on 14 February. OPNX is asking customers to settle positions before 7 February, 8 AM UTC, adding that “after this deadline, any remaining open positions will be automatically settled.”</p>
<p>OPNX is an exchange founded by the founders of failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital founder Su Zhu and co-founder Kyle Davies. OPNX was created for the trading of bankruptcy claims.</p>

<p>The launch of OPNX was headed by CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb. But in October creditors of CoinFLEX, a bankrupt exchange, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/creditors-of-struggling-crypto-exchange-coinflex-sue-ceo-and-seek-funds-from-bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver.htm">sued</a> Lamb and early investor Roger Ver, aka Bitcoin Jesus, alleging a breach of fiduciary duty over the new exchange OPNX launch and unauthorized use of company assets.</p>
<h2><strong>Three Arrows Capital Collapse </strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
During the bull market, the founders were seen as influential figures but following Three Arrows Capital’s collapse they <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/three-arrows-capital-founders-shake-up-crypto-industry-with-new-crypto-exchange-after-acquiring-coinflex-assets-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">faced challenges</a>, especially with their reputation in tatters.</p>
<p>Last year, Zhu and Davies, completed a funding round for OPNX exchange claiming to have raised $25m, but reportedly declined to say who the investors are.</p>
<p>The news that fundraising for the new exchange has been completed was shared in a Twitter thread by a popular community member and DeFi researcher Ignas, who said Kyle Davies had reached out to him and confirmed the news.</p>
<p>Back then, in his Twitter thread, Ignas confirmed that OPNX – or Open Exchange – will acquire all of CoinFLEX’s assets and that this would include “people, tech, and tokens.” He added that FLEX would be the new exchange’s own token.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, it emerged the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defiance-capital-wins-in-lawsuit-against-defunct-crypto-fund-3ac-in-singapore.htm">High Court of Singapore turned down a plea</a> from the now-defunct Three Arrows Capital to dismiss DeFiance Capital’s lawsuit filed against the fund.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2024_SGHC_21">recent hearing</a>, Judge Chua Lee Ming gave greenlight to Defiance Capital in its $140 million dispute with Three Arrows Capital. Further, the court ordered the failed hedge fund to pay SG$15,000 and legal disbursements to DeFiance Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DZ Bank, the second largest bank in Germany, is reportedly planning to begin a retail crypto trading trial this year. Per a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-01/dz-bank-will-pilotphase-fur-bitcoin-handel-dieses-jahr-starten">Bloomberg report</a>, the Frankfurt-based bank aims to make the service available to its over 700 community banks.</p>
<p>“Over the course of the year we will enter the pilot phase for retail trading of cryptocurrencies with the first cooperative banks,” Souad Benkredda, DZ Bank board member responsible for capital market operations, told the publication.</p>
<p>The service is available for private customers who have access to cryptocurrencies independently without seeking financial advice.</p>
<p>Benkredda cited a study from Genoverband that “every second bank wants to offer this solution for their customers.” However, each institute makes the decision independently, she added.</p>
<p>Some of the local banks such as Volksbank Raiffeisenbank Bayern Mitte eG, has been recently expanding options as a part of its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> strategy. On Wednesday, the bank signed a <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1752718077676957890">long-term partnership</a> with Bitcoin energy consulting firm Terahash “to develop new offerings.”</p>
<h2>DZ Bank’s Crypto Venture</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
DZ Bank, which possess $627 billion in assets under management, unveiled a blockchain-based <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/germanys-third-largest-bank-unveils-blockchain-based-digital-custody-platform-for-institutional-investors.htm">digital custody platform</a> last year. The platform is specifically designed to cater to institutional clients, enabling them to engage in cryptocurrency investments, the bank noted.</p>
<p>DZ hinted in November, that it had plans to include crypto purchases for both institutional investors and individual customers.</p>
<p>This comes after DZ’s application for a crypto custody license from the German financial regulator – BaFin – in June 2023. Holger Meffert, head of digital custody at DZ Bank, expressed a positive tone on the future developments of blockchain-based infrastructures.</p>
<p>“We assume that within the next ten years, a significant proportion of capital market business will be processed via distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based infrastructures,” Meffert said at the time. “In the medium term, we see DLT as a complementary technology to the established infrastructures in the existing capital market processes.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore police authority and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore have raised concerns around cryptocurrency draining kits.</p>
<p>In a<a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publications/singcert/2024/joint-advisory---protecting-yourself-from-crypto-drainers.pdf?sfvrsn=cbbe738b_1"> joint statement,</a> the authorities warned that cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging cryptocurrency drainers and targeting owners of digital wallets.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/2) As the use of cryptocurrencies become increasingly popular, cybercriminals are also increasingly leveraging crypto drainers to target owners of cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>&mdash; CSA (@CSAsingapore) <a href="https://twitter.com/CSAsingapore/status/1752528205918179361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>What is a Crypto Drainer?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A crypto drainer is a type of malware targeting digital wallets and works by exploiting any vulnerability. For example, when you send cryptocurrency from one wallet to another, you need to sign the transaction with your private key.</p>
<p>The private key is like a password that allows you to authorise transactions from your wallet. Drainers are often deployed as a phishing attack when the user is tricked into clicking a malicious link.</p>
<p>Although the Singaporean authorities are raising concerns, they add, “While such cases have not been observed in Singapore, members of the public should remain alert to such cyber attacks that are happening globally.”</p>
<p>The authorities warn of other scams which include unsuspecting victims connecting their crypto wallets to a website and then asked to authenticate their accounts using private keys and seed phrases.</p>
<p>Once a connection is made cybercriminals begin infiltrating cryptocurrencies out of the victim&#8217;s wallets. Another popular scam includes airdrops – the distribution of free tokens.</p>
<h2>Drainers and Recent Hacks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In December, cryptocurrency hacking group, Pink Drainer was<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-security-firm-says-pink-drainer-responsible-for-4-4-million-link-exploit.htm"> linked to the recent</a> $4.4 million LINK user drain, increasing the number of their victims to 9,068 with a total of $18.7 million stolen.</p>
<p>Cybercrime, including impersonations, hackings and crypto-jacking in the cryptocurrency sector are common. Just last month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cybersecurity-risks-in-the-cryptocurrency-industry-2.htm">social media account, X was compromised</a> when it posted the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-gary-gensler-says-official-sec-account-is-compromised-whats-going-on.htm">fake spot Bitcoin ETF approval announcement</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Here are the most common risks in the cryptocurrency sector.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> This is when users can be tricked into revealing their private keys or login credentials through phishing emails or websites. This involves the practice of sending fraudulent communication.</p>
<p><strong>Hacks and Cryptocurrency Exchanges:</strong> Cryptocurrency exchanges are often targeted for large-scale thefts. If an exchange is compromised, users’ funds can be at risk.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Applications and Software:</strong> Third-party applications are any applications that aren’t created or supported by the maker of the device the app is installed on. Hackers may find new ways to exploit bugs in third-party software to retrieve sensitive information.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Vulnerabilities:</strong> Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency wallets to steal funds.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Contract Flaws:</strong> Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be exploited to drain funds from decentralized applications (dApps) or blockchains.</p>
<p><strong>Ponzi Schemes:</strong> Fraudulent schemes promising high returns can deceive users into investing their cryptocurrencies, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Manipulating individuals to disclose sensitive information or transfer funds through social engineering tactics is another risk. Social engineering isn’t a direct cyber-attack. It is when actors with bad intentions gain the trust of their targets, so they lower their guard and give up sensitive information.</p>
<p><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Employees or individuals with insider access to sensitive information can misuse their privileges to steal funds or sensitive information.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks:</strong> To mitigate these risks, users and organizations should adopt best practices, such as using hardware wallets, keeping software up-to-date, and conducting thorough due diligence before investing or participating in cryptocurrency transactions.</p>
<p>Setting up 2FA is an important first step for security because it immediately neutralizes the risks associated with compromised passwords.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celsius Network has emerged from bankruptcy and is planning to pay over $3 billion of cryptocurrency and fiat to its creditors.</p>
<p>Part of the bankruptcy plan will include the creation of a new Bitcoin mining company named “Ionic Digital” which will be fully owned by Celsius’ creditors.</p>
<p>Hut 8 Corp. listed on Nasdaq trading under the ticker TSX will manage the mining operations for Ionic Digital. The team has named Matt Prusak, chief commercial officer, of Hut 8, as the CEO of Ionic Digital.</p>
<p>Prusak will work closely with the board of directors. This bankruptcy plan was approved by 98% of Celsius Network’s account holders.</p>
<p>“Today, over 18 months after Celsius paused withdrawals, we began distributing over $3 billion of cryptocurrency, fiat, and stock in Ionic Digital to Celsius creditors,” said Chris Ferraro, plan administrator and former chief restructuring officer, interim CEO and CFO, in a press release.</p>
<h2>Former CEO Released on $40M Bond</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last year, the U.S. District Judge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-pleads-not-guilty-bail-set-at-40-million.htm">set the bail for the former</a> CEO of the Celsius Network, Alex Mashinsky, at $40 million. Back then Mashinsky pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges that he artificially inflated the value of CEL token and misled the customers.</p>
<p>Celsius’ chief revenue officer, Roni Cohen-Pavon, was also charged with artificially inflating the price of the network’s native toke CEL.In January, Mashinsky <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defunct-celsius-ceo-mashinsky-moves-to-sweep-fraud-charges-under-carpet.htm">requested his legal team</a> that the courts dismiss charges relating to commodities fraud and market manipulation.</p>
<p>Giving reasons for this request, the CEO said in the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67604393/united-states-v-mashinsky/">January 12 filing</a> to the court that the commodities fraud charges were “repugnant” and inconsistent with the unclear position the US government has taken on whether crypto assets should be classified as securities or commodities.</p>
<h2>Celsius Wallet Activity Increases</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Analytics teams have noted <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/celsius-wallet-transfers-36m-into-coinbase-and-falconx-platforms-whats-going-on.htm">that there has been increased activity</a> from Celsius wallets.</p>
<p>In January, it was noted by an on-chain analytics blockchain platform Lookonchain that a Celsius wallet was making transfers to crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>Sharing the information on X (formerly Twitter), Lookonchain highlighted that the defunct crypto lending protocol’s wallet deposited 13,000 Ether tokens – equivalent to $30.34 million in fiat currency – to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-slams-us-treasurys-proposed-requirement-for-crypto-platforms-to-report-all-mixing-activities.htm">Coinbase</a> trading platform.</p>
<p>According to Spot on Chain, “In the last 2 days,<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Celsius?src=hashtag_click"> #Celsius</a> further deposited 67,500<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=cashtag_click"> $ETH</a> ($156.5M) to<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Coinbase?src=hashtag_click"> #Coinbase</a> Prime.

<p>Ulloa underlined the government&#8217;s support for cryptocurrencies, noting as evidence the recent approval of Bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

<p>El Salvador, which became the first nation to accept Bitcoin as legal cash in September 2021, intends to move forward with plans to establish Bitcoin-backed bonds and create Bitcoin City.

<h2><strong>Robert Kiyosaki Advocates for Bitcoin as a Safeguard Against Fiscal Misconduct</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Robert Kiyosaki, the well-known author of &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/rich-dad-poor-dad-robert-kiyosaki-cites-bitcoin-as-protection-against-the-theft-of-our" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed that he keeps Bitcoin</a> as insurance against the &#8220;theft of our wealth via our money.&#8221; Kiyosaki accused Wall Street bankers, the government, and the Federal Reserve of stealing money through stock market manipulation, taxation, and inflation.</p>
<p>He expressed mistrust for fiat money and stressed the need to invest in and save Bitcoin as a safety measure. As a frequent critic of the US economy and the USD, Kiyosaki views gold and silver as &#8220;God&#8217;s money&#8221; and Bitcoin as &#8220;people&#8217;s money.&#8221;</p>

<p>He acknowledges that he doesn&#8217;t know a lot about Bitcoin, but he still thinks it&#8217;s valuable and in a previous comment he said it would reach $150,000. His support might lead to a rise in the use of Bitcoin among his fans and the general public.</p>
<h2><strong>US Crypto Mining&#8217;s Energy Consumption Under Scrutiny Amid Bitcoin&#8217;s Surge</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The energy usage of cryptocurrency miners is being subject to an emergency <a href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examination by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</a>, which mandates that they report on their usage for the following six months.</p>
<p>The poll is to comprehend and address the possible increase in cryptocurrency mining activities and its impact on electricity usage, which has been prompted by a recent spike in the price of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the DOE will gather information and feedback from the general public while concentrating on the energy demand development for bitcoin mining, pinpointing regions with rapid expansion, and estimating the sources of electricity.</p>
<p>This action is a component of the U.S. government&#8217;s continuous efforts to control and comprehend the cryptocurrency mining sector, tackling issues related to energy usage and environmental effects. The effect on Bitcoin pricing is contingent upon prospective regulatory measures arising from the review.</p>

<p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $42,186, closely aligning with the current price level. Despite a recent breakout above the upward trendline at approximately $42,185, the formation of a bearish engulfing pattern on the 4-hour timeframe signals a potential shift towards a downtrend for BTC.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall trend for Bitcoin appears bearish below the $42,185 mark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin (BTC) price has dipped back below $43,000 in wake of hawkish comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who on Wednesday commented that he doesn’t think it likely the FOMC will be confident enough to cut US interest rates as soon as March.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Powell: Not Likely Committee Will Be Confident Enough By March to Cut Rates</p>
<p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1752784651951722800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>His comments come after the Fed announced that it had decided to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, as expected.</p>
<p>In its policy announcement, the Fed’s statement said that interest rate cuts won’t come until the Fed has greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably lower.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price was last just under $42,500, down 2.6% in 24 hours as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The downside in the Bitcoin price comes as traders pare back on bets for a Fed rate cut in March.</p>
<p>As per a <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">CME tool</a>, the money market implied probability of a 25 bps cut in March was 35.5%.</p>
<p>That’s down from over 40% on Tuesday and nearly 90% as recently as one month ago.</p>
<p>Bets that the Fed will have cut interest rates by 25 bps by May jumped to 62.9% from under 55% on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, money markets are pricing a roughly 32% chance that the Fed cuts interest rates by 50 bps by May.</p>
<p>That’s roughly unchanged versus one day and one week ago, but is down from over 70% one month ago.</p>
<p>In sum, markets suggest a rate cut is no longer likely in March, but remains a strong bet for May.</p>
<h2><strong>Macro to Remain a Tailwind</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the dip in the Bitcoin price as markets price out a March Fed cut, the macro backdrop is likely to remain a strong tailwind for BTC in 2024, as the Fed will start lowering interest rates and easing financial conditions sooner or later.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-faith-immaculate-disinflation-narrative-put-test-2024-01-31/'">Fed dropped any hints at possibly taking interest rates higher</a> in its latest statement.</p>
<p>That confirms that the question is when and how fast the Fed starts lowering interest rates, not if.</p>
<p>Traders may continue to get caught offside betting on interest rate cuts to come too soon or not soon enough.</p>
<p>And this may continue to trigger volatility in the Bitcoin price, just like that seen on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But easing financial conditions is a widely known positive for cryptocurrencies, just like it is for other asset classes, like stocks, bonds and gold.</p>
<p>Macro tailwinds are one reason why investors will likely continue to buy major dips in the Bitcoin price.</p>
<h2><strong>Plenty of Bullish Narratives For 2024</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
But Bitcoin also has many other narratives to help keep its price underpinned.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/navigating-spot-bitcoin-etfs-in-the-us-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> earlier this month have seen a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gbtc-outflows-topped-2-2-billion-last-week-outweighing-all-spot-bitcoin-etf-gains-coinshares.htm">flood of investment leave GBTC</a>.</p>
<p>But that flood of selling has substantially eased, and new ETFs from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-new-bitcoin-etf-debuts-strong-holding-over-120-million-in-btc.htm">BlackRock</a> and Fidelity are attracting strong demand.</p>
<p>New Bitcoin ETFs look to have added a major new source of demand that is relatively insensitive to price.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">upcoming Bitcoin halving in April</a> will substantially reduce sell pressure from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm">Bitcoin miners</a>.</p>
<p>While there is no exact pattern or playbook that the Bitcoin price follows in the lead-up to and aftermath of a halving event, they have historically come ahead of fresh pumps to record highs.</p>
<p>If history does repeat itself, we could be looking at a Bitcoin price above $100,000 by 2025.</p>
<p>And this doesn’t even go on to mention potential US political and fiscal tailwinds that could support Bitcoin in 2024.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Next for the Bitcoin Price?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Bitcoin price looks set to close out January almost exactly where it started the month.</p>
<p>After a more than 60% pump in the final four months of 2023, that’s not a bad start to the year.</p>
<p>The strong rebound from sub-$40,000 levels suggests the buy-the-dip mentality remains strong.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s very short-term outlook is merky, with the cryptocurrency wedged between its 21 and 50DMAs at $42,000 and $42,850 respectively.</p>
<p>The price also remains stuck just below the 50% retracement back from monthly lows to monthly highs.</p>

<p>Rangebound conditions may prevail in the coming months as traders look ahead to the halving.</p>
<p>Another wild card to watch is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-allow-emergency-bank-lending-program-expire-march-11-2024-01-25/">the end of</a> the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/financial-stability/bank-term-funding-program.htm'">Fed’s March 2023 emergency liquidity program</a> that staved off a bank crisis.</p>
<p>A re-emergent US bank crisis could be another tailwind for the Bitcoin price, just as it was in March 2023.</p>
<p>All said, a trip $10,000 higher to the low $50,000s seems more likely than a $10,000 dip lower to the low $30,000s in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Social media X is abuzz with speculation on whether Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus networks, like Bitcoin, may be banned in the European Union (EU) following the release of a draft assessment by the European Comission and the European Central Bank (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/european-central-bank-official-warns-crypto-entities-to-face-stringent-banking-oversight.htm">ECB</a>).</p>
<p>Daniel Batten, a managing partner at CH4 Capital, shared on his X (formerly Twitter) profile that the ECB and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/esma-unveils-plan-to-address-crypto-risks-ahead-of-mica-regulation-implementation.htm">European Securities and Markets Authority</a> (ESMA) were assigned to craft the report.</p>
<h2><strong>The EU&#8217;s Stance on Bitcoin Energy Consumption</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a screenshot Batten shared, the EU report presents an alarming assessment of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-work.htm">Bitcoin and other PoW blockchain protocols</a>. Suggesting a possible ban on Bitcoin and its mining processes in the region, the analysis highlighted that they are environmentally harmful due to their high energy demands.</p>
<p>The report added that this unsafe mining process could threaten the EU&#8217;s energy security. These recent remarks tie into a 2023 ‘eTender’ submission titled ‘Developing a Methodology and Sustainability Standards for Mitigating Environmental Impacts of Crypto Assets.’</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />While we were sleeping, the European Commission (via ESMA &amp; ECB) has been creating a report which they plan to label bitcoin<br />-environmentally harmful<br />-a threat to EU energy security<br />-a haven for financial criminals</p>
<p>Paving the way for 2025 de facto EU bans on BTC &amp; BTC mining <a href="https://t.co/Zj9er7E4V9">pic.twitter.com/Zj9er7E4V9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) <a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1752487657320726890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The eTender report noted that the surge in crypto asset mining generates adverse economic and social consequences. Additionally, its persistent use could hinder the region&#8217;s sustainability goals in line with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/european-commission-initiates-800000-study-address-cryptos-environmental-impact.htm">Paris Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>Hence, eTender would focus on providing actionable steps to mitigate the impact of cryptocurrency mining and develop specific sustainability standards.</p>
<p>Sharing its expected measures, the EU Commission revealed that it would level a carbon tax on crypto mining. This would be based on the network’s consensus mechanisms and possible environmental impacts. The endgame is to coerce miners to lower their mining activities or stop them completely.</p>
<p>Other measures include granting EU bloc members the authority to &#8216;shut off&#8217; crypto mining for energy security at any time. Bitcoin mining will also be formally labeled as ‘harmful to the environment,’ and the EU will devise means to disincentivize institutional investment in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>According to Batten, Bitcoin is expected to be designated as a ‘haven for financial criminals, &#8216; making it even less appealing to prospective investors.</p>
<h2>Could EU Measures Be Adopted Worldwide?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Batten, the EU&#8217;s crypto asset&#8217;s potential mining ban is not expected to be siloed to the region again. The ESMA and the ECB have reportedly revealed that if the ban is legalized in the EU bloc, they will push for it to be accepted in other regions.</p>
<p>If the bill is enacted, this move could see Bitcoin mining capitals like the US close down publicly listed Bitcoin mining firms like Riot Blockchain.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3/5</p>
<p>I&#39;m not in EU, who cares?</p>
<p>ESMA, who work closely with ECB (Euro Central Bank), has  signalled that once the report is accepted in EU, they will push for it to become the standard in other nations</p>
<p>Like other wars, this war starts in EU but may not end there.</p>
<p>&mdash; Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) <a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1752487662492287073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The outrage surrounding Bitcoin’s mining electricity demands is no novel discourse in the crypto space. The PoW blockchain network reportedly consumes more electricity than a small-sized country.</p>
<p>Industry practitioners and experts have largely supported this view, however, which led to the formation of the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC).</p>
<p>The BMC is focused on transitioning the energy demands of the PoW protocol to a more environmentally friendly option. So far, they have been successful.</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/tj905x0elW">According to a K33 Research</a>, Bitcoin miners power their operations with an estimated 58% renewable energy sources. This is three times higher than the world’s average.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> miners have economic incentives to utilize renewable energy, their sustainable power mix is estimated to be 58% &#8211; almost three times higher than the world average.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Kiyosaki – author of the famous personal finance book <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em> – has come out with another statement in support of Bitcoin (BTC) as a superior money and investment asset compared to traditional stocks.</p>
<p>“Bitcoin is protection against the theft of our wealth via our money,” read a post to X from the author on Wednesday, titled “Why I Own Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>“Fed Chairman Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Wall Street bankers steal our wealth via our money, specifically via inflation, taxation, &amp; stock price manipulation,” he continued.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why I own Bitcoin. Bitcoin is protection against the theft of our wealth via our money. Fed Chairman Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Wall Street bankers steal our wealth via our money, specifically via inflation, taxation, &amp; stock price manipulation.  That is why I save…</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1752487550093320640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Though neither Powell nor Yellen has expressed interest in banning Bitcoin, the former has deemed it a failed currency due to its lack of adoption as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>Other central banks including those of Sweden and the European Union have also disregarded Bitcoin as money because of its price volatility.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank specifically has argued that Bitcoin is “<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/european-central-bank-says-bitcoin-is-rarely-used-for-legal-transactions-this-on-chain-data-suggests-otherwise.htm">rarely used for legal transactions</a>,” (though blockchain data would suggest otherwise).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Bitcoin protocol is renowned for only allowing a maximum supply of 21 million coins, making it impossible to debase the currency through monetary expansion. This has turned it into an “inflation hedge” in the minds of many, with some proponents like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink labeling it as “<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-ceo-praises-bitcoin-for-digitizing-gold-says-btc-could-revolutionize-finance.htm">digital gold</a>.”</p>
<p>Bitcoin also protects against theft in the more explicit sense: if nobody knows your private key, no bank or government can seize or freeze your funds.</p>
<p>Such qualities appeal to an investor of Kiyosaki’s taste. Not only has he long railed against fiat currency debasement, but he has proudly advocated for investors to become rich by using debt to purchase more scarce assets, such as real estate.</p>
<p>“That is why I save and invest in Bitcoin, not stocks, bonds, and fake dollars,” Kiyosaki continued.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Versus Stocks: Michael Saylor</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a video presentation last month, Bitcoin billionaire Michael Saylor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SQBIy5yG-s&amp;ab_channel=LABITCONF">argued</a> that Bitcoin is a superior long-term investment to the S&amp;P500, with greater upside potential and lower long-term risk.</p>
<p>The investor argued that stocks have effectively tracked the monetary inflation rate over the past 20 years because of their relative scarcity compared to dollars. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is even more scarce than stocks.</p>

<p>In the wake of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s latest decision to hold interest rates steady at 5.50%, the financial world turns its gaze to the potential impacts on major cryptocurrencies, notably <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin </a>and <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>This stabilization of the federal funds rate comes amid a backdrop of solid economic expansion, with enduring job strength and a persistently low unemployment rate, albeit amidst ongoing inflation concerns.</p>
<p>As the Fed continues its vigilant approach towards inflation, aiming to anchor it back to a 2% target, the crypto market, known for its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts, could be on the cusp of a new trend.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC/USD pair</a> presents a pivotal moment as it hovers around the key pivot point of $42,864, marked by the green line on the chart. The currency faces immediate resistance at $43,922, with further ceilings at $45,229 and $46,446, which could impede upward movements.</p>
<p>Conversely, support levels at $42,209, $40,810, and $38,822 offer a cushion against price retractions.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 53, hinting at a neutral to slightly bullish momentum without tipping into overbought or oversold conditions.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an upward channel on the 4 hourly timeframe which is likely to support uptrend in Bitcoin. The 50 EMA at $42,209 provides a baseline for the currency&#8217;s resilience.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the trend for Bitcoin appears cautiously optimistic, hinging on its ability to maintain above the pivot point with an eye towards testing the immediate resistances.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum-price-prediction.htm">Ethereum</a> is currently trading at $2,299.7, slightly below its pivot point of $2,308.3, as indicated by the green line.

<p>Supports lie at $2,292.5 and further down at $2,233.0, with a stronger base at $2,166.5. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral at 59, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressures.</p>
<p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lies at $2,300.4, hovering near the pivot point, which could serve as a dynamic support in the short term.</p>

<p>Currently, Ethereum is contained within a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating consolidation and the potential for a breakout. The chart suggests a holding pattern with the potential for a bullish move if Ethereum sustains above the upward trendline and the $2,300 support area.</p>
<p>Buyers may gain confidence for a push towards higher resistance levels if this support holds. Overall, the market posture for Ethereum is cautiously optimistic, with a close eye on the pivotal $2,300 mark to determine the short-term directional bias.</p>

<p>Data compiled by <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bloomberg </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/bitcoin-btc-futures-demand-cools-as-etf-era-closes-gbtc-arb-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reveals</span></a> that open interest in CME Group Bitcoin futures contracts dropped by approximately 24%, reaching 20,679 contracts by January 30th, just three weeks after the introduction of 11 spot ETFs.</p>
<p>CME Bitcoin futures contracts have been popular among investors due to their regulated nature, providing a secure platform for exposure to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>However, now that spot Bitcoin ETFs can fulfill a similar role, investor interest in Bitcoin futures has waned.</p>
<h2>CME Futures Were Used in Arbitrage Activity</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a note to Bloomberg, crypto asset manager DACM said that CME futures were previously used in arbitrage activity involving Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p>
<p>The fund, before being converted into a spot ETF, used to trade at a premium or discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV) due to supply and demand imbalances, the requirement for accredited investors, lock-up periods, market sentiment, and arbitrage opportunities.</p>
<p>When demand for GBTC shares exceeded supply, it led to a premium, while factors like investor sentiment and arbitrage trading could influence its pricing relative to the underlying Bitcoin&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>However, now that the fund has been converted into an ETF, this arbitrage trade has ceased.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Furthermore, Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, suggested that the shift towards ETFs and the cooling of Bitcoin&#8217;s rally could lead to reduced activity in CME Bitcoin futures.</p>
<p>However, he also emphasized that these futures contracts remain crucial in maintaining higher liquidity in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Lunde suggests that they could potentially serve as hedging instruments for authorized participants involved in managing the creation and redemption of ETF shares.</p>
<p>“Due to GBTC’s negative premium, long GBTC and short CME Bitcoin futures is a popular trade,&#8221; said DACM co-founder Richard Galvin, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This trade paid off, causing investors to sell their GBTC shares and The liquidation of CME positions resulted in a decrease in open positions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>SEC Approval of ETFs End Speculations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There has been <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-stabilize-as-sec-approval-of-etfs-ends-speculation-and-reduces-volatility-fineqia.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reduced volatility in the price of Bitcoin</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> following the recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">approval of ETFs by the SEC</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which put an end to speculation surrounding this development, according to Matteo Greco, research analyst at Fineqia International.</span></p>
<p>The introduction of Bitcoin Spot ETFs has attracted significant inflows from traditional finance into the digital assets market, Greco said in a note shared with Cryptonews.com.</p>
<p>He said that since their launch, the 11 Spot ETFs have collectively attracted approximately $1.15 billion in cumulative inflows.</p>
<p>Still, the leading cryptocurrency is <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-heads-towards-fifth-consecutive-monthly-gain-marking-longest-winning-streak-since-pandemic-rally.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">poised to achieve</span></a> its fifth consecutive monthly gain, marking its longest winning streak since the pandemic-induced rally fueled by accommodative monetary policies.</p>
<p>In other words, if Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory by the end of the month, it will achieve its longest streak of monthly gains since the six months spanning October 2020 to March 2021 during which it reached a record high of almost $69,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ETF provider Global X, has pulled its application for a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> ETF, an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2024/34-99445.pdf">SEC filing</a> on Tuesday showed.</p>
<p>The CBOE BZX Exchange submitted a withdrawal notice for the Global X Bitcoin Trust on Jan. 26, around two weeks after the SEC <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-frenzy-begins-as-sec-finally-approves-first-spot-bitcoin-funds-bitcoin-remains-unresponsive.htm">approved 11 other spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>.</p>
<p>Securing approval for these 11 funds was tough. At first, the SEC had concerns about market manipulation, lack of surveillance-sharing agreements, and monitoring Bitcoin spot markets for fraud.</p>
<p>After facing resistance from the SEC in its initial attempt to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, Global X faced further delays upon refiling in Aug. 2023.</p>
<p>Global X missed the final list of potential ETFs due to documentation issues, but it’s not the only one that came up short. Pando Asset Management and 7RCC are also waiting for approval for their spot bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>Global X didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.</p>
<h2>GBTC Outflows are Slowing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The authorized ETFs, including Bitwise, Grayscale, and BlackRock, saw substantial outflows since they opened for trade. These outflows, especially from <a href="https://etfs.grayscale.com/gbtc">GBTC</a>, affected Bitcoin&#8217;s price due to market selling pressure.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that outflows were mainly tied to factors like forced selling related to the FTX estate and profitable investor strategies tied to GBTC&#8217;s discount in the past two years.</p>
<p>But Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart pointed out that the daily outflows from GBTC <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1752117998070976801">fell to $191.7m</a> on Monday. These outflows have been partially balanced by investments flowing into the recently launched spot ETFs.</p>
<h2>Global X’s Bitcoin ETF Withdrawal ‘Not Surprising’</h2>

Seyffart also said that Global X’s withdrawal was unsurprising as “they were out of the race since at least early December but now its official.”</p>
