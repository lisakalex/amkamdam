										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advanced data management solutions within the healthcare sector are becoming increasingly important as organizations realize the need to manage, govern, exchange, and analyze both internal and external datasets.</p>
<p>In addition, providing adequate data protection has become a major concern for healthcare companies. According to <a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/patient-data-breaches-doubled-reaching-87m-in-2023">data from Atlas VPN</a>, 87 million patients in the United States fell victim to data breaches in 2023. This number has more than doubled in comparison to the 37 million patients impacted in 2022.</p>
<h2><b>Blockchain for Data Management</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To solve these challenges, organizations have started to combine blockchains with other technologies to create more efficient data management systems.</p>
<p>Amber Hartley, Chief Strategy Officer at BurstIQ ‚Äì a blockchain-based platform-as-a-service ‚Äì¬† told Cryptonews that the healthcare industry has long relied on traditional data management methods that perpetuate data silos, making it difficult to connect information.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTraditional data management is only designed for internal data,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is not designed for the numerous organizations, vendors, partners, applications, and individuals who own, control, trade, and analyze data in multi-sided data ecosystems.‚Äù</p>
<p>To address this concern, Hartley explained that BurstIQ has combined blockchain technology with machine learning and privacy-enhanced technology to create ‚Äúsmart data.‚Äù Hartley said smart data builds privacy, permissions, history, context, and trust directly into generated data across various sectors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúData privacy is no longer bound to the security of the database it lives in, as privacy and security are embedded within the data itself,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Hartley explained that smart data is stored on BurstIQ‚Äôs data management system, LifeGraph, which is currently used by a number of healthcare organizations.</p>
<p>For example, she noted that The Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing ‚Äì which manages Medicaid data for 1.5 million Coloradans ‚Äì incorporates LifeGraph within their Medicaid Enterprise Solutions Integration platform.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis allows for the management of data quality, unification, governance, and security across the agency‚Äôs numerous vendors, sub-systems, and partners,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>In regards to the role that blockchain plays, Hartley explained that this allows for efficiencies such as data encryption, self-sovereign identity, and privacy-enhanced technology.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBlockchain provides the ability for patients to control their identity and data. When coupled with smart consent contracts, it allows a patient to grant access to some or all of their information,‚Äù she explained, adding that leveraging blockchain enables secure <a href="https://digitalprivacy.ieee.org/publications/topics/what-is-multiparty-computation">multi-party computation (MPC)</a>. ‚ÄúThis means parties can jointly analyze data without revealing their inputs.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Establishing Trust in a Trustless System</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bruce Ahn, Head of Adoption at Partisia Blockchain ‚Äì a platform that enables advanced MPC for public blockchain networks ‚Äì told Cryptonews that MPC essentially enables trust in a trustless system.</p>
<p>He explained that Partisia is also designing a data management solution that uses MPC with private patient healthcare data provided by Verida.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Partisia blockchain is a privacy preserving computation network which needs access to private data,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Verida Wallet and Verida Network provide an on-ramp to provide private user data to the Partisia blockchain, for new types of privacy preserving data processing use cases.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Verida Network is the first self-sovereign database network for storing private data.</p>
<p>The Verida Network is decentralized public infrastructure <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DePIN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DePIN</a> providing secure and private database infrastructure for users to own and control their private data.</p>
<p>2/6</p>
<p>&mdash; Verida <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="üíú" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@Verida_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/Verida_io/status/1742572075087515814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>To put this in perspective, Ahn explained that patients may eventually use the Verida Wallet to claim their healthcare or fitness activity tracking data from multiple third party systems. Verida CEO Chris Were noted that these types of datasets are stored and encrypted on the Verida Network, meaning information is only accessible by the user.</p>
<p>Ahn added that a healthcare research organization could then build an application to request and process verified, anonymous healthcare data for research purposes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this case, the research organization would utilize the Partisia blockchain and Verida developer software development kits to build an application that requests private data from a user‚Äôs Verida Wallet and submits it to a privacy preserving smart contract on the Partisia blockchain,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe smart contract would accept the data of many users and produce a research output of valuable data; all obtained with consent, anonymously and with full data privacy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Although this solution is still underway, Ahn shared that Partisia and Verida have been working closely with healthcare organizations to enable better data analysis while preserving privacy around patient data in a regulatory compliant manner.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith additional regulatory friendly features like Jurisdiction Management that allow for GDPR compliance, and proven use cases, we feel comfortable in users beginning to adopt a new way to share the use of patient data,‚Äù Ahn remarked.</p>
<p>MPC technology may also make it more difficult for hackers to gain unauthorized access to patient data. This is because centralized data storage is removed, as data becomes decentralized across a user base.</p>
<p>According to a Fireblocks <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/what-is-mpc/">blog post</a>, MPC has become one of the primary technologies crypto wallet providers and custodians utilize to secure crypto assets due to its advanced security. However, MPC systems are still hackable, as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fireblocks-uncovers-bitforge-vulnerabilities-posing-threat-major-mpc-wallets.htm">Fireblocks recently identified a set of vulnerabilities</a> known as ‚ÄúBitForge‚Äù that pose a threat to crypto wallets that use MPC technology.</p>
<h2><b>Challenges May Hamper Crypto Adoption</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While it‚Äôs notable that blockchain technology can create efficiencies for healthcare data management systems, a number of challenges may hamper adoption.</p>
<p>For instance, Ahn pointed out that organizations may be hesitant to incorporate blockchain due to privacy concerns. ‚ÄúTraditional blockchain networks provide transparency, which may be concerning,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Given this, Hartley noted that health data should not be stored on public ledgers. Rather, she believes that blockchain for healthcare use cases should be leveraged as part of a broader service stack, providing benefits such as privacy-based capabilities.</p>
<p>Were further mentioned that while the Verida Network uses blockchain technology, it‚Äôs not a blockchain itself. ‚ÄúTherefore, user data is not stored on a blockchain network or in a public domain,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>As Hartley remarked, healthcare firms should understand that blockchain alone will not ensure data privacy or regulatory compliance. She explained that when blockchain is combined with other privacy-enhancing technologies, however, it can offer significant advantages with respect to data privacy and security.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo be considered by healthcare companies, blockchain companies must demonstrate that their technologies can meet the stringent data privacy and security requirements outlined in HIPAA, HITECH, 42 CFR Part 2, and numerous other regulations,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hartley thinks that the fundamental architecture of blockchain implementations makes it very challenging, if not impossible, to meet these standards. Yet she still believes that as technology advances, web3 services such as blockchain will be essential to broader adoption. ‚ÄúSpecifically when unifying digital experiences across a person‚Äôs health journey,‚Äù she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Congress Members introduced bipartisan legislation on Thursday in hopes of overturning the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).</p>
<p>Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Representative Wiley Nickel (D-NC), and Mike Flood (R-NE) have joined forces to introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121">set to challenge SAB 121</a>, which requires banks safeguarding crypto assets to present a corresponding liability on its balance sheets.</p>
<h2>Is The SEC Overstepping Regulatory Authority With SAB 121?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-nickel-and-flood-introduce-joint-resolution-to-overturn-secs-sab-121-rule/">A press release from Senator Lummis‚Äô office</a> stated that SAB 121 has ‚Äúserious implications for consumers and banks by confusing the distinction between customer assets and bank assets, threatening the foundation of essential custody services and increasing bankruptcy risk for consumers.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chair <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GaryGensler</a>‚Äôs SAB 121 has virtually blocked banks from serving as custodians of digital assets.

<p>&mdash; Rep. Mike Flood (@USRepMikeFlood) <a href="https://twitter.com/USRepMikeFlood/status/1753149720518635962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Representative Nickel suggested that the accounting bulletin is just another way the SEC continues ‚Äúto overstep regulatory authority,‚Äù labeling the federal agency‚Äôs regulatory approach on <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/digitalassets/index.htm">digital assets</a> ‚Äúuntenable.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Congress Steps Up Crypto Regulation Efforts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite recent Congressional criticism, this is far from the first time the SEC has faced claims that their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/we-squandered-a-decade-of-opportunities-to-do-our-job-sec-commisioner-says.htm">regulatory stance is unsustainable</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2023, Coinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer and general counsel <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/coinbase-sued-by-sec-over-alleged-unregistered-securities.html">Paul Grewal told CNBC</a> in part that ‚ÄúSEC‚Äôs reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America‚Äôs economic competitiveness.‚Äù</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-regulatory-approach-pushing-crypto-overseas-new-21shares-report-says.htm">recent report from 21Shares</a> stated that regulatory uncertainty is pushing several valuable crypto firms overseas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the face of overreach by a regulator, it is the role of Congress to serve as a check,‚Äù Representative Flood stated. ‚ÄúI am proud to jointly introduce a bipartisan resolution of congressional disapproval with Senator Lummis and Congressman Nickel to fulfill that role.‚Äù</p>
<h2>SEC Chair Gary Gensler Doubles Down</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some players from the banking industry joined their voices in support of Thursday‚Äôs legislative pushback against the SEC.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSAB 121‚Äôs requirement for balance sheet recognition deviates from current accounting treatment for traditional assets held in custody, which are not required to be recorded on a firm‚Äôs balance sheet,‚Äù the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentson Jr. said. ‚ÄúBecause of its impact on bank capital and liquidity ratios, SAB 121 has disincentivized banks from providing custodial services for digital assets.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do not disagree with the need for regulatory oversight,‚Äù Bentson continued, ‚ÄúBut the process should be deliberate and comprehensive to avoid unintended knock-on effects.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/gensler-defends-sec-staff-accounting-bulletin-on-crypto-after-gao-report-deems-it-a-rule/">report from Thomson Reuters</a>, SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently defended SAB 121 at an American Bar Association event in December, claiming it‚Äôs ‚Äújust a staff accounting bulletin‚Äù that ‚Äúbasically addresses whether liabilities should be on a balance sheet.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSAB 121 has massive implications, and the SEC should have received feedback on it from the federal banking regulators and the public before implementing this legally binding directive,‚Äù Senator Lummis said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media influencer Andrew Tate stirred controversy in the crypto space after revealing plans to launch a digital coin with a now-deleted February 2 X post. The social media influencer has since deleted the post, however, stating that it was just a ‚Äújoke.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Andrew Tate&#8217;s $100M Investment to Back Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/andrew-tate-net-worth-crypto-holdings-revealed-billionaire-or-not.htm">Tate initially declared</a> his intention to launch the crypto asset for his 8.7 million followers, saying the new crypto project would be backed with $100 million of his personal funds, and that he does not intend to sell.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Andrew Tate deleted his crypto coin tweet</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For early-bird investors from his University.com team, Tate stated they would be given a discount for buying the crypto asset.</p>
<p>Tate promised to promote the crypto asset everywhere and use his influence as a social media icon to push the price, instructing his followers to retweet at least 50,000 times and the proposal would then become a ‚Äúdone deal.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTop G &#8211; The G stands for crypto. Every single time you tweet at me,‚Äù Tate mentioned in the post.</p>
<p>While the idea gained major traction online with 661,000 views recorded, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Andrew-Tate-one-of-the-most-influential-people-in-human-history">the self-described ‚Äúmost famous man alive‚Äù</a> eventually deleted his post.</p>
<h2>Andrew Tate‚Äôs &#8216;Crypto Scamcoin&#8217;?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tate‚Äôs crypto asset idea has been ridiculed by several industry experts. One such is crypto sleuth and investigator CoffeeZilla, who immediately called Tate‚Äôs proposal a ‚Äúcrypto scamcoin.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Andrew Tate is launching a crypto scamcoin. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>CoffeeZilla went on to post a screenshot of Tate‚Äôs post, where he unequivocally mentioned that he does not endorse <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/5-best-crypto-shitcoins-buy-now-that-andrew-tate-might-endorse-copium-ladys-ai-pepe-sponge.htm">shitcoins</a>. Shitcoins are joke crypto assets that ride on social media appeal and have little utility. Tate then claimed bemusement that the crypto investigator is unable to detect a joke when it&#8217;s made.</p>
<p>Tate is also quoted as saying he has nothing to do with any crypto asset as he does not intend to rob his ‚Äúfans.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Tate‚Äôs relationship with the crypto industry has been one of heated aggression. In a viral post on X, Tate said he was glad that crypto investors lost all their funds during the long, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-winter-will-last-at-least-another-year-says-founder-of-crypto-firm-which-just-laid-off-40-of-its-workforce.htm">drawn-out crypto winter</a> that stretched through much of 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>In a 12-month video, he explicitly mentioned that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHTOCd8ZgkQ">he foresaw an impending bear market</a> that would impact the emerging industry during that timeframe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission instructed cryptocurrency exchange Zipmex to temporarily suspend its digital asset trading and brokerage services beginning February 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.or.th/TH/Pages/News_Detail.aspx?SECID=10520&amp;NewsNo=30&amp;NewsYear=2567&amp;Lang=TH">In a February 1 announcement</a>, the SEC said that Zipmex has been given a 15-day period to fix its financial position and address operational deficiencies.</p>
<h2><strong>Zipmex Suspension Ends Upon Fulfillment of Requirements</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/11/crypto-exchange-zipmex-faces-probe-from-thai-securities-regulator-bloomberg/">SEC had previously directed Zipmex</a> to revise its liquid capital maintenance and management structure on January 12. As of Thursday, however, the SEC was dissatisfied with Zipmex‚Äôs compliance with these requirements.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ah, another temporary suspension of services! Because who needs stable financial markets anyway? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60f.png" alt="üòè" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Thailand?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Thailand</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zipmex?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Zipmex</a></p>
<p>&mdash; MichealDew (@ecmiakcat) <a href="https://twitter.com/ecmiakcat/status/1753463568094155006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Once Zipmex fulfills the requirements set by the regulator, the crypto exchange will be permitted to resume normal operations, the SEC noted. During the suspension of service, Zipmex must also provide customers with the ability to withdraw assets at any time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccording to the process specified by law. If the digital asset business operator is unable to comply with the SEC‚Äôs orders [&#8230;] within the specified period, the SEC may propose that the Minister of Finance consider revoking the order,‚Äù SEC Deputy Secretary General Anek Yuyuen said.<br />
<b></b></p>
<h2><b>Zipmex‚Äôs Regulatory Issues</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Zipmex has already discontinued trading and deposit services, and encouraged its customers to withdraw their assets, according to announcements on its website in <a href="https://zipmex.com/th/en/announcements/company-update-22122023/">December </a>and <a href="https://zipmex.com/th/en/announcements/company-update-28012024/">January</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-02/zipmex-crypto-exchange-to-get-100-million-buyout-from-v-ventures-fund">Zipmex has been under regulatory scrutiny</a> from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since December 2022, following the downturn in the crypto market. The exchange was reportedly under investigation regarding an acquisition by V Ventures and allegations of operating in Thailand without regulatory approval.</p>
<p>In November 2023, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/zipmex-thailand-suspends-crypto-trading-citing-compliance-with-the-countrys-sec-rules.htm">Zipmex suspended trading</a>, citing the move as an effort to comply with regulations. The Singapore-based exchange had filed for debt relief in 2022, allegedly owing customers $97 million.</p>
<p>Following this, Zipmex was reportedly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/zipmex-proposes-repayment-of-3-35-cents-per-dollar-to-creditors-in-latest-restructuring-plan.htm">looking to provide creditors with 3.35 cents per dollar</a> for initial claims as part of its restructuring initiatives. However, major creditors deferred the proposals, seeking a comprehensive examination of the exchange&#8217;s assets and liabilities.</p>

Various projects, including Avalanche, Aptos, The Sandbox, Optimism (OP), and Sui (SUI), are preparing to unlock tokens.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vesting refers to locking digital assets for a predetermined period, preventing early investors from quickly selling their tokens and incentivizing long-term commitment to the project. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Generally, when a new crypto project is launched, it has a vesting period, wherein its tokens remain frozen for a certain period. However, these vesting events can impact the market as token holders gain the ability to transfer or sell their assets.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Avalanche (AVAX), Aptos (APTO) and The Sandbox (SAND) Token Unlock in February</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/avalanche-price-prediction-as-analysts-suggest-avax-nearing-bottom-bull-run-on-the-horizon.htm">Avalanche</a> is set to unlock the largest amount, with 9.5 million tokens expected to be released on February 22. At the current valuation, these tokens are worth approximately $320 million. The tokens are allocated to the Avalanche Foundation, strategic partners, team members, and an airdrop.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Aptos, a Layer-1 blockchain, is set to release 24.8 million crypto tokens on February 11, valued at around $233 million based on current market prices. This release will allocate $180 million in tokens to core contributors and investors, with an additional $39 million allocated for the community and foundation. Previous unlocks on January 12, 2024, and December 12, 2023, led to notable <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/aptos-price-pump-68-to-1377-as-it-prints-all-time-high-too-late-to-buy.htm">price declines</a> of 17.94% and 14.10%, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Sandbox, known for its metaverse project, conducts two token unlocks annually, with the first scheduled for February 14, 2024. The project is set to unlock 205.59 million SAND tokens, constituting 9.19% of the circulating supply. At the current market price, these tokens are valued at $95.47 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The allocation of the unlocked supply will be distributed among three beneficiaries, as company reserves will receive over $40 million worth of tokens. In contrast, the remainder will be distributed to the team and advisers.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Optimism and Sui Vested Token Unlocks in February</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Optimism will join the token release on February 29, unveiling 24 million <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-optimism-op-price-gains-25-as-a-futuristic-meme-coin-attracts-2-7-million.htm">OP</a> tokens with a market value of around $70 million. These tokens will be distributed among core contributors and investors. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-sui-about-to-crash-sui-price-drops-9-as-traders-pile-into-a-new-bitcoin-protocol-what-does-it-do.htm">Sui</a> is set to unlock $53 million in tokens as part of its community access program on February 3.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While releasing these tokens marks a significant event in the crypto space, experts warn of potential repercussions on market prices. Tokenomics suggests that a sudden increase in the circulating supply of a token can exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Various factors influence price action, and market participants will be observing closely to gauge the overall impact on the cryptocurrency market. Investors and analysts will closely monitor the market&#8217;s response to these token releases, anticipating potential volatility and adjusting their strategies accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a separate development, Stride, an interchain liquid staking solution, announced a significant airdrop of 5 million STRD tokens, equivalent to $18 million, to stTIA token holders over the next 150 days.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike traditional airdrops, eligibility for STRD tokens is straightforward‚Äîholders must possess stTIA tokens within the Stride protocol or exchange them on a decentralized exchange (DEX). The airdrop will initially be exclusive to stTIA and held on the Stride blockchain for the first five days, expanding to the Osmosis and Neutron blockchains after February 5 at 5 a.m. ET.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-co-founder-hacked-of-over-112-million-worth-of-xrp.htm">exploit</a>, XRP Ledger developers promptly informed exchanges about the incident and urged them to monitor deposits linked to the explorer&#8217;s wallets closely.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance CEO Richard Teng <a href="https://twitter.com/_RichardTeng/status/1753100751713517903">announced</a> on social media platform X that the exchange had frozen $4.2 million worth of XRP from the exploit that saw $112 million stolen from Larsen&#8217;s wallet on January 31.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ripple is reportedly engaged in discussions with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze the explorer&#8217;s address, and they have also notified law enforcement agencies about the incident.

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ripple Co-founder Chris Larsen&#8217;s XRP Stash Stolen in Security Breach</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The security incident was initially flagged by blockchain investigator ZachXBT on January 31, who discovered 213 million XRP stolen and subsequently distributed across various exchanges. Ripple&#8217;s co-founder and executive chairman, Chris Larsen, clarified that the funds in question were his own. Larsen disclosed unauthorized access to his accounts but did not provide specific details regarding the breach.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, this exploit deviates from typical hacking patterns, as it occurred over an extended period, involving the gradual theft of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-on-chain-data-suggests-ripple-is-hacked-for-100-million-is-xrp-going-to-crash.htm">XRP</a> over approximately 10 hours before being deposited on centralized exchanges like MEXC, Gate.io, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, and HitBTC. The exploiters did not follow the common practice of quickly draining funds and using crypto mixers to obscure their tracks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ZachXBT later <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1752853358602494181?s=20">revealed</a> that the Ripple attribution for the affected account was tagged as Ripple itself in XRP block explorers XRPScan and Bithomp, leading to confusion about the nature of the hack.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While Binance promptly froze some of the stolen funds, other crypto exchanges, including OKX and Kraken, have not disclosed whether they have identified or frozen any funds associated with the hack.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to addressing the security breach, Ripple continues to navigate legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding alleged violations of federal laws in digital asset sales. While certain sections of the lawsuits have been dismissed, the status of institutional sales remains a point of contention in the ongoing legal battle.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong will publish a consultation on a proposed regulatory framework for over-the-counter crypto trading platforms ‚Äúvery soon,‚Äù according to a February 2 blog post.</p>
<p>Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury <a href="https://www.fstb.gov.hk/en/blog/blog020224.htm">Christopher Hui warned the public</a> of the risks of over-the-counter venues, given their accessibility and involvement in fraud cases.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Hong Kong&#8217;s Majority Crypto Fraud Cases Caused by OTC Platforms</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
‚ÄúOTC venues have played a certain role in some of the fraud cases involving some unlicensed VA trading platforms last year, having misled investors to channel funds to these unlicensed platforms,‚Äù Hui wrote. ‚ÄúTherefore, we believe that it is necessary to bring OTC venues under regulation, and we will launch a consultation very soon on the proposed regulatory framework.‚Äù</p>
<p>In June 2023, Hong Kong formally launched its crypto licensing framework for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-asset-exchange-bybit-applies-for-hong-kongs-vatp-license.htm">virtual asset trading platforms</a>, permitting licensed exchanges to provide retail trading services. Two platforms, HashKey and OSL, have received licenses under this regime so far.</p>
<p>The government provided a transition period for virtual asset service providers already operating in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-crypto-project-hong-kong-probe-privacy-concerns.htm">Hong Kong</a> before the licensing system took effect, mandating them to submit license applications by February 29.</p>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will assess whether applicants fulfill the regulatory requirements and had substantial operations in Hong Kong before the initiation of the licensing system.</p>
<p>This evaluation will determine whether existing service providers can be considered as licensed from June 1 this year until a final decision is reached on their license applications.</p>
<p>Hui cautioned that as the deadline nears, the SFC is gearing up for enforcement activities and will intensify publicity initiatives.<br />
<b></b></p>
<h2><b>Stablecoin Issuance Consultation Nears Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In December 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/insight/2023/12/20231227/">stated in a joint consultation paper</a> that a stablecoin issuer would need to acquire a license from the authorities ‚Äúif it issues a stablecoin that references the value of one or more fiat currencies in Hong Kong.‚Äù</p>
<p>The two-month consultation period is scheduled to conclude at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Hui added that the HKMA intends to establish a sandbox for the exploration of stablecoin issuance, which will include collaboration with key industry players in the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New D.C. court filings from January 24 revealed that three people have been charged with stealing more than $400 million worth of digital currency from FTX in a November 2022 FTX SIM-swapping attack.</p>
<h2>A Years-long FTX SIM Swap Scheme</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Robert Powell, Carter Rohn, and Emily Hernandez have all been <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68192231/1/united-states-v-powell/">charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud</a> and conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft for a years-long FTX SIM swapping scheme lasting from March 2021 to April 2023.</p>
<p>SIM swap attacks occur when fraudsters trick a victim‚Äôs cell phone carrier by reassigning a phone number from one device to another, allowing perpetrators to bypass multi-factor authentication and providing them access to vulnerable personal data.</p>
<p>Prosecutors argue the trio‚Äôs goal was ‚Äúto unjustly enrich themselves by targeting victims for SIM swaps, creating fraudulent identification documents in victim names, performing SIM swaps in exchange for money, accessing and stealing victims‚Äô money and data, and concealing the source of the ill-gotten money through multiple concealment techniques.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Unveiling ‚ÄúVictim Company-1‚Äù</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The indictment alleges that the ‚Äúco-conspirators transferred over $400 million in virtual currency‚Äù on or about November 11, 2022, from a corporation labeled as ‚ÄúVictim Company-1‚Äù to virtual wallets under their control.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-01/ftx-s-missing-400-million-stolen-in-sim-swapping-hack-doj-says">newly released Bloomberg report</a>, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed that FTX is indeed ‚ÄúVictim Company-1.‚Äù</p>
<p>FTX formally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11, 2022, after allegations swirled that the company had misappropriated customer funds. The crypto exchange‚Äôs disgraced founder, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-trial-recap-legal-analysis-and-whats-to-come.htm">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, was found guilty on seven different counts of fraud in November 2022 and is facing what could amount to a life sentence in prison.</p>
<h2>Nearly $70 Million Stolen in FTX SIM Swap Attacks in 2021 Alone</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have three US citizens just been implicated in the $477 million FTX heist?<a href="https://t.co/H7odNzlk5H">https://t.co/H7odNzlk5H</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elliptic (@elliptic) <a href="https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1753131574164406776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to recent <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center received over 1,600 complaints of SIM swap attacks constituting more than $68 million of adjusted losses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is not clear whether the three indicted individuals are alleged to have been involved in the theft of the crypto assets and their subsequent laundering, or only in facilitating the initial access to the victim company&#8217;s online accounts,‚Äù <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/three-individuals-implicated-in-the-477-million-ftx-heist">British blockchain analytics firm Elliptic</a> stated in a recent blog post. ‚ÄúIt is therefore not clear whether any of the stolen assets are under their control, and might be recovered.‚Äù</p>
<p>News of the indictment came just one day after the bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-commits-to-full-customer-repayment-scraps-exchange-restart-heres-the-latest.htm">committed to ensuring full repayment</a> for FTX customers.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried is currently scheduled to be sentenced in Manhattan federal court on March 28. FTX and Alameda Research executives charged in the crypto exchange‚Äôs collapse are expected to be sentenced at a later date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fintech firm, Monei has launched trials of the euro-backed stablecoin EURM in Spain in collaboration with major financial institutions in the country.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://monei.com/es/blog/testing-of-eurm-begins/">press release</a>, the company announced the commencement of tests under the supervision of the Bank of Spain‚Äôs Financial Sandbox.</p>
<p>The tests are currently limited to a select number of users with a reduced margin for error as they explore pathways to the digitization of payment in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/european-unions-mica-legislation-its-impact-stablecoin-adoption-lawyers-raise-concerns.htm">compliance with regulations</a>.</p>
<p>The tests will see participants send and receive EURM backed by the Euro which will be deposited in a Spanish financial institution.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe project admitted to the regulatory sandbox, led by the General Secretariat of the Treasury and International Financing, has the Bank of Spain as its supervisory authority. Within the framework of this controlled testing space, a reduced sample of participants has been taken, with a minimized margin of error.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the release, users can easily integrate the asset through their mobile phone number after verifying their identity through a video format KYC process.</p>
<h2>EURM Stablecoin Backed 1:1</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Currently, each user in the trial phase can deposit 10 Euros in the wallet through Bizum and send the assets to other registered users.</p>
<p>All euros deposited are backed 1:1 as there is always the same number of EURM as there are physical euros. Every euro deposited on the platform is stored in Spain&#8217;s financial institutions supervised by the Bank of Spain.</p>
<p>The Monei platform boasts several utilities including seamless and fast transactions in milliseconds to any user with a registered phone number.</p>
<p>The team added that monthly payments can be programmed into smaller fragments while salary payments can be structured according to employee preference.</p>
<p>Alex Saiz Verdaguer, the CEO of Monei views this as a huge leap towards digitalization of payments and the tests, an opportunity to scale current standards.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>‚ÄúEURM proposes an unprecedented innovation and we have in our hands the opportunity to make the management of collections and payments, and the sending of money more secure, programmable, economical, democratic, and liberalized than ever.‚Äù</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Companies can also onboard wallets linked to the EURM to structure payments and other fees with little cost per transaction.</p>
<p>Spain began tests for a Central Bank Digital Currency (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/CBDC/">CBDC</a>) in 2022 with collaboration from local financial institutions.</p>
<p>Studies into the project were meant to cover the movement of funds, use cases of wholesale CBDCs, and the liquidation of assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bank of Spain has also backed research into a possible digital Euro to aid financial inclusion and cross-border payments. Highlighting key areas, the financial regulator stressed offline payments with the asset and privacy concerns that different models may pose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta subsidiary Reality Labs, which focuses on the development of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-the-metaverse.htm">metaverse</a>, recorded a significant operating loss of over $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results-Initiates-Quarterly-Dividend/default.aspx">fourth-quarter report</a>, released on February 1, Meta revealed that Reality Labs reported a loss of $4.65 billion during Q4, while generating nearly $1.1 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>This operating loss marks the largest quarterly loss for Reality Labs since Meta began including the division&#8217;s financials in its reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>In 2023, Reality Labs&#8217; total revenues amounted to just under $1.9 billion, with more than half of the annual revenue generated in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the release of the Meta Quest 3.</p>
<p>The total o<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/earnings-report-zuckerbergs-metaverse-dream-becomes-137-billion-loss-for-meta.htm">perating loss for 2023</a> reached $16.1 billion, representing a 17.5% year-on-year increase from 2022.</p>
<h2>VR Sales Attributed to Strong Reality Labs Performance</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
During an earnings call, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed the revenue performance of Reality Labs to a &#8220;strong holiday season&#8221; for their Quest line of virtual reality (VR) headsets.</p>
<p>He also expressed confidence in the success of their newly released Quest 3, stating that it had a &#8220;strong start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zuckerberg emphasized that artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse were integral to Meta&#8217;s long-term vision, and the company would continue to make significant investments in these areas.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, Mark Zuckerberg gave a masterclass on Meta&#39;a AI Strategy at their latest earnings call. They took some time to wake up but they&#39;re going ALL IN. ¬†<a href="https://t.co/w940nqSGkv">https://t.co/w940nqSGkv</a> <a href="https://t.co/XWKHRVO14t">pic.twitter.com/XWKHRVO14t</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Zuckerberg further highlighted the rapid advancements in the field of AI and expressed his expectation that the next generation of augmented reality (AR), VR, and mixed reality (MR) platforms would provide a realistic sense of presence, serving as the foundation for future social experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;These days, there are a lot of questions about AI that I get, and that field is moving very quickly,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I still expect that this next generation of AR VR and [mixed reality] computing platforms to deliver a realistic sense of presence that will be the foundation for the future of social experiences.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Reality Labs Loss to Increase YoY</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li acknowledged that they anticipate Reality Labs&#8217; losses to increase significantly year-over-year due to ongoing investments in AR and VR product development, as well as efforts to scale their ecosystem.</p>
<p>Despite the operating loss in Reality Labs, Meta&#8217;s overall performance in 2023 was impressive.</p>
<p>The tech giant reported a full-year revenue of $134.9 billion, surpassing estimates from Wall Street research house Zacks and representing a 16% increase from the previous year.</p>
<p>Additionally, Meta announced its intention to issue its first-ever dividend of 50 cents per share on March 26.</p>
<p>The metaverse has been a topic of intense debate in the tech world, with some industry leaders like Bill Gates expressing a tepid outlook.</p>
<p>The gloomy outlook regarding the metaverse is not entirely out of the norm, particularly since many big supporters of the idea have recently backed down from their ambitions.</p>
<p>For one, entertainment giant Disney <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/disney-closes-metaverse-division-50-laid-off-in-company-wide-staff-reduction.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a> last year that it is eliminating its metaverse division as part of broader layoffs that will impact as many as 7,000 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-news/">Blockchain</a> and artificial intelligence (AI) together have the potential to boost each other, making the two fiels more exciting and diverse.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://tensquared.com/research/research-24-02/10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf">new report</a> from TenSquared Capital highlights the ways AI can enhance speed and efficiency in the Web3 arena.</p>
<p>Essentially, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-companies-leverage-ai-despite-ongoing-challenges.htm">AI joining forces with Web3</a> has the potential to tackle tough global issues. It can also automate essential tasks, boost data-driven choices, and amp up trust and transparency for users.</p>
<p>The growth equity firm‚Äôs research team explored specific areas where AI can be applied to make Web3 more structured.</p>
<h2>AI‚Äôs Power in Cross-Language Coding</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AI, particularly tools like ChatGPT and Github Co-Pilot, can significantly influence the crypto industry by simplifying code writing.</p>
<p>These AI tools empower developers to work on various blockchains, even if they are not well-versed in a specific programming language.</p>
<p>For instance, if a developer is proficient in Solidity but needs to code in Rust for Cosmos, they can rely on ChatGPT/Co-Pilot to assist in the translation process, TenSquared‚Äôs report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAI code-writing tools lower the barrier to entry in blockchain and allow developers to write much more quickly,‚Äù they stated.</p>
<p>AI not only speeds up code writing ‚Äî it can also enhance blockchain infrastructure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160489" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160489" style="width: 688px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-160489" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm-300x216.png" alt="AI Web3" width="688" height="495" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm-300x216.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm-768x554.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm-150x108.png 150w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706857494-screenshot-2024-02-02-at-12-29-13-pm.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160489" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TenSquared Capital</figcaption></figure>
<p>The tech can create smart contracts and consensus protocols that make real-time decisions using on-chain data. Furthermore, it can improve Web3 security through AI-based detection systems, ensuring more accurate and efficient smart contract decisions.</p>
<p>A few startups have already embraced this. For example, Oraichain employs AI-powered APIs to establish the groundwork for intelligent smart contracts and advanced decentralized applications (DApps).</p>
<p>Additionally, DApps can use on-chain AI for data analysis and automation.</p>
<p>Experts predict AI agents will use crypto for most payments, as large language models (LLMs) can handle transactions via crypto wallets and interact with smart contracts and DeFi protocols effectively.</p>
<h2>Boosting Web3 Security</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Researchers and startups are already diving into AI-based consensus methods, which are key for keeping blockchains safe and scalable.</p>
<p>Take Velas, for example, which is developing an AI Delegated Proof-of-Stake system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Inery is working on a way to validate blocks more efficiently based on uptime.</p>
<p>AI also plays a role in beefing up Web3 security, helping to fend off cyberattacks and shore up blockchain defenses. It&#8217;s a big deal because security is a major roadblock for users getting into crypto.</p>
<p>Just in January, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-lost-127m-to-hackers-in-january-2024-more-crypto-news.htm">Web3 took a $127m hit</a> from hackers across 19 different incidents. And last year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-korea-hackers-illicit-gains-dwindled-in-2023-despite-more-attacks-chainalysis.htm">cyber fraud groups made off with over $1b</a> from the crypto industry, according to Chainalysis.</p>
<h2>AI in Credit Scoring</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AI can reshape decentralized finance (DeFi) by using historical lending data to create credit scores and improve loan decisions. For instance, Spectral&#8217;s MACRO Score is an on-chain credit score powered by advanced machine learning for DeFi lending.</p>
<p>Through trading bots and predictive analytics, AI can enable traders to enhance their decision-making and profit from market trends. Platforms like 3Commas offer crypto trading bots for automated strategies.</p>
<h2>Interactive Gaming</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Generative AI can personalize gaming stories and characters. For example, Inworld AI creates AI NPCs, making games like WebKinz more immersive. ASM, part of Futureverse, develops a platform for user interaction with AI Agents in gaming worlds.</p>
<p>AI can also enhance NFT platforms and Web3 social networks by delivering personalized content and relevant product recommendations to users.</p>
<p>However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently warned that the toughest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-discusses-challenges-between-crypto-and-ai-warns-tread-carefully.htm">challenge in crypto and AI integration</a> is creating a single, decentralized AI trusted by other applications.</p>

<p>The event was attended by nearly a thousand people and marked by the presence of officials from both nations, including Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister of the UAE Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and the Chinese Ambassador to the UAE Zhang Yiming.</p>
<p>During the celebration, Mansour invited Zhang to jointly initiate the cross-border payment and launch the m-CBDC Bridge, making the first real-time transaction since the Bridge‚Äôs phase one pilot in 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bank of China&#8217;s UAE institution also utilized the platform to successfully complete the first digital yuan cross-border remittance transaction.</p>
<h2>Project mBridge for Multi-CBDC Cross-Border Transactions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm">Project mBridge</a> is a multi-national digital currency platform initiated by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/project-atlas-bank-for-international-settlements-tackles-crypto-tracking-with-eu-central-banks-heres-latest.htm">Bank for International Settlements</a>. The founding central banks include Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, Digital Currency Institute of the People&#8217;s Bank of China and Bank of Thailand.</p>
<p>The introduction of multi-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) arrangements aimed to revolutionize the existing framework for cross-border transactions. The mBridge platform, underpinned by the mBridge Ledger, was particularly geared towards enhancing the efficiency of international trades.</p>
<h2>Digital Yuan Remittances Set for Expansion in Hong Kong</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/money/20240202/e67e60cc9d1a41f998d0000cfe3dcc6b/c.html">recent report</a> by Xinhua unveiled that a collaboration between the Digital Currency Research Institute of the People&#8217;s Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is set to enhance the digital yuan&#8217;s cross-border capabilities, focusing on small-scale remittances between Mainland China and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-crypto-project-hong-kong-probe-privacy-concerns.htm">Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>Initiated in late 2020, the pilot has facilitated digital yuan exchanges and payments across the regions. With preparations nearly complete, the next phase will see more institutions in Hong Kong offering these services.</p>
<p>Key developments include simplifying the process for Hong Kong residents to use digital yuan wallets and introducing cross-border remittances to improve transaction efficiency.</p>
<p>Additionally, efforts are underway to integrate digital yuan with Hong Kong&#8217;s payment systems, aiming to expand merchant acceptance and streamline cross-border e-commerce and educational payments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea‚Äôs <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-crypto-drug-dealing-teens-jailed.htm">crypto-powered drug trading epidemic</a> is seeing the country become ‚Äúpolluted‚Äù with dead-dropped narcotics, a new report has claimed.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&amp;entry_id=466670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilyo Shinmun</a>, a 59-year-old man who was arrested for drug offenses told police that he had not bought the narcotics he was caught taking.</p>
<p>Instead, the man claimed that he found the drugs ‚Äì methamphetamine and cannabis ‚Äì hidden on a hill in Gangwon Province.</p>
<p>Police officers have yet to authenticate the veracity or otherwise of his claim. But, the media outlet noted, the claims are not implausible.</p>
<p>This is especially true when considering the recent sharp uptick in crypto-related drug criminals who use public spaces to dead drop narcotics.</p>
<h2>South Korea Wages ‚ÄòWar‚Äô on Crypto-powered Drug Crimewave</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
President Yoon Seok-yeol has claimed that the country <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/s-korean-president-calls-for-war-on-crypto-powered-drug-trafficking.htm">is now at war</a> with crypto-powered drug traders.</p>
<p>Using Telegram as a communication platform and cryptoassets as a payment tool, teenagers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-police-arrest-girl-aged-14-for-buying-crystal-meth-with-crypto.htm">as young as 14</a> are buying and selling narcotics online.</p>
<p>Dealers offer ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù in the neighborhood of the buyer‚Äôs choosing. Buyers then transfer crypto to the dealers‚Äô wallets.</p>
<p>And a few hours later, police say, dealers contact buyers to explain where their drugs are hidden.</p>
<p>Typically, the report‚Äôs authors explained, dealers choose public areas such as apartment complexes.</p>
<p>And they often choose to leave drugs in mailboxes, electricity, water, and gas meters, or drainpipes.</p>
<p>Other popular spots include ‚Äúhospital restrooms, public parking lots, under store signboards, basement window frames, electrical wiring, and behind doorknobs in public spaces.‚Äù</p>

<h2>Police Concerned as Crypto-powered Drug Epidemic Intensifies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The media outlet gave the example of a recent case in Daejeon‚Äôs Eastern District. Here, a resident called the police when they spotted ‚Äúa stranger searching several mailboxes‚Äù in their apartment.</p>
<p>Officers arrived at the scene and discovered that the person in question was a drug buyer, and later found ‚Äú30 doses of drugs wrapped in black tape inside one of the mailboxes.‚Äù</p>
<figure id="attachment_160227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160227" style="width: 1842px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160227" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802637-apt.png" alt="A bank of South Korean apartment complex mailboxes." width="1842" height="735" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802637-apt.png 1842w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802637-apt-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802637-apt-1024x409.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802637-apt-768x306.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802637-apt-1536x613.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802637-apt-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1842px) 100vw, 1842px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160227" class="wp-caption-text">A bank of South Korean apartment complex mailboxes. (Source: MBN/YouTube/Screenshot)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In another case reported on January 12, a citizen in Seoul came to a police station in the Jungnang District to explain that they had found what looked like a lost ‚Äúcoin purse.‚Äù</p>
<p>After opening the wallet, the citizen said they had found a bag with a ‚Äústrange powder inside.‚Äù</p>
<p>Officers recognized that the powder was methamphetamine. They used CCTV footage to identify the wallet‚Äôs owner, and found this individual with ‚Äúbags containing more‚Äù of the substance in their pockets.</p>
<p>The report‚Äôs author warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúNowadays, we live in a world where you can even find drugs in a wallet you find at the side of the road. If you just [&#8230;] pick it up and then leave it on the side of the road because something doesn‚Äôt feel right, you could find yourself the subject of a drug-related investigation.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Police officers have also complained that drug dealers are using ‚Äúflower beds outside buildings, gas meter boxes, outdoor air conditioning units, and electric poles‚Äù as hiding spots.</p>
<p>Officers added that ‚Äúpoorly maintained buildings‚Äù used to be ‚Äúfrequent trading spots.‚Äù But they conceded that ‚Äúnow, almost all everyday spaces are a drug distribution route.‚Äù</p>
<p>Investigators claimed that in some instances, drugs had been hidden ‚Äúon the same street as major courthouses‚Äù or ‚Äúoutside elementary schools.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Crypto-powered Drug Dealers ‚ÄòInfiltrate the Military‚Äô</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Armed forces spokespeople added that an increasing number of military personnel have been caught buying and selling drugs using crypto.</p>
<p>In some instances, dealers snuck into army bases and other military facilities to leave bags of drugs for serving conscripts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160226" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160226" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160226" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802541-2011.jpg" alt="South Korean conscripts during a military training exercise." width="640" height="426" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802541-2011.jpg 640w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802541-2011-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706802541-2011-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160226" class="wp-caption-text">South Korean conscripts during a military training exercise.

<p>Courts have responded with increasingly heavy sentences. Earlier this month a convicted crypto-powered drug dealer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-crypto-drug-dealer-jailed-for-7-years.htm">was jailed for seven years in Busan.</a>¬†An accomplice received a 2.5-year jail term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An airdrop farmer has made over $1 million in Jupiter tokens after creating nearly 10,000 Solana wallet addresses, according to a February 1 X post.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1753016097941680638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1753016097941680638%7Ctwgr%5E23c4f4a634edac312909354beaaeb740a0d29e4c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcrypto.news%2Fjupiter-airdrop-farmer-earns-1-1m-using-thousands-of-wallets%2F">Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain revealed</a> that the airdrop farmer had received 1.85 million Jupiter tokens through 9,246 wallets.</p>
<h2>Airdrop Farmer Creates 1% of All Eligible Wallets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Following the airdrop, a portion of the received tokens, valued at over $1 million even after a 69% price decline, was sold on the Jupiter platform to generate profits.</p>
<p>The user deposited approximately $77,000 in airdropped tokens on both Bybit and Mexc. According to Lookonchain, the airdrop farmer possessed 319,000 JUP, which were valued at $196,000 on-chain. This individual represents roughly 1% of the eligible wallets for Jupiter‚Äôs airdrop.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The revelation has generated controversy on X, with many users speculating that the farmer was an insider.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe is someone from the company of course,‚Äù commented user @Anseriin. ‚ÄúHe knew what to do and when. It&#8217;s always the same pattern.‚Äù</p>
<h2><strong>WEN and JUP Airdrops</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jupiter-price-prediction-as-solana-airdrop-creates-a-new-crypto-unicorn-how-to-check-jup-eligibility.htm">Jupiter has rapidly gained popularity</a> as one of the leading Solana DeFi protocols, especially after the recent launch of its decentralized exchange and two consecutive token distributions.</p>
<p>Jupiter users initially received the WEN memecoin as a nod to crypto culture and the creator of JUP, Weremeow. This token was inspired by a fractionalized NFT poem, serving as a stress test for an upcoming airdrop.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-based-jupiter-to-distribute-1-billion-jup-tokens-in-upcoming-airdrop.htm">Jupiter then began distributing</a> its native token, JUP. This initiative allocated $700 million in tokens to early supporters and users of the Solana DEX. The launch faced controversy, however, particularly regarding a seven-day period during which Weremeow and his team could sell 2.5% of JUP‚Äôs 10 billion token supply, but only if the price remained above 70 cents.</p>
<p>This approach raised concerns among users and airdrop recipients, who feared a potential major sell-off could undermine confidence in the project.</p>
<p>Jupiter‚Äôs native token is currently trading at $0.00584, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/jupiter/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polygon blockchain developer Polygon Labs has cut 19% off its workforce, according to a blog post published by CEO Marc Boiron on Thursday.</p>
<h2>Polygon Labs Lays Off 60 Employees</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://forum.polygon.technology/t/an-update-on-polygon-labs-polygon-ventures-and-polygon-id/13507">Boiron called the decision</a> ‚Äúdifficult, but necessary‚Äù to ensure the team‚Äôs ‚Äúextreme focus, diligence, efficiency and agility.‚Äù</p>
<p>He claimed the company‚Äôs ‚Äúrapid growth‚Äù due to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-network-records-robust-user-activity-amid-broader-crypto-market-weakness-in-q3-2023-report.htm">most recent bull market</a> ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù the aforementioned qualities, prompting Polygon Labs to cut a total of 60 people on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-sizing for the sake of enhanced performance, rather than for financial reasons, may seem unconventional,‚Äù Boiron said. ‚ÄúThe reality is that achieving our mission often demands challenging decisions, and while difficult, the Founders and I agree that we must move forward in a thoughtful way that gives us the greatest chance to execute successfully.‚Äù</p>
<h2>A Series of Shakeups</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
News of Thursday‚Äôs layoffs parallels those Polygon Labs made nearly one year ago when <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/consolidating-teams-within-polygon-labs">the company laid off¬† 20% of its employees</a>.</p>
<p>The company was faced with another shakeup in July 2023 when former Polygon Labs president <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/07/polygon-labs-promotes-boiron-to-ceo-president-wyatt-to-depart/">Ryan Wyatt stepped down from his position</a>. Boiron, who took over the role shortly after, previously served as chief legal officer for Polygon Labs as well as the decentralized exchange dYdX.</p>
<p>Despite the company‚Äôs most recent layoffs, remaining employees will receive a 15% increase in their compensation. Those laid off are set to receive two months of severance and health benefits.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo move as ambitiously and nimbly as possible where everyone is able to take ownership of what they‚Äôre doing, we must create an efficient surgical team, with significantly less bureaucracy,‚Äù Boiron said. ‚ÄúAs a smaller team, we can collaborate more, expedite demanding projects, and execute at our highest potential.‚Äù</p>
<h2>‚ÄúGetting Back to Polygon Labs‚Äô ‚ÄòUnderdog‚Äô Roots‚Äù</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Saying goodbye to friends and colleagues is always very painful, but this was a necessary step to take Polygon Labs back to its &#39;underdog&#39; roots. This makes us lighter, nimbler and more mission focused.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In addition to cutting members of the team, Boiron announced Polygon ID will spin off into its own separate entity of 33 employees.</p>

<p>On January 31, popular crypto lawyer James Murphy exposed subtle anti-crypto moves by the US Federal Reserve against crypto custody firm Custodia Bank.</p>
<h2>‚ÄòMaster Account‚Äô Approval Takes Forever</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), James ‚ÄúMetaLawMan‚Äù Murphy revealed a perceived coordinated anti-crypto effort by US government agencies, stirring concerns in the crypto community.</p>
<p>According to the renowned crypto lawyer, the US <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-announces-increased-oversight-of-cryptocurrencies-2024-fiscal-plan.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has not been the only entity taking legal action against crypto-backed businesses. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/federal-reserve-establishes-program-monitor-crypto-activities-us-banks.htm">Federal Reserve</a> has also been involved in what MetaLawMan described as ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It‚Äôs not just the SEC.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve leads the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 crackdown on crypto.</p>
<p>Custodia Bank <a href="https://twitter.com/custodiabank?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@custodiabank</a> has sued the Fed because it failed to approved Custodia&#39;s application for a Fed &quot;master account.&quot;</p>
<p>A Fed &quot;master account&quot; is essentially a bank account‚Ä¶</p>
<p>&mdash; MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1752722655881441651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>To substantiate his claims, the blockchain lawyer cited the ongoing issue between digital asset payment and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/custodia-bank-launches-bitcoin-custody-service-for-businesses.htm">custody solutions</a> firm Custodia Bank and the Feds.</p>
<p>In a twist of events, Custodia Bank sued the Federal Reserve for failing to approve its ‚Äòmaster account‚Äô application despite a thorough cross-examination by the Kansas branch of the apex bank.</p>
<p>From its position as a Wyoming-chartered depository institution, Custodia Bank met the qualifications to operate a &#8216;master account&#8217; under federal laws.</p>
<p>A ‚Äòmaster account‚Äô is a bank account for financial firms that enables them to use the Federal Reserve System for check clearing, wire transfers, and automated clearing house (ACH) payments.</p>
<p>By design, the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/other20220815a1.pdf">master account</a> approval takes roughly 5 to 7 business days and is often given to federal or state-chartered depository institutions.</p>
<p>However, Custodia Bank&#8217;s application faced prolonged uncertainty for 20 months. It was subsequently denied eight months after the crypto custody firm filed its case in court.</p>
<p>MetaLawMan noted that the US SEC employed a similar strategy in its rulemaking <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arguments-conclude-in-coinbase-and-sec-case-judge-failla-holds-on-decision.htm">petition against Coinbase</a>.</p>
<h2>All Was Rosy Before Federal Reserve‚Äôs Denial</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Operation Chokepoint 2.0 seems novel to many, but it&#8217;s a term used to describe organized attempts by top financial bodies to undermine the integrity and adoption of digital assets in the US.</p>
<p>This is certainly the case regarding Custodia Bank, as the crypto-focused financial service firm reportedly got stellar reviews from the Kansas branch of the Feds.</p>
<p>In a shared report, Kansas City stated that the capital requirements for a master account application were ‚Äúadequate.‚Äù The risk management was found to have ‚Äústrong risk management practices,‚Äù and the management experience was impressive and ‚Äúextensive.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúJudge Scott Skavdahl of the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming said he likely would not dismiss the lawsuit Custodia Bank filed against the Fed board and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City earlier this year.‚Äù 1/3 <a href="https://t.co/9E72a5iYnt">https://t.co/9E72a5iYnt</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Julie A. Hill (@ProfJulieHill) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfJulieHill/status/1586158996708560896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the subsequent report from the DC branch presented a contrasting view.</p>
<p>The Feds expressed a need for a robust capital requirement framework and acknowledged existing risk management gaps.</p>
<p>In addition to insufficient liquidity, the report highlighted that the management team lacked the relevant banking experience to qualify for a master account.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has tried persuading the courts to dismiss the case. In a ruling in the US District Court for the District of Wyoming, Judge Scott Skavdahl said he would not approve the motion.</p>
<p>He stated that the lengthy approval timeframe was unexpected and should have taken less time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The push by U.S. lawmakers for stringent regulations in the crypto industry is driving business overseas, a 2024 market outlook report released on January 28 from ETP provider 21Shares revealed.</p>
<h2>The U.S. Desperately Needs Regulatory Clarity</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://21shares.com/research/state-of-crypto-11">21Shares&#8217; State of Crypto report</a> claims regularity unclarity has ‚Äúresulted in offshore exchanges retaining the majority of spot and futures trading volume in recent years.‚Äù</p>
<p>The report cited criticism of the United State&#8217;s crypto regulatory approach previously made by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/coinbase-sued-by-sec-over-alleged-unregistered-securities.html">Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal</a>, who described the country‚Äôs strategy as an ‚Äúenforcement-only approach that has only increased consumer risk and driven customers and innovation out of the country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Grewal‚Äôs take echoes a similar statement made earlier this year by Coinbase CEO <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/coinbase-ceo-crypto-firms-will-develop-offshore-without-clear-regulations-2023-04-18/">Brian Armstrong at an Innovate Finance conference</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the reason why we need clarity about legislation and regulation onshore because if the UK doesn&#8217;t have this, if the U.S. doesn&#8217;t have this, these firms are going to be built in offshore havens,&#8221; Armstrong said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are excited to announce the release of the 11th edition of the State of Crypto magazine! This edition provides an in-depth look at the market outlook for 2024, a pivotal year for Bitcoin with the anticipated halving event. With Bitcoin fundamentals stronger than ever and the‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/4YKOdMJMmn">pic.twitter.com/4YKOdMJMmn</a></p>
<p>&mdash; 21Shares (@21Shares) <a href="https://twitter.com/21Shares/status/1752957246227808349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Crypto Competition Arises in Light of the U.S. Regulatory Approach</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Due to the U.S. exit of Coinbase‚Äôs competitor, Binance, the report estimates that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchange platform</a> ‚Äúmay gain further legitimacy in the U.S. and consolidate as the leading exchange despite having an active lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are seeing increasing jurisdictional competition in the global race for crypto talent, with the U.K. and Hong Kong as primary examples,‚Äù 21Shares&#8217; report reads. ‚ÄúThe main question going into 2024 is if regulators in the largest market in the world, the U.S., will finally provide the regulatory clarity entrepreneurs and consumers desperately need.‚Äù</p>
<p>Most recent estimates from Blockchain data analysis firm <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/north-america-cryptocurrency-adoption/">Chainalysis¬†rank the North American crypto market</a> as the largest globally, with $1.2 trillion in on-chain value‚Äîmost of which comes from the United States.</p>
<h2>The U.K. May Become a Crypto Epicenter</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the size of the U.S. crypto market, the 21Shares&#8217; 2024 market outlook report suggests the United Kingdom may take its place <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/golden-opportunity-exists-for-uk-become-global-leader-crypto.htm">as a leading crypto hub</a>, noting that the ‚ÄúU.K. may be able to meaningfully attract crypto businesses in 2024.‚Äù</p>
<p>The report cites statements made by Andrew Griffith, former economic secretary to the Treasury, who promised in November 2023 that ‚Äúthe government‚Äôs ambition to make the U.K. a global hub for cryptoasset technologies remains steadfast.‚Äù</p>
<p>So far, several crypto firms are already <a href="https://www.ccn.com/crypto-register-fca-uk-list-approved-firms/">operating within the U.K.</a>, including Kraken, BitStamp, Gemini, and more.</p>

<p>Renowned crypto influencer BitBoy, real name Ben Armstrong, has announced the end of his daily crypto show on January 31.</p>
<h2>Cash Crunch and Legal Battles Prompt Closure</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a surprising turn of events, BitBoy bid farewell to his three-year daily crypto show. Revealed on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0dZ5K0CmQ">YouTube channel</a>, BitBoy attributed the decision to financial challenges.</p>

<p>According to him, his financial struggles have been further aggravated by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ben-bitboy-crypto-fired-from-his-own-company-in-coup-whats-going-on.htm">his ongoing legal battles</a>, which have seen him spend considerable time pleading his case in court.</p>
<p>Providing more details, BitBoy revealed that he spends as much as $25,000 weekly to create and publish his daily shows. A further $100,000 is channeled towards covering his legal fees. According to him, he has lost everything.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>BitBoy‚Äôs legal issues started in mid-2023 when he created his crypto asset, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-influencer-ben-bitboy-crypto-armstrong-launches-ben-token.htm">$BEN coin</a>. Following the launch of the digital asset, the BitBoy Crypto brand did not endorse the idea.</p>
<p>In an announcement on X, BitBoy Crypto‚Äôs parent company, BJ Investment Holdings, stated that it would take legal action against Armstrong. Consequently, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ben-bitboy-crypto-fired-from-his-own-company-in-coup-whats-going-on.htm">the crypto influencer was ousted</a> from the entire BitBoy Crypto franchise business.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday, BJ Investment Holdings, the parent company of Hit network, took decisive legal action in removing Ben Armstrong from the company, and specifically the Bitboy Crypto brand.  <a href="https://t.co/e0kYLKUZ4r">https://t.co/e0kYLKUZ4r</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In response, Armstrong filed a counter-lawsuit, but the tide of events remained irreversible. Since then, the YouTuber has reported an onslaught of legal battles emerging from everyone and everywhere.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre barely making it out here, guys. We‚Äôve got lawyers coming at me from every angle. Everyone I know is coming after me right now,‚Äù Armstrong explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0dZ5K0CmQ">in his closing YouTube presentation</a>.</p>
<p>Reminiscing with his 60,000 followers on X, Armstrong said he would likely miss them after his daily show ended.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My daily crypto livestream has been my life.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Followers Rally Around BitBoy</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Armstrong rose to prominence in 2021, captivating crypto enthusiasts with his daily insights on digital assets. Covering digital asset fundamentals, price predictions, and Web3 investment opportunities, his YouTube channel amassed more than 91,000 followers in the subsequent years.</p>
<p>Following his announcement, his YouTube subscribers gave him moral support. One stated that his show served as a treasure trove of information, allowing would-be investors to get first-hand knowledge since 2021. Many of his subscribers are rooting for him to make a possible comeback.</p>
<p>While the atmosphere is largely positive, Armstrong has not hinted at any possible comeback on his YouTube show and X handle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Derivatives trading protocol Aevo has announced that it is set to launch its native Aevo token.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://aevo.mirror.xyz/Rx6gZ6o7oJukpTIl3UrJTrfKS2zwcpCwVlyHgfmdfBk">announcement</a> published on January 31, the project revealed that it plans to distribute a portion of the supply to early adopters through an Aevo token airdrop.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, we are pleased to announce more details about <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AEVO&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$AEVO</a>, Aevo&#39;s first Farming Program, and Aevo Airdrop. <a href="https://t.co/loG8V2ZAya">pic.twitter.com/loG8V2ZAya</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Aevo (@aevoxyz) <a href="https://twitter.com/aevoxyz/status/1752809496928473233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The protocol is also set to launch a ‚Äúfarming program‚Äù in the next few days, with rewards from the program being distributed in the form of Aevo tokens.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will be airdropping Aevo to early adopters of the Aevo exchange and will be launching our first farming program over the coming weeks,‚Äù the announcement read. ‚ÄúTo be clear, all users of Aevo up to this point who have done volume will be eligible for Aevo.‚Äù</p>
<h2><strong>Aevo Token Airdrop Comes With Farming Program</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The primary criteria for the Farming Program will revolve around volumes, fees, and loyalty exhibited on the platform, with loyalty being based on how much a user uses Aevo.</p>
<p>There will also be a ‚ÄúFarming Boost‚Äù which will act as a multiplier on the rewards earned. This multiplier is influenced by the aforementioned criteria as well.</p>
<p>Upon the conclusion of the Farming Program, every user on Aevo Exchange will have the opportunity to claim the amount of Aevo tokens they earned during this period, in addition to any previously accrued earnings. The DAO will also provide initial liquidity for the Aevo token.</p>
<p>The team is currently conducting audits for both the Aevo token contract and a conversion smart contract between its token and Ribbon Finance‚Äôs native token. As a result of delays in meeting the initial deadlines, there is a proposal to shorten the conversion window for the $RBN &#8211; $AEVO conversion contract. However, this adjustment is still subject to approval through a governance proposal.<br />
<b></b></p>
<h2><b>Aevo and Ribbon Finance</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Aevo was originally part of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/abracadabra-money-in-crisis-as-6-5-million-crypto-theft-sends-shockwaves-across-defi-community.htm">DeFi</a> project Ribbon Finance up until June 2023, when Ribbon DAO holders voted in favor of folding Ribbon Finance into Aevo.</p>
<p>Aevo utilizes a Layer 2 optimistic rollup constructed with the Conduit rollup platform. It intends to leverage Celestia for data availability, ensuring low transaction fees and creating opportunities for other protocols to establish their presence.</p>
<p>In 2022, Ribbon Finance gained prominence as a significant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-stop-criminals-from-exploiting-defi-according-to-polygon-labs.htm">DeFi</a> protocol, particularly in the decentralized options market. Aevo was developed as an extension of Ribbon Finance, with a primary focus on scaling decentralized options through its proprietary Layer 2 appchain. Initially featuring options, Aevo later expanded its offerings to include perpetuals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital asset exchange Bybit has applied for a Virtual Asset Trading Operator (VATP) license in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The exchange <a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/Virtual-assets/Virtual-asset-trading-platforms-operators/Lists-of-virtual-asset-trading-platforms">filed the application</a> to Hong Kong‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission (SFC) through Spark Fintech Limited according to the regulator‚Äôs website.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SFC official website shows that Bybit has applied for a Hong Kong virtual asset trading platform license on January 31, 2024. The trading platform is called Spark Fintech Limited. There are currently 14 companies on the applicant list. <a href="https://t.co/XZhHM7FgU3">https://t.co/XZhHM7FgU3</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1752975054349140038?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The application submitted on Jan 31 takes the number of firms seeking the license to 14.</p>
<h2>Bybit Follows in OKX&#8217;s Footsteps</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/okx-final-stage-obtain-hong-kong-vasp-license-as-retail-trading-market-grows.htm">OKX also applied for a VATP license</a>¬†in November 2023 as Hong Kong is becoming an attractive spot for Web3 firms.</p>
<p>Lennix Lai, OKX&#8217;s Chief Commercial Officer expressed optimism at the move adding that the exchange looks to work with the city‚Äôs vision to become a global player and a leading web3 hub.</p>
<p>Currently, only two cryptocurrency companies have obtained the license, the first being OSL Exchange and the latter, HashKey Exchange in 2022.</p>
<p>Hong Kong regulators have two major licenses for digital asset firms seeking to operate in its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>While the VATP licenses sought by Bybit and OKX are to give companies access to retail clients, the Virtual Asset Service Provider License (VASP) covers larger institutional clients.</p>
<p>Although institutional clients usually invest based on the amounts and assets they control, the retail market also drives up reach and trading volumes. Consequently, this has been a huge source of revenue in recent times.</p>
<p>Last year, Hong Kong authorities launched operations to crack down on illegal blockchain companies offering retail services without a VATP license.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Police Force set up a monitoring group to investigate and conduct risk assessments of related cases to protect investors with suggestions on tightening regulations after the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpex-scandal-sparks-creation-of-hong-kong-polices-crypto-crimes-group.htm">infamous JPEX scandal</a>.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong‚Äôs Web3 Drive</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hong Kong is among the cities on the pathway towards becoming a Web3 hub for status. This is possible as the regulators rolled out a licensing regime with guidelines for several sectors.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s approach to cryptocurrencies is opposed to mainland China‚Äôs anti-crypto stance which started a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/crypto-world-finds-its-way-in-post-crackdown-china-1186.htm">crackdown on assets</a>, leading many analysts to suggest Hong Kong might be a test bed for a future reversal of policy in China.</p>
<p>Hong Kong‚Äôs regulators recently announced a decision to accept applications for spot cryptocurrency ETFs and released strict requirements for firms.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The new rules released by the city have been hailed among industry executives calling on other regions to emulate Hong Kong and the European Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-framework-signed-into-law-by-eu-officials.htm">MiCA</a>) regulation.</p>
<p>After the fall of Terra Network and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">implosion of FTX in 2022</a>, global authorities began a major shift towards regulations leading to bottle-neck policies in some jurisdictions and multiple lawsuits against Web3 firms.</p>
<p>As a result, a key element for web3 companies became jurisdictions with clearer rules over regions without rules.</p>
