<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a Sky News </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://news.sky.com/story/bitcoin-worth-16314bn-seized-after-ex-takeaway-worker-tried-to-buy-16323m-mansion-court-hears-13059926" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the police seized over 61,000 Bitcoin, valued at $1.7 billion during recovery, from four separate devices stored in a safe deposit box in 2018. The police successfully recovered the cryptocurrency from the devices in 2021, as indicated in the report, without delving into specifics.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Trial of Jian Wen, Accused of Laundering a £5 Billion Investment Fraud Through Bitcoin</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">On January 31, Jian Wen, aged 42, was accused of acting as a &#8220;front person&#8221; to assist in laundering profits from a £5 billion investment fraud orchestrated in China by Zhimin Qian between 2014 and 2017. Qian reportedly used Bitcoin to move the fraudulent money out of China before arriving in the UK under the false Yadi Zhang identity and a St. Kitts and Nevis passport. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently on trial at Southwark Crown Court, Wen is accused of playing a role in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/oracle-worker-linked-to-54-million-crypto-laundering-scheme.htm">money laundering scheme</a> by acting as a conduit for converting Bitcoin into real assets, including attempting to buy a multimillion-pound mansion. Police reportedly raided the residence rented by Wen and Qian near Hampstead Heath in northwest London, seizing devices containing digital wallets with more than 61,000 Bitcoin.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: Court hearing confirms the UK police have seized a record £1,400,000 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> from a massive ongoing China investment fraud case.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e73bbbb0-7974-4c8e-a3e8-2817884e35fb">prosecutor Gillian Jones KC </a></span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e73bbbb0-7974-4c8e-a3e8-2817884e35fb"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">outlined</span></a> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">that Jian Wen was not directly involved in the core fraud but played a role in dealing with Bitcoin on behalf of Qian. Wen was accused of acting as a conduit for converting Bitcoin into real assets, including attempting to buy a multimillion-pound mansion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Police reportedly raided the residence rented by Wen and Qian near Hampstead Heath in northwest London, seizing devices containing digital wallets with more than 61,000 Bitcoin, valued at over £1.4 billion, when authorities accessed them in the summer of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wen, who <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/london-trial-sheds-light-on-alleged-bitcoin-laundering-in-5-billion-fraud-case.htm">denies three counts of money laundering</a> between October 2017 and January 2022, does not dispute dealing with Bitcoin fraud but claims she was Zhang&#8217;s carer and was unaware of the illicit source of the funds. The court heard that Wen and Zhang portrayed themselves as involved in an international jewelry business, traveling extensively and selling Bitcoin while buying high-value items.</span></p>
<h2>Jian Wen’s Involvement in Bitcoin Transactions and Attempted Property Purchases</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before meeting Zhimin Qian (known under various aliases, including Rose, Emma, and Hua Hua), Wen worked at a Chinese takeaway in southeast London and lived in a room underneath the restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wen referred to Qian as her &#8220;boss,&#8221; together, they claimed to be engaged in an international jewelry business, trading diamonds and antiques in countries such as Japan, Thailand, and China. The duo extensively traveled throughout Europe, selling Bitcoin and purchasing high-value items, including fine jewelry and watches.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During their ventures, they considered buying properties in Zurich, and Wen, who remained in the UK while Qian rented a property in Sweden, attempted to buy real estate in London. The proposed purchases included a £23.5 million seven-bedroom Hampstead mansion with a swimming pool and a £12.5 million eight-bedroom home with a cinema and gym. None of these transactions materialized because the source of the Bitcoin used for the purchases could not be explained, however.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the prosecutor, Wen initially claimed the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> had been mined. Later, she stated it was a &#8220;love present&#8221; and produced a deed of gift, asserting that she had received 3,000 Bitcoin (worth £15 million at the time) from Qian.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The prosecutor urged the jury to scrutinize the circumstances surrounding this purported gift, questioning whether it was a genuine gesture or a device to create an appearance of legitimacy regarding the source of funds when Wen attempted to buy high-value property on Qian&#8217;s behalf.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The jury will be tasked with deciding whether Wen knew or suspected that the funds were the proceeds of a crime. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/woman-tried-london-over-alleged-bitcoin-laundering-63-bln-china-fraud-2024-01-29/">Zhimin Qian has reportedly fled the UK</a> and remains at large. The trial continues, with Wen facing three counts of money laundering between October 2017 and January 2022.</span></p>

If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let&rsquo;s build together.</i></p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/115483/278316/picture1.jpg" srcset="" width="" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p style="text-align:justify;"><i>It&rsquo;s no secret that cryptocurrencies have gained immense popularity as &zwnj;modern, decentralized financial assets. And with their increasing value, safeguarding them has become paramount. As the cryptocurrency market continues expanding significantly, various versatile crypto wallets have emerged to accommodate the diverse range of available digital currencies. Thus, one crucial aspect of securing cryptocurrencies is choosing the right crypto wallet.</i></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i>This article will guide you through the key considerations for selecting a secure crypto wallet and introduce Defexa Crypto Wallet, a reliable and trusted option for protecting your digital assets.</i></p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Significance of Selecting the Right Crypto Wallet</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Choosing the right crypto wallet is critical to protecting your cryptocurrencies. With various wallet options available, it&#8217;s essential to consider factors such as <i><strong>security, user-friendliness, compatibility</strong></i>, and <i><strong>functionality</strong></i>. A wrong choice could result in potential risks such as theft, hacking, or losing access to your digital assets, leading to severe consequences.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The choice of a cryptocurrency wallet is not to be taken lightly, as it directly impacts the security, accessibility, and control of one&#8217;s cryptocurrency holdings. Let&#8217;s explore the reasons why selecting the right cryptocurrency wallet is essential.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Security: </strong>The security of your cryptocurrency holdings should be your top priority when choosing a wallet. Since cryptocurrencies are digital assets, they are vulnerable to online threats like hacking, phishing, and malware attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Despite being a mobile crypto wallet, Defexa maintains the highest level of security. As an innovative and new-to-market solution, Defexa Wallet harbors advanced security measures such as secret phrase backup, PIN code, and biometric authentication.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Control:</strong> Cryptocurrency wallets come in different types, including hardware wallets, software wallets, and online wallets. Each type offers different levels of control over your private keys. It&#8217;s essential to carefully consider the type of wallet that aligns with your desired level of control over your crypto assets. Not your keys, not your coins, remember?</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, <a href="https://defexa.io/wallet?utm_source=Media&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Cryptonews_art&amp;utm_id=Cryptonews&amp;utm_term=Cryptonews&amp;utm_content=Launch">Defexa Wallet</a> does not retain or store users&#8217; private keys. This means that users have complete control over them, and any third-party entity does not hold their digital assets.

Powered by blockchain technology, DeFi offers a transparent, open, and permissionless alternative to traditional financial systems.</p><p>In this article, we will delve into the world of DeFi, exploring its core concepts, benefits, and challenges. Join us as we navigate through the decentralized landscape of<a href="https://www.avatrade.com.au/forex/cryptocurrencies"> cryptocurrency trading</a>.</p><h2><strong>Understanding DeFi: Unlocking Financial Freedom</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Let&#8217;s dive into the inner workings of this groundbreaking technology.</p><h3><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h3><p>At the heart of DeFi are smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements coded on blockchain networks. These contracts automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met. Smart contracts ensure transparency, immutability, and security in DeFi transactions.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/blockchain.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_977_550.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_900_507.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w" width="977" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><h3><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong></h3><p>DeFi relies on blockchain technology, most commonly the Ethereum blockchain. Blockchain provides a decentralized and transparent ledger where all transactions and data are recorded. It acts as a single source of truth, ensuring that participants can verify and audit transactions in real-time.</p><h3><strong>Decentralized Applications (DApps)</strong></h3><p>DeFi protocols are built as decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchain networks. These DApps offer various financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and investing, without relying on intermediaries like banks or brokers.</p><h3><strong>Interoperability</strong></h3><p>One of the key features of DeFi is its interoperability. DeFi protocols are designed to work seamlessly with each other, allowing users to leverage multiple applications and services within the ecosystem. This enables innovative financial products and services to be created by combining various DeFi protocols.</p><h3><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</strong></h3><p>Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) play a crucial role in DeFi by enabling peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading. DEXs operate without the need for a central authority, allowing users to retain control of their funds. They utilize smart contracts to facilitate trustless and secure transactions directly between participants.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/liquidity.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_977_550.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_900_507.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w" width="977" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><h3><strong>Liquidity Pools and Automated Market Makers (AMMs)</strong></h3><p>DeFi platforms often utilize liquidity pools and automated market makers (AMMs) to enable efficient trading.&nbsp;</p><p>Liquidity providers deposit their cryptocurrencies into these pools, which are used to facilitate trades. AMMs, governed by smart contracts, automatically determine token prices based on the ratio of assets in the pool, ensuring liquidity and continuous trading.</p><h3><strong>Yield Farming and Staking</strong></h3><p>DeFi introduces innovative concepts like yield farming and staking, incentivizing users to participate in the ecosystem.</p><p>Yield farming involves users providing liquidity to protocols in exchange for rewards in the form of additional tokens. Staking, on the other hand, involves users locking their tokens to support network operations and earning staking rewards.</p><h3><strong>Governance and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):</strong></h3><p>Many DeFi protocols employ governance mechanisms through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).&nbsp;</p><p>DAOs enable token holders to participate in decision-making processes like protocol upgrades, fee structures, or asset listings. Token holders can vote on proposals, ensuring a democratic and decentralized governance structure.</p><h3><strong>Security and Auditing</strong></h3><p>While DeFi offers numerous opportunities, it is crucial to address security concerns. Understanding the risks, using reputable platforms, and employing best security practices are essential for safe participation in DeFi.</p><p>Smart contracts are audited to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate risks. However, users must remain vigilant and conduct due diligence before interacting with DeFi protocols.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of DeFi</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Here are some of the benefits of decentralized finance:</p><h3><strong>Financial Inclusion</strong></h3><p>DeFi opens up financial services to anyone with an internet connection, enabling individuals from underserved regions to participate in global markets.</p><h3><strong>Transparency</strong></h3><p>DeFi protocols operate on open and auditable blockchains, providing users with unparalleled visibility into transactions and smart contract operations.</p><h3><strong>Elimination of Intermediaries</strong></h3><p>By removing intermediaries such as banks or brokers, DeFi reduces costs and enhances efficiency, ensuring a more equitable financial ecosystem.</p><h3><strong>Programmability</strong></h3><p>DeFi protocols are built on smart contracts, allowing for the creation of complex and automated financial applications that operate autonomously.</p><h2><strong>What are the risks of DeFi?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While DeFi offers exciting opportunities, it also comes with risks. Smart contract vulnerabilities, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainties are some key risks associated with DeFi.&nbsp;</p><p>Diversifying investments, staying informed, and using reputable platforms to mitigate these risks are, thus, crucial. Some of the risks of DeFi include:</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>DeFi applications are built on top of relatively new and untested blockchain technology. There have been several high-profile hacks of DeFi applications, so choosing your DeFi applications carefully is important.</p><h3><strong>Complexity</strong></h3><p>DeFi applications can be complex and difficult to understand. It is important to do your research before using any DeFi application.</p><h3><strong>Volatility</strong></h3><p>The prices of cryptocurrencies, which are used to power DeFi applications, are volatile. This means that your investment could lose value quickly.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DeFi and Cryptocurrency Trading: Empowering Investors</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/decentralized.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_977_489.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_900_450.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_720_360.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_600_300.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_300_150.jpg 300w" width="977" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>One of the key areas where DeFi has made significant strides is cryptocurrency trading. DEXs are platforms that facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. Users retain control of their funds while trading directly with other participants, making DEXs more secure and resistant to hacks.</p><h3><strong>Advantages of DEXs</strong></h3><p>Here are some of the pros of decentralized exchanges:</p><h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3><p>DEXs eliminate the need for users to trust centralized exchanges with their funds, reducing the risk of hacks or theft.</p><h3><strong>Greater Privacy</strong></h3><p>DEXs often operate without user identification or KYC procedures, allowing individuals to maintain their privacy.</p><h3><strong>Lower Fees</strong></h3><p>DEXs typically have lower transaction fees than centralized exchanges, as they remove the costs associated with intermediaries.</p><p><strong>Promote a highly regulated brokerage with an excellent reputation.</strong></p><p>Promote an established, highly forex regulated brokerage with a strong international presence and regulatory licenses across 6 jurisdictions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Disclaimer: The following article is part of Cryptonews Deals Series and was written as a promotional article in collaboration with the sponsor of this offer. If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let&rsquo;s build together.</i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The craze of decentralized finance is raging. Although the cryptocurrency world can be overwhelming for people who have just started their decentralized trading journey, the returns it offers urge them to take chances even with the new technology.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To make investing and trading these currencies user-friendly and easily understandable, several decentralized platforms are emerging, taking advantage of the rising crypto fever.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">These platforms provide an interface to crypto users and are an educational resource that makes the cryptocurrency world more accessible for beginners.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">One such easy-to-use network is NEST. This article will explain the NEST platform&#8217;s solutions to crypto users facing volatile market conditions with a safe and trusted mechanism.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Let&rsquo;s begin!</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is the NEST Protocol?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.nestprotocol.org/">NEST protocol</a> is a decentralized trading infrastructure called the martingale network. It leverages smart contracts to eliminate the top crypto market makers, providing traders infinite liquidity to their funds through a risk-sharing concept.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107800/262171/1500x500.jpg" srcset width class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p style="text-align:justify;">It is utilized for various purposes, including decentralized contract exchanges, financial supermarkets, on-chain and off-chain risk hedging, lottery platforms, GameFi, metaverse, and prop synthesis.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The platform has its token, NEST, issued on the Ethereum ERC20 protocol with a total value of 1500 integers. The total supply of NEST tokens is ten billion.</p><p>The NEST network has achieved a significant number of followers on major social media platforms, including TikTok (1.1 Million), Twitter (948.1 K), and Telegram (114 K).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Besides being popular on social media channels, NEST has also been launched on dozens of exchanges, including Coinbase, and has partnerships with 100+ project owners and institutions.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is Martingale Trading?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">A Martingale trade is where the cost you pay to buy the asset at the current time is equal to the mathematical expectation of the asset at subsequent points in time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The martingale function automatically raises the cost of the majority of positions. It compensates for the minority of positions to ensure the overall fairness of the transaction, which reduces the net exposure of the system to a certain extent.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It ensures that the system is not exposed to more risk than it can bear by limiting its maximum position.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Challenges Of Current Decentralized Exchanges</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Here are the risks and problems involved with existing decentralized exchanges:</p><ul><li><strong>Restricted cross-channel transaction:</strong> One of the significant problems of decentralized platforms is the need for more provision for cross-chain transactions. It also proves to be one of the critical reasons for the slow adoption.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Dormancy of order management: </strong>Existing decentralized exchanges have been doomed to a great extent due to the restricted generation of volumes due to inefficiencies in the design. This also tends to create a high cost for the market makers. They spend a steep cost on gas every time an order is posted, modified, or canceled.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Low liquidity and limited transaction volumes:</strong> The cryptocurrencies displayed on decentralized platforms have a low liquidity problem. It also generates problems in the liquidity pool system, causing liability and inflationary pressure on the whole system.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Does NEST Martingale Solve These Problems?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Here is how NEST Martingale can help you solve problems of existing decentralized exchanges:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">NEST Martingale allows derivative trading by eliminating the need for market makers or liquidity pools.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">This network provides an unlimited supply of financial products using smart contracts, the largest seller in the entire system. You can quickly burn your NEST tokens to buy a wide range of financial products on the Martingale network.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">NEST Martingale network solves the problem of coordinating with intermediaries by eliminating added costs and delays. All the data is collected and gathered anonymously, and companies don&rsquo;t need to contact a third party, which saves time and money.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">NEST Martingale network is one of the top cost-effective decentralized trading platforms that achieve 100% of the transaction fee as a rebate for referred trades. The NEST platform doesn&rsquo;t have any custody cost, no technical cost, no liquidity cost, and no interest cost.</li><li>The risk is managed significantly using the NEST martingale network as it automatically increases the cost of the majority of positions and redresses the minority. This ensures the transaction&#8217;s impartiality, reducing the overall system&#8217;s net exposure to a great extent.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p style="text-align:justify;">Compared to other decentralized platforms, NEST has a relatively high supply of tokens, making it an impressive and inviting network for beginners and established traders. Another intriguing factor of the network that makes it a must-choice is the reliable data it offers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">With its innovative and upgraded technology, NEST promises to increase the likelihood of mass blockchain adoption with an accurate and secure system for all traders and investors. Its future also holds the possibility of 1000+ trading users daily.</p>

If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let&rsquo;s build together.</i></p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/104291/255735/picture1111.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/104291/255735/responsive-images/picture1111___media_library_original_624_351.jpg 624w, https://cimg.co/news/104291/255735/responsive-images/picture1111___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/104291/255735/responsive-images/picture1111___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w" width="624" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><strong>London, UK</strong> &mdash; In January 2023, decentralized options and social trading platform OptionBlitz, launched its community networks. The platform is now poised for a February deployment into Ethereum Layer protocol Arbitrum, to offer unique trading options like &lsquo;zero-day&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Turbo&rsquo;. OptionBlitz will also run a 2-stage (BLX) token presale from February 28th to March 28th, 2023.</p><h2><strong>What is OptionBlitz?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://optionblitz.co/">OptionBlitz</a> is a decentralized, enterprise-grade options and social trading platform &#8211; powered by Ethereum Layer 2 protocol, Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Protocol underpins all of the platform&#8217;s trading options including Zero-day, Barrier, American/European options, and the world&#8217;s first DeFi Perpetual option, known as &lsquo;Turbo&rsquo;.</p><h2><strong>Zero-day Options and More</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The OptionBlitz platform offers a multitude of cutting-edge trading options, unique features, and over 22 different trading pairs. Zero-day options are one of the fastest-growing trends in the financial markets and one of the pillars of the OptionBlitz platform. Zero-day options expire the same day that they are purchased, allowing traders to take advantage of ultra short-term trades, which they can enter &amp; exit almost instantaneously.&nbsp;</p><p>The OptionBlitz platform also features various American &amp; European options with maturities from 24h down to as low as 10 seconds, allowing for highly-customizable trading control. The liquidity Provider program is another great feature that offers traders excellent returns, boosted by up to +50% when USDC capital is staked with the platform&rsquo;s native BLX token.</p><h2><strong>What About Perpetual Turbo?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>OptionBlitz is currently the only platform that offers <a href="https://optionblitz.co/#turbos">Perpetual Turbo Options</a>. Turbos are an exciting new form of derivative which are like a cross between a perpetual futures contract and an option. Instead of paying margin, the trader pays an initial outlay depending on the leverage selected. Turbos have different characteristics to other perpetuals, including:</p><ul><li>1:200 Leverage</li><li>No Margin</li><li>No expiration</li><li>Fixed 0.1% TX Fee</li><li>0% Slippage&nbsp;</li></ul><p>No margin means no margin calls, so highly volatile markets can be supported even with high leverage. A Turbo is liquidated by the risk engine if its barrier level is touched, the barrier level is set according to the leverage selected and it moves according to a funding rate mechanism.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Social Trading &amp; BLX Token Economy</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://optionblitz.co/">OptionBlitz</a> has integrated numerous features to promote community growth through social trading. The platform uses a Web 3.0-enabled in-app chat, deep social sentiment analytics, free trading signals, and indicators &mdash; all built around the platform&rsquo;s BLX token economy and incentive model. Deep integration with affiliate networks offers traders an opportunity to build their own brand with verifiable on-chain proof of trade delivered through the OptionBlitz social hub.</p><h2><strong>More Reasons to Use OptionBlitz</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Besides the unique perpetual turbo and Zero-day options, there are many other reasons to start trading on OptionBlitz. For example, the platform uses advanced risk management systems to keep liquidity secure &amp; maintain product pricing in line with the market.&nbsp;</p><p>The platform&#8217;s native BLX token also gives traders huge discounts on fees, boosts liquidity provider rewards, and unlocks exclusive features. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, traders do not have to worry about onboarding, lengthy sign-up processes, or even KYC.</p><h2><strong>The Future of DeFi Options</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="http://optionblitz">OptionBlitz</a> is intent on becoming the most popular decentralized trading platform for options, leveraged trading, and investing. The platform is already on the way to achieving this and is soon to introduce decentralized managed funds and robo funds to supercharge their trading community.</p><p>OptionBlitz will also bring unique, freely transferable, unrestricted, tokenized stocks to the blockchain and turn the platform into a fully featured investment hub. It will also Integrate with other DeFi partners committed to a transparent, open, and censorship-resistant future.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>BLX Token Sale</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>OptionBlitz is launching a two-stage<a href="https://optionblitz.co/presale"> BLX token presale</a> from 28th February to 28th of March 2023. The token pricing for stage one is 0.1 USDC/BLX. Pricing for stage two will start at 0.1 USDC/BLX, rising to 0.41 USDC/BLX should the sale sell out.</p><p>The BLX Token has been audited by award-winning company Shellboxes and will initially launch on Uniswap. The company has also established agreements in principle that will see the BLX token listed on Bitmart, Lbank and Probit exchanges respectively.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>OptionBlitz Socials</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/optionblitz_co">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/planetblx">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://optionblitz.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/D5Rk6fhh4n">Discord</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionBlitz/">Reddit</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Media Contact Details</strong></p><p><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Artemis</p><p><strong>Contact Email</strong>: <a href="mailto:info@optionblitz.co">info@optionblitz.co</a>&nbsp;</p><p><i>OptionBlitz is the source of this content.

After a crypto winter that lasted more than a year, the quotes of the main cryptocurrencies soared. A huge wave of new cryptocurrency supporters will soon cover the market. Most of them want to quickly enter the market to take advantage of financial innovations, invest and earn successfully, and at the same time minimize risks. Until recently, this was impossible, because experience comes from mistakes and losses, and successful trading on the exchange requires a long-term education. The world of crypto can be overwhelming and complicated for those who are just starting out. They need not only a user-friendly interface but also comprehensive educational resources that make the world of cryptocurrency more accessible and less intimidating to beginners. And most importantly, what they need is a way not to lose all their funds by the very first mistake. For a long time, no one could provide such a service. But now the <a href="https://cryptounity.org/">CryptoUnity</a> platform comes. With it, everything could be changed. A new startup with its own CUT token allows beginners to quickly become full participants of the crypto community, start trading quickly and successfully on the exchange, and at the same time, due to the cold storage, they can minimize their risks and not lose their assets even if something is wrong with the exchange.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/cryptounity.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_977_343.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_900_316.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_720_253.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_600_211.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_300_105.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="977" class="content-img"></figure><h3><strong>Cool cold wallet</strong></h3><p>Even the most secure exchanges get hacked from time to time. We regularly hear about this in the news from the cryptocurrency market. When hackers break into an exchange, the users usually lose all their funds placed on their exchange accounts. And even reliable and convenient online wallets cannot guarantee the complete safety of funds. There is only one way to store digital assets securely, and that is with a cold wallet. A cold wallet is not connected to the internet and therefore stands a far lesser risk of being compromised. In other words, this is an offline wallet or a hardware wallet. A cold wallet is the only way of holding cryptocurrency offline to prevent hackers from being able to access the owner&#8217;s holdings via traditional internet-hacking means. And more: even if you lose your cold wallet, but still have your seed phrase, you can get another hardware wallet and access your assets.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/asset.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_977_464.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_900_427.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_720_342.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_600_285.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_300_142.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="977" class="content-img"></figure><p>Most often, a cold wallet looks like a flash drive and is connected to a computer via a USB port. But there is a more convenient version of a cold wallet, that looks like a traditional bank card and accesses the Internet using NFC. Such a cold wallet provides the full functionality of a hardware wallet while remaining very convenient to use. And this is exactly what the new generation of users is accustomed to. The card with NFC can be easily carried with you wherever you go, allowing for quick and secure access to your funds at any time. This combination of beginner-friendliness and top-level security makes the <a href="https://cryptounity.org/">CryptoUnity</a> platform the go-to destination for anyone looking to get involved in the world of cryptocurrency.</p><h3><strong>Trust and transparency</strong></h3><p>It is known that the crypto finance system built on the blockchain provides a trustless solution. But you still have to trust the solution providers. CryptoUnity successfully completed several audits including QuillAudits in September 2022 and an audit by CertiK in November 2022. While undergoing a due diligence audit with CertiK, the CryptoUnity team also received a KYC Golden badge, demonstrating the highest level of transparency and trust. The combination of user-friendly interface and security provided by cold wallet was highly appreciated by the Auditor. At the end of the year, CertiK published a shortlist of recently evaluated 5 new cryptocurrency projects and evaluated them on their trust scores. The CryptoUnity&#8217;s trust score put it in the top rate of all projects, per the security audit. With a trust score of 89, the cryptocurrency exchange platform comes in first.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/logos.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_977_124.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_900_114.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_720_91.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_600_76.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_300_38.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="977" class="content-img"></figure><h3><strong>What next?</strong></h3><p>The newbie-oriented project provides two main user needs: security and education. They are complemented by an original and effective affiliate program &#8211; BAPP (Blockchain Affiliate Partner Program), which solves three problems at once: provides an influx of new users; builds trust in the community; and allows users to access additional passive income, where they can earn up to 10% of the value from transactions made by their followers using their code. . Further development of the project, according to the team, will be based on the feedback from their users. This means that CryptoUnity will continue to be able to meet the needs of both experienced and new users who will, like a wave, come to the cryptocurrency market due to its revival.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54.jpeg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_1280_675.jpeg 1280w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_1200_633.jpeg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_900_475.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_720_380.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_600_316.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_300_158.jpeg 300w" width="1280" class="content-img" alt=""></figure>

The tokens will be allocated proportionally based on the achievements of the top five (5) top participants.&nbsp;</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1st place : &euro;35 000 KLX</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2nd place : &euro;25 000 KLX</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3rd place : &euro;20 000 KLX</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4th place : &euro;10 000 KLX</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5th place : &euro;10 000 KLX</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">To participate in the Kalima developer Airdrop, participants must first fill out the registration form, which is available on the Kalima website at <a href="http://www.kalima.io">www.kalima.io</a>. They will then receive all the instructions and steps to follow to participate to the competition via e-mail.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All the steps for the participation of the airdrop are detailed in <a href="https://medium.com/@Kalima_KLX/how-to-participate-in-kalima-blockchains-100-000-developer-airdrop-5cecbc485ed7">this article</a>, on the <a href="https://medium.com/@Kalima_KLX">Medium page</a> of Kalima. Kalima&rsquo;s Social Media pages and communication channels will be giving the updates on the competition during and prior to it, so it is important to <a href="https://linktr.ee/Kalima_KLX">follow Kalima</a> online and keep track of the updates.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This event comes about as Kalima prepares the listing of its native token, the KLX, on the BitMart Exchange on February 2<sup>nd</sup> 2023.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Participating in the inaugural Kalima Developer Airdrop</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">The prize aggregation makes participation worthwhile. Even though the winner has an excellent incentive, others coming in close will also be fairly rewarded for their efforts. Developers will be required to build software applications and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Kalima blockchain and test them for performance for a chance to claim the prize.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">These protocols must be consistent with the overall goals of the Developer Airdrop. Developers will be able to build embedded blockchain projects or multichain projects using Kalima as the second layer for Tezos or the Lightning Network. Builders can, for example, create smart rewarding systems for indoor air quality or systems aligned with sustainability practices such as carbon measurement, tracking, and credentialing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Participants may choose from the following topics to base their projects:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Embedded blockchain project</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Multichain using Kalima as second layer for Tezos or Lightning Network</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Gaming</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Micro Payments</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Smart rewarding systems (e.g., Indoor air quality Smart Rewarding)</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Auditable Data (i.e., carbon tracking)</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Physical NFTs</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Building the Kalima Blockchain Community</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">As a low-cost, high-speed, and scalable rival to other Enterprise Blockchain projects, Kalima provides unmatched&nbsp;modularity and independence in the race to become the ultimate Blockchain for IoT (BIoT) network. Both beginners and developers with smart contract&nbsp;experience benefit from its high degree of composability, as the Kalima API is available in many programming languages.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Whether it is for businesses as a whole, or for builders wanting to benefit from the Kalima Network, building dApps and on the ecosystem will be a natural process, which will be supported by the Kalima foundation. Kalima has a close support system available for enterprise adopting Kalima Blockchain, with a formation time and program that has been proved to be one of the most efficient in the industry.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, throughout the years the Kalima foundation will host a number of hackathons and developer airdrops to assist developers in honing their skills, starting with the inaugural Kalima Developer Airdrop. These may take place online, or physically in one of the three regions Kalima is operating in : Europe, the U.S.A. and the U.A.E..</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kalima has also allocated an important amount of tokens for its planned developer grant program, in which in-house and external developers will be rewarded handsomely for adopting the Kalima Network and creating dApps on it, either for their own programs, or for third parties. This program is set to be launched for the seven years following the Kalima listing on the Bitmart Exchange on February 2<sup>nd</sup> 2023.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the Kalima foundation will incentivize the deployment of PrivaChains in its initial stage, by rewarding the first one thousand PrivaChain owners, in ten rounds, on a first-come-first-served basis. About 20 billion KLX have been put aside for this incentive program, with the rewarding set in a descending order, meaning the 10 first owners will earn more than the following volley of owners and so on.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About Kalima</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Kalima, a layer 1 third-generation blockchain, is a rapidly expanding ecosystem that will enable enterprises, developers, and startups to build the future of Web3 Enterprise and Data Governance applications, specifically with IoT (Internet of Things) data, to solve real-world problems.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Users can independently govern, manage, and monetize data using Kalima&#8217;s decentralized network of permissioned blockchains (PrivaChains), as well as create tokens for smart-rewarding systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kalima is a modular concept which allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that are hosted on PrivaChains. Kalima was designed for the creation of dApps, with the goal of generating new business models or improving existing ones, ranging from data notarization to decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization (NFTs), data monetization, and industrial IoT applications (Digital Twins, Predictive Maintenance, Smart Infrastructure, and so on).&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kalima&#8217;s blockchain is built to handle very large amounts of sensitive data generated by industries collecting data via IoT sensors and analyzing that data in real-time. The PrivaChains will be able to connect to one another as well as to other leading public chains (Tezos, Lightning, Polygon, and Cosmos hubs), boosting Kalima&#8217;s industrial adoption.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To learn more about Kalima, be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.kalima.io">www.kalima.io</a> website.

That&rsquo;s why now it&rsquo;s more important than ever to understand what data breaches are, how they happen, and how to <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=504&amp;aff_id=74417&amp;url_id=9358">prevent them</a>.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Most websites store user data in some shape or form. When they experience a data breach, controlling the spread of the compromised data becomes very difficult. The effects of a data breach can be devastating, with permanently damaged online reputation or even identity theft.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For crypto traders, a password breach might mean a substantial financial loss. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s essential to understand more about data breaches and how to <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=504&amp;aff_id=74417&amp;url_id=9358">protect your passwords</a> &ndash; and your money.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How data breaches happen</strong>&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Data breaches can occur in several ways and for many reasons. A malicious party outside the organization is typically to blame &ndash; but someone within an organization can also cause them.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a data breach happens within the organization, it&rsquo;s often the result of an unintentional accident, human error, or infrastructural weaknesses. However, they can also be insider jobs &ndash; a data breach deliberately carried out by someone within the company.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a data breach happens due to a malicious party targeting the organization, it&rsquo;s known as a deliberate attack. These deliberate attacks may involve techniques like ransomware, phishing, social engineering tactics, SQL injection, or brute-force attacks.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Stolen credentials &ndash; the most common cause of data breaches&nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Unsurprisingly, stolen or leaked credentials are most commonly responsible for data breaches.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a password is stolen or leaked, it becomes available to unauthorized parties and can be used to access various personal or business accounts. Cybercriminals can steal passwords in several ways, including keylogger programs, phishing, social engineering, brute-force attacks, and, sometimes, simply guesswork.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A stolen password can have severe consequences for users and organizations, exposing accounts to cybercriminals and potentially causing significant financial losses.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The biggest data breaches of 2022</strong>&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">This year has seen many major data breaches exposing the data of millions of customers. Here are some of the most significant incidents this year to date:&nbsp;</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>January 17, 2022: </strong>Hackers broke into almost 500 crypto traders&rsquo; wallets on crypto.com and stole $18 million in bitcoin and $15 million in Ethereum.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>March 21, 2022:</strong> The Lapsus$ hacker group breached the authentication company Okta, affecting 2.5% of the company&rsquo;s customers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>March 23, 2022: </strong>Cybercriminals successfully stole $625 million in cryptocurrency from the makers of Axie Infinity.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>July 21, 2022:</strong> Hackers breached the data of approximately 5.4 million Twitter users and put it on sale with their phone numbers and email addresses.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How can cybercriminals use stolen data?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Hackers can use stolen data in many ways, some of which are worse than others. What criminals do with stolen data largely depends on whether it&rsquo;s business or personal.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Personal information</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sell it for profit.</strong> Cybercriminals may put stolen data up for sale on the dark web. According to <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/heres-how-much-your-personal-information-is-selling-for-on-the-dark-web/">Experian</a>, criminals can sell data for anywhere between $1 to $2,000.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Steal money or commit financial fraud. </strong>Stolen data may give attackers access to bank or investment accounts &ndash; a relatively easy way to steal the user&rsquo;s money.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Commit identity theft. </strong>Hackers may use stolen data to open new credit cards or file a tax return under the victim&rsquo;s identity.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Cause damage on social media. </strong>Cybercriminals may also use stolen data to access the victim&rsquo;s social media accounts. They may share posts as the victim or contact their friends and followers to ask for money.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">In most cases, the victim will have to jump through hoops to restore their life to how it used to be, including contacting the authorities, changing all login credentials, and notifying family and friends.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Corporate information</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Stolen corporate information can have a devastating effect on an organization&rsquo;s reputation too.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a significant data breach occurs, users may lose trust in an organization and its ability to handle their information securely. This loss of confidence can seriously impact the business long-term, causing irreversible reputation damage.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, stolen corporate information may also lead to major financial losses, like in the cases of the data breaches listed above. Overall, data breaches pose serious risks &ndash; whether at an individual or corporate level.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How to prevent a data breach</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Individuals and organizations can prevent data breaches in various ways, including:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Keeping <strong>software up to date.</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;">Being mindful of <strong>phishing attacks.</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shredding documents</strong> with personal or financial information.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Only using <strong>secure websites.</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;">Checking <strong>credit reports</strong>.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">However, since most data breaches happen due to weak or stolen passwords, let&rsquo;s look at how to improve your passwords.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Improve your password security</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=504&amp;aff_id=74417&amp;url_id=9358">Password security</a> is vital in data breach prevention. Strong passwords are much harder to crack and will be more effective in keeping your accounts safe. Here are some tips for password security:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Create unique passwords that are at least 12 characters long.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Use lower and uppercase letters and a combination of letters and numbers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Include at least one special character. The longer and more complex your password is, the harder it becomes for hackers to guess or crack it.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Keep your passwords safe. Using a reliable password manager could help you always create strong, uncrackable passwords and store them in a secure, encrypted place. Password managers can help avoid human errors and make your accounts more secure.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Data breach prevention tips for crypto wallets</strong>&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">With crypto trading becoming more popular, crypto-related data breaches are increasing too. Protect your crypto wallets with strong passwords as your first line of defense. Here are some tips for keeping your crypto wallets safe:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Create complex passwords. </strong>Malicious tools for brute force attacks and password guessing are easily accessible to hackers. If your passwords aren&rsquo;t strong enough, hackers may be able to break into your crypto trading account and empty your wallet.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Use unique passwords. </strong>Don&rsquo;t use the same password on several accounts. Unique passwords are also essential because of the risk of third-party data breaches. One email account could compromise all shared passwords if it suffers a breach.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Use a password manager. </strong>Remember your complex and strong passwords with a password manager. These helpful cybersecurity tools let you store, autofill, and save as many strong passwords as you want. Your passwords are easily accessible on any device &ndash; but only to you.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About NordPass</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=504&amp;aff_id=74417&amp;url_id=9358">NordPass</a> is a highly rated password manager created by Nord Security &ndash; a global company specializing in personal and business cybersecurity solutions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">NordPass allows users to store, autosave, and autofill unique, complex passwords to secure their online accounts.

Right?</p><p>Wrong. Cryptocurrency may be unbreakable, but crypto wallets don&rsquo;t enjoy the same luxury. Whether you keep your coins on an exchange or in a non-custodial wallet, you&rsquo;re relying on mundane security measures to keep your assets safe. If they&rsquo;re not up to snuff, your journey to the moon only has one end &mdash; not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>Your crypto wallet&rsquo;s security starts with a <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&amp;aff_id=24083">strong password</a>. In this article, we&rsquo;ll teach you how to create a strong password for your coins by following six simple rules.</p><h2><strong>1. Never reuse passwords</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Every website wants you to make an account, and every account needs a password. Pretty soon, the amount of credentials becomes overwhelming, and you might be tempted to downsize a bit. Why not simply create a single <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&amp;aff_id=24083">super strong password</a> for all your accounts?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Resist the temptation. If you reuse passwords, you&rsquo;re putting all your eggs in one basket. A single data leak from a vulnerable website can put your entire digital kingdom in jeopardy. Once hackers have their hands on a set of credentials, they&rsquo;ll run the username/password combo through email services, social media, and &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; crypto wallets.</p><p>And do you really want to risk thousands of dollars in crypto for easier access to Facebook?</p><h2><strong>2. Simple is bad</strong>&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So if every account must have a <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&amp;aff_id=24083">unique password</a>, why not keep things simple? It&rsquo;s much easier to remember multiple passwords if they&rsquo;re composed of common words, use popular phrases, or reference anything personal.</p><p>Trouble is, if your password is easy to remember, there&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s also easy to guess. The first thing hackers will try on your crypto wallet is a dictionary attack &mdash; they&rsquo;ll get a supercomputer to throw popular names, words, and phrases at the account by the thousand to see if anything sticks. Faced with this onslaught, a simple password will fold in milliseconds.</p><p>The same goes for personal information. Don&rsquo;t make passwords out of pet names, important dates, or in-jokes &mdash; this information is not as private as you think. To crack open your crypto wallet, hackers will thoroughly investigate your social media profiles, forum posts, and even government registries for hints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To protect your crypto assets, take a page from cryptography. Just like encrypted data, the <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&amp;aff_id=24083">best passwords</a> look like complete gibberish created by rolling your face on the keyboard. Create your password out of random characters for the best results.</p><h2><strong>3. Special is good</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Alright, so it has to be unique and random. But can we at least keep to the bottom half of the keyboard? Surely that&rsquo;s enough randomness to foil any hacking attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, sweet summer child. Your crypto is a juicy prize, so if the dictionary attack fails, hackers will move on to the next phase &mdash; simple, raw brute force. They will pry your crypto wallet open one symbol at a time.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s put things into perspective. An eight character password only composed of lowercase letters has almost 209 billion combinations. That&rsquo;s more possible passwords than a human being would be able to guess in a lifetime &mdash; but a computer running optimized brute force algorithms would be able to crack it in less than a second.</p><p>By adding more character possibilities to the mix, you increase the time it takes to brute force your crypto wallet exponentially. With uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols, the same eight character password goes from folding in milliseconds to holding out for hours against sustained assault.</p><h2><strong>4. The more, the merrier</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Just like the average Reddit post, your password is now full of random capitalization, misplaced symbols, and unsubstantiated numbers. But unless you want the difference between &ldquo;funds are SAFU&rdquo; and &ldquo;SFYL&rdquo; to be one all-nighter, you need to think bigger.</p><p>Specifically, you need a bigger password.&nbsp;</p><p>It all comes down to the number of possible combinations. In our previous example, the eight character password with lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols would last about eight hours against a high-power offline cracking computer. But add just one more character, and the time until your crypto wallet is compromised jumps to three weeks.</p><p><a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&amp;aff_id=24083">Really strong passwords</a> consist of at least twelve characters &mdash; with this many possible combinations, even supercomputers would need an average of 34,000 years to penetrate your account. And by that time, your coins will have safely shot to the moon.</p><h2><strong>5. Just use a password manager</strong>&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>At this point, you might be wondering how to keep this random mishmash in your head, much less use daily to check on your funds. That&rsquo;s the best part &mdash; you don&rsquo;t need to.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a much easier way to get strong passwords for any account, including your crypto wallet.</p><p><a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&amp;aff_id=24083">NordPass</a> is a free password manager from Nord Security, the creators of NordVPN. The free app lets you generate, save, and automatically fill in strong passwords on the fly, keep sensitive notes, and store credit card details. All your credentials will be safely stored in your private NordPass vault, protected by unbreakable xChaCha20 encryption.</p><p>And best of all? As a crypto enthusiast, you&rsquo;ll love the fact that <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&amp;aff_id=24083">NordPass</a> runs on zero-knowledge architecture &mdash; in other words, not even NordPass technicians know what you keep in your vault.

If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let’s build together.</i></p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/97681/242729/adobestock-452213091-editorial-use-only.jpeg" alt="" width="5328" /></figure>
<p>You know you should click carefully while browsing the more unsavory side of the internet. But sometimes, even the most careful of us tend to forget that. Besides, having to always be on your guard can get exhausting fast. So wouldn’t it be great if there was a tool that would guard your back online at all times? Not just sound the alarm once your device is infected, but to <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">prevent malicious software</a> from getting on it in the first place? Luckily, there is one!</p>
<h2><strong>NordVPN’s Threat Protection</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>NordVPN is a leader in the cybersecurity software market. And while its main purpose is to encrypt and reroute your connection, in the spring of 2022, NordVPN released <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a>. It was introduced as an additional free NordVPN feature, a lightweight malware protection solution.</p>
<p>Today, it’s a standalone desktop application designed for people who don’t need or want to use a VPN but would still like a hassle-free way to protect their devices from various online threats. <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> is an all-in-one solution for scanning your downloading files for malware, blocking trackers and malicious websites, and stopping intrusive and annoying ads.</p>
<p>How does it differ from regular antivirus software? Aside from the extra features like blocking ads and trackers, <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> prevents malware from getting on your device rather than notifying you after it’s already infected. Threat Protection does not offer local file scanning like traditional antiviruses. Instead, it scans the files you’re downloading and deletes the infected ones before they can land on your device. Another big advantage over traditional security software is how lightweight Threat Protection is. It works silently as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-vpn-block-how-bypass-it.htm">VPN</a> in the background without slowing down your computer.</p>
<h2><strong>Threat Protection’s features</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Users get four main functions with <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a>: scanning downloading files for malware, blocking ads, blocking trackers, and preventing you from landing on malicious websites.</p>
<h3><i><strong>Scanning files for malware</strong></i></h3>
<p>Whenever you download a file through your browser, <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> will scan it for malware. If the file is deemed likely to infect your device, it is deleted immediately before it can do any harm. You will find two different settings for malware scanning:</p>
<h4><strong>1. Regular file scanning</strong></h4>
<p>This method of detecting malware in a regular file relies on comparing the file’s unique digital signature against a database of known malware. You can’t open or use the file in any way while <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> is scanning it, but the scan takes no time at all, and you’re unlikely to even notice it. This feature works with all file types that can be malicious.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Deep file scans for malware detection</strong></h4>
<p>This method involves sandboxing and is behavior based. Deep file scans are designed for software — if you’re not sure it is safe, choose this option in the settings menu, and the file will be uploaded to the cloud and executed in a safe environment. <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> analyzes how the software acts once executed and, according to that information, determines whether it is malicious. This feature only works for executable files — your pictures, videos, or documents will not be uploaded to the cloud.</p>
<h3><i><strong>Blocking ads</strong></i></h3>
<p>With the era of ad-blocking browser extensions coming to an end, this <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> feature is likely to become a favorite among internet users.</p>
<p>Blocking intrusive and annoying ads makes your browsing faster, smoother, and safer. Once you enable ad blocking in <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> settings, it will work on all popular browsers and block ads even while you’re browsing in private/incognito mode.</p>
<h2><i><strong>Stopping trackers</strong></i></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The internet we are used to would be impossible without tracking cookies. They ensure that when you close an online shop’s tab and open it back up a moment later, your shopping bag still has the items you put in it. They also allow you to stay logged in to your email account for days and weeks without the need to re-enter your password every time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same technology can be used to track your actions online. Third-party trackers constantly follow you around as you browse, collecting data about your digital habits. This information includes your device and browser type, IP address, location, browsing history, how you interact with different web elements, and for how long. This might not sound like much, but experienced data analysts can use this information to accurately determine your age, gender, marital status, religious and political views, income, spending habits, and other characteristics.</p>
<p>Personal data like the above is often used to serve highly targeted, intrusive ads. <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> blocks these trackers so that they can’t follow you around and analyze your browsing habits.</p>
<h2><i><strong>Blocking malicious websites</strong></i></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures — like clicking on an unknown website on the fifth page of Google’s results because maybe<i> this one</i> will have that toy your niece wants for her birthday. Unfortunately, you being desperate is exactly what cybercriminals are counting on. Once you’re on their website, they will try to steal your data or make you download malware to your device.</p>
<p><a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> is here to block your access to these websites. It scans the URLs you’re about to visit and prevents you from landing on a website if it is found to be fake or hosting malicious software. Instead, you will see a warning screen. And while you can still visit the website, it is not recommended.</p>
<h2><strong>Bottom line</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=725&amp;aff_id=24083&amp;url_id=22382">Threat Protection</a> is available for Windows and macOS computers, and you can get a monthly or yearly subscription — it’s a bargain at just a few dollars per month. Get it today and browse in confidence, knowing that Threat Protection is actively guarding your devices against various online threats.</p>

AMC announced this back in May of 2020, with the network buying up 18 of Anne Rice&#8217;s novels&nbsp;</p><p>The new series is a gothic horror and vampire series created by Rolin Jones. The series is based on Anne Rice&#8217;s novel of the same name. The Vampire Chronicles, in particular, sets the premise for this series. The series follows the story of love, blood, and the dangers of immorality. The Interview with the Vampire NFTs will end up in the development of an exciting digital destination filled with lore and monsters. Anne Rice&#8217;s sexually charged novels will set the premise for the virtual world, featuring witches, spooky events, and many supernatural activities! For more on this, keep an eye out for any releases from Orange Comet touching on this and other new projects!</p>

If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let&rsquo;s build together.</i></p><p>One of the main factors that determine the <strong>quality of a cryptocurrency exchange is undoubtedly its degree of security</strong>. Recent events have reminded us that this factor should not be compromised.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/94488/235946/crypto.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/94488/235946/responsive-images/crypto___media_library_original_512_341.jpeg 512w, https://cimg.co/news/94488/235946/responsive-images/crypto___media_library_original_300_200.jpeg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="512" class="content-img"><figcaption>Photo: Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure><p>Ensuring maximum security for its users is by far the most critical aspect of any reputable trading platform. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://go.primexbt.com/click?pid=396&amp;offer_id=12">PrimeXBT</a><strong> has, to date, never been hacked and has a solid reputation for reliability</strong> and the way the administrators manage the security of this must-have exchange.</p><h2><strong>Cold storage, maximum security</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>It should be noted that the majority of bitcoins are stored on the platform&#8217;s wallet via &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets. </strong>This is called cold storage. This way of storing crypto-assets provides users with maximum security because the funds are not directly accessible from the outside but are locked offline to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore,<strong> in order for PrimeXBT users to withdraw funds, a number of crypto assets are kept in a &#8220;hot&#8221;</strong> wallet or <i>hot storage</i>. Daily withdrawals can be made smoothly.</p><p><strong>Moreover, transfers between the hot wallet and the cold wallet are confirmed using multiple signatures (Multisig), </strong>which is the most secure and most used way of managing this type of process in the crypto industry. This security standard contributes greatly to reducing the risk of having what is called a point of failure.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clarity for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrimeXBT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PrimeXBT</a> users:<br><br>Safety and security of user funds and AUM are a top priority at PrimeXBT.<br><br>In response to the situation with FTX this week, we would like to share more insight into how we handle and protect assets on PrimeXBT.<br><br>A short thread <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>&mdash; PrimeXBT (@PrimeXBT) <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeXBT/status/1591012529416839168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h3><strong>Cloudflare</strong></h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/94488/235947/shield.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/94488/235947/responsive-images/shield___media_library_original_503_512.jpeg 503w, https://cimg.co/news/94488/235947/responsive-images/shield___media_library_original_300_305.jpeg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="503" class="content-img"></figure><p>In addition to the security measures mentioned above, PrimeXBT protects its users&#8217; crypto assets with <strong>Cloudfare</strong>, a specialized solution against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</p><p><i>&#8220;Cloudflare&#8217;s anti-DDoS protection solution secures websites, applications and entire networks while ensuring that legitimate traffic is not compromised.

Among these best practices, we obviously think about how to secure access to PrimeXBT accounts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We&#8217;re talking about a powerful password combination combined with 2FA authentication based on Google Authenticator</strong> (two-factor authentication).

Because of this, it only makes sense that now the cryptocurrency market has many different opportunities. Anyone interested in cryptocurrencies can choose from many different options, including different trading platforms.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, it&rsquo;s fantastic that you can choose from many different types of platforms, but this also creates a certain champagne problem. When there are so many options, how can you choose one? This article aims to help you with this. We will introduce some of the popular trading platforms, and why people tend to choose them.</p><h2>More and more ways to start investing</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As we said, nowadays investors can choose from many different options. Sometimes it can be unsafe to start with a new stockbroker, luckily, it is now also possible to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptomeister.com/">invest in crypto at traditional stockbrokers</a>, which has not been a possibility for a long time. An increasing number of traditional stockbrokers have added cryptocurrencies to their selection.&nbsp;</p><p>Using traditional stockbrokers is a popular option for two clear reasons. First of all, it&rsquo;s very suitable for beginners. They can get all the help they might need very easily. Additionally, investors can learn also about other possibilities traditional stockbrokers have. That way they can see whether the broker has any additional investment opportunities that they would like to include in their portfolio.</p><h3>Exchanges are created for cryptocurrencies</h3><p>Exchanges have been an important part of the crypto world for a long time now. If you are not yet familiar with the term, Exchange means simply a platform that investors can use to change one currency to another. They can use it for changing fiat currency to crypto or vice versa.</p><p>Exchange platforms could be the most popular and famous options for crypto trading. They are an especially common choice because of how easy they are to use for crypto trading. Since they are originally created for cryptocurrencies, they also have a lot of options that investors can choose from. Not to forget that now there are many different Exchange platforms to find the most suitable and know when to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-ethereum-will-october-bullish-month.htm">cash in on the predicted prices</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Pay attention to deals and promotions&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A feature, which makes both exchange sites and brokers popular is that some of them offer deals and promotions. When you are choosing the fitting platform for you, this is good to check out. You can use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptomeister.com/">CryptoMeister</a> for finding out all of the newest and most interesting deals and promotions in the cryptoworld. Just remember to check any promotional terms before claiming them. This helps you with ensuring that the promotion will be certainly fitting for you.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/93541/233726/deals.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/93541/233726/responsive-images/deals___media_library_original_1004_668.jpg 1004w, https://cimg.co/news/93541/233726/responsive-images/deals___media_library_original_900_599.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/93541/233726/responsive-images/deals___media_library_original_720_479.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/93541/233726/responsive-images/deals___media_library_original_600_399.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/93541/233726/responsive-images/deals___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w" width="1004" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><h2>Cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular and common</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies can be seen in many different things. Now even high-end fashion stores like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61343255">Gucci accept cryptocurrency</a>. Since they are becoming so common, obviously more opportunities are introduced on a steady basis. Therefore it&rsquo;s likely that in the future there will be even more options, even when it comes to ways to trade cryptocurrencies.</p>

If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let&rsquo;s build together.</i></p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/93414/233490/nft.jpg" srcset width class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><strong>If you&rsquo;re considering purchasing an NFT, you should know what type of investment you&rsquo;re making. The world of crypto is hyped and exciting, but it&rsquo;s also volatile and unregulated. Get some insight on the most important things for you to know here.</strong></p><p>In 2021 NFTs were suddenly on everybody&rsquo;s lips. The market for non-fungible tokens has exploded in a very short period. Today you can buy NFTs of all kinds, shapes, and sizes. It has become a common investment asset with great potential. Still, there are things one needs to consider before investing in NFTs. In some ways, they&rsquo;re just like any other investment objects, but in other ways, they are very unique investments. If you&rsquo;re interested in investing in NFT, you should start by finding the best <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://buynft.com/tools/">tools for NFT trading</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Be aware of the volatility&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>One of the central aspects that anyone should know about is the volatility of the NFT market. There have been periods where the NFT prices have dropped as much as 75% over the course of just a few months. Just like anything in the world of crypto, it is defined by volatility. It&rsquo;s a decentralized market, which means that the only thing defining the value is the demand. This makes it a risky investment for any investor. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptocurrency/">Read much more on cryptocurrencies here.</a></p><h2>More than a craze?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Right now there&rsquo;s lots of debate on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/arianee/nfts-is-the-demand-real-or-is-it-only-hype-4163fcdfa6e6">whether or not NFTs are more than just hype</a>. Just like anything new phenomenon, people will be speculating. But actually, there&rsquo;s a lot more to NFTs than most people know. The potential that it&rsquo;s bringing to the table is quite revolutionizing. This technology is a new way of authenticating the ownership of digital assets. This means that it can be used in every corner of the digital world. For example, it could potentially even replace IDs and passports in the future. NFTs are already being used for tickets, licenses, memberships, and so on. The possibilities of how to utilize this technology are endless. This strongly suggests that NFTs are much more than a craze, it&rsquo;s a potential fundamental technology for the digital future.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/93414/233491/side-of-nft.jpg" srcset width class="content-img" alt=""></figure><h2>Learn about the fun sides of NFTs</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>BuyNFT has everything you might need under the same roof. You can find all the best tools for trading NFTs but that&rsquo;s not all. You can also learn about different fun aspects that NFTs offer.</p><p>As we mentioned, NFTs can be used for various different practical purposes. Even though these are important, they are not the reason for NFTs popularity. The fact that they can be used for so many fun things such as gaming, has more impact on their popularity.</p><p>To get the most out of NFTs, you should always keep up with the possibilities it offers. This is where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://buynft.com/">BuyNFT</a> becomes so handy. To be able to get all the needed information on one site is the best way to start NFT trading. You can even find information about newest deals and other promotions that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss out on.</p>

The Walking Dead 3D Avatars are the newest addition to the official AMC Walking Dead NFT collection and they&rsquo;re coming for you.</p><p>Whether you love or hate them, Zombies (known as &ldquo;<i>Walkers</i>&rdquo; to The Walking Dead crowd) are here to stay. The mindless monsters crossed over into the mainstream and sealed their fate in modern pop culture on October 31, 2010. That Halloween night, 5&frac12; million viewers around the globe watched in horrified fascination as AMC premiered The Walking Dead (based on the 2003 comic of the same name). After an unforgettable 11-year run and the highest audience ratings in history, the beloved fan favorite ends in November. But the legacy lives on in Orange Comet&rsquo;s official Walking Dead 3D Avatar collection, debuting on October 5th.</p><p>Loaded with the most terrifying and beautiful moments from the past 11 seasons and featuring dynamic 3D cinematic NFT animations and generative 1:1s, The Walking Dead NFTs represent a gallery of rare, unique, world-class quality digital collectibles and immersive experiences, giving fans an opportunity to own a piece of the television show&rsquo;s legacy.</p><p>The Walking Dead 3D Avatar Mint is part of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://orangecomet.com/collection/twd-lands-roadmap/">The Walking Dead Lands</a>, a post-apocalyptic open-world build-and-earn experience based on The Walking Dead universe. The terrifying virtual experience is crawling with relentlessly hungry walkers looking to consume human brains, amidst a visually stunning and formidable realistic digital world anthropomorphized by the amazing visionary team at Orange Comet, the world&rsquo;s premier Web3 entertainment company. To enter the experience, you will need at least one avatar.</p><p>Walker Land makes up most of the world. It cannot be claimed, but it can be explored and contains plenty of useful things, such as resources to scavenge, trade, or sell. Plus, one might be able to capture roaming walkers. Be cautious though, discoveries aren&rsquo;t always what&rsquo;s expected.

The mint is a guaranteed rarity mint.</p><p>The Walker Access Pass is no longer available from Orange Comet but you can go to the secondary market to get one. 5,000 passes were offered on March 3, 2022 and quickly sold out the same day. The pass has been a large part of the project&rsquo;s success. Walker Access Pass Holders have special benefits including the ability to pre-mint any NFTs at a lower price.</p><p><strong>The Snapshot for the allow list will be Monday, October 3, 2022, at 12:00 Noon Pacific.</strong> If you do not have a Walker Access Pass and want to participate in the Allow List mint, you are encouraged to purchase yours as soon as possible from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://opensea.io/collection/thewalkingdeadofficial">OpenSea</a>.</p><p>Own a piece of television history and take the plunge into the world of NFTs. The phenomenal team at Orange Comet always pleases and their collections have been known to sell out in minutes. The Walking Dead 3D Avatars immortalize one of the most watched shows in history. Now you can have ownership of this global favorite, perfectly tailored for every fan.</p><p>For more information on this exciting drop visit:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://orangecomet.com/collection/twd-lands-avatars/">Website</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/orangecometnft">Twitter</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.gg/orangecomet">Discord</a></p>

Earning USDT through staking is what the exchange <a href="https://ascendex.com/signup/earn-1?inviteCode=BCNEWS">AscendEX</a><u> </u>is offering in an exclusive event that started on September 19! Before going into the details of this campaign, let&#8217;s start by mentioning the latest major developments around AscendEX.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/89411/224393/ascendex.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/89411/224393/responsive-images/ascendex___media_library_original_941_141.jpg 941w, https://cimg.co/news/89411/224393/responsive-images/ascendex___media_library_original_900_134.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/89411/224393/responsive-images/ascendex___media_library_original_720_107.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/89411/224393/responsive-images/ascendex___media_library_original_600_89.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/89411/224393/responsive-images/ascendex___media_library_original_300_44.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="941" class="content-img"></figure><h2><strong>AscendEX, a mainstream exchange with growing popularity</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Crypto exchange AscendEX, formerly known as Bitmax, is a leading player in the crypto trading industry, and this is thanks to the finance experts with years of experience on Wall Street who participated in its creation. The platform was founded in 2018 to allow as wide an audience as possible, regardless of their level of experience, to explore the opportunities offered by the crypto sector. The exchange currently has nearly one million verified traders and a combined trading volume of $150 billion.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://ascendex.com/signup/earn-1?inviteCode=BCNEWS">AscendEX</a> has a comprehensive suite of tools to perform investment operations, from the simplest to the most complex. In addition, the platform&#8217;s infrastructure has been designed with a high degree of security to ensure the protection of clients&#8217; assets and portfolios. Security features include two-factor authentication, dynamic rebalancing of hot and cold portfolios to ensure that the majority of client assets are held offline at all times, and a zero-trust security mode that prohibits account unlocking by text message or phone call.</p><h2><strong>Revamping of Earn module, the beginning of a new stage for AscendEX</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>AscendEX recently revamped one of its flagship products, Earn, in an effort to revitalize its product line and offer its users the best opportunities in the market.
