										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX is seeking approval to sell its 8% stake in AI startup Anthropic Holdings.</p>
<p>The motion, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MzA1NzAzMA==&amp;id2=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span>by FTX&#8217;s current CEO, John Ray III, requests permission to sell the stake and proposes two possible procedures, including an auction or a private sale.</p>
<p>FTX aims to expedite the deliberation process by requesting a shortened period for objections to be raised, with a court hearing scheduled for February 22.</p>
<p>The precise price sought for the Anthropic shares has been redacted from the filing, as FTX&#8217;s legal team believes public disclosure could hinder the potential to obtain higher offers for the stake.</p>
<p>Anthropic Holdings achieved a reported valuation of up to $18 billion in December 2023, indicating that <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftxs-500-million-investment-openai-rival-offers-hope-for-creditors.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX&#8217;s 7.84% stake</span></a> could be worth approximately $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>This value has sparked hope among victims of the FTX collapse, as FTX anticipates having sufficient funds to fully repay all customer and creditor claims.</p>
<p>The sale of the stake in Anthropic Holdings represents a significant opportunity for FTX to generate funds and address its financial obligations.</p>
<p>By divesting this illiquid asset, FTX aims to maximize the returns for its stakeholders and fulfill its commitments to customers and creditors.</p>
<h2>FTX Files Motion to Sell its Claim Against Genesis</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Earlier this month, FTX also filed a motion in a Delaware court to sell its $175 million claim against bankrupt digital financial services firm Genesis Global Capital.</p>
<p>The claim was initially made by Alameda Research, FTX&#8217;s associated hedge fund.</p>
<p>If approved, FTX will have the flexibility to sell the claim in its entirety or in parts, taking advantage of the most favorable market conditions.</p>
<p>Currently, claims against Genesis are selling for 65% of their face value, significantly higher than the 38% that Alameda Research claims are fetching.</p>
<p>The motion seeks approval for a sales procedure that would apply to all sales, streamlining the process and reducing costs.</p>
<p>The sale price must be at least 95% of the highest price quoted by leading market-makers for general unsecured claims of Genesis Global Capital within three days of the sale date.</p>
<p>FTX initially sought to recover $3.9 billion from Genesis in May 2023, but later negotiated the reduced claim of $175 million in August 2023, which was approved by the court in October.</p>
<p>The decision to reduce the claim was based on the unpredictable nature of potential recoveries and the desire to avoid lengthy and costly litigation.</p>
<h2>Genesis Had $175M in FTX Accounts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
FTX faced its own troubles when irregularities were discovered in its accounting books, leading to its <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">collapse in November 2022</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p>At that time, Genesis had $175 million tied up in FTX accounts, although it claimed this did not affect its market-making activities.</p>
<p>Genesis, a subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group, filed for bankruptcy in January 2023, triggering a contentious dispute with the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange over the impact on the Gemini Earn program.</p>
<p>In a separate development, Genesis recently <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/genesis-settles-sec-lawsuit-agrees-to-21-million-civil-penalty-for-earn-product.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached a $21 million settlement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the Gemini Earn program. </span></p>
<p>This settlement will be considered during a court hearing in New York on February 14, where Genesis debtors&#8217; proposed bankruptcy reorganization plan will also be reviewed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#8217;s highly anticipated headset Vision Pro has an upcoming <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-the-metaverse.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">metaverse</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span>app from a blockchain-related company.</p>
<p>Victoria VR, a crypto-meets-virtual reality (VR) developer, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-vision-pro-set-first-170539913.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">aims to offer</span></a> an immersive metaverse experience with ultra-realistic graphics, complementing the advanced technologies of the Apple headset.</p>
<p>The app is scheduled for release in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The Victoria VR metaverse app will showcase the capabilities of the Apple Vision Pro while demonstrating the power of Web3 technology, according to a statement released by the company.</p>
<p>The move marks Apple&#8217;s entry into the virtual reality ecosystem and positions Vision Pro as a competitor to Meta&#8217;s (formerly Facebook) Meta Quest headset.</p>
<h2>Victoria VR Metaverse Powered by VR Token</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Victoria VR metaverse is powered by the VR token, an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency following the ERC-20 standard.</p>
<p>Active users and stakers of the VR token will be rewarded, with half of the revenue generated from in-game asset sales being redistributed to these participants.</p>
<p>The VR token&#8217;s market cap stands at $103 million, and its value has surged by nearly 60% in the last 24 hours, as per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Victoria VR aims to create an inclusive environment accessible to all participants.</p>
<p>The project emphasizes a &#8220;pay-to-speed&#8221; approach rather than a &#8220;pay-to-win&#8221; model, ensuring that users can earn VR tokens simply by participating in the metaverse.</p>
<p>This launch comes at a time when interest in the metaverse has been gaining momentum, with tech companies exploring opportunities in the space.</p>
<p>By combining blockchain technology with virtual reality, Victoria VR aims to offer a unique and engaging metaverse experience on the Apple Vision Pro headset.</p>
<p>As the metaverse continues to evolve and attract attention, the release of the Victoria VR metaverse app on Apple Vision Pro could be a significant development in the intersection of blockchain and VR.</p>
<h2>Meta&#8217;s Reality Labs Records $4.6 Billion in Loss</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meta subsidiary Reality Labs, which focuses on the development of the metaverse, recorded a significant <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metas-reality-labs-reports-4-65-billion-operating-loss-in-q4-2023-as-metaverse-efforts-continue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">operating loss of over $4.6 billion</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the fourth quarter of 2023.</span></p>
<p>In its fourth-quarter report, released on February 1, Meta revealed that Reality Labs reported a loss of $4.65 billion during Q4, while generating nearly $1.1 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>This operating loss marks the largest quarterly loss for Reality Labs since Meta began including the division’s financials in its reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>In 2023, Reality Labs’ total revenues amounted to just under $1.9 billion, with more than half of the annual revenue generated in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the release of the Meta Quest 3.</p>
<p>The total operating loss for 2023 reached $16.1 billion, representing a 17.5% year-on-year increase from 2022.</p>
<p>The metaverse has been a topic of intense debate in the tech world, with some industry leaders like Bill Gates expressing a tepid outlook.</p>
<p>The gloomy outlook regarding the metaverse is not entirely out of the norm, particularly since many big supporters of the idea have recently backed down from their ambitions.</p>
<p>For one, entertainment giant Disney <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/disney-closes-metaverse-division-50-laid-off-in-company-wide-staff-reduction.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a> last year that it is eliminating its metaverse division as part of broader layoffs that will impact as many as 7,000 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a> has rehired Steve Christie, its former Senior Vice President of Compliance, as the Deputy Chief Compliance Officer.</p>
<p>In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/leadership/steve-christie-announced-as-binance-deputy-chief-compliance-officer-8955435036564475832" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent announcement</span></a>, the exchange said Christie&#8217;s primary responsibility will be to enhance Binance&#8217;s compliance framework by collaborating with regulators, industry leaders, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>His extensive compliance expertise and familiarity with the company make him well-suited for the role.</p>
<h2>Steve Christie Returns Follows a Period of Absence</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Christie&#8217;s return follows a period of absence during which he focused on personal matters and family.</p>
<p>Taking over the position left vacant by Kristen Hecht, Binance&#8217;s previous Deputy Chief Compliance and Global Money Laundering Reporting Officer, Christie will work closely with Noah Perlman, the firm&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer.</p>
<p>Perlman expressed confidence in Christie&#8217;s capabilities, stating that his previous tenure at Binance had contributed significantly to the growth and development of the compliance team.</p>
<p>“Steve’s familiarity with Binance and deep compliance expertise makes him the perfect person to assume the DCCO role,” said Perlman.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Steve first joined Binance in 2022, the compliance team underwent fast growth and made tremendous efforts and investments to strengthen and mature its compliance culture and program, which Steve helped lead.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Perlman emphasized that compliance is an ever-evolving field, and Christie&#8217;s expertise has been instrumental in helping Binance navigate new challenges and changes.</p>
<p>By making compliance a business enabler and a driver of sustainable industry growth, Christie&#8217;s return will further strengthen Binance&#8217;s commitment to regulatory compliance.</p>
<h2>Binance Pushes for Global Expansion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last month, Binance unveiled its joint venture crypto exchange Binance Thailand, which came in collaboration with Gulf Innova, a subsidiary of Gulf Energy Development.</p>
<p>Binance Thailand, abbreviated as Binance TH, provides a platform for digital asset exchange services with Thai baht trading pairs.</p>
<p>It has also integrated with local banks in Thailand and forged a partnership with Binance Kazakhstan for brokerage services, all under the watchful supervision of Thailand’s SEC.</p>
<p>The move came as Binance.US and its global parent company, Binance, have faced regulatory scrutiny in recent months.</p>
<p>In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">initiated an enforcement action</span></a> against them, alleging the sale of unregistered securities.</p>
<p>The SEC lawsuit named Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as one of the defendants, accusing him of controlling Binance.US despite claiming it operated independently.</p>
<p>In November, Zhao stepped down as CEO and <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">pleaded guilty to an anti-money laundering violation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, agreeing to pay a $50 million fine. </span></p>
<p>Binance, as a company, also settled with the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, paying a hefty $4.3 billion in penalties.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Binance is <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bernstein-report-binance-will-remain-the-top-global-crypto-exchange-despite-doj-settlement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">expected to maintain its position</span></a> as the dominant global exchange, even after reaching a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>
<p>Some analysts even claimed that the plea deal between Binance and the DOJ is a favorable outcome for both Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the company itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bug in the user interface implementation of Friend.tech has led to traders overpaying for &#8216;keys&#8217; on the platform.</p>
<p>In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/ELaszlo_/status/1753096355592155498" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent post on X</span></a>, security researchers Pawel Wylecial and &#8216;E.Laszlo&#8217; said the bug arises from the user interface caching information before transactions are created, causing it to fall out of sync with the blockchain over time.</p>
<p>The issue is most likely triggered when multiple users trade &#8216;keys&#8217; for the same account.</p>
<p>Traders, unknowingly affected by this bug, ended up overpaying for their &#8216;keys.&#8217;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Issue 1: Lack of UI synchronization with the current blockchain status resulting in outdated prices to fill out the transaction data.</p>
<p>Issue 2: No refund function is implemented for such transactions.</p>
<p>Result: More than 440 (+187 through app) excess ETH sent and locked forever.</p>
<p>&mdash; E.Laszlo (@ELaszlo_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELaszlo_/status/1753096358704435339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Traders Overpaied 2.44 ETH to Acquire Keys</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
During one particular launch, E.Laszlo observed traders spending an excessive amount of 2.44 ether to acquire &#8216;keys.&#8217;</p>
<p>According to Dune&#8217;s analysis, the total excess expenditure by traders is estimated to be around 445 ether.</p>
<p>Additionally, approximately 43,173 transactions were processed through the flawed front end.</p>
<p>The analysis further highlights that two traders, dpats_ and HerroCrypto, have sent over 1 ether in excess payments.</p>
<p>The researchers claim to have previously reported the bug to the Friend.tech team.</p>
<p>However, the team allegedly classified it as &#8216;out of scope,&#8217; suggesting that no action was taken to address the issue.</p>
<h2>Friend.tech&#8217;s Popularity Drops After Splashy Debut</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Friend.tech, launched on August 10, 2023, has become one of the top decentralized applications (dApps) on the Base layer, attracting over 200,000 users and facilitating a trading volume exceeding $230 million.</p>
<p>The platform uniquely converts user influence into tradable tokens known as &#8220;keys,&#8221; allowing users to gain access to a creator&#8217;s attention or influence.</p>
<p>The model has attracted not only cryptocurrency influencers but also NBA players and esports personalities, broadening its appeal beyond the crypto space.</p>
<p>One significant factor contributing to Friend.tech&#8217;s popularity was the hype surrounding the Base network, a Layer 2 solution associated with Coinbase.</p>
<p>The involvement of Paradigm, an investment firm connected to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>, further increased confidence in Friend.tech&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>However, the platform has also faced privacy concerns, particularly regarding the potential for user doxxing due to the link between Twitter profiles and Ethereum addresses.</p>
<p>Friend.tech has addressed these concerns by clarifying that the information deemed leaked was actually from their public API, showcasing the platform&#8217;s open nature while also highlighting the importance of user caution in protecting personal information.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Friend.tech has seen its popularity drop as of late.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://dune.com/tk-research/friendtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dune analytics dashboard</span></a>, the project raked in more than $1 million in revenue last year.</p>
<p>However, its revenue has recently fallen to under $20,000 over the past couple of days.</p>

<p>The SEC has already <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-delays-grayscales-spot-eth-etf-application.htm">delayed decisions</a> on applications from Grayscale and BlackRock. Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fidelity-follows-blackrock-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-where-next-for-ether-eth.htm">Fidelity&#8217;s proposal</a>, submitted in November, faces a crucial March deadline.</p>
<p>But, what are the chances of these products being approved soon? And does the approval of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> spot ETFs set a precedent for their potential approval?</p>
<h2>Spot Ether ETFs Could Face Challenges Similar to Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Gaining approval for Bitcoin ETFs was a lengthy and legally complex process. Brian Evans, CEO of BDE Ventures, suspects something similar will happen when it comes to the proposed Ether ETFs.</p>
<p>“There will be long, possibly drawn-out discussions over such issues as cash or in-kind redemptions as well as surveillance-sharing agreements,” he told Cryptonews.</p>
<p>“These were some of the issues with the BTC ETFs that had to be sorted out, and I suspect that something similar will play out with Ethereum.” He believes it&#8217;s highly likely that they will eventually receive approval.</p>
<h2>Impact of Ethereum&#8217;s Classification on ETF Approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ethereum currently exists in a regulatory ambiguity. But Rostin Behnam, Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), <a href="https://events.law.rutgers.edu/event/1866">previously said</a> it should be regulated as a commodity.</p>
<p>Clear definitions for decentralization from regulators like the CFTC will play a crucial role in the potential approval of a spot ETH ETF.</p>
<p>“End users of the ETF need clarity on who controls Ethereum if it really is a commodity. Ideally is ‘nobody’ like BTC,” said Pontem co-founder Alejo Pinto.</p>
<p>“The question I would ask if it’s a security: who controls it? Who is responsible for reporting requirements of ETH? I doubt Vitalik would do it,” he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if ether is categorized as a security, this could significantly complicate matters.</p>

<p>Ethereum enables users to use their Ether (ETH) tokens as collateral to support the network and engage in transaction validation. Under its proof-of-stake system, validators lock tokens to secure the blockchain and earn interest-like returns.</p>
<p>Consequently, certain regulators perceive this model as resembling an investment contract. This, by definition, could subject the asset to US securities laws.</p>
<h2>What if ETH is a Security?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously suggested that cryptocurrencies offering token staking <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-sec-chair-gary-gensler-refuses-say-if-eth-security-bullish-for-ethereum.htm">might be considered securities</a>.</p>
<p>Helika CEO Anton Umnov noted that such a classification would lead to greater SEC oversight and a focus on crypto market maturity.</p>
<p>Cryptosmart CEO Alessandro Frizzoni agreed, saying the possibility of Ethereum being labeled a security poses a hurdle to the ETF&#8217;s approval.</p>
<p>“It threatens the survival of the Ethereum project itself and could therefore put the Ethereum ecosystem under great uncertainty. I think Ethereum is decentralized enough to not be classified as a security and therefore the Spot Ethereum ETF will ultimately be approved,” Frizzoni said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Ethereum is categorized as a security, it would restrict the involvement of infrastructure partners and custodians in overseeing the ETF.</p>
<h2>Custody Challenges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Conversely, if Ether is not classified as a security, it could potentially follow a less strict regulatory route. It would still be required to address significant concerns related to investor protection and the integrity of the market, according to Web3 security firm HashEx CEO Dmitry Mishunin.</p>
<p>Mishunin pointed out that the market shouldn&#8217;t anticipate a substantial price spike after the approval of such an ETF.</p>
<p>“The market has a way of pricing in such developments well before they officially occur, meaning that by the time of approval, the event&#8217;s potential impact on Ethereum&#8217;s price might already be reflected in its current valuation,” he said.</p>
<p>Industry insiders also say the ETF issuers need to accurately track Ethereum&#8217;s price and securely handle custody of the underlying assets. BlackRock getting in on it makes an approval seem more likely, but regulators will still need more clarity.</p>
<h2>Spot Ether ETF Approval Timeline</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Deutsche Bank expects the first such ETF <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-expected-may-23rd-and-could-surge-in-value-new-report-says.htm">to be approved by May 23</a>. Meanwhile, TD Cowen <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-timeline-predictions-td-cowen.htm">expects approval to drag on</a> to 2025 or 2026.</p>
<p>Other crypto executives have mixed opinions, indicating that the outcome primarily hinges on political variables.</p>
<p>COZ CEO Tyler Adams is skeptical it will happen this year, pointing to regulators’ cautious approach when dealing with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>“I think that Ethereum is a pretty large, fundamental leap from Bitcoin due to its underlying model. Ethereum has an infinite supply and its technological volatility renders the discussion increasingly complex – the same does not exist for Bitcoin,” he said.</p>
<p>LayerTwo Labs co-founder Austin Alexander believes that approval may come to fruition in the next year or two.</p>
<p>“Even with a change at the SEC, perhaps with a Trump presidential victory, it’s still unclear to me that new leadership would speed things up in this regard,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Phillip Shoemaker, executive director of decentralized identity firm Identity.com is double the spot ETH ETF will ever materialize.</p>
<p>“Look how long it took the BTC ETFs to get approved, after all. If anything, I suspect that the SEC might soon go after the Ethereum blockchain and associated tokens,” he said.</p>
<p>“All this said, I do hope it happens. It would help further mainstream the space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Get your daily, bite-sized digest of blockchain and crypto news – investigating the stories flying under the radar of today’s news.</em></p>
<p>In today’s crypto news roundup edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>US Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Approval May Lead to ‘Regulatory Headache’</li>
<li>Animoca Brands, Delphi Ventures, Amber Group, and Other Big Players Invest in Pixelmon</li>
<li>BlackRock Ten-folded Bitcoin Mining Stocks: From $76M to $775M</li>

<h2>US Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Approval May Lead to ‘Regulatory Headache’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It could take months for options on new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-foresee-a-bitcoin-etf-offering-by-charles-schwab-trillions-to-enter-the-market.htm">spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) to gain regulatory approval, “potentially dampening the appeal of the underlying products,” Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/regulatory-nod-us-spot-bitcoin-etf-options-may-take-months-sources-2024-02-01/">reported</a>, citing multiple industry sources.</p>
<p>The sources explained that options on the Bitcoin ETFs are delayed because there is no established regulatory process for approving them.</p>
<p>The US <strong>Securities and Exchanges Commission</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-to-withdraw-case-against-crypto-startup-debt-box-following-admission-of-inaccuracy.htm">SEC</a>) typically approves them just days after an ETF starts trading. However, the problem is that regulators view <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-police-seized-1-77-billion-in-bitcoin-from-chinese-investment-fraud-more-crypto-news.htm">Bitcoin</a> as a commodity, so spot Bitcoin ETF options may also require approval from the <strong>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cftc-committee-recommends-enhanced-understanding-and-regulation-of-defi.htm">CFTC</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, spot Bitcoin ETF-related products could raise questions about jurisdiction and oversight.</p>
<p>According to Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at <strong>MarketVector Indexes</strong>, which provides the benchmark for <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/liquidity-and-regulatory-issues-are-obstacles-to-tokenization-of-real-world-assets-says-van-eck-ceo.htm">VanEck&#8217;s</a></strong> spot Bitcoin ETF:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This dual regulatory engagement adds a layer of complexity and potential for what some might call regulatory headache.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Leinweber argued it could take 2-10 months for the approvals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, analysts have argued that big investors could help drive as much as $100 billion into the ETFs. But that may not happen without the options, as they face risk management issues.</p>
<p>Yesha Yadav, a law professor at <strong>Vanderbilt University</strong>, argued that some big investors may “stay away altogether.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the delay prevents the industry from bringing more innovative products to market.</p>
<p>“The markets really want to go there, but the regulators are the gatekeepers,” opined John Roglieri, head of capital markets at ETF marker-maker <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/celsius-wallet-transfers-36m-into-coinbase-and-falconx-platforms-whats-going-on.htm">FalconX</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Animoca Brands, Delphi Ventures, Amber Group, and Other Big Players Invest in Pixelmon</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the latest crypto news, decentralized web3 gaming IP <strong>Pixelmon</strong> has raised a seed investment of $8 million. It will use the funding to continue development across its differentiated portfolio of casual and mid-core games.</p>
<p>Per the press release shared with <em>Cryptonews</em>, the round saw participation from <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/animoca-brands-and-hashkey-sign-strategic-partnership-deal-more-crypto-news.htm">Animoca Brands</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-labs-coinfund-lead-10-million-funding-round-for-cosmos-blockchain-neutron.htm">Delphi Ventures</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/troubled-crypto-lender-amber-group-raises-300-million-amid-layoffs-refocusing-efforts.htm">Amber Group</a></strong>, <strong>Bing Ventures</strong>, <strong>Bitscale Capital</strong>, <strong>Cypher Capital</strong>, <strong>Foresight Ventures</strong>, <strong>Mechanism Capital</strong>, <strong>Sfermion</strong>, <strong>Spartan Labs</strong>, <strong>VistaLabs</strong>, and others.</p>
<p>The round also saw participation from a long list of founders, angels, KOLs, and ecosystem partners, it said. These include Ray Chan, founder of <strong>9GAG Inc.;</strong> Kun Gao, founder of <strong>Crunchyroll</strong>; Robbie Ferguson, co-founder of <strong>Immutable</strong>; Gabby Dizon, co-founder of <strong>Yield Guild Games</strong> (YGG); and founders of cryptocurrency exchanges <strong>Bit2Me</strong> and <strong>Tokocrypto</strong> and web3 advisory firm <strong>Emfarsis</strong>.</p>
<p>The funding follows the successful launch of <strong>Kevin the Adventurer</strong> (KTA), Pixelmon’s first hypercasual game. Deployed in October 2023 on <strong>Coinbase&#8217;s</strong> native Layer 2 <strong>Base</strong>, the side-scroller saw 36,000 active players and 10,100 hours played in its launch month.</p>
<p>A second hypercasual game, <strong>PixelPals</strong>, which features pet and habitat management blended with trading card mechanics, is set to launch on <strong>Mantle</strong> this first quarter.</p>
<p>The team focuses on major releases for the core Pixelmon IP, including a rebuild of its free-to-play desktop title <strong>Arena</strong>, new Pixelmon abilities, and core game loops, targeting a 2024 release.</p>
<p>Further, <strong>Hunting Grounds</strong>, an open-world adventure game with RPG elements and PvP autobattler tournaments, is set for the open beta in 2024 and a full release in early 2025.</p>
<p>Pixelmon plans to grow its decentralized IP across verticals via franchises, sublicenses, and joint ventures. This includes merchandise, trading card games, animated series, comic books, and more.</p>
<h2>BlackRock Ten-folded Bitcoin Mining Stocks: From $76M to $775M</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The world’s largest asset manager <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-ibit-etf-soars-surpasses-2-billion-market-cap-in-crypto-milestone.htm">BlackRock</a></strong> “has not only been answering client demands for its spot Bitcoin ETF but also scooping up mining stocks,” <a href="https://blocksbridge.substack.com/p/blackrock-bitcoin-mining-mara-riot-clsk">according</a> to the latest Miner Weekly report by <strong>BlocksBridge Consulting</strong>.</p>
<p>BlackRock’s asset and investment management subsidiaries already increased their stakes in <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-marathon-digitals-record-mining-boosts-btc-amid-etf-hopes.htm">Marathon</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/leading-crypto-miners-riot-terawulf-cleanspark-brace-for-2024-bitcoin-halving.htm">Riot</a></strong> in 2023.</p>
<p>Per recent SEC filings, says the report, BlackRock’s subsidiaries bought even more shares of <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-buys-another-193-million-of-mining-equipment-after-stock-downturn.htm">CleanSpark</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The company picked up more shares in Riot, Marathon, and CleanSpark by 36%, 100%, and 205%, respectively, the report found.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160657" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160657" style="width: 1836px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160657" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875722-miner-weekly.png" alt="" width="1836" height="822" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875722-miner-weekly.png 1836w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875722-miner-weekly-300x134.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875722-miner-weekly-1024x458.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875722-miner-weekly-768x344.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875722-miner-weekly-1536x688.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706875722-miner-weekly-150x67.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1836px) 100vw, 1836px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160657" class="wp-caption-text">Source: blocksbridge.substack.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>The increase in positions is partially fueling the price rally of Bitcoin mining stocks, it said.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has led BlackRock’s total holdings in the three mining companies to reach $775 million as of December 31. This is up from $76 million a year ago.</p>
<p>One underlying trend, says the report, is the scale of equity dilution among these mining companies. It was &#8220;used to fund their growth and capital expenditure as the industry learns from the lesson of over-leveraging during the 2021 bull run.“</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is now exploring tech solution for privacy concerns of central bank digital currency (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDC</a>).</p>
<p>According to an insider who is familiar with the government’s CBDC moves, India is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/02/02/india-cbdc-insider-reveals-current-stance-of-countrys-central-bank/">making progress in CBDCs</a> with caution. The unnamed source told CoinDesk that the central bank is keen on improving privacy issues associated with the digital rupee.</p>
<p>“A privacy legislation is not the only way. Other ways to tackle this problem – particularly technology – do exist, and our team is exploring that,” the officer noted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the source also revealed that India’s CBDC pilot might see participation from local startups in the future.</p>
<p>“The evolution of a CBDC requires experimentation and considerable efforts to make it a secure product for the nation, and that can take time,” the official added.</p>
<p>Additionally, the officer confirmed that RBI does not have crypto taxation in its domain. Taxation of digital assets comes under legislation and is the sole responsibility of the government, the insider noted.</p>
<h2>India Budget 2024 Skips Crypto Tax Change</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
India’s recent budget session did not mention any changes to its existing crypto tax deducted at source (TDS) policy. The country previously announced 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% TDS on all transactions, affecting the local crypto service providers and investors.</p>
<p>On Feb 1., Social medias overflowed with hash tags #ReduceCryptoTax urging the Indian government to lower the taxes imposed on cryptos. During the interim budget presented in the parliament on Thursday, the country’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman noted that there is no changes on taxes implemented of digital currencies.</p>
<p>Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of India-based crypto exchange Unocoin said that the campaign to reduce crypto tax “won’t stop.” In his post on X (Twitter), he wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today, it marks the second anniversary of this #reducecryptotax campaign that we started on 1st Feb 2022. The day of budget speech when 30% income tax, 1% TDS and no set off of losses were announced. It won’t stop till we have fair crypto tax.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Rajagopal Menon, VP of crypto exchange WazirX said that cryptos can be a force multiplier in achieving a developed nation. He further told Cryptonews that digital public infrastructure will benefit from integrating provisions for long term financing of domestic crypto projects given how India is at a pivotal phase in the crypto revolution.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We expect these developments to factor in the government&#8217;s agenda along with our existing requests for a reduction in TDS rates to 0.01 percent and offset of losses for traders.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renowned comedian Larry David has expressed regret over his decision to star in a Super Bowl commercial for the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The FTX ad aired during Super Bowl LVI.</p>
<p>Speaking during the final season premiere of &#8220;Curb Your Enthusiasm,&#8221; the hit show in which he stars, David admitted to feeling foolish for participating in the advertisement despite seeking advice from knowledgeable friends.</p>
<p>The commercial, which aired in 2022, featured David comically rejecting past inventions before ultimately dismissing FTX.</p>
<p>However, the aftermath revealed a darker side, as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/disgraced-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-friend-found-guilty-on-all-seven-fraud-charges.htm">FTX&#8217;s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was recently found guilty</a> of defrauding customers, lenders, and investors.</p>
<p>The exchange has subsequently filed for bankruptcy, leaving celebrities who promoted FTX, including David, Tom Brady, and Steph Curry, facing a lawsuit filed in November 2022.</p>
<h2>Larry David Says He Consulted Friends About the FTX Ad</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Recalling the decision-making process behind his involvement, David revealed that he had consulted friends who were well-versed in the industry to seek their opinions.</p>
<p>Assured that it was a legitimate opportunity, he reluctantly agreed to take part.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So, like an idiot, I did it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="Larry David on his 2022 cryptocurrency Super Bowl ad" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9x1It5GxYgE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The Larry David FTX ad humorously portrayed him rejecting historical inventions with his signature wit and conviction.</p>
<p>However, the subsequent revelation of FTX&#8217;s fraudulent activities added a bitter twist to the tale.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/disgraced-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-friend-found-guilty-on-all-seven-fraud-charges.htm">has been convicted</a> for defrauding various parties, which has left him awaiting sentencing.</p>
<p>As a consequence of their involvement with FTX, David and other celebrities who promoted the platform <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tom-brady-larry-david-face-class-action-for-endorsing-ftx-suit-alleges-they-backed-unregistered-securities.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">were hit with a class action lawsuit</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> following the company’s implosion. </span></p>
<p>The class action lawsuit, filed in November 2022, claims that Sam Bankman-Fried, NFL quarterback Tom Brady, and comedian Larry David misled customers and engaged in deceptive practices to sell FTX yield-bearing digital currency accounts.</p>
<p>Other celebrities listed in the lawsuit include Kevin O’Leary, Golden State Warriors, Shaquille O’Neal, Udonis Haslem, David Ortiz, Naomi Osaka, and more.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that the celebrities actively participated in the sale of unregistered securities through yield-bearing accounts.</p>
<p>David, who had a portion of his salary tied up in cryptocurrency, even said he was willing to be part of the lawsuit, acknowledging the significant financial losses he incurred.</p>
<h2>FTX to Pay Creditors</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a recent hearing, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich revealed that the company has been negotiating with potential bidders and investors since October 2023, but none were willing to contribute sufficient funds to rebuild the FTX exchange.</p>
<p>Therefore, the platform has chosen to abandon and has instead decided to liquidate all assets, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-commits-to-full-customer-repayment-scraps-exchange-restart-heres-the-latest.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">returning funds to its customers</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p>At the hearing, the company sought approval for a process to ascertain the amounts owed to each creditor and customer.</p>
<p>US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/ftx-expects-to-repay-customers-in-full-bankruptcy-lawyer-says">ruled</a> that the size of each claim would be determined based on what the customer or creditor was owed on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity firm Cybertrace has issued a stark warning regarding a highly convincing deepfake video featuring Australian mining magnate and businessman Andrew &#8220;Twiggy&#8221; Forrest.</p>
<p>The deepfake video, which has surfaced on social media platforms, shows Forrest promoting a fake cryptocurrency trading platform that promises high returns.</p>
<p>The video, which initially appeared on Facebook, encourages users to sign up for a fraudulent platform claiming to generate substantial daily profits for &#8220;ordinary people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victims are directed to a website called &#8220;Quantum AI,&#8221; a name that Cybertrace says is intertwined with scams and financial fraud.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another Deepfake identified<a href="https://t.co/LcsKDukOPX">https://t.co/LcsKDukOPX</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Cybertrace (@Cybertrace_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cybertrace_com/status/1752533475994030480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Scammers Behind the Deep Fake Have Sales Expertise</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/andrew-forrest-deepfake-video-scam-targets-aussies/news-story/6c53931854a4f30d2a593615a74bade9?amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">comment</span></a>, Cybertrace CEO Dan Halpin claimed that the deepfake video could deceive individuals, as the scammers behind it appear to possess sales expertise.</p>
<p>Halpin further noted its length and repetitive nature, which enhances its convincing nature.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The video is long and in many ways repetitive, which can be quite convincing, and appears to have been created by someone with knowledge of sales and marketing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The deepfake manipulates Forrest&#8217;s behavior and body language, utilizing footage from a &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; conducted by Rhodes Trust in October.</p>
<p>Cybertrace detected the deepfake video on January 27, showcasing an <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-deepfakes-becoming-tool-of-choice-cyber-extortion-says-fbi-how-crypto-being-used-process.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AI-altered version</span></a> of Forrest endorsing a fictitious cryptocurrency trading software.</p>
<p>In the video, the altered version of Forrest promises viewers the opportunity to join him and his team as partners in the world&#8217;s most intelligent stock and cryptocurrency trading software, guaranteeing substantial profits regardless of market conditions.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Scam Alert - Deepfake Video Impersonating Andrew Forrest" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AW20XyepsjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Forrest, a former CEO of Western Australian mining firm Fortescue Metals Group, is a highly successful entrepreneur with a net worth of $29.4 billion.</p>
<p>The deepfake video concludes with Forrest urging viewers to sign up for the platform before it&#8217;s too late, adding an element of urgency to the scam.</p>
<h2>Deepfake Fraud Sees a Surge</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cybertrace has cautioned users to exercise extra vigilance due to the recent surge in deepfake fraud.</p>
<p>In addition to Forrest, other notable Australian individuals such as Gina Rinehart, the country&#8217;s richest person, entrepreneur Dick Smith, and TV host Allison Langdon have also been targeted by scammers using deepfake videos, as highlighted by Cybertrace.</p>
<p>As reported, Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister of Singapore, has <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pm-of-singapore-alerts-residents-to-deepfake-crypto-scam-using-his-image.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">also warned</span></a> his social media followers regarding the use of deepfake videos that use his voice and image to promote cryptocurrency scams.</p>
<p>At the time, Loong even shared an example video of himself being interviewed, which was created by scammers to endorse a fraudulent “hands-free crypto trading” scheme.</p>
<p>“The use of deepfake technology to spread disinformation will continue to grow,” said Loong.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We must remain vigilant and learn to protect ourselves and our loved ones against such scams.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Scammers have been employing various methods to deceive individuals and steal their fiat currency or tokens since the inception of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In 2020, hackers <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/twitter-hack-victims-face-new-personal-data-breech-threats-7210.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">compromised the accounts</span></a> of prominent Twitter users, including former United States President Barack Obama and President-elect Joe Biden, to promote a Bitcoin scam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Genesis Global and its affiliated entities have reached a settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), agreeing to pay a civil penalty of $21 million.</p>
<p>The settlement, which resolves the SEC&#8217;s civil lawsuit against Genesis over the &#8220;unregistered offer and sale of securities&#8221; through the Gemini Earn program, was <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-01/bankrupt-crypto-lender-genesis-settles-sec-s-earn-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">proposed in a filing on January 31</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</span></p>
<p>According to the filing, the proposed settlement is the result of extensive negotiations between Genesis Global Holdco (GGC) and the SEC.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>SEC Settlement Provides Numerous Benefits to GGC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The settlement will provide several benefits to GGC&#8217;s estates, including the resolution of the SEC&#8217;s Civil Action Claim filed in these Chapter 11 Cases.</p>
<p>By reaching this settlement, Genesis would eliminate the risks, expenses, and uncertainty associated with protracted litigation against the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-lending-crisis-gemini-and-genesis-charged-by-us-sec-with-selling-unregistered-securities.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed its lawsuit against</span></a> Genesis and Gemini in January 2023, focusing on the period between February 2021 and November 2022.</p>
<p>The commission alleged that both firms violated U.S. securities laws through their crypto lending program.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the legal proceedings, Genesis suspended withdrawals on its platform in November 2022 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in January 2023.</p>
<p>The settlement announcement marks the latest development in a series of legal actions between Gemini, Genesis, Genesis&#8217; parent company Digital Currency Group, and its CEO Barry Silbert.</p>
<h2>Genesis Global Trading to Pay $8M to DFS</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On January 12, Genesis Global Trading, an entity distinct from Genesis Global Capital and unrelated to the Gemini Earn program, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/genesis-global-trading-settles-with-nydfs-pays-8-million-penalty-and-surrenders-bitlicense.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">agreed to pay an $8 million</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> penalty to the New York Department of Financial Services. </span></p>
<p>The settlement followed an investigation that uncovered &#8220;significant failings&#8221; in the company&#8217;s Anti-Money Laundering and cybersecurity programs.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Genesis Global Trading agreed to cease operations in New York and surrender its BitLicense.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the SEC recently announced a $24 million settlement in its case against Bittrex and its former CEO William Shihara for operating an unregistered exchange.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Over the past year, the SEC has filed numerous lawsuits against crypto firms, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler consistently asserting that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities.</p>
<p>For one, the agency initiated a civil case <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-and-cftcs-lawsuits-against-sam-bankman-fried-put-on-hold-by-us-judge-heres-why.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">against Sam Bankman-Fried</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, co-founder of FTX. </span></p>
<p>In addition to the case against Bankman-Fried, the SEC filed lawsuits against other major crypto players, including <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance, its CEO Changpeng Zhao</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-coinbase-sues-sec-demands-court-compel-response-rulemaking-petition-heres-latest.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p>All three entities have denied any wrongdoing and have requested the dismissal of the regulator’s cases.</p>
<p>However, in a major blow to the commission, the agency was recently <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-to-withdraw-case-against-crypto-startup-debt-box-following-admission-of-inaccuracy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">forced to withdraw</span></a> its lawsuit against crypto startup DEBT Box after admitting to making inaccurate statements in court.</p>

<p>Prior to that, Judge Shelby <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-lawyers-warned-by-judge-for-misleading-request-in-crypto-case.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">criticized the agency’s lawyers</span></a> and demanded an explanation for the “false or misleading” statements made by the SEC, claiming that DEBT Box was attempting to move assets offshore to evade regulatory oversight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The High Court of Singapore turned down plea from the now-defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/three-arrows-capital/">3AC</a>) to dismiss DeFiance Capital’s lawsuit filed against the fund.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2024_SGHC_21">recent hearing</a>, Judge Chua Lee Ming gave greenlight to Defiance Capital in its $140 million dispute with 3AC. Further, the court ordered 3AC to pay SG$15,000 and legal disbursements to DeFiance Capital.</p>
<p>A former restructuring attorney, who goes by the pseudonym WassieLawyer, wrote series of posts on X (Twitter), explaining the case. He has been working with DeFiance Capital founder Arthur Cheong on the case.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>DeFiance Capital&#8217;s Dispute Against 3AC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For the past year, DeFiance Capital has been locked in a dispute with the beleaguered 3AC, that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-turmoil-3ac-files-for-bankruptcy-ftx-and-blockfi-agree-suspensions-at-voyager.htm">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> on June 30, 2022. The hedge fund claimed that the investor’s assets belong to the 3AC and should be paid to creditors of 3AC.</p>
<p>Arthur Cheong wrote in a <a href="https://writing.defiance.capital/our-statement-and-update-on-dispute-with-three-arrows-capital-ltd-3ac-2a2624ebee5a">recent blog post</a> that his company has been trying hard to help the liquidators of 3AC understand that “DeFiance Capital have exclusive, unfettered control and beneficial ownership over its assets.”</p>
<p>The court declared that though Cheong’s assets were placed on 3AC platform, he had an independent control over it. In the legal pursuit against 3AC firm, DeFiance gained full support from the court. According to WassieLawyer, the move brings some “much-needed vindication” for Cheong.</p>

The Court announced in October, 2023 that it will take forward the dispute<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-court-adjudicate-defiance-capitals-140-million-dispute-with-3ac-liquidators.htm">, against the will</a> of the 3AC liquidators. The liquidators argued that assets locked at DeFiance Capital must be included in the 3AC bankruptcy estate for distribution to creditors.</p>
<p>Per the hearing last year, the Judge pointed out the importance of evidence related to DeFiance Capital founder’s assets control. Judge Ming also emphasized the location where the DeFiance’s assets were held, and the creation of the Trust in Singapore.</p>
<p>Following the hearing, Cheong <a href="https://twitter.com/Arthur_0x/status/1691400992645087232">posted in social media</a>, “We are delighted that High Court of Singapore agreed with our position.” He added that, though both 3AC and DeFiance Capital were based out of Singapore, the liquidators insisted that the dispute be resolved in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>“Our position was that all the important witnesses and documents are in Singapore. The dispute ought to be heard by the Singapore Courts to ensure all relevant evidence would be available,” Cheong noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia’s digital ruble pilot is gathering pace, with 17 more banks joining the Central Bank’s CBDC project.</p>
<p>The group of banks includes heavyweights such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-business-titan-sber-join-digital-ruble-pilot.htm">Sberbank</a> and Tinkoff, the <a href="https://www.cbr.ru/fintech/dr/#a_156753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Bank explained in an official statement</a>.</p>
<p>This represents a major coup for the Central Bank. Both Sberbank and Tinkoff <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-analyst-digital-ruble-brings-no-benefits-for-ordinary-citizens.htm">pulled out of the first phase</a> of the pilot prior to launch last year. In an <a href="https://t.me/centralbank_russia/1541" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Telegram post</a>, the Central Bank explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The [banks] have already signed an agreement to join the digital ruble platform. [They] are now setting up their systems to enter the pilot when it is expanded.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The move takes the number of banks and financial institutions in the pilot to 30. The bank also said that “30 trading and service providers” are also taking part in the pilot.</p>
<p>In addition to Sberbank and Tinkoff, the list of newly added banks also includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>AB Russia</li>
<li>Bank Orenburg</li>
<li>Russian Standard Bank</li>
<li>Russian Bank for Small and Medium Enterprises Support</li>
<li>Russian Agricultural Bank</li>
<li>Expobank</li>
<li>Novikombank</li>
<li>Russian Regional Development Bank</li>
<li>Bank Kuban Kredit</li>
<li>Tochka Bank</li>
<li>Primtercombank</li>
<li>RosDor Bank</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-russian-banks-say-theyll-join-digital-ruble-pilot-cbdc-advances.htm">Center-invest Bank</a></li>
<li>National Commercial Bank of Russia</li>

</ul>

<h2>What’s Different About the New Banks Joining Russia’s CBDC Pilot?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The list includes a much wider variety of banks than the initial 13 banks that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/600-russians-trial-cbdc-next-week-digital-ruble-pilot-begins.htm">joined the first stage of the pilot in mid-2023</a>.</p>
<p>It includes two neobanks, one of which is operated by the Russian tech giant mail.ru.</p>
<p>It also comprises regional banks headquartered in areas as far afield as Primorsky Krai and the disputed territory of Crimea.</p>
<p>Two banks on the list specialize in providing finance to specific industrial sectors – namely agriculture and commodities production.</p>
<p>And this could indicate that Moscow is indeed looking to use its CBDC <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-lawmaker-suggests-china-russias-cbdcs-are-compatible.htm">to power international trade deals</a>.</p>
<p>The Kremlin hopes that Russian allies will use the CBDC as a payment tool for imports, as well as exports of food, metals, and energy resources.</p>
<p>The Central Bank is yet to provide further details of the second stage of its pilot. But analysts have claimed it could begin in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The first stage focused primarily on CBDC-powered micropayments and customer-to-business transactions.</p>
<p>Businesses trailing the coin included <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-beauty-salon-becomes-first-process-cbdc-payment.htm">a beauty salon in Yekaterinburg</a> and an online education services provider.</p>
<p>But considering the type of banks included in the new list, it may be reasonable to expect the next stage to involve more B2B transactions.</p>
<p>The fact that more regional banks are involved could mean the Central Bank wants to trial the use of the digital ruble outside Russia’s biggest cities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2023, Tether saw its assets approach the $100 billion mark, following a $6.2 billion profit according to the company&#8217;s Q4 attestation report released on January 31.</p>
<p>The financial surge, detailed in <a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-2023-q4-attestation/">Tether&#8217;s latest financial statements</a>, reflects a strategic allocation of assets.</p>
<h2><strong>Tether&#8217;s Financial Milestones</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Roughly $4 billion of those profits were “generated by US Treasuries, Reverse Repo and Money market funds,” where the company keeps the vast majority of its reserves.</p>
<p>As of December 31, the stablecoin giant held total assets worth $97 billion, versus $91.6 billion in liabilities.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fourth quarter witnessed a record-breaking net profit of $2.85 billion, of which ~$1 billion in net operating profits (were primarily interests from US Treasuries) with the remaining primarily from the appreciation of Gold and Bitcoin reserves,” Tether stated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Throughout last year, Tether used most of its profits to top up its excess reserve stash as insurance against insolvency. Now worth $5.4 billion, these excess reserves fully cover Tether’s outstanding secured loans worth $4.8 billion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tether Q4/2023 attestation is out.</p>
<p>My summary:</p>
<p>&#8211; profit for the quarter: $2.85B, of which ~$1B in net operational profit (mainly US t-bill interests), ~$1.85B from gold and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> holdings.</p>
<p>&#8211; total profit for 2023: $6.2B.</p>
<p>&#8211; cash &amp; cash equivalents cover now 90% of all… <a href="https://t.co/AXjDw33QTc">https://t.co/AXjDw33QTc</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Paolo Ardoino <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f350.png" alt="🍐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@paoloardoino) <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1752702607305691232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Such reserves were widely criticized in the past for adding risk to Tether’s portfolio should they not be repaid. As the largest stablecoin issuer, Tether must ensure that its stablecoins remain backed 1:1 by US dollars at all times for the token to retain its value – or risk an industry-wide financial wipeout.</p>
<h2>Tether&#8217;s Asset Breakdown</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The bulk of Tether’s portfolio features $82.06 billion of “cash and cash equivalents,” including $80.3 billion worth of US Treasuries.</p>
<p>It also bears the fruit of more recent investments, including $3.6 billion in gold, and another $2.1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC), alongside $5.6 billion of “other” holdings.</p>
<p>Tether has also invested $1.5 billion into VC investments in areas like AI infrastructure, Bitcoin mining, and P2P telecommunications technology. These assets aren’t considered part of the reserves backing its tokens.</p>
<p>Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The substantial net profits generated not only in the last quarter of the year but throughout the year, amounting to $6.2 billion, showcases our financial strength.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In December, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-holdings-have-the-money-they-say-they-have-confirms-cantor-ceo.htm">Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick confirmed</a> to CNBC that his firm holds Tether’s Treasury bills, quelling concerns that Tether’s stablecoins weren’t fully backed.</p>
<p>Tether is by far the largest stablecoin by market cap, with its closest competitor – Circle – boasting $26.7 billion of coins in circulation. Last month, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/usdc-stablecoin-issuer-circle-confidentially-files-for-ipo.htm">Circle filed for an initial public offering</a>.</p>
<p>Tether&#8217;s financial achievements in 2023 reflect a year of substantial growth and strategic asset management. With a focus on diversification and maintaining a solid reserve, the company has reinforced its position in the stablecoin sector. As Tether moves forward, its continued emphasis on financial stability and asset-backed security will be important for its operations and for maintaining user confidence.</p>

<p>Whilst most major cryptocurrencies remain lower in the past 24 hours, the market is attempting a rebound on Thursday, low cap shitcoins $PORK2, $SOUTH and $PORK are the top crypto gainers today on DEXTools.</p>
<p>Blue chip cryptocurrency markets dipped on Wednesday following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCIIU5YlTQ">hawkish Fed policy announcement</a>.</p>
<p>While the Fed left interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, Fed Chair Powell argued a March rate cut would be unlikely.</p>
<p>Given investors had been pricing a good chance of a rate cut in March, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-2024-01-31/#:~:text=The%20Fed%20took%20a%20major,further%20hikes%20in%20borrowing%20costs.">this weighed on market sentiment</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/'">BTC</a>) subsequently fell briefly as low as the $41,800s.</p>
<p>But it has since rebounded by around $1,000, shrugging off stronger-than-expected US ISM Manufacturing PMI numbers.</p>
<p>That’s because, while a Fed rate-cutting cycle might not start as soon as some traders want, its definitely coming.</p>
<p>Investors are still betting that rate cuts start by May, with macro likely to remain a strong tailwind in 2024.</p>
<p>While major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">ETH</a>) struggle to get into the green, some shitcoins are outperforming.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/5-small-cap-crypto-coins-to-accumulate-before-the-bitcoin-halving-in-2024.htm">Small-cap cryptocurrencies</a> almost always pumping and nearly always also take the mantle for the top crypto gainers each day.</p>
<p>That’s because their low level of liquidity means that relatively small buy pressure can easily result in fast exponential gains.</p>
<p>While blue-chip cryptocurrencies can offer good upside prospects, traders looking to make quick profits usually turn to low-cap markets.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top small-cap crypto gainers on Thursday as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/gainers">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXTools</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>PepeFork2 ($PORK)</strong></h3>
<p>A copycat version of the recently launched PepeFork ($PORK) memecoin called PepeFork2 ($PORK2) is up nearly 900% on Thursday.</p>
<p>However, $PORK2’s market cap was still only a tiny $450,000 on Thursday, with just over $300,000 in liquidity.</p>
<p>While $PORK2 has a 99/99 <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x6d2503ba72503f1d5a057b6e260c43edfe7194a3">DEXTscore</a>, it may be a honeypot scam, so is probably best avoided.</p>
<h3><strong>DeepSouth AI ($SOUTH)</strong></h3>
<p>AI shitcoin DeepSouth AI ($SOUTH) is testing record highs on Thursday.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd1e606be11b3bca2a1ec974e6bd3e110f3b131b6">DEXTools</a>, it was last up 97% on the day, making it one of the top crypto gainers today.</p>
<p>$SOUTH’s market cap was a solid $4.37 million, with locked liquidity of around $312,000.</p>
<p>The token has a solid DEXTscore of 99/99, while six smart contract issues has been identified.</p>
<h3><strong>PepeFork (PORK)</strong></h3>
<p>A newly launched Pepe Coin alternative called PepeFork (PORK) is pumping on Thursday.</p>
<p>$PORK was last up around 80% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xc026eb864dc9f9e820e010ddeeeb3c7cbaebf365">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>Its market cap is an impressive $276 million, though liquidity is a tiny $260,000.</p>
<p>Its DEXTscore is 99/99, and it has three concerning aspects to its token contract, as per DEXTools’ security audit.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Low-cap coins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>For those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<p>Whilst most major cryptocurrencies remain lower in the past 24 hours, the market is attempting a rebound on Thursday, with Chainlink (LINK), Pyth (PYTH), and Mina Protocol (MINA) looking like the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<p>Blue chip cryptocurrency markets dipped on Wednesday following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCIIU5YlTQ">hawkish Fed policy announcement</a>.</p>
<p>While the Fed left interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, Fed Chair Powell argued a March rate cut would be unlikely.</p>
<p>Given investors had been pricing a good chance of a rate cut in March, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-2024-01-31/#:~:text=The%20Fed%20took%20a%20major,further%20hikes%20in%20borrowing%20costs.">this weighed on market sentiment</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/'">BTC</a>) subsequently fell briefly as low as the $41,800s.</p>
<p>But it has since rebounded by around $1,000, shrugging off stronger-than-expected US ISM Manufacturing PMI numbers.</p>
<p>That’s because, while a Fed rate-cutting cycle might not start as soon as some traders want, its definitely coming.</p>
<p>Investors are still betting that rate cuts start by May, with macro likely to remain a strong tailwind in 2024.</p>
<p>While major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">ETH</a>) struggle to get into the green, a few major altcoins are outperforming.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best crypto to buy now on the 1<sup>st</sup> of February 2024.</p>
<h2>Best Crypto to Buy Now</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Chainlink (LINK)</strong></h3>
<p>Inter-blockchain connectivity and data sharing network Chainlink (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/chainlink/">LINK</a>) is looking like one of the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is up around 6% in 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>LINK is pushing to the top of its multi-month range.</p>
<p>A break above resistance in the $17 area could open the door to a fast move higher towards late 2021 highs in the $36-38 area.</p>
<p>That could mean short-term gains in the region of 2x.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160247" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804209-link.png" alt="" width="1776" height="706" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804209-link.png 1776w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804209-link-300x119.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804209-link-1024x407.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804209-link-768x305.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804209-link-1536x611.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804209-link-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1776px) 100vw, 1776px" /></p>
<p>That would take the cryptocurrency’s gains from January lows to 150%.</p>
<h3><strong>Pyth Network (PYTH)</strong></h3>
<p>Another inter-blockchain connectivity and data sharing network Pyth Network (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-pyth-network-pyth-price-erupts-53-after-airdrop-and-this-might-be-the-next-crypto-to-explode.htm">PYTH</a>) could be another of the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p>PYTH is up around 6% in 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pyth-network/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The protocol is designed to provide real-time, off-chain financial data to smart contracts and dApps on multiple blockchains.</p>
<p>PYTH is currently teasing a breakout above $0.44 resistance.</p>
<p>This could open the door to a swift move higher towards record highs around $0.55.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160248" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804225-pyth.png" alt="" width="1781" height="712" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804225-pyth.png 1781w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804225-pyth-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804225-pyth-1024x409.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804225-pyth-768x307.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804225-pyth-1536x614.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706804225-pyth-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1781px) 100vw, 1781px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Mina (MINA)</strong></h3>
<p>Zero-knowledge proof powered layer-1 blockchain Mina (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-mina-protocol-going-to-zero-mina-price-drops-8-as-new-mining-protocol-receives-7-million-in-funding.htm">MINA</a>) could be one of the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is up around 5% in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>MINA has been gaining bullish momentum since its strong bounce from key support at $0.97.</p>
<p>Having broken back above its 21 and 50DMAs, MINA could soon retest recent highs near $1.70.</p>
<p>The prospect of quick potential near-40% gains make MINA one of the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains.</p>
<p>But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<p>In today’s crypto news selection:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK Police Seized £1.4BN of Bitcoin from Chinese Investment Fraud</li>
<li>Industry Leaders Band Together to Launch the Digital Assets Association</li>
<li>Digital Asset Product Volumes Surge Over 200% in January</li>
</ul>
<p>__________</p>
<h2>UK Police Seized £1.4BN of Bitcoin from Chinese Investment Fraud</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <strong>UK Metropolitan Police</strong> has seized more than £1.4 billion ($1.77 billion) worth of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-dips-as-fed-chair-powell-says-march-rate-cut-unlikely-where-next-for-btc.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a>. This is one of the largest crypto seizures of by law enforcement globally, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7aec98dd-6161-4ee9-8e0e-654fc7e0fae3">according</a> to the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The seized funds came from a huge investment fraud in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-gears-up-for-updated-crypto-aml-laws-report.htm">China</a>, a London court heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jian Wen, 42, is on trial, accused of laundering Bitcoin on behalf of her former employer, Yadi Zhang (real name Zhimin Qian). The latter is an alleged fugitive from the Beijing authorities. She has also fled the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-exchange-advisory-council-adds-former-uk-chancellor-to-team.htm">UK</a>.</p>
<p>In 2018, the UK police seized four devices holding more than 61,000 BTC from a safety deposit box and a property where Wen and Zhang lived.</p>
<p>By the time the police had recovered all this BTC in July 2021, its value was about £1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Per the prosecution, Zhang had committed investment fraud in China between 2014 and 2017. She stole some £5 billion from over 128,000 investors, subsequently converting it into BTC.</p>
<p>Wen is not accused of involvement in this fraud but of helping Wen convert BTC into fiat, property, and luxury items in the UK.</p>
<p>Wen claims to have been Zhang’s “carer” and that she believed Zhang gained all bitcoin legally. The prosecution, however, argued on Monday that Wen was a “front person” paid to “keep Ms Zhang in the background.”</p>
<h2>Industry Leaders Band Together to Launch the Digital Assets Association</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the latest crypto news, the <strong>Digital Assets Association</strong> (DAA) announced its official launch. Per the press release shared with <em>Cryptonews</em>, it’s a groundbreaking transnational organization dedicated to fostering responsible development and adoption of institutional digital assets.</p>
<p>The DAA committee is made up of industry leaders who believe in the future of digital assets, it said. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Henry Zhang, Founder &amp; CEO of <strong>DigiFT</strong>;</li>
<li>Chia Hock Lai, CEO of <strong>Onfet</strong>;</li>
<li>Danny Chong, CEO of <strong>Tranchess</strong>;</li>
<li>Daniel Lee, Head of Web3 at <strong>Banking Circle</strong>;</li>
<li>Steven Hu, Head of Digital Assets, Trade &amp; Working Capital, <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>;</li>
<li>Chang Tze Ching, CEO of <strong>Bright Point International Digital Assets</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DAA launch represents a key step forward in the financial industry to facilitate greater collaboration between industry players and key stakeholders, said the press release.</p>
<p>It added that by bringing together financial institutions, fintechs, technology providers, and legal and regulatory experts, the DAA aims to bridge the gap between TradFi and the transformative potential of tokenized real-world assets (RWA).</p>
<p>The DAA will provide a platform for stakeholders to come together to: share knowledge and best practices through working groups, conferences, and online resources; develop industry standards; engage with policymakers and regulators to promote responsible legal and regulatory frameworks that foster innovation while mitigating risks; and empower future leaders through training, mentorship, and industry placements.</p>
<h2>Digital Asset Product Volumes Surge Over 200% in January</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In January, following the approval of the initial <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-foresee-a-bitcoin-etf-offering-by-charles-schwab-trillions-to-enter-the-market.htm">Bitcoin spot ETFs</a></strong>, the sector&#8217;s total assets under management (AUM) saw a period of relative stability, <a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/digital-asset-management-review-january-2024">according</a> to Digital Asset Management Review by on-chain analytics firm <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-spot-market-share-spiked-first-time-in-ten-months-as-btc-futures-products-rise-ccdata.htm">CCData</a></strong>. The report noted a small increase of 1.53% to $50.7 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the average daily aggregate trading volumes have shown a significant upward trend, surging to $2.19 billion. The 224% increase can be attributed to the ETF launch and a broader uptick in market sentiment.</p>
<p>“This was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in average daily product volumes for the industry,” it said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160003" style="width: 907px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160003" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788804-ccdata.png" alt="" width="907" height="472" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788804-ccdata.png 907w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788804-ccdata-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788804-ccdata-768x400.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788804-ccdata-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160003" class="wp-caption-text">Source: CCData</figcaption></figure>
<p>The report further noted that each ETF’s fee structure influences inflows and trading volumes. Fees are often “a key determinant for investors in a competitive market,” and “lower fees increase an ETF&#8217;s appeal.” Hence, many ETF providers recently lowered their fees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-going-to-zero-as-grayscale-sends-10000-btc-to-coinbase-best-altcoins-to-invest-in-right-now.htm">Grayscale&#8217;s</a></strong> outflows have started slowing down. Since converting to a spot Bitcoin ETF, <strong>GBTC</strong> has registered $5.23 billion in outflows. But on January 22, it recorded $641 million, and $221 million on January 30.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The overall inflow figures, even when negative, do not undermine the encouraging trajectory we have observed in the ETF market. This holds particularly true when Grayscale is excluded from the equation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The trend, CCData argues, suggests growing confidence in the digital asset space. This is likely fueled, besides ETFs, by the increasing acceptance of digital assets by institutions as a legitimate investment category.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160004" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160004" style="width: 909px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160004" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788825-ccdata-1.png" alt="" width="909" height="507" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788825-ccdata-1.png 909w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788825-ccdata-1-300x167.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788825-ccdata-1-768x428.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706788825-ccdata-1-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160004" class="wp-caption-text">Source: CCData</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Grayscale maintained the industry&#8217;s highest AUM in January, at $29.1 billion. <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-ibit-etf-soars-surpasses-2-billion-market-cap-in-crypto-milestone.htm">BlackRock</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-calls-for-comments-on-fidelitys-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">Fidelity</a></strong> recorded over $2 billion, making them the 2nd and 4th largest companies by AUM in their first month of trading. <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitwise-sets-new-precedent-as-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-to-reveal-btc-addresses.htm">Bitwise</a></strong> led the AUM increase with 81.2% to $1.32 billion.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-products-for-european-investors-experiencing-etf-fomo.htm">XBT Provider</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-btc-etf-approval-will-encourage-more-institutions-to-invest-in-bitcoin-cathie-wood.htm">21Shares</a></strong> had AUMs of $2.32 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively. <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/liquidity-and-regulatory-issues-are-obstacles-to-tokenization-of-real-world-assets-says-van-eck-ceo.htm">VanEck</a></strong> saw a 20.6% rise, while <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/etc-group-physical-ethereum-pow-zetw-etp-launching-deutsche-borse.htm">ETC Group</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gbtc-outflows-topped-2-2-billion-last-week-outweighing-all-spot-bitcoin-etf-gains-coinshares.htm">CoinShares</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-new-era-5-best-cryptocurrencies-to-hold-in-a-traditional-investment-portfolio.htm">CI Financials</a></strong> saw declines of around 10%.</p>

<p>The bill, known as the &#8220;Ley Ómnibus&#8221; or the &#8220;Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of Argentines,&#8221; initially <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/argentinas-new-government-introduces-new-bill-to-regulate-crypto-holdings-for-tax-payers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">included provisions that required taxpayers</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to declare ownership of previously undisclosed assets, including cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p>However, Minister of Interior Guillermo Francos announced the removal of these clauses, citing the need for rapid economic development and legislative efficiency as the driving factors behind the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tax part was smaller and delayed treatment,&#8221; <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.iproup.com/economia-digital/45568-no-hay-blanqueo-cripto-que-impuestos-pagan-en-argentina-el-bitcoin-y-monedas-digitales" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Francos stated</span></a>, emphasizing the government&#8217;s focus on achieving consensus on more agreeable aspects of the bill.</p>
<h2>Removal of Crypto Tax Law Creates Concern and Confusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The removal of proposed cryptocurrency taxes has created a sense of concern and confusion regarding the implications and taxation of cryptocurrencies in the country.</p>
<p>Marcos Zocaro, an accountant knowledgeable about the matter, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.iproup.com/economia-digital/45568-no-hay-blanqueo-cripto-que-impuestos-pagan-en-argentina-el-bitcoin-y-monedas-digitales" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">told local news outlet</span></a> iProUP that holding and using cryptocurrencies for payment will not be subject to taxation.</p>
<p>However, he said selling significant amounts of cryptocurrencies at a profit will incur income tax. There is also a threshold below which no tax is due.</p>
<p>The removal of the crypto tax from the omnibus bill is part of a broader strategy by the Milei administration to address public pushback, national strikes, protests, and criticism of the initial proposals.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The primary goal of the Ley Ómnibus is to introduce comprehensive economic, social, and administrative reforms aimed at fostering economic development and freedom.</p>
<p>The bill&#8217;s extensive scope and radical reforms across various sectors, including defense, capital amnesty, tax moratoriums, personal asset taxation, public works, pension systems, labor formalization, privatization of state-owned companies, export taxation, energy sector regulations, mental health, education, environmental laws, administrative restructuring, and even new divorce procedures, have sparked significant debate and concerns.</p>
<h2>Critics Express Concern About Milei&#8217;s Bill</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Critics have argued that the bill&#8217;s broad scope and radical changes could potentially undermine Argentina&#8217;s democratic framework, which has been cultivated over the past four decades, specifically regarding Argentina&#8217;s crypto tax laws.</p>
<p>Key concerns revolve around the bill&#8217;s impact on human rights and democratic institutions, as per <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://comercioyjusticia.info/justicia/alto-comisionado-de-naciones-unidas-para-los-derechos-humanos-critico-la-ley-omnibus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reports from local outlets</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p>Some have also claimed that the bill seeks to dismantle essential procedures and implement regressive measures affecting basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare access.</p>
<p>The bill&#8217;s deregulatory nature is also seen as a potential threat, as it may lead to the privatization of essential public services without adequate safeguards to ensure quality and affordability.</p>
<p>Another contentious issue is the bill&#8217;s approach to law enforcement and public demonstrations.</p>
<p>Critics argue that the bill&#8217;s punitive stance on social protests redefines social dissent as a crime against public order, potentially subjecting a wide range of meetings and gatherings to new restrictions and offenses.</p>
<p>Given that Milei&#8217;s party holds a minority in Congress, the bill is likely to face resistance, which explains the administration&#8217;s willingness to make concessions in certain areas.</p>
<p>The Congress has until February 15 to determine the fate of the bill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iconic first-person shooter game Doom has surpassed traditional platforms and made it onto blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.</p>
<p>Using protocols like Ordinals, enthusiasts have inscribed simplified versions of Doom on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> network.</p>
<p>Ordinals refer to a relatively recent innovation that allows for the inscription of additional data directly onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This concept has garnered attention for introducing a way to attach unique, non-fungible properties to specific satoshis, similar in spirit to NFTs on other blockchain platforms like Ethereum.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the recent integration of Doginals, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> version of Ordinals, allows for the full version of Doom to be played directly through a web browser.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Doom Could Run Using E. Coli Bacteria</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-doom-using-gut-bacteria-but-the-framerate-is-atrocious" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent student study</span></a> from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) suggests that Doom could even run using E. coli bacteria, aside from blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.</p>
<p>While this experiment may seem far-fetched, it highlights the boundless creativity and versatility surrounding the classic game.</p>
<p>Lauren &#8220;Ren&#8221; Ramlan, an MIT biotech graduate student researcher, proposed a concept where E. coli cells in a 32&#215;48 well plate act as pixels, connected to a display controller.</p>
<p>The graphics of Doom are translated into signals that control the fluorescence of the cells, creating a visual representation of the game.</p>
<p>Although the gameplay experience might not be particularly enjoyable, it showcases the potential of merging genetic engineering with engaging entertainment.</p>
<h2>What is Doom?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Doom, released in 1993, follows the story of a lone space marine battling demons in a research facility on Mars.</p>
<p>While the game&#8217;s file size remains small compared to modern standards, it revolutionized the gaming industry and spawned a successful franchise.</p>
<p>The unconventional gameplay and computational design of Doom have spurred a movement to play the game on a variety of unintended devices, such as ATMs, printers, calculators, Lego bricks, and even potatoes.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s Doom running on a calculator powered by 100 pounds of moldy potatoes <a href="https://t.co/8PSiR2l54x">https://t.co/8PSiR2l54x</a> <a href="https://t.co/NKISmyDANY">pic.twitter.com/NKISmyDANY</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ramlan&#8217;s experiment adds a unique twist to the ongoing trend of running Doom on unconventional platforms.</p>
<p>While neuronal computing has enabled Doom to be played through artificial neural networks, programming cells to play the game introduces a novel approach.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that running Doom solely on E. coli cells would be an incredibly time-consuming endeavor, potentially taking centuries to complete a single playthrough.</p>
<p>Ramlan encourages people to explore the possibilities of using cellular systems for gaming and display purposes, highlighting the diverse range of opportunities that synthetic biology offers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I definitely encourage people to imagine what they would play/display on a cellular system. The opportunities are as diverse as a computer screen… only with a much longer wait time.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Core_Scientific/status/1752736454688596336">recent post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the crypto miner said 13,762 BTC were mined by the company itself in its state-of-the-art data centers, while 5,512 BTC were mined by its customers.</p>
<p>The company said it maintains dedicated teams that monitor their mining fleet around the clock to ensure optimal performance, working tirelessly to minimize downtime and maximize productivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each team is dedicated to finding creative ways to maximize our miners&#8217; efficiency, positioning us at the forefront of the ever-evolving Bitcoin mining industry,&#8221; it said.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As we continue to prioritize efficiency and excellence, we look forward to reaching new heights and shaping the future of Bitcoin mining.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Core Scientific Returned From Bankruptcy</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In December 2022, Core Scientific faced significant challenges leading to its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/one-of-largest-bitcoin-mining-firms-just-filed-for-bankruptcy-heres-what-it-means-for-crypto-industry.htm">filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a>.</p>
<p>The move was primarily driven by the downturn in crypto prices and a series of market failures, which heavily impacted the company&#8217;s financial stability.</p>
<p>However, with Bitcoin prices recovering as of late, the company put forward a plan to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>As reported, the <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-overcomes-bankruptcy-eyes-stock-market-return.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">plan was approved</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by the Bankruptcy Court earlier this month, setting the stage for its </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-announces-post-bankruptcy-comeback-to-return-to-nasdaq.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">relisting on the Nasdaq</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p>The reorganization included various strategic changes aimed at strengthening Core Scientific&#8217;s financial position and enhancing its competitiveness in the industry.</p>
<p>Part of the plan involved substantial debt restructuring, including agreements with major creditors like BlackRock and investment bank B. Riley.</p>
<h2>Mining Companies to Expand Operations Ahead of Halving</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As part of its future growth strategy, Core Scientific aims to expand its mining operations.</p>
<p>The company, which operates mining facilities across five U.S. states with a total power capacity of 724 megawatts, plans to increase its mining capacity by over 50% within the next four years.</p>
<p>This includes deploying new Bitcoin miners and preparing for the upcoming halving event in the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>The halving, which occurs approximately every four years, is a significant event for miners as it reduces the reward for mining new blocks, thereby affecting the economics of mining operations.</p>
<p>The company also announced its new Board of Directors, aiming to bring their expertise to contribute to the restructuring operation.</p>
<p>Aside from Core Scientific, a number of other major cryptocurrency miners are also <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/leading-crypto-miners-riot-terawulf-cleanspark-brace-for-2024-bitcoin-halving.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">bracing themselves for the challenges</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ahead as the 2024 Bitcoin halving event looms.</span></p>
<p>According to a recent report from asset manager CoinShares, Riot, TeraWulf, and CleanSpark are among the best-positioned companies to weather the impending storm.</p>
<p>Per the analysis, the cost of production and cash costs per Bitcoin, which were approximately $16,800 and $25,000 in the third quarter of 2023, are expected to surge to $27,900 and $37,800 post-halving, respectively.</p>
<p>Analysts project that the average production cost for crypto miners post-halving is going to be around $37,856.</p>
<p>These anticipated cost increases stem from the reduction in rewards and the need for miners to expand their operations to remain profitable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>El Salvador&#8217;s President Nayib Bukele intends to push forward with his plans for Bitcoin if he secures a second term in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>Despite pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reconsider the country&#8217;s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender during loan negotiations, the government remains steadfast in its decision, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-will-stay-committed-bitcoin-after-election-vice-president-2024-02-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Reuters reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, citing his vice president Felix Ulloa.</span></p>
<p>Ulloa reportedly said that Bitcoin will continue to be recognized as legal tender in El Salvador.</p>
<p>He also mentioned the recent announcement by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track Bitcoin, saying that the decision strengthens the government&#8217;s resolve to maintain its cryptocurrency-friendly stance.</p>
<h2>Nayib Bukele&#8217;s Future Bitcoin Plans</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The administration&#8217;s future plans include launching Bitcoin-backed bonds in the first quarter of 2024, constructing a tax-free crypto haven known as Bitcoin City in the eastern part of the country, and issuing passports to investors who contribute the equivalent of $1 million in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>El Salvador made history in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a move that faced criticism from various quarters, including the IMF.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, the government remains optimistic and hopes to overcome obstacles to accessing IMF financing as it faces an acceleration of public debt.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bukele&#8217;s New Ideas party is predicted to win the upcoming election by a significant margin.</p>
<p>If these predictions hold true, the president&#8217;s ambitious plans for Bitcoin-backed initiatives and the development of a crypto-friendly environment are expected to move forward.</p>
<p>Ulloa, a 72-year-old lawyer, expressed confidence that the government&#8217;s decision to embrace Bitcoin enjoys global credibility and will continue to be upheld.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of the package has already been agreed upon,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bet Starts to Pay Off</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
El Salvador’s Bitcoin investment <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvadors-bitcoin-strategy-pays-off-with-3-6-million-profit-will-president-nayib-bukele-sell-btc-holdings.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has turned green</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p>Data from Nayibtracker.com, which tracks the country’s Bitcoin purchases based on Bukele’s tweets, shows that El Salvador would walk away with roughly $4 million in profit if it decided to sell its holdings.</p>
<p>Aside from El Salvador, some other big investors in the cryptocurrency have also seen their profits reach billions.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy, one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, has seen its <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microstrategys-michael-saylor-is-now-in-almost-2-billion-profit-from-bitcoin-holdings-will-he-sell.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">unrealized profit soar to $2 billion</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p>With Bitcoin reaching $42,000, the value of MicroStrategy’s holdings rose to approximately $7.3 billion, resulting in a profit exceeding $2 billion.</p>
<p>Likewise, Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, has witnessed a significant increase in the value of its Bitcoin reserves, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tethers-bitcoin-holding-profit-surges-to-1-1-billion-as-leading-cryptocurrency-surpasses-42000.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">surpassing $1 billion in profit</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p>Tether currently holds 57,576 BTC, with an average purchase price of $22,480 per coin, meaning the company’s holdings have gained around 85%, or $1.1 billion, since its acquisition.</p>
