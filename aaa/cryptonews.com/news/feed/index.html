<p>With its price at $96.50, despite a 2.50% dip over the past day, Solana&#8217;s substantial $1.3 billion trading volume underscores its growing prominence.</p>
<p>Holding a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">commanding market capitalization</a> of $42.07 billion and a circulating supply of 436 million SOL coins, the digital asset showcases significant momentum.</p>
<p>This surge in activity and investor interest places Solana in a pivotal position for future market dynamics, prompting speculations about its trajectory and comparisons with leading cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Analyzing the 4-hour chart, the pivot point is identified at $97.69, suggesting a nuanced balance point for future price directions.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance levels are positioned at $100.03, $102.56, and $105.47, indicating potential ceilings for upward price movements.</p>

<p>Conversely, support levels are found at $94.91, $92.96, and $90.66, marking thresholds for possible pullbacks.</p>
<p>The technical indicators present a mixed sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42 hints at a slight bearish momentum, suggesting a lack of strong buying pressure at the moment.</p>

<p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) standing at $98.40 further underscores the current bearish trend, as the price resides below this average.</p>
<p>Chart patterns reveal a symmetrical triangle breakout below the $97.69 level, indicating a potential continuation of the selling trend.</p>
<p>This is further confirmed by the presence of a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern below the pivot, reinforcing the bearish outlook for Solana.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Solana exhibits bearish tendencies below the $97.69 threshold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX is seeking approval to sell its 8% stake in AI startup Anthropic Holdings.</p>
<p>The motion, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MzA1NzAzMA==&amp;id2=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span>by FTX&#8217;s current CEO, John Ray III, requests permission to sell the stake and proposes two possible procedures, including an auction or a private sale.</p>
<p>FTX aims to expedite the deliberation process by requesting a shortened period for objections to be raised, with a court hearing scheduled for February 22.</p>
<p>The precise price sought for the Anthropic shares has been redacted from the filing, as FTX&#8217;s legal team believes public disclosure could hinder the potential to obtain higher offers for the stake.</p>
<p>Anthropic Holdings achieved a reported valuation of up to $18 billion in December 2023, indicating that <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftxs-500-million-investment-openai-rival-offers-hope-for-creditors.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX&#8217;s 7.84% stake</span></a> could be worth approximately $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>This value has sparked hope among victims of the FTX collapse, as FTX anticipates having sufficient funds to fully repay all customer and creditor claims.</p>
<p>The sale of the stake in Anthropic Holdings represents a significant opportunity for FTX to generate funds and address its financial obligations.</p>
<p>By divesting this illiquid asset, FTX aims to maximize the returns for its stakeholders and fulfill its commitments to customers and creditors.</p>
<h2>FTX Files Motion to Sell its Claim Against Genesis</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Earlier this month, FTX also filed a motion in a Delaware court to sell its $175 million claim against bankrupt digital financial services firm Genesis Global Capital.</p>
<p>The claim was initially made by Alameda Research, FTX&#8217;s associated hedge fund.</p>
<p>If approved, FTX will have the flexibility to sell the claim in its entirety or in parts, taking advantage of the most favorable market conditions.</p>
<p>Currently, claims against Genesis are selling for 65% of their face value, significantly higher than the 38% that Alameda Research claims are fetching.</p>
<p>The motion seeks approval for a sales procedure that would apply to all sales, streamlining the process and reducing costs.</p>
<p>The sale price must be at least 95% of the highest price quoted by leading market-makers for general unsecured claims of Genesis Global Capital within three days of the sale date.</p>
<p>FTX initially sought to recover $3.9 billion from Genesis in May 2023, but later negotiated the reduced claim of $175 million in August 2023, which was approved by the court in October.</p>
<p>The decision to reduce the claim was based on the unpredictable nature of potential recoveries and the desire to avoid lengthy and costly litigation.</p>
<h2>Genesis Had $175M in FTX Accounts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
FTX faced its own troubles when irregularities were discovered in its accounting books, leading to its <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">collapse in November 2022</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p>At that time, Genesis had $175 million tied up in FTX accounts, although it claimed this did not affect its market-making activities.</p>
<p>Genesis, a subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group, filed for bankruptcy in January 2023, triggering a contentious dispute with the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange over the impact on the Gemini Earn program.</p>
<p>In a separate development, Genesis recently <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/genesis-settles-sec-lawsuit-agrees-to-21-million-civil-penalty-for-earn-product.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached a $21 million settlement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the Gemini Earn program. </span></p>
<p>This settlement will be considered during a court hearing in New York on February 14, where Genesis debtors&#8217; proposed bankruptcy reorganization plan will also be reviewed.</p>

<p>This comes amid news from the cryptocurrency trading platform Gemini, announcing the bankrupt company Genesis is proceeding with the sale of its trust assets. Interest in Bitcoin ETFs has been dampened by stringent due diligence processes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice has made headlines by accusing a couple of illegally mining cryptocurrency in a school district, amid wider investigations into the energy consumption of crypto activities. These events collectively paint a complex picture for investors considering Bitcoin&#8217;s future price movements.</p>

<h2>Genesis Trust Asset Sale Moves Forward</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With the goal of making money off of interests in Grayscale Ethereum trusts, cryptocurrency lender Genesis has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/crypto-exchange-gemini-says-bankrupt-genesis-moves-authorize-sale-trust-assets-2024-02-03/?taid=65be969c9d1e610001e8fcf4&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">submitted a motion</a> for asset sale to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p>Genesis wants to approve the sale of trust assets, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares, according to Gemini Trust Co.&#8217;s confirmation of the move.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>On February 8, an expedited hearing is also requested in the motion. Genesis recently offered a liquidation plan to reimburse clients in cash or bitcoin as part of the settlement of an SEC lawsuit regarding its now-defunct Gemini Earn lending scheme.</p>
<p>Depending on the result, asset sales may have a favorable effect on market sentiment and, consequently, Bitcoin prices.</p>

LPL Financial Holdings is slowing the <a href="https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1753830096191078578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adoption of Bitcoin ETFs</a> with its detailed due diligence, affecting nearly 19,000 financial advisers and $1.4 trillion in managed assets. This review aims to assess the ETFs&#8217; risks and potential before allowing investments.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Companies such as LPL Financial Holdings, one of the largest independent brokers in the United States, are currently reviewing recently approved Bitcoin ETFs to decide whether to offer them to the nearly 19,000 independent financial advisors who manage $1.4 trillion in assets.…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Expected to conclude in three months, this process will scrutinize the ETFs&#8217; performance and sustainability, possibly delaying the anticipated $10 billion inflow into Bitcoin ETFs in their first year.</p>
<p>This cautious approach could impact Bitcoin&#8217;s market perception and price.</p>
<h2>DOJ Targets Illegal Crypto Mining in School</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Two employees of the Patterson Joint Unified School District have been charged by the U.S. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/former-assistant-superintendent-and-former-it-director-patterson-joint-unified-school">Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> for allegedly running a cryptocurrency mining farm on school property, utilizing school resources, and inflating electricity expenses.</p>
<p>It is said that IT director Eric Drabert and assistant superintendent Jeffrey Menge bought expensive graphics cards and mined cryptocurrency on school premises.</p>

<p>The accusations against Menge and Drabert include theft, with Menge allegedly stealing between $1 million and $1.5 million and Drabert allegedly stealing between $250,000 and $300,000.</p>
<p>This incident may affect the public&#8217;s impression of bitcoin operations as U.S. regulators are closely monitoring the energy usage of cryptocurrency miners.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 48, indicating a neutral market sentiment, while the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $42,710 slightly supports the current price level.</p>
<p>However, a symmetrical triangle breakout below $42,885 suggests an emerging selling trend, steering the short-term outlook towards bearish beneath this threshold.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Domain registry company NJAL.LA aka ‘Njalla’ has be cast into the spotlight of cryptocurrency for their finessing of Mollars.com from the “Mollars Cryptocurrency Project.”   Now relocated to Mollars.CC, the project’s original domain shut down abruptly with no explanation.   The strange event worried some crypto investors, but a PSA was issued to clarify the issue.</p>
<p>Via twitter today, an answer to all those questioning what happened was shared <a href="https://twitter.com/mollarstoken/status/1753938447645991161?s=46&amp;t=1YWjgqonygeHG2g50IAGZg">via X (formerly twitter</a>).</p>
<h3>Why Mollars.com Switched to Mollars.CC</h3>
<p>“http://Mollars.com, the domain, was hijacked from us by a rogue domain registry service that has in their T&amp;C they actually own our domain.    We are fighting to get the domain back but until then, we&#8217;re focused on building http://Mollars.cc  as our new domain brand.”</p>
<p>This was only a part of the full tweet but after seeing this, the obvious thing for traders to do is research who is NJALLA domain registry and are they legit.    In a quick search of the company with the word scam or “Njal.la stealing domains,&#8221; the search results are shocking.</p>
<p>Apparently the ‘decentralized-like’ domain registry isn’t a registry at all, though they maintain the shell appearance of one.   Instead, the company buys domains for clients and puts it in their own name, retaining ownership of their domains without them knowing.</p>
<p>Unless however a client happens to read the ‘about us’ page — which really has nothing to do with the buying process typically.  On Njalla’s about us page the company explains &amp; virtually protects themselves against lawsuits without making it clear who owns the domain:</p>
<p>“For instance, when you register a domain name in our system, we can register with our own data. We will be the actual registrant of the domain &#8212; it&#8217;s not an ownership by proxy as found with all other providers. However, you will still have full control over the domain name. You can either use our information (and our nameservers) or you can go with your custom data. And you can move at any time. Simple, flexible.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slick description of the company, which is not made clear on the sales page to customers, has put the Mollars.com domain in jeopardy.   And not just Mollars, but hundreds of others are complaining about the company on SEO forums, <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/njal.la">TrustPilot</a>, and reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=njal.la">see here</a>) alike.</p>
<h3>Who Owns NJAL.LA?</h3>
<p>It’s also been discovered by some recently, the founder and owner of the company is none other than Peter Sunde. If you are unfamiliar with the name, he’s the co-founder of the scrupulous internet site, Pirate Bay.  Another project with a jaded past.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency supporters of the Mollars project however may be the biggest rival to the company they&#8217;ve ever faced.  Thousands of Investors can lose a small percentage of potential ROI gains from the loss of the domain.  A ‘.com’ tends to be viewed as more trustworthy than something like Mollars.CC, though ‘CC’ is more descriptive of Cryptocurrency.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mollars.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148851" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704768853-mollars-token-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="63" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704768853-mollars-token-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704768853-mollars-token-banner-300x37.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704768853-mollars-token-banner-150x18.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Presale investors may not be swayed, but generally no investor wants to see an entity <b><i>try</i></b> to put blemish on a ‘diamond gem’ they’ve found, no matter what the case.</p>
<h3>Investors Money Can’t Be Stolen from Mollars Token Presale Wallet</h3>
<p>As for the nearly half-a-million dollars raised thus far for the $MOLLARS token project, all investments are still secured. In the tweet made earlier today by Mollars developers, it was made very clear all investors’ funds remain unbothered by the Domain debacle.</p>
<p>“All funds are 100% safe. This event has done /does no harm to the actual token project nor the money contributed in the token presale,&#8221; reads a second line from the tweet.</p>
<p>The inexperienced may not realize how token presale funds are stored, but it’s not on the actual domain itself.  All cryptocurrency, even from Initial coin offerings, is stored in a crypto wallet who has a special key to access it.   Alongside that wallet key, the smart contract used to bridge payments, adds security to ensure funds go to the right place.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay &amp; Njal.la founder cannot access Mollars funds by stealing the Mollars.com domain.</p>
<h3>Why is Njal.la &amp; Peter Sunde stealing domains?</h3>
<p>The reason for stealing so many domains from clients is probably some sort of back-end profit to domain hijackers.   Once a domain’s brand has become big enough to generate hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars via type-in and SERPS, it has massive value.    Domains like Mollars.com can be resold on the black-market for massive amounts of money.</p>
<p>In highly competitive niches like cryptocurrency, Peter Sunde &amp; company could also profit by taking back-door payments from rival brands.    A 5-figure payment to ‘snipe’ a competitor’s domain is a lucrative business for a ‘fake domain registry’ company.</p>
<h2>Where to Buy Mollars Now?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Regardless, investors can visit <a href="http://www.mollars.cc">www.Mollars.cc</a> for the latest updates on the Bitcoin-alternative’s token presale.    The original domain may be returned to the creator of the Mollars’ token project in the future.</p>
<p>To date the $MOLLARS ICO has raised nearly $520,000 (USD) and is on track to selling all 4-million tokens of the available presale supply by the end of this month.</p>

Retik Finance (RETIK) has emerged as a compelling alternative to Solana (SOL), experiencing a meteoric rise in its presale phase.  As of the latest update, Retik Finance has surged past an impressive milestone, accumulating over $19,000,000 in presale funds. This remarkable feat has been fueled by a surge of interest from investors and significant contributions from whale wallets, demonstrating the platform&#8217;s potential for substantial growth.</p>
<h2><b>Presale Dynamics of Retik Finance (RETIK)</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Retik Finance has entered its seventh presale stage, offering its tokens at an enticing price of $0.1. The project&#8217;s commitment to security and reliability is evident through its meticulous audit conducted by Certik, a respected blockchain security firm. This endorsement adds a significant layer of credibility to Retik Finance, reassuring investors of its trustworthiness. Moreover, the project has solidified its presence on leading cryptocurrency tracking platforms, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, further enhancing its reputation and visibility within the market. The presale phase has exceeded expectations, with Retik Finance successfully selling 289,336,507 RETIK tokens, resulting in a remarkable presale fund surpassing $19,000,000. This achievement underscores the confidence and enthusiasm of investors who recognize the inherent value and potential growth opportunities associated with RETIK. The substantial inflow of investors and the participation of whale wallets have contributed to Retik Finance&#8217;s rapid ascent, cementing its position as a promising utility token poised for significant growth.<a href="https://retik.com/?utm_source=cryptonews&amp;utm_medium=cryptonews0321" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161050" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706982157-retik-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="82" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706982157-retik-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706982157-retik-banner-300x48.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706982157-retik-banner-150x24.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Retik Finance Unique Features</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><b>Retik Swap &#8211; Redefining Token Trading</b></h3>
<p>At the heart of Retik Finance&#8217;s ecosystem lies Retik Swap, a decentralised exchange (DEX) offering a seamless token trading experience with remarkably low fees. Operating on the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, Retik Swap distinguishes itself from traditional order book exchanges. Instead of direct matching with a counterparty, all trades occur against a liquidity pool. The AMM model, governed by the equation x * y = k, dictates asset pricing in a decentralised exchange like Retik. This mathematical formula ensures that trades on Retik Swap are executed autonomously via smart contracts, providing users with an innovative, autonomous, and liquid trading environment. Liquidity providers (LPs) play a crucial role by supplying liquidity to the smart contract, collectively sustaining the market&#8217;s operation.</p>
<h3><b>Stake &amp; Earn &#8211; Active Participation for Passive Income</b></h3>
<p>In the realm of decentralised finance, Retik Finance provides users with an opportunity to actively contribute to the network&#8217;s security and functionality through staking. By staking RETIK tokens, users not only support the network but also earn additional RETIK tokens as a bonus. The staking mechanism requires users to lock their RETIK tokens into a smart contract for a specified period. This commitment ensures that staked tokens are used to validate transactions, secure the network, and facilitate various functions within the Retik Finance ecosystem. The rewards distributed as a percentage of the staked amount incentivize users to actively participate, fostering a more engaged and committed user base within the Retik ecosystem.</p>
<h3><b>Perpetual Futures &amp; Options &#8211; Advanced Trading Solutions</b></h3>
<p>Retik Finance introduces a SuperDEX, utilising advanced technology to redefine the decentralised exchange trading experience. The platform offers perpetual futures contracts, enabling users to engage in leveraged trading, going long or short on cryptocurrency values without actual ownership. While this opens up opportunities for high profits, it also introduces risks, emphasising the importance of understanding and effective risk management. Options trading, a sophisticated financial instrument, is another dimension of Retik Finance&#8217;s offerings. Users can buy or sell the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified strike price and future date. This feature enables various trading strategies for speculation or risk management, providing increased leverage in speculative trades. In the Retik option protocol, each option type corresponds to a specific Ethereum Smart Contract, indicating the base and quote tokens, strike price, and expiration date. The transparent and tradable nature of options as ERC20 tokens ensures a decentralised and accountable trading environment.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Retik Finance&#8217;s phenomenal success in its presale, surpassing $19,000,000 in funds, positions it as a formidable player in the decentralised finance arena. With a comprehensive suite of features including Retik Swap, staking, lending and borrowing, perpetual futures, and options trading, Retik Finance offers a diverse and innovative platform for users seeking advanced financial solutions in the DeFi space. As the cryptocurrency and DeFi landscapes continue to evolve, Retik Finance&#8217;s commitment to security, transparency, and diversified services positions it as a noteworthy alternative to Solana and a promising player in the broader decentralised finance ecosystem. Investors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly watching as Retik Finance unfolds its vision for a decentralised and dynamic financial future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advanced data management solutions within the healthcare sector are becoming increasingly important as organizations realize the need to manage, govern, exchange, and analyze both internal and external datasets.</p>
<p>In addition, providing adequate data protection has become a major concern for healthcare companies. According to <a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/patient-data-breaches-doubled-reaching-87m-in-2023">data from Atlas VPN</a>, 87 million patients in the United States fell victim to data breaches in 2023. This number has more than doubled in comparison to the 37 million patients impacted in 2022.</p>
<h2><b>Blockchain for Data Management</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To solve these challenges, organizations have started to combine blockchains with other technologies to create more efficient data management systems.</p>
<p>Amber Hartley, Chief Strategy Officer at BurstIQ – a blockchain-based platform-as-a-service –  told Cryptonews that the healthcare industry has long relied on traditional data management methods that perpetuate data silos, making it difficult to connect information.</p>
<p>“Traditional data management is only designed for internal data,” she said. “It is not designed for the numerous organizations, vendors, partners, applications, and individuals who own, control, trade, and analyze data in multi-sided data ecosystems.”</p>
<p>To address this concern, Hartley explained that BurstIQ has combined blockchain technology with machine learning and privacy-enhanced technology to create “smart data.” Hartley said smart data builds privacy, permissions, history, context, and trust directly into generated data across various sectors.</p>
<p>“Data privacy is no longer bound to the security of the database it lives in, as privacy and security are embedded within the data itself,” she said.</p>
<p>Hartley explained that smart data is stored on BurstIQ’s data management system, LifeGraph, which is currently used by a number of healthcare organizations.</p>
<p>For example, she noted that The Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing – which manages Medicaid data for 1.5 million Coloradans – incorporates LifeGraph within their Medicaid Enterprise Solutions Integration platform.</p>
<p>“This allows for the management of data quality, unification, governance, and security across the agency’s numerous vendors, sub-systems, and partners,” she said.</p>
<p>In regards to the role that blockchain plays, Hartley explained that this allows for efficiencies such as data encryption, self-sovereign identity, and privacy-enhanced technology.</p>
<p>“Blockchain provides the ability for patients to control their identity and data. When coupled with smart consent contracts, it allows a patient to grant access to some or all of their information,” she explained, adding that leveraging blockchain enables secure <a href="https://digitalprivacy.ieee.org/publications/topics/what-is-multiparty-computation">multi-party computation (MPC)</a>. “This means parties can jointly analyze data without revealing their inputs.”</p>
<h2>Establishing Trust in a Trustless System</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bruce Ahn, Head of Adoption at Partisia Blockchain – a platform that enables advanced MPC for public blockchain networks – told Cryptonews that MPC essentially enables trust in a trustless system.</p>
<p>He explained that Partisia is also designing a data management solution that uses MPC with private patient healthcare data provided by Verida.</p>
<p>“The Partisia blockchain is a privacy preserving computation network which needs access to private data,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Verida Wallet and Verida Network provide an on-ramp to provide private user data to the Partisia blockchain, for new types of privacy preserving data processing use cases.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Verida Network is the first self-sovereign database network for storing private data.</p>
<p>The Verida Network is decentralized public infrastructure <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DePIN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DePIN</a> providing secure and private database infrastructure for users to own and control their private data.</p>
<p>2/6</p>
<p>&mdash; Verida <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="💜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@Verida_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/Verida_io/status/1742572075087515814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>To put this in perspective, Ahn explained that patients may eventually use the Verida Wallet to claim their healthcare or fitness activity tracking data from multiple third party systems. Verida CEO Chris Were noted that these types of datasets are stored and encrypted on the Verida Network, meaning information is only accessible by the user.</p>
<p>Ahn added that a healthcare research organization could then build an application to request and process verified, anonymous healthcare data for research purposes.</p>
<p>“In this case, the research organization would utilize the Partisia blockchain and Verida developer software development kits to build an application that requests private data from a user’s Verida Wallet and submits it to a privacy preserving smart contract on the Partisia blockchain,” he said. “The smart contract would accept the data of many users and produce a research output of valuable data; all obtained with consent, anonymously and with full data privacy.”</p>
<p>Although this solution is still underway, Ahn shared that Partisia and Verida have been working closely with healthcare organizations to enable better data analysis while preserving privacy around patient data in a regulatory compliant manner.</p>
<p>“With additional regulatory friendly features like Jurisdiction Management that allow for GDPR compliance, and proven use cases, we feel comfortable in users beginning to adopt a new way to share the use of patient data,” Ahn remarked.</p>
<p>MPC technology may also make it more difficult for hackers to gain unauthorized access to patient data. This is because centralized data storage is removed, as data becomes decentralized across a user base.</p>
<p>According to a Fireblocks <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/what-is-mpc/">blog post</a>, MPC has become one of the primary technologies crypto wallet providers and custodians utilize to secure crypto assets due to its advanced security. However, MPC systems are still hackable, as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fireblocks-uncovers-bitforge-vulnerabilities-posing-threat-major-mpc-wallets.htm">Fireblocks recently identified a set of vulnerabilities</a> known as “BitForge” that pose a threat to crypto wallets that use MPC technology.</p>
<h2><b>Challenges May Hamper Crypto Adoption</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While it’s notable that blockchain technology can create efficiencies for healthcare data management systems, a number of challenges may hamper adoption.</p>
<p>For instance, Ahn pointed out that organizations may be hesitant to incorporate blockchain due to privacy concerns. “Traditional blockchain networks provide transparency, which may be concerning,” he said.</p>
<p>Given this, Hartley noted that health data should not be stored on public ledgers. Rather, she believes that blockchain for healthcare use cases should be leveraged as part of a broader service stack, providing benefits such as privacy-based capabilities.</p>
<p>Were further mentioned that while the Verida Network uses blockchain technology, it’s not a blockchain itself. “Therefore, user data is not stored on a blockchain network or in a public domain,” he said.</p>
<p>As Hartley remarked, healthcare firms should understand that blockchain alone will not ensure data privacy or regulatory compliance. She explained that when blockchain is combined with other privacy-enhancing technologies, however, it can offer significant advantages with respect to data privacy and security.</p>
<p>“To be considered by healthcare companies, blockchain companies must demonstrate that their technologies can meet the stringent data privacy and security requirements outlined in HIPAA, HITECH, 42 CFR Part 2, and numerous other regulations,” she said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hartley thinks that the fundamental architecture of blockchain implementations makes it very challenging, if not impossible, to meet these standards. Yet she still believes that as technology advances, web3 services such as blockchain will be essential to broader adoption. “Specifically when unifying digital experiences across a person’s health journey,” she said.</p>

<h2>Meta&#8217;s Reality Labs Records $4.6 Billion in Loss</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meta subsidiary Reality Labs, which focuses on the development of the metaverse, recorded a significant <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metas-reality-labs-reports-4-65-billion-operating-loss-in-q4-2023-as-metaverse-efforts-continue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">operating loss of over $4.6 billion</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the fourth quarter of 2023.</span></p>
<p>In its fourth-quarter report, released on February 1, Meta revealed that Reality Labs reported a loss of $4.65 billion during Q4, while generating nearly $1.1 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>This operating loss marks the largest quarterly loss for Reality Labs since Meta began including the division’s financials in its reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>In 2023, Reality Labs’ total revenues amounted to just under $1.9 billion, with more than half of the annual revenue generated in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the release of the Meta Quest 3.</p>
<p>The total operating loss for 2023 reached $16.1 billion, representing a 17.5% year-on-year increase from 2022.</p>
<p>The metaverse has been a topic of intense debate in the tech world, with some industry leaders like Bill Gates expressing a tepid outlook.</p>
<p>The gloomy outlook regarding the metaverse is not entirely out of the norm, particularly since many big supporters of the idea have recently backed down from their ambitions.</p>
<p>For one, entertainment giant Disney <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/disney-closes-metaverse-division-50-laid-off-in-company-wide-staff-reduction.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a> last year that it is eliminating its metaverse division as part of broader layoffs that will impact as many as 7,000 employees.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pandoshi (PAMBO) is an emerging crypto project that aims to champion decentralization, privacy, and monetary freedom. With an ecosystem of decentralized products, Pandoshi seeks to emulate the meteoric growth seen by Polygon (MATIC) in 2021.</p>
<h2>An Introduction to Pandoshi</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s vision, Pandoshi manifests the ideals behind blockchain technology &#8211; decentralization, privacy, and financial autonomy. Its mission is to build an ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) products, including a layer-2 blockchain, decentralized exchange (DEX), non-custodial <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a>, metaverse, crypto debit cards, and more.</p>
<p>At Pandoshi&#8217;s core are the utility token PAMBO and the governance token BAMBOO. PAMBO powers transactions across Pandoshi products as the native token. Meanwhile, BAMBOO allows community members to vote on the project&#8217;s future direction. Unlike PAMBO which has a fixed supply, BAMBOO is inflationary without a supply cap.</p>
<p>With 50% of the total supply going to public presales, PAMBO takes a community-focused approach. Its buyback-and-burn mechanism makes it deflationary, with the token burns continuing until 80% of the circulating supply is removed.</p>
<h2>The Polygon (MATIC) Growth Story</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In 2021, Polygon saw meteoric growth in adoption and price. Its native token, MATIC, rose over 10,000% by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>In November 2021, Malaysia-based Enegra Group moved its $3.4 billion equity token offering from Ethereum to Polygon. This shift enabled faster and cheaper transactions for investors. Polygon&#8217;s infrastructure allowed Enegra to seamlessly migrate tokens while retaining the same wallet addresses. Other protocols, like SushiSwap, Decentraland and OpenSea, were also launched on Polygon.</p>
<p>This adoption and network effects spawned bullish momentum on MATIC’s price. Polygon reached an all-time high of $2.91 on DDecember27, 2021. MATIC currently trades 80% below this all-time high.</p>

<h2>Pandoshi&#8217;s Growth Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As an emerging project, Pandoshi seems poised to emulate Polygon&#8217;s growth trajectory in 2024. Its ecosystem aims to solve many pain points holding back crypto adoption &#8211; scalability, usability, and fees.</p>
<p>For example, Pandoshi is launching PandaChain &#8211; a layer-2 proof-of-stake blockchain. PandaChain will boost scalability and reduce fees via innovations like zkEVM and PolyBFT consensus. It bridges to Ethereum while supporting ERC token standards.</p>
<p>On usability, Pandoshi launched its non-custodial wallet for easy onboarding. The wallet is now available on Android, with an iOS version underway. PandoshiSwap will also make token swaps accessible for pro and new users alike.</p>
<p>With wider adoption, the deflationary PAMBO token can see massive price appreciation. Currently in presale at $0.01 per PAMBO, the token has enormous room for growth, like MATIC. Pandoshi also plans to list PAMBO on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Uniswap after its launch.</p>
<p>Moreover, 50% of PAMBO&#8217;s supply goes to public presales, making it a community-focused project. PAMBO buybacks-and-burns further boost holding incentives. With network effects, the token can easily 100x as Polygon&#8217;s MATIC did.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In 2021, Polygon grew rapidly by providing much-needed scalability and usability to crypto users. Riding on this adoption, its token MATIC surged exponentially in value as well. As an emerging project, Pandoshi seems set to chart a similar trajectory to Polygon in 2024. With innovations across decentralization, usability, and tokenomics, the foundations are laid for PAMBO to break out. If executed well, PAMBO can easily replicate MATIC&#8217;s 10,000% explosion.</p>

<p>Finally, the SCORP token plays a dual role, serving as both a governance token and a rewards mechanism. Users can exercise their voting rights on crucial decisions shaping the platform&#8217;s future while also receiving tokens as a reward for their contributions and active participation.</p>
<p>In November, the platform underwent a comprehensive overhaul, introducing 20 new features, a completely revamped interface, and a refreshed look.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Scorpion Casino presale has reached a noteworthy milestone, exceeding $3.6 million in sales, and this impressive figure is expected to continue growing in the foreseeable future. Currently, SCORP tokens are available at $0.028 during the presale, with a listing price of $0.05. Interested investors can acquire SCORP using ETH, USDT, or BNB. The total SCORP supply is capped at 1 billion tokens, with 280 million allocated to the presale and 300 million reserved for affiliate incentives.</p>
<p>The popularity of the presale can be attributed to the appealing rewards offered to both presale participants and the broader gaming community. Notably, the generous 500% bonus for presale investors has generated significant excitement. Additionally, contributions of $100,000 or more qualify for an impressive 40% credit bonus, presenting substantial potential returns.</p>
<p>Another attractive feature is the exclusive Elite Scorpion Members Club, offering additional benefits such as VIP service, cashback rewards, enhanced staking rewards, and a larger SCORP allocation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SCORP holders enjoy various advantages, including opportunities for passive income, complimentary games, weekly bonuses, and participation in the referral/reward affiliate system.</p>
<p>Crucially, staking enables investors to potentially earn up to 10,000 USDT daily, with presale participants benefiting from a dedicated staking pool. Gold membership NFT holders experience enhanced staking rewards in both USDT and SCORP. Notably, Scorpion Casino stands out as the pioneering platform to offer USDT rewards.</p>
<p>Moreover, the recently introduced vesting structure has sparked renewed interest and discussions. The schedule involves distributing 10% of the supply during each of the 10 phases, with the initial 10% released 24 hours post-launch. Subsequent portions unlock at 10-day intervals.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investors are captivated by SCORP and its appealing features. The attraction stems from the varied opportunities for profitability within the Scorpion Casino ecosystem, spanning from daily USDT rewards to staking SCORP tokens. We highly recommend exploring the SCORP presale and keeping abreast of updates through the project’s social media channels.</p>

<h2>DogWifHat Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a 4-hour chart analysis, DogWifHat&#8217;s pivot point aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.26296, signifying a potential turning point for its price actions.</p>
<p>If momentum continues, immediate resistance levels at $0.28172 and $0.29998 await, with a more distant target at $0.31969.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Should the trend reverse, DogWifHat may find support at $0.24037, with further potential fallbacks at $0.20340 and $0.18421.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a moderate 55, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressures.</p>
<p>However, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.29419 indicates a bearish divergence, as the EMA stands above the current price point.</p>

<p>DogWifHat has completed a critical 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, coinciding with a downward trendline that could resist upward movements.</p>
<p>Additionally, the appearance of a Doji candle followed by a bearish engulfing pattern signals a potential reversal of the recent uptrend.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the current trend for DogWifHat is subject to change, the asset exhibits bearish tendencies as long as it remains below the $0.26296 threshold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a> has rehired Steve Christie, its former Senior Vice President of Compliance, as the Deputy Chief Compliance Officer.</p>
<p>In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/leadership/steve-christie-announced-as-binance-deputy-chief-compliance-officer-8955435036564475832" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent announcement</span></a>, the exchange said Christie&#8217;s primary responsibility will be to enhance Binance&#8217;s compliance framework by collaborating with regulators, industry leaders, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>His extensive compliance expertise and familiarity with the company make him well-suited for the role.</p>
<h2>Steve Christie Returns Follows a Period of Absence</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Christie&#8217;s return follows a period of absence during which he focused on personal matters and family.</p>
<p>Taking over the position left vacant by Kristen Hecht, Binance&#8217;s previous Deputy Chief Compliance and Global Money Laundering Reporting Officer, Christie will work closely with Noah Perlman, the firm&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer.</p>
<p>Perlman expressed confidence in Christie&#8217;s capabilities, stating that his previous tenure at Binance had contributed significantly to the growth and development of the compliance team.</p>
<p>“Steve’s familiarity with Binance and deep compliance expertise makes him the perfect person to assume the DCCO role,” said Perlman.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Steve first joined Binance in 2022, the compliance team underwent fast growth and made tremendous efforts and investments to strengthen and mature its compliance culture and program, which Steve helped lead.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Perlman emphasized that compliance is an ever-evolving field, and Christie&#8217;s expertise has been instrumental in helping Binance navigate new challenges and changes.</p>
<p>By making compliance a business enabler and a driver of sustainable industry growth, Christie&#8217;s return will further strengthen Binance&#8217;s commitment to regulatory compliance.</p>
<h2>Binance Pushes for Global Expansion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last month, Binance unveiled its joint venture crypto exchange Binance Thailand, which came in collaboration with Gulf Innova, a subsidiary of Gulf Energy Development.</p>
<p>Binance Thailand, abbreviated as Binance TH, provides a platform for digital asset exchange services with Thai baht trading pairs.</p>
<p>It has also integrated with local banks in Thailand and forged a partnership with Binance Kazakhstan for brokerage services, all under the watchful supervision of Thailand’s SEC.</p>
<p>The move came as Binance.US and its global parent company, Binance, have faced regulatory scrutiny in recent months.</p>
<p>In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">initiated an enforcement action</span></a> against them, alleging the sale of unregistered securities.</p>
<p>The SEC lawsuit named Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as one of the defendants, accusing him of controlling Binance.US despite claiming it operated independently.</p>
<p>In November, Zhao stepped down as CEO and <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">pleaded guilty to an anti-money laundering violation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, agreeing to pay a $50 million fine. </span></p>
<p>Binance, as a company, also settled with the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, paying a hefty $4.3 billion in penalties.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Binance is <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bernstein-report-binance-will-remain-the-top-global-crypto-exchange-despite-doj-settlement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">expected to maintain its position</span></a> as the dominant global exchange, even after reaching a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>
<p>Some analysts even claimed that the plea deal between Binance and the DOJ is a favorable outcome for both Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the company itself.</p>

<p>This momentum coincides with US legislators scrutinizing the SEC&#8217;s cryptocurrency oversight, highlighting Bitcoin&#8217;s enduring appeal amidst regulatory debates.</p>

<h2>US Politicians Question SEC&#8217;s Cryptocurrency Regulations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The examination of the SEC&#8217;s cryptocurrency regulations by US politicians might not immediately influence Bitcoin (BTC) prices.</p>
<p>However, this scrutiny signals an increased legislative effort to shape cryptocurrency regulations, potentially impacting the broader regulatory framework.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Fed Holds Rates Steady, Signals Cautious Approach</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to keep the benchmark <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/fed-rate-decision-january-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interest rate unchanged at 5.25%–5.50%</a> has recalibrated market expectations, previously leaning towards a potential rate cut in March.</p>
<p>This cautious stance, emphasizing rate adjustments only upon clear signs of sustainable inflation control, has significantly impacted the likelihood of an imminent rate cut, reducing it from a previously anticipated 65% to just over 50%.</p>

<p>Despite the Fed&#8217;s hawkish outlook, Bitcoin&#8217;s price remained relatively stable around $43,163 following the announcement.</p>
<p>The Fed&#8217;s future monetary policy moves, diverging from investor anticipations, could influence market dynamics, particularly for assets like Bitcoin, by altering investor sentiment.</p>

<p>Considering the pattern&#8217;s convergence, BTC is at a juncture that may precede significant price action.</p>
<p>A bullish break above $43,375 could initiate a rally, while a drop below the pivotal $42,950 could signal a bearish downturn.</p>

<p>Solana (SOL) price predictions are turning increasingly bullish, with the cryptocurrency still substantially below its December peaks, but with chart analysis hinting at upside price risks and widely followed crypto personality Arthur Hayes commenting that it may be time to “get back on the Solana train”.</p>
<p>Hayes made the post earlier this week when Solana was trading in the $94s.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think it might be time to get back on the train fam. Maybe after a few US banks bite the dust this weekend. <a href="https://t.co/SxCwK3BVYB">pic.twitter.com/SxCwK3BVYB</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1752972890843283660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Solana price has since risen to end Friday around $100.</p>
<p>Hayes caveated his comment by saying “maybe after a few US banks bite the dust this weekend”.</p>
<p>He was likely referring to a recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-regional-bank-stocks-brace-final-trading-session-painful-week-2024-02-02/">resurgence of concerns about regional banks in the US</a>.</p>
<p>NYBC’s share price plummeted this week after an ugly earnings release, weighing on the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.KRX'">KRW Regional Banking Index</a>.</p>
<p>The index started the week above 109 but closed the week under 100, its lowest since mid-December.</p>
<p>Troubles in the US banking sector prompted a huge rally in crypto markets in March 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and cryptocurrencies more broadly were viewed as a safe-haven alternative to the fractional reserve banking-based traditional financial system.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin would probably lead if the bank crisis returns, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> is also a strong candidate to perform well.</p>
<h2><strong>Solana Price Predictions – Where Next for SOL?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bank troubles could become an increasingly important theme in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In early March, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-allow-emergency-bank-lending-program-expire-march-11-2024-01-25/">the Fed is axing a liquidity support program</a> it first launched in March 2023 to help troubled regional lenders.</p>
<p>The end of the so-called Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) could beset new issues for the sector.</p>
<p>And that could drive cryptocurrencies like Solana’s price higher.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Solana price is likely to benefit from positive technicals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/missed-solana-sol-this-new-cryptocurrency-is-about-to-skyrocket.htm">Solana</a> price recently broke above a key short-term downtrend.</p>
<p>It also recently saw a strong bounce from its 21 and 50DMAs.</p>
<p>This bounce comes after it also bounced from key long-term support in the $77-80 area earlier this month.</p>
<p>Technical analysis suggests a strong likelihood of a near-term rally towards December highs around $125.</p>

<p>In wake of recent positive Solana ecosystem developments, such as surging on-chain activity as traders flock to benefit from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jupiter-airdrop-farmer-makes-1-1-million-using-almost-10000-wallets-after-token-launch.htm">successful airdrop campaigns</a> such as this week’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jupiter-price-prediction-as-solana-airdrop-creates-a-new-crypto-unicorn-how-to-check-jup-eligibility.htm">Jupiter (JUP) token launch</a>, Solana price predictions look set to remain optimistic.</p>

<p>With blue-chip cryptocurrency markets choppy on Friday following the release of a bumper US jobs reports that saw macro traders pare back on Fed rate cut bets, Oasis Network (ROSE), Pendle (PENDLE) and Flare (FLR) are the best performers, making them the likely best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-whipsaws-around-43k-after-blockbuster-us-jobs-report-where-next-for-btc.htm">Bitcoin (BTC) swung either side of $43,000</a> while Ether (ETH) chopped either side of $2,300 on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders paring Fed rate cuts bets is a headwind for liquidity-sensitive assets like crypto.</p>
<p>But at the same time, net flows into recently launched spot Bitcoin ETFs are turning decisively positive.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-holds-3-billion-in-btc.htm">BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) hit $3 billion</a> in assets under management (AUM) on Friday, indicative of strong BTC demand.</p>
<p>As a result, neither the bulls nor bears were able to take control of blue-chip markets on Friday.</p>
<p>But looking elsewhere across the altcoin market, some smaller names are enjoying big gains.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best-performing altcoins on Friday, which could be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Oasis Network (ROSE)</strong></h3>
<p>Privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain Oasis Network (ROSE) is up around 13% in 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The price pump comes following a breakout above a downtrend that has been in play since late December 2023.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160986" style="width: 814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-160986" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032.png" alt="Big potential gains make ROSE potentiall the best crypto to buy" width="814" height="708" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032.png 814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032-300x261.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032-768x668.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913266-screenshot-2024-02-02-172032-150x130.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160986" class="wp-caption-text">Big potential gains make ROSE potentially the best crypto to buy / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Technical analysis now suggests a strong likelihood of a near-term retest of resistance near $0.15.</p>
<p>That could mean quick 30% gains, with Oasis Network last around $0.115.</p>
<p>That potentially makes ROSE the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Pendle (PENDLE)</strong></h3>
<p>Pendle (PENDLE), an innovative future yield tokenization and trading protocol, punched to fresh all-time highs near $3 on Friday.</p>
<p>PENDLE is up nearly 6x from last summer’s lows under $0.50.</p>
<p>Its rally from its 2022 lows is even more impressive at over 80x.</p>
<p>But as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pendle/">CoinMarketCap</a>, which clocks PENDLE’s 24-hour gains at around 12%, its market cap remains modest at $686 million.</p>
<p>That leaves plenty of room for 10x or more gains as the asset tokenization narrative gains ground.</p>
<p>That potentially makes PENDLE one of the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Flare (FLR)</strong></h3>
<p>Data-focused layer-1 blockchain Flare (FLR) pumped up 11% in the last 24 hours, making it one of the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flare/">FLR</a> was last just under $0.025 after hitting its highest levels since May 2023.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency just broke key resistance at $0.2430, opening the door to swift gains into the $0.30s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160987" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016.png" alt="" width="817" height="708" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016.png 817w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016-300x260.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016-768x666.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706913304-screenshot-2024-02-02-173016-150x130.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains.</p>
<p>But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With blue-chip cryptocurrency markets choppy on Friday following the release of a bumper US jobs reports that saw macro traders pare back on Fed rate cut bets, $DORK, $GME and $BEBE are the biggest crypto gainers today on decentralized exchange Uniswap.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-whipsaws-around-43k-after-blockbuster-us-jobs-report-where-next-for-btc.htm">Bitcoin (BTC) swung either side of $43,000</a> while Ether (ETH) chopped either side of $2,300 on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders paring Fed rate cuts bets is a headwind for liquidity sensitive assets like crypto.</p>
<p>But at the same time, net flows into recently launched spot Bitcoin ETFs are turning decisively positive.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-holds-3-billion-in-btc.htm">BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) hit $3 billion</a> in assets under management (AUM) on Friday, indicative of strong BTC demand.</p>
<p>As a result, neither the bulls nor bears were able to take control of blue-chip markets on Friday.</p>
<p>However, some number of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/5-small-cap-crypto-coins-to-accumulate-before-the-bitcoin-halving-in-2024.htm">small-cap cryptocurrencies</a> are almost always pumping and nearly always also take the mantle for the biggest crypto gainers each day.</p>
<p>That’s because their low level of liquidity means that relatively small buy pressure can easily result in fast exponential gains.</p>
<p>While blue-chip cryptocurrencies can offer good upside prospects, traders looking to make quick profits usually turn to low-cap markets.</p>
<p>That being said, here are some of the biggest crypto gainers today on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">web3’s</a> best-known decentralized exchange (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex.htm">DEX</a>) <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum">Uniswap</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Low-cap coins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>For those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023:</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Monday, August 7, 2023</em> – Mega Dice Casino is all in on crypto, expanding its listing of token accepted on the platform with 14 new coins, including BONK and PEPE.</p>
<p dir="auto">More coins accepted means more users for the fast-growing casino that has already made a name for itself as one of the top Telegram crypto casinos.</p>
<p dir="auto">Originally <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice Casino</a> boasted an impressive roster of 13 coins, including the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. Now, with another 14 added to the mix, the total comes up to 27, helping to cement Mega Dice among the first rank of crypto casinos.</p>
<p dir="auto">New additions to the Mega Dice token line-up are:</p>
<table style="height: 313px" width="376">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Bonk</td>
<td>DAI</td>
<td>Uniswap</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PEPE</td>
<td>Avalanche</td>
<td>Cronos</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tamadoge</td>
<td>Chainlink</td>
<td>EOS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Floki</td>
<td>Polygon</td>
<td>ApeCoin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shiba Inu</td>
<td>Polkadot</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">Those tokens join the original 13, which were: BCH, DOGE, USDT, BTC, SOL, TFG, XRP, BNB, ETH, LTC, USDC, TRX, and ADA.</p>
<p dir="auto">Adding new coins is not simply a matter of enhancing the convenience for users of the platform, who may have an array of available coins they may wish to use to deposit into the casino and sportsbook. Each new coin listing is like putting a key in the access door to onboard potentially tens of thousands more players that hold one of the many listed digital assets.</p>
<p dir="auto">In particular, the availability of hot trending coins, such as BONK or PEPE, makes Mega Dice a much more attractive gaming venue for holders of those tokens.</p>
<p dir="auto">Take BONK for instance. According to data on the decentralized exchange trading site DEXTools, BONK has 618k holders of the Solana-based token.</p>
<p dir="auto">Earlier buyers of BONK that held their coin will have missed out on the gain at the top of the market but are still sitting on an ROI in excess of 2,000%. That means there are many well-heeled BONK millionaires out there who will be looking to deploy their investment winnings to see if they can translate that winning streak to the Mega Dice casino and sportsbook.</p>
<p dir="auto">PEPE has 154,000 holders on DEXs, which of course, like with other tokens, doesn’t capture the holdings data on centralized exchanges.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Transfer crypto from your wallet and earn a 200% deposit bonus</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">All new depositors receive a 200% deposit bonus up to 1 BTC. To qualify for the bonus, you must deposit crypto valued at a minimum of 20 USD, EUR, or GBP.</p>
<p dir="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160977" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2.png" alt="" width="1600" height="841" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-300x158.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-1024x538.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-768x404.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-1536x807.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910183-md2-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p dir="auto">Although the mobile and desktop versions of Mega Dice let you deposit regular money using payment methods including Wire transfer, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, for the moment the standalone Telegram experience is crypto-only.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice</a> also provides instant withdrawals, subject to terms and conditions, so you can always quickly access your winnings.</p>
<p dir="auto">The platform has an impressive collection of 6,000 games, covering offerings from all the top providers in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p dir="auto">The wide choice includes live dealer games, and favorites such as slots and table games, featuring poker, roulette, and all the other classics. There are also a host of specialty games to choose from, such as scratch cards, virtuals sports, video poker, bingo, and lucky numbers draw game Keno.</p>
<p dir="auto">Transfer your crypto funds from one of your existing wallets to the addresses created for you on Mega Dice, and you can immediately start playing thousands upon thousands of different games.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition to popular slots such as Gates of Olympus, Wanted Dead or Alive, and classic Novomatic titles such as Book of Ra, there’s a strong selection of live casino games by leading providers like Evolution Gaming and crypto fan favorites Plinko and Aviator by Spribe</p>
<p dir="auto">At Mega Dice, there really is something for everyone.</p>
<p dir="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160978" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3.jpg" alt="" width="845" height="1600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3.jpg 845w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-158x300.jpg 158w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-541x1024.jpg 541w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-768x1454.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-811x1536.jpg 811w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910204-md3-150x284.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></p>

<h2 dir="auto">Licensed operator offers 10% commission when you refer a friend</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">And if you enjoy what you see and play, why not invite a friend? Each new customer you refer receives a 10% commission on all invited players’ wagers. Referral income is paid out monthly in USDT.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current champion referrer according to data shared on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice Casino</a> Telegram account is someone with the handle @ruso779673 who has tallied up a grand total of 1,076 referrals, earning themselves an additional $200 reward on top of the regular 10% commission.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Mega Dice business was launched in late 2023 and is owned and operated by MIBS B.V., which has a Master Gaming License issued by the Governor of Curacao.</p>
<p dir="auto">The gaming platform complies with all EU anti-money laundering rules. It also subscribes to Responsible Gambling good practice.</p>

<p dir="auto">Also, users can join the Community Telegram group to engage with other players. Here, you will also find the team on hand to answer questions about games, how the referral system works, what’s on offer in the latest promotions, or any other questions you might have.</p>
<p dir="auto">Furthermore, Mega Dice has partnered with 50 software providers to build its gaming offering. Not all games are available in all countries because Mega Dice complies with the laws in all the jurisdictions its services are available.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Mega Dice is leading the way on Telegram where it targets 700 million increasingly crypto-savvy users</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">In a breakthrough for crypto casino adoption, Mega Dice, in addition to being available on desktop and mobile, is leading the way by opening the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible on the Telegram app.</p>
<p dir="auto">Crypto casinos are a big business and soaring in popularity because of the use of blockchain tech to implement unique transparency and trust features. Mega Dice Casino is helping to create a new standard for measuring fairness in the industry, online and offline.</p>
<p dir="auto">The largest crypto casino in the world is thought to be Stake.com, with revenue in 2022 estimated at $2.6 billion, according to a recent report.</p>
<p dir="auto">With its market-beating offering, Mega Dice casino on <a href="https://t.me/megadicecasinobot">Telegram</a> is not just snapping at the heels of Stake.com; it is outdoing it as one of the leaders in the newest forum for targeting the gambling audience.</p>
<p dir="auto">Telegram was estimated to have around 700 million active users in 2022. It has become immensely popular in the crypto community because of its superior feature set compared to the likes of WhatsApp.</p>
<p dir="auto">With Telegram, developers can program bots to execute processes initiated by users sending text-based commands, prefaced by a forward slash.</p>
<p dir="auto">But with Mega Dice, you don&#8217;t even need to know the commands, as everything is accessible with the click of a button.</p>
<p dir="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160979" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4.png" alt="" width="1592" height="1272" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4.png 1592w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-300x240.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-1024x818.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-768x614.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-1536x1227.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706910410-md4-150x120.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1592px) 100vw, 1592px" /></p>
<h2 dir="auto">Onboarding to Mega Dice Casino is a breeze</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">The ease of use of Telegram bots is why the platform is already a favorite among the crypto community, making Mega Dice Casino a rising star.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mega Dice on Telegram means no KYC. Because Telegram users verify account uniqueness through their telephone number, onboarding to use Mega Dice on Telegram couldn’t be smoother.</p>
<p dir="auto">A Telegram account is all you need to get up and running with Mega Dice.</p>
<p dir="auto">Simply go to <a href="https://t.me/megadicecasinobot" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://t.me/megadicecasinobot&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1706995367098000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ARaE0fmDxbnBSVyvl1GJn">https://t.me/megadicecasinobot</a>, click ‘start’, and it opens a connection to the web app where you can deposit Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, or Dogecoin into the wallet addresses created for each deposit currency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Congress Members introduced bipartisan legislation on Thursday in hopes of overturning the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).</p>
<p>Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Representative Wiley Nickel (D-NC), and Mike Flood (R-NE) have joined forces to introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121">set to challenge SAB 121</a>, which requires banks safeguarding crypto assets to present a corresponding liability on its balance sheets.</p>
<h2>Is The SEC Overstepping Regulatory Authority With SAB 121?</h2>

<a href="https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-nickel-and-flood-introduce-joint-resolution-to-overturn-secs-sab-121-rule/">A press release from Senator Lummis’ office</a> stated that SAB 121 has “serious implications for consumers and banks by confusing the distinction between customer assets and bank assets, threatening the foundation of essential custody services and increasing bankruptcy risk for consumers.”</p>

<p>Representative Nickel suggested that the accounting bulletin is just another way the SEC continues “to overstep regulatory authority,” labeling the federal agency’s regulatory approach on <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/digitalassets/index.htm">digital assets</a> “untenable.”</p>
<h2>Congress Steps Up Crypto Regulation Efforts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite recent Congressional criticism, this is far from the first time the SEC has faced claims that their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/we-squandered-a-decade-of-opportunities-to-do-our-job-sec-commisioner-says.htm">regulatory stance is unsustainable</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2023, Coinbase’s chief legal officer and general counsel <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/coinbase-sued-by-sec-over-alleged-unregistered-securities.html">Paul Grewal told CNBC</a> in part that “SEC’s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America’s economic competitiveness.”</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-regulatory-approach-pushing-crypto-overseas-new-21shares-report-says.htm">recent report from 21Shares</a> stated that regulatory uncertainty is pushing several valuable crypto firms overseas.</p>
<p>“In the face of overreach by a regulator, it is the role of Congress to serve as a check,” Representative Flood stated. “I am proud to jointly introduce a bipartisan resolution of congressional disapproval with Senator Lummis and Congressman Nickel to fulfill that role.”</p>
<h2>SEC Chair Gary Gensler Doubles Down</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some players from the banking industry joined their voices in support of Thursday’s legislative pushback against the SEC.</p>
<p>“SAB 121’s requirement for balance sheet recognition deviates from current accounting treatment for traditional assets held in custody, which are not required to be recorded on a firm’s balance sheet,” the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentson Jr. said. “Because of its impact on bank capital and liquidity ratios, SAB 121 has disincentivized banks from providing custodial services for digital assets.”</p>
<p>“We do not disagree with the need for regulatory oversight,” Bentson continued, “But the process should be deliberate and comprehensive to avoid unintended knock-on effects.”</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/gensler-defends-sec-staff-accounting-bulletin-on-crypto-after-gao-report-deems-it-a-rule/">report from Thomson Reuters</a>, SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently defended SAB 121 at an American Bar Association event in December, claiming it’s “just a staff accounting bulletin” that “basically addresses whether liabilities should be on a balance sheet.”</p>
<p>“SAB 121 has massive implications, and the SEC should have received feedback on it from the federal banking regulators and the public before implementing this legally binding directive,” Senator Lummis said.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Friday, February 2nd, 2024</em> – Meme Kombat ($MK) has raised nearly $8 million for its battling iGaming ecosystem, which will see meme characters go toe-to-toe in its battling arena.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Web3 gaming platform is a first-of-its-kind offering as far as meme battling goes. But the innovation doesn’t stop there. Meme Kombat will also enable players to wager on the outcome of the bouts, in a novel twist that is already proving that it appeals to a wide crypto audience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat</a> has a hard cap target of $10 million, which explains why the fundraising is picking up such a strong head of steam at this juncture. In the last stage of the presale, contributors are now in a race against time to secure their stake in the future of crypto gaming.</p>
<p dir="auto">Native token $MK is on sale at the cheap price of $0.279 as the ICO approaches the finishing line. The rate at which funds have been amassed has grown at a rate of more than 2,500% over the past eight weeks alone.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/a-guide-to-igaming-and-high-risk-dapps-5254.htm">iGaming</a>, wagering and meme coins constitute a triumvirate of perhaps the most closely watched and lucrative sectors of the crypto industry.</p>
<p dir="auto">Helping to encourage contributions is news from the Meme Kombat team, promising a forthcoming $25k giveaway – not that any further encouragement is required judging by the way fundraising is powering ahead.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Meme Kombat is a one-of-a-kind project that hits all the bases</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">Meme Kombat allows token holders to deposit their tokens in order to take part in the battling and wagering. From their activity on the platform, players can secure various rewards in addition to their winnings from wagering on the outcome of the meme character fights.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is nothing else quite like Meme Kombat on the market today, which is no doubt its core appeal to the ICO’s contributors. The project will launch with an 11-character Season 1, to be followed up with Season 2 at a later date.</p>
<p dir="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160971" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706909458-mk2.png" alt="" width="1600" height="442" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706909458-mk2.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706909458-mk2-300x83.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706909458-mk2-1024x283.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706909458-mk2-768x212.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706909458-mk2-1536x424.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706909458-mk2-150x41.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p dir="auto">Meme Kombat’s Season 1 will be available after the presale is sold out and the project is launched. There are 11 meme characters you can battle with in Season 1: Milady, Baby Doge, Doge, Floki, Kishu, Mong, Pepe, Pepe2, Shiba, Sponge and Wojak.</p>
<p dir="auto">Season 2 meme characters will be out just before Season 1 wraps up. But the story doesn’t end there for Meme Kombat. There are ambitious plans in the works, as hinted at in its marketing materials.</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, according to the Meme Kombat website, “the project has plans for further expansion, potentially adding new game modes, partnerships, and other exciting developments.”</p>

<h2 dir="auto">How Meme Kombat is the perfect fit for crypto enthusiasts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p dir="auto">Meme coins continue to attract buyers who clearly are sold on its vision, and in particular the potential of a decentralized application that could have wide appeal across the multi-billion dollar meme coin space and beyond.</p>
<p dir="auto">Increasingly, crypto investors are homing in on projects with real-world use cases that can attract a large and engaged customer base – Meme Kombat does exactly that. To reiterate, the project targets three of the hottest segments in crypto: gaming, betting and meme coins.</p>
<p dir="auto">Data from listings site CoinGecko values the GameFi sector in market cap terms at $20.7 billion. Another key metric shows that gambling tokens are valued at circa $700 million and growing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Meanwhile, CoinGecko estimates the worth of the meme coins sector at around $20 billion. Meme Kombat has the perfect market fit for this total addressable market that can be measured in tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pick your winner. This would be a fierce battle<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2694.png" alt="⚔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/dk0ZKzD7LL">pic.twitter.com/dk0ZKzD7LL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) <a href="https://twitter.com/Meme_Kombat/status/1752904512631677106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="auto">Meme Kombat’s total token supply is 120,000,000, of which thirty percent is allocated for staking and battle rewards, 10 percent for community rewards, and ten percent for decentralized exchange liquidity. Fifty percent of the total token supply is on sale in the ICO.</p>
<p dir="auto">Prospective contributors to the presale will be comforted to hear that Meme Kombat’s smart contract is fully security audited and no major issues have been detected.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another thing Meme Kombat has going for it is the quality of its art, as shown on its social media properties. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">Meme coins</a> live and die by the vibrancy of their communities – irreverent humor and engaging artwork are key parts of making that pitch to new community members.</p>
<p dir="auto">All the signs indicate that the project’s polished and professional team of designers (and developers) has got a handle on the meme zeitgeist, as you can see from the X postings above.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ultimately then, Meme Kombat is in the enviable position of appealing to all types of meme coin communities. So whether followers of Pepe, Shiba Inu or Sponge, there’s something for everyone at Meme Kombat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media influencer Andrew Tate stirred controversy in the crypto space after revealing plans to launch a digital coin with a now-deleted February 2 X post. The social media influencer has since deleted the post, however, stating that it was just a “joke.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Andrew Tate&#8217;s $100M Investment to Back Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/andrew-tate-net-worth-crypto-holdings-revealed-billionaire-or-not.htm">Tate initially declared</a> his intention to launch the crypto asset for his 8.7 million followers, saying the new crypto project would be backed with $100 million of his personal funds, and that he does not intend to sell.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Andrew Tate deleted his crypto coin tweet</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For early-bird investors from his University.com team, Tate stated they would be given a discount for buying the crypto asset.</p>
<p>Tate promised to promote the crypto asset everywhere and use his influence as a social media icon to push the price, instructing his followers to retweet at least 50,000 times and the proposal would then become a “done deal.”</p>
<p>“Top G &#8211; The G stands for crypto. Every single time you tweet at me,” Tate mentioned in the post.</p>
<p>While the idea gained major traction online with 661,000 views recorded, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Andrew-Tate-one-of-the-most-influential-people-in-human-history">the self-described “most famous man alive”</a> eventually deleted his post.</p>
<h2>Andrew Tate’s &#8216;Crypto Scamcoin&#8217;?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tate’s crypto asset idea has been ridiculed by several industry experts. One such is crypto sleuth and investigator CoffeeZilla, who immediately called Tate’s proposal a “crypto scamcoin.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Andrew Tate is launching a crypto scamcoin. </p>
<p>Last year: &quot;I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANY CRYPTO&#8230; I don&#39;t need to rob my fans&quot; <a href="https://t.co/25ivGTqpKp">pic.twitter.com/25ivGTqpKp</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>CoffeeZilla went on to post a screenshot of Tate’s post, where he unequivocally mentioned that he does not endorse <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/5-best-crypto-shitcoins-buy-now-that-andrew-tate-might-endorse-copium-ladys-ai-pepe-sponge.htm">shitcoins</a>. Shitcoins are joke crypto assets that ride on social media appeal and have little utility. Tate then claimed bemusement that the crypto investigator is unable to detect a joke when it&#8217;s made.</p>
<p>Tate is also quoted as saying he has nothing to do with any crypto asset as he does not intend to rob his “fans.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Tate’s relationship with the crypto industry has been one of heated aggression. In a viral post on X, Tate said he was glad that crypto investors lost all their funds during the long, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-winter-will-last-at-least-another-year-says-founder-of-crypto-firm-which-just-laid-off-40-of-its-workforce.htm">drawn-out crypto winter</a> that stretched through much of 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>In a 12-month video, he explicitly mentioned that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHTOCd8ZgkQ">he foresaw an impending bear market</a> that would impact the emerging industry during that timeframe.</p>
