										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past 24 hours, the non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bybit-provides-nft-ticket-marketplace-for-robbie-williams-virtual-concert-more-top-nft-news.htm">NFT</a>) market sales volume has slightly decreased, less than 2%, to $35,310,744, with several big developments making NFT news rounds.</p>
<p>Buyers are up 8%, sellers 3%, and transactions 9%, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">according</a> to <strong>CryptoSlam</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of the top 10 collections by sales volume are up ‚Äì and significantly so.</p>
<p>The largest increase was recorded by <strong>CATS BRC-20 NFTs</strong>, jumping 4,876% in a day to the 10<sup>th</sup> place with $582,800.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-police-seized-1-77-billion-in-bitcoin-from-chinese-investment-fraud-more-crypto-news.htm">Bitcoin</a></strong>-based NFTs, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-will-play-a-pivotal-role-in-2024-more-top-nft-news-2.htm">Uncategorized Ordinals</a></strong> are in first place with a sales volume of $2.77 million, having gone up 98%.</p>
<p>And when it comes to Bitcoin, it is very close to <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-discusses-challenges-between-crypto-and-ai-warns-tread-carefully.htm">Ethereum</a></strong> today: the former‚Äôs sales volume is $10,778,162, while the latter‚Äôs is $11,127,275.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin narrowed the gap between it and the throne-holder Ethereum, it widened it compared to <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-transaction-volume-reaches-record-high-1-trillion-adoption-rising.htm">Solana</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The two have been in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-25-january.htm">a battle</a> for second place for a while, but Solana currently has nearly half of Bitcoin‚Äôs volume: $5,772,470.</p>
<p>Today in NFT news: Doodles partners with the luxury watch brand G-shock, Art Blocks acquires the Sansa marketplace, and card-battling sci-fi game Parallel nears its open beta launch.</p>
<h2>Doodles and G-shock Join in an NFT Collab</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the latest NFT news, Digital asset firm <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/how-to-build-a-bluechip-nft-brand-with-doodles-founder-poopie-overpriced-jpegs-12.htm">Doodles</a></strong> has partnered with the luxury watch brand <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/casio-latest-japanese-firm-enter-nft-arena-more-follow.htm">G-shock</a></strong> to launch an NFT-inspired watch collection.</p>
<p>Notably, Doodles is behind the popular NFT collection with the same name.</p>
<p>The collaboration is ‚Äúdropping soon,‚Äù the team said in a Twitter post, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/GShock_US/status/1753130100063707317">shared</a> by G-shock as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the explosive growth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) raising legal concerns, NFT regulations have become a top priority as governments and industry organizations worldwide grapple to find the right balance between innovation and consumer protection.</p>
<p>NFTs gained popularity in 2021, <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/2021-dapp-industry-report">generating over $23 billion in trading volume</a> that year. In addition to impressive market growth, many celebrities, major brands, and sports teams launched their own NFTs that year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the NFT industry saw a major decline following the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/disgraced-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-friend-found-guilty-on-all-seven-fraud-charges.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collapse of the crypto exchange FTX</a> and a major market downturn.¬† According to a <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/dapp-industry-report-2023-defi-nft-web3-games">2023 industry report from DappRadar</a>, NFTs became much less valuable throughout 2023, resulting in a trading volume of only $12.6 billion.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the DappRadar report also points out that an impressive 60 million NFTs were sold last year ‚Äì a 445% increase from previous years. Given this, industry experts are predicting that NFTs are going to play a major role in the digital asset industry in 2024.</p>
<h2><b>NFT Regulations Become a Worldwide Priority</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/codycarbone">Cody Carbone</a>, policy lead for The Chamber of Digital Commerce ‚Äì a United States organization promoting the use of digital assets and blockchain ‚Äì told Cryptonews that the industry will likely start to see more NFT use cases arise this year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think we will see NFTs being used for consumer products in real estate, entertainment, healthcare, and more,&#8221; Carbone said. &#8220;We may not see popularity from a market perspective, but NFTs will likely become leveraged within various industries for real-world use cases.‚Äù</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, The Chamber of Digital Commerce recently published <a href="https://digitalchamber.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pixels-to-Policy-compressed-1.pdf">an NFT impact report</a> that explains how NFTs can be used in consumer products in many sectors.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160342" style="width: 588px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-160342 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816035-screenshot-2024-01-30-at-3-47-28pm.png" alt="" width="588" height="942" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816035-screenshot-2024-01-30-at-3-47-28pm.png 588w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816035-screenshot-2024-01-30-at-3-47-28pm-187x300.png 187w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816035-screenshot-2024-01-30-at-3-47-28pm-150x240.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160342" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image Source: The Chamber of Digital Commerce</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet, while it‚Äôs notable that NFTs may see increased adoption this year, understanding how NFTs should be regulated has now become a top priority.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewlrossow">Andrew Rossow</a>, attorney and CEO of AR Media Consulting, told Cryptonews that there is currently no specific federal legislation in the U.S. that directly speaks to NFTs, their governance, and their classification.</p>
<p>Given this, industry experts and organizations are looking to shape regulatory frameworks around NFTs. For example, The Chamber of Digital Commerce NFT impact report states that ‚ÄúNFTs are by and large consumer products that should not be regulated in the same manner as the early, financial applications of blockchain such as cryptocurrencies.‚Äù</p>
<h2>SEC Enforcement Actions Sound the Alarm</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
U.S. lawmakers seem to have a differing opinion, however. For example, The United States Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-163">(SEC) charged media and entertainment company Impact Theory</a> with conducting an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-commissioners-dissent-against-agencys-first-nft-enforcement-action.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unregistered offering of crypto asset securities</a> in the form of NFTs in August last year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis raised alarm bells for everyone,&#8221; Carbone said. &#8220;There are now concerns that the SEC will get involved and start to regulate NFTs as securities.&#8221;</p>
<p>To ease these concerns, Carbone shared that The Chamber of Digital Commerce hosted its first-ever ‚Äú<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/organizations-aim-to-shape-nft-regulations-as-digital-assets-gain-adoption.htm">NFT Education Day</a>‚Äù on Jan. 31. According to Carbone, the purpose of the event was to bring NFT subject matter experts to Capitol Hill to educate both the SEC and Congress on non-fungible tokens.</p>
<p>Specifically, Carbone mentioned that industry experts met with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, along with several House Representatives. According to him, there was an overall general receptiveness to NFTs and their use cases beyond digital collectibles.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was agreement across the board that NFTs should not be securities and should be treated as consumer goods,&#8221; he told Cryptonews. &#8220;There was an appetite to pass specific legislation to exempt consumptive NFTs from securities laws, but not add it to anything that already exists.‚Äù</p>
<figure id="attachment_160343" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160343" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-160343 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816106-processed-17995e8a-8ecc-4e7e-854f-7a603344c144.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816106-processed-17995e8a-8ecc-4e7e-854f-7a603344c144.jpeg 800w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816106-processed-17995e8a-8ecc-4e7e-854f-7a603344c144-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816106-processed-17995e8a-8ecc-4e7e-854f-7a603344c144-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706816106-processed-17995e8a-8ecc-4e7e-854f-7a603344c144-150x113.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160343" class="wp-caption-text">Chamber executives meet with SEC Commissioner Peirce over NFT-related enforcement actions on Jan. 31.<em> Image Source: The Chamber of Digital Commerce</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Carbone added that throughout the event industry leaders were told several times that engagement with other committees outside of financial services is crucial for new regulations around NFTs to form.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Digital Commerce founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perianne-boring-43363991">Perianne Boring</a> told Cryptonews that The Chamber is not advocating for specific regulations tailored exclusively to NFTs, noting that proposing they prematurely could overlook the complexities and evolving nature of the industry.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the technology and its applications continue to develop, we advocate for a measured and comprehensive approach to regulation that considers the unique characteristics and potential implications of NFTs within existing legal frameworks,&#8221; Boring said. &#8220;Our stance prioritizes thorough analysis and dialogue among stakeholders to ensure that any regulatory measures regarding NFTs are informed, balanced, and conducive to fostering innovation while safeguarding consumer protection.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Asia Lags in NFT Regulations Compared to US and EU</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While this perspective comes from a U.S. based organization, Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of gaming software and venture capital company <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-token-hacks-blockchain-gaming-project-animoca.htm">Animoca Brands</a>, told Cryptonews that most countries in Asia do not have specific or advanced regulations for NFTs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMany jurisdictions are looking to self-governing bodies or associations to help regulate NFTs, or they are waiting for the NFT market to evolve further in order to assess the need for regulation,‚Äù he said, adding that he believes NFTs should be treated similarly to how <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-real-world-asset-tokens.htm">real-world assets</a> are treated. ‚ÄúFor instance, there shouldn&#8217;t be regulation, but more consumer protection.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to Siu, due to the versatile nature of NFTs, coupled with the fact that these <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/employee-resources/news/2023/08/30/10-digital-asset-terms-you-should-know">digital assets</a> can represent many different things, a regulatory framework must be flexible enough to account for this diversity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúContext is crucial ‚Äì it&#8217;s not just about regulating NFTs for being NFTs, but rather understanding what those NFTs represent on a case-by-case basis,&#8221; he added. &#8220;For example, selling an NFT is not the same as selling a security, but selling fractional ownership of an NFT may be categorized by regulations as selling a security.‚Äù</p>
<h2>EU Pursues Regulatory Clarity</h2>

Industry experts in Europe are also looking to create regulatory clarity around NFTs. Tokenization platform Brickken&#8217;s head of legal, <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/elisendafabrega/en">Elisenda Fabrega,</a> told Cryptonews that in the European Union (EU), the regulatory scenario for NFTs is intricate, mainly due to the lack of specific regulations.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also important to note that while The European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto Assets regulation ‚Äì also known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/esma-unveils-plan-to-address-crypto-risks-ahead-of-mica-regulation-implementation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiCA ‚Äì is due to take effect at the end of this year</a>, the commission will likely report on NFTs laws in 2025.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Fabrega believes that the characteristics of NFTs can give rise to specific rights and obligations, necessitating the application of different legal frameworks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor example, in contexts where NFTs serve as contracts or embody contractual rights, the significance of contract law is magnified,&#8221; Fabrega said. &#8220;Yet an NFT resembling traditional financial instruments could be classified as a ‚Äòsecurity token,‚Äô subject to European and national financial regulations, such as MiFID II.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fabrega further explained that a key focus for NFT regulation in the EU is <a href="https://news.law.fordham.edu/jcfl/2023/02/06/an-overview-of-the-eu-crypto-asset-regulatory-framework-mica/">around consumer protection</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs more consumers engage with NFTs, the EU has placed increasing emphasis on safeguarding their interests,&#8221; she explained to Cryptonews. &#8220;This includes ensuring transparency in transactions, providing clear information about the rights and limitations associated with NFT purchases, and protecting against deceptive practices.‚Äù</p>
<h2><b>Ongoing Challenges Around NFT Regulations</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While it‚Äôs notable that organizations want to help implement regulatory frameworks for NFTs, confusion around these digital assets persists.</p>
<p>For instance, Carbone mentioned that the best advice he received during NFT Education Day was to refrain from using the term ‚ÄúNFTs‚Äù due to its association with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need to find a new name for NFTs moving forward,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Siu further shared that while there are NFT whitepapers present in regions like Japan, this doesn‚Äôt mean that NFTs are being regulated according to those documents.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn my view, it is unlikely that NFTs themselves will ever be regulated,‚Äù Siu remarked.</p>
<p>Yet the diverse and multifaceted nature of non-fungible tokens might be the biggest challenge to consider when it comes to establishing a regulatory framework for these assets. According to Fabrega, the wide-ranging use cases of NFTs creates a formidable obstacle for the implementation of a uniform regulatory framework.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis diversity requires a careful and tailored approach to regulation, as different categories of NFTs intersect with various legal domains, encompassing intellectual property law, contract law, and financial regulation,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>To accommodate for this, Fabrega believes that a well-structured regulatory approach is instrumental for maintaining a trustworthy and sustainable market for NFTs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis will encourage innovation while diligently safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders involved.&#8221;</p>

DRiP Haus co-founder and CEO Vibhu Norby also welcomed Bryan Johnson to Solana in his own post on X, <a href="https://twitter.com/vibhu/status/1751969246236537099">saying</a> the artwork now has become ‚Äúforever immortalized‚Äù on DRiP.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>DRiP account holders can sign up for the airdrop for free with an invite code or join for 0.1 SOL on their wallet balance.</p>
<p>The airdrop, processed in real-time, was covered by DRiP for gas fees, and the collectibles were tagged to indicate their origin within users&#8217; wallets.</p>
<p>Airdrops are free giveaways of tokens or NFTs to users of specific blockchains or protocols within the crypto space. Users usually need to take some type of action to manually claim the tokens, which are then transferred to the user‚Äôs own wallet.</p>
<p>The tokens may or may not have any monetary value on the secondary market, but affiliation with celebrities like Bryan Johnson undeniably helps bring awareness about the airdrop.</p>

<h2>Pudgy Penguins Reveals Its IP Licensing Platform</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The team behind the popular collection <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-18-january.htm">Pudgy Penguins</a></strong> announced that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pudgy-penguins-nft-launches-toys-2000-walmart-stores-trading-volume-surges-by-530.htm">Pudgy Toys</a> has opened licensing for its second chapter.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe Chapter 2 Pudgy Toy licensing deal is for those Pudgy penguins that will be included in our new line of toys.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the success of Chapter 1, the platform <a href="https://www.overpassip.com/deal/28">says:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWe are excited to offer more licensing opportunities to our community to bring their Pudgy Penguins to life through Toys.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, this is facilitated by the team&#8217;s very own intellectual property (IP) licensing platform, <strong>OverpassIP</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pudgy Penguins and <strong>Lil Pudgy</strong> owners can join the process over the next two weeks. This way, they can transform their MFT penguins into physical toys.</p>
<p>The website also <a href="https://www.overpassip.com/about">notes</a> that owners who successfully join the program will be able to grant licenses to renowned brands for product or media incorporation.</p>
<p>Submitting an NFT for selection does not mean that it will automatically be selected, though.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the chance to bring your Pudgy Penguin or Lil Pudgy to life, follow the instructions in the video below. You have 14 days to submit. </p>
<p>Submit your Pudgy Penguin here: <a href="https://t.co/PolGPmZlb5">https://t.co/PolGPmZlb5</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, OverpassIP has added so-called <strong>Pudgy Rods</strong> as multipliers for licensing deals. It automatically applies if the Penguin and the Rod are in the same wallet and calculated at payout.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Pudgy Rods have developed a layer of utility and will serve as a multiplier for certain licensing deals, on-chain drops, or claims we may do in the future,‚Äù the team <a href="https://media.pudgypenguins.com/education-posts/pudgy-rods-all-you-need-to-know">said</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sotheby&#8217;s has sold an Ordinals inscribed poem titled &#8220;Cord&#8221; by Ana Maria Caballero for 0.28 Bitcoin or $11,430.</p>
<p>The sale, which <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/auction-catalogue/2024/natively-digital-an-ordinals-curated-sale?locale=en&amp;s=introText" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">took place last week</span></a>, was part of the Natively Digital auction, an online event featuring Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions.</p>
<p>The Natively Digital collection aimed to provide a comprehensive exploration of NFT-like Ordinals on Bitcoin, showcasing significant early inscriptions.</p>
<p>In addition to acquiring the inscription, the buyer of &#8220;Cord&#8221; will receive a signed print of the poem.</p>
<h2>First Poem to be Sold by Sotheby&#8217;s</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Michael Bouhanna, the Vice President and Head of Digital Art at Sotheby&#8217;s, took to Twitter to announce that &#8220;Cord&#8221; was the first individual poem ever sold by the esteemed auction house, excluding manuscripts and books.</p>
<p>Caballero said that the sale of &#8220;Cord&#8221; holds great significance for her as she sees it as an opportunity to affirm the inherent value of written poetry.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an incredible opportunity to make a statement that words and language and poetry have value on their own.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes yes not counting manuscripts and books.</p>
<p>&mdash; Michael Bouhanna (@michaelbouhanna) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelbouhanna/status/1749386091679875476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Caballero emphasized that the poem was sold based solely on the power of its language and text, without any additional visuals, sound, or experiences attached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cord&#8221; will be featured in Caballero&#8217;s upcoming book, titled &#8220;Mammal.&#8221; Other notable artists included in the Natively Digital auction were FAR, XCPinata, Nullish, Rudxane, Jennifer and Kevin McCoy, Popoki, Shroomtoshi, Des Lucr√©ce, and Claudia Hart.</p>
<p>One inscription associated with the &#8220;Quantum Cats&#8221; collection fetched over $250,000 during the auction.</p>
<h2>Caballero Continues Push into the Digital Asset Industry</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In 2021, Caballero, along with Kalen Iwamoto and Sasha Stiles, co-founded theVerseverse, a digital poetry and NFT gallery.</p>
<p>Earlier, theVerseverse collaborated with the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles to present an exhibition that combined Allen Ginsberg&#8217;s photographs with AI-generated poetry.</p>
<p>The exhibition, titled &#8220;Muses &amp; Self: Photographs by Allen Ginsberg,&#8221; received mixed reactions from the poetry community, as it sought to emulate the style of the iconic Beat Generation figure.</p>
<p>Sotheby&#8217;s highlighted Caballero&#8217;s exploration of the influence of biology on societal and cultural rituals in her work.</p>
<p>The auction house praised her ability to unveil the reality behind romanticized motherhood and challenge the narrative of sacrifice as a virtue.</p>
<p>Caballero revealed that &#8220;Cord&#8221; is written in a poetic form known as a villanelle.</p>
<p>This form consists of 19 lines divided into five stanzas, with three lines each, and one stanza with four lines. The villanelle employs two repeated rhymes and utilizes certain lines multiple times.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI love that value statement for poetry, and for verse, especially because this is a poem about motherhood; it&#8217;s about pregnancy, about the body, about embodiment,‚Äù Caballero said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo it&#8217;s even more meaningful in what tends to be a very male-dominated space,‚Äù she said, adding that the auction for the Ordinals poem ‚ÄúCord‚Äù received over 40 bids.</p>
<p>Caballero has received several awards throughout her writing career, including the Beverly International and Jos√© Manuel Arango National Poetry Prizes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The collapse of the non-fungible token (NFT) market last year dealt a blow to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/opensea-nft-marketplace-review.htm">OpenSea</a>, raising questions about its once staggering $13.3 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Now, the popular NFT marketplace is at the center of acquisition discussions, with CEO and co-founder Devin Finzer expressing an open-minded approach to potential deals, including the possibility of being acquired itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that if the right partnership comes along, then that&#8217;s something we should certainly consider,&#8221; Finzer <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/opensea-ceo-open-to-suitors-acquiring-nft-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said in a recent interview</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.¬†</span></p>
<p>However, he clarified that OpenSea is not actively seeking a suitor and has no immediate plans to be acquired.</p>
<p>Despite being overtaken by rival platform Blur, which has achieved greater trading volume, OpenSea remains focused on building a brand that prioritizes user safety and removes fraudulent or problematic collections.</p>
<p>The decline in OpenSea&#8217;s trading volume has been significant, plummeting by 96% since January 2022, according to data from Dune Analytics.</p>
<p>Blur, on the other hand, has gained momentum by employing airdrops of its token and now boasts a daily trading volume five times greater than OpenSea&#8217;s, although OpenSea still has a larger user base.</p>
<p>OpenSea enjoyed substantial support from venture capitalists during the NFT boom in 2021, with Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Coatue Management, and actor Ashton Kutcher all participating in fundraising rounds.</p>
<p>However, Coatue Management reportedly devalued its stake in OpenSea by 90% to $13 million in November.</p>
<p>While rumors about OpenSea&#8217;s potential initial public offering persist, Finzer remained tight-lipped on the matter.</p>
<h2>OpenSea Has Done its Share of Deals</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In terms of deals, OpenSea has already made some moves, acquiring NFT aggregator tool Gem in 2022, as well as early crypto wallet Dharma and Mintdrop, a platform that facilitates quick market entry for creators.</p>
<p>Finzer emphasized that talent is a crucial factor in their acquisition strategy, seeking entrepreneurial-minded individuals who may have started their own projects but are now seeking opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome of the most passionate individuals are those who go to start their own project, those sort of entrepreneurial-minded people. Maybe they didn‚Äôt get the level of traction that they wanted in their own startup, and they‚Äôre looking for home elsewhere.‚Äù</p>
<p>OpenSea is also actively engaging with luxury brands to develop bespoke NFT initiatives, reflecting the growing interest of fashion houses and other content-based companies in the NFT space.</p>
<p>In October, NFT trading volume <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nfts-on-the-rise-again-october-saw-32-growth-in-trading-volume-trend-to-continue-this-month.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">surged by $99 million</span></a>, reaching $405 million, signifying levels of sales not seen since August.</p>
<p>Likewise, sales of NFTs on the <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin (BTC)</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†network¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-blockchain-sets-new-record-december-2023-nft-sales-surpass-881-million-for-first-time-ever.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached a new milestone</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†in December 2023, surpassing $881 million for the first time ever.¬†</span></p>
<p>NFT sales on the Bitcoin chain reached $881,223,753.92 last month, setting the highest single-month sales record to date.</p>
<p>This included 111,713 buyer addresses and 98,744 seller addresses, both setting the highest single-month records to date.</p>
<p>Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, trailed behind with NFT sales totaling $364.79 million.</p>
<p>BTC-focused NFT sales outperformed ETH‚Äôs by a significant margin, being 2.34 times greater in December.</p>
<p>Solana secured the third spot with approximately $325.14 million in NFT sales, experiencing a remarkable 312% increase from the previous month.</p>

<p>On Jan 25, Ronaldo played football with selected NFT holders in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Ctdq2cH_Lvw?si=25jSxv2c1j6yrqFm">training drill in Lisbon</a> alongside Binance ambassador Khaby Lame and footballer Maria Markovic.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Golden Ticket was part of the CR7 Forever Zone Collection and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cristiano-ronaldo-launches-nft-collection-with-binance-crypto-exchange.htm">GOAT NFT Series.</a> The Golden Ticket holder and four other users selected at random got a chance to play alongside the football star.</p>
<p>The event ‚ÄúTrain with CR7‚Äù saw Ronaldo teach participants several football techniques including penalty decisions with Khaby Lame in goal.</p>
<p>Fans described the event as an unbelievable once-in-a-lifetime chance to practice their favorite sport with one of the best players.</p>
<p>Ronaldo shared highlights of the session on his Instagram page. The footballer noted that it was an amazing fan experience set up by the exchange expressing gratitude to the holders of his rarest NFTs.</p>
<h2>Ronaldo‚Äôs NFTs Journey</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In June 2022, the former Real Madrid and Manchester United player announced a multi-year NFT partnership with Binance with former CEO Changpeng Zhao praising the sports star for boasting one of the most dedicated fan bases through skill and authenticity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>We&#39;re kicking off an exclusive multi-year NFT partnership with football legend Cristiano Ronaldo. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On his part, Ronaldo noted that he would like to bring new experiences to his fans as he always wanted to be a part of the NFT platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúMy relationship with the fans is very important to me, so the idea of bringing unprecedented experiences and access through this NFT platform is something that I wanted to be a part of.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<h2>NFT Leads to Lawsuit in the United States<i>¬†</i></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, one year later, Ronaldo <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/soccer-superstar-cristiano-ronaldo-sued-for-promoting-binance-crypto-exchange-heres-the-latest.htm">faces a lawsuit</a> in the United States over promoting the NFT with Binance.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs claim he participated in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in partnership with Binance claiming damages of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>In 2022, the cheapest of the digital collectibles were priced at $77 but plunged to $1 a year later with investors claiming that Ronaldo‚Äôs involvement led to a 500% increase in searches.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúRonaldo‚Äôs promotions solicited or assisted Binance in soliciting investments in unregistered securities by encouraging his millions of followers, fans, and supporters to invest with the Binance platform.‚Äù<i>¬†</i></p></blockquote>
<p>On Jan 16, plaintiffs sought to serve the sports star through substituted means like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-customers-seek-to-serve-1b-lawsuit-to-ronaldo-via-x.htm">email and social media</a> as efforts to locate his residence in Saudi Arabia have been difficult</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past 24 hours, the non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/magic-eden-rewards-top-nft-news-today-24-january.htm">NFT</a>) market has recovered a bit, bringing a ray of light to the daily NFT news roundup.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs up 11% in a day, at the time of writing, rising to $32,246,366.</p>
<p>Buyers and sellers are down about 1%, and transactions are up less than 1%, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">according</a> to <strong>CryptoSlam.</strong></p>
<p>Among the top 10 collections per sales volume, the day‚Äôs best performers are <strong>LIGO BRC-20 NFT</strong> (+130%) and <strong>Dokyo</strong> (+29%).</p>
<p>Overall, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptic-clues-mysterious-ordinals-inscription-hints-at-cursed-bitcoin-art-whats-going-on.htm">Ordinals</a></strong> are in the first place by sales volume, with %1.49 million. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-23-january.htm"><strong>CryptoPunks</strong></a> follows it¬†with $1.36 million.</p>
<p>Daily NFT news: Bitcoin and Solana cross swords over the 2<sup>nd</sup> place among the top 10, Ronin unveils a major wallet upgrade, and Rario is set to close the current platform and launch a new one.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Solana Duke It Out</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We‚Äôve recently seen <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-mystery-deepens-with-21000-ordinal-inscriptions-airdropped-in-enigmatic-bitcoin-game.htm">Bitcoin</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-sales-solana-bitcoin-ethereum-weekly-trading-volume.htm">Solana</a></strong> crossing swords over the coveted second place in the top 10 blockchains per NFT sales volume.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-begins-technical-assessment-to-onboard-new-ethereum-execution-client-for-diversity.htm">Ethereum</a> </strong>has been firmly holding the first place, and it‚Äôs still there. Though its volume is slightly down, it stands at $9.4 million, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">according</a> to <strong>CryptoSlam</strong>.</p>
<p>But the second-place occupant has been shifting between two other popular chains. Just yesterday, Solana was there, and today, Bitcoin pushed it out. The latter‚Äôs higher increase in sales percentage-wise tipped the scale.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is up over 21% in the last day, with a current volume of $7.6 million. Very close by is Solana, at $7.42 million. It‚Äôs up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>And speaking of Ronin‚Ä¶.</p>
<h2>Ronin Reveals Wallet Upgrade</h2>

<h2>Rario Closes Existing NFT Product, Plans a New One</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Rario</strong>, a cricket-focused NFT platform, has announced the closure of its current platform.</p>
<p>The team said it could not live up to the users‚Äô expectations due to the issues faced over the last half a year. These include the NFT sector crash, management failures, and new Web3 regulations creating industry headwinds.</p>
<p>Therefore, it has formed a new management team. But to make positive changes, they argued, they‚Äôll have to sunset the current Rario product on January 29.</p>
<p>Wallet cash balances will be available for withdrawal until March 31.</p>

<p>That said, the platform has announced ‚Äúa new and improved version of Rario.‚Äù In March, the team will launch a new platform with new cricket-based games.</p>
<p>However, the existing Rario cards will be unusable on the new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unstoppable-domains-and-the-sandbox-partner-to-launch-new-metaverse-experience-more-crypto-news.htm">gaming</a> platform. The owners will get additional perks, with more details coming in February, the team said.</p>
<p>This has caused issues, with the platform acknowledging that ‚Äúsome‚Äù users ‚Äúhave experienced losses‚Äù from investment in these cards.</p>
<p>The team claims to be working with stakeholders on a compensation plan. More details should be available next week.</p>

<h2>Weekly NFT Sales Drop, Solana Ahead of Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
NFT sales for the past week have dropped. Falling 13%, they currently sit at $268,396,450.</p>
<p>The number of transactions is down, too. It has dropped 19% to 2.3 million.</p>
<p>Not everything is red, though. Buyers are up 51% in seven days. Meanwhile, the number of sellers increased 57%.</p>
<p>Notably, <strong>Solana</strong> has kept its position ahead of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> in this period despite the latter‚Äôs recent rise. Solana is in the second place of the top 10 blockchains by NFT sales volume.</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum</strong>, in the first spot, has dropped over 30% but maintained its position with $9.8 million. Solana is relatively close now (even with a 6% drop) with $7.88 million.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, ranking third, fell 22% in a week to $6.19 million. The four-ranked <strong>Polygon</strong> is quite far behind with $1.6 million in volume (down 32%).</p>

<p>Buyers and sellers are both up around 2%, while transactions are down 10%.</p>
<p>Among the top 10 collections by sales volume, <strong>CryptoPunks </strong>made the NFT news rounds and took the first spot with over $3.5 million.</p>

<p><strong>Froganas</strong> and <strong>Gas Heroes Common Heroes</strong> are making NFT news rounds in red, dropping 6% and 3%, respectively.</p>
<p>Today in NFT news, read about the Magic Eden-backed Non-Fungible DAO, CryptoPunks relaunching its CryptoPunks721 wrapper, and iSHANG and Earth Exchange‚Äôs NFT staking program for environmental sustainability.</p>
<h2>Non-Fungible DAO Unveiled, Powered by NFT</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Non-Fungible DAO</strong> (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) introduced itself on Monday. It <a href="https://twitter.com/Non_FungibleDAO/status/1749446837973532747">said</a> that would be a community-owned, decentralized organization.</p>
<p>Its mission: to develop and drive adoption of the protocols that will power the future of NFT commerce.</p>
<p>While digital asset adoption is still in its early phases, the future will see most of the world interacting with NFTs every day, argued the team.</p>
<p>Non-Fungible DAO owns and governs open-source technologies for NFTs across major chains. This includes smart contracts originally developed by the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm">Magic Eden</a></strong> marketplace on four chains: <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-stablecoin-transfers-hit-monthly-record-of-300-billion-sol-adoption-rising.htm">Solana</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-plunges-below-40000-down-nearly-20-from-post-etf-launch-highs-heres-how-low-the-btc-bears-could-bury-the-price.htm">Bitcoin</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterins-zuzalu-retreat-spurs-ethereum-backed-zu-villages-whats-behind-this-mysterious-gathering.htm">Ethereum</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/banks-will-invest-in-blockchain-when-they-make-money-from-bitcoin-etf-more-crypto-news.htm">Polygon</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Magic Eden commented, saying it would be open-sourcing and contributing its trading and minting protocols to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/1inch-dao-votes-to-hire-permanent-legal-counsel-for-decentralized-nature-challenges.htm">DAO</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Decentralization is essential to the global adoption of NFTs. Magic Eden will be open-sourcing and contributing all of its NFT trading and minting protocols to Non-Fungible DAO. <a href="https://t.co/5gUzwqdDnh">https://t.co/5gUzwqdDnh</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Per the DAO, each NFT token holder will be able to vote on governance and the use of the ecosystem funds.</p>
<p>Most of the NFT token supply will be allocated to the community. Community members who use the protocols owned by the Non-Fungible DAO can earn the token.</p>
<p>As for ‚ÄúWEN NFT,‚Äù the team said ‚ÄúSOON.‚Äù</p>
<p>The token is still not deployed, they said, and there are no airdrops yet. MagicEden CEO Jack Lu also commented on the news:</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">At <a href="https://twitter.com/MagicEden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MagicEden</a>, our mission is to make digital ownership universal. That mission will take many years.</p>

<h2>CryptoPunks Ranks #1, Relaunches CryptoPunks721</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The popular <strong>CryptoPunks</strong> collection has taken the first spot per sales volume today. <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">According</a> to CryptoSlam, it is up 12% over the last 24 hours, currently standing at $3,550,498.</p>
<p>Its buyers are up 56%, sellers 25%, and transactions 29%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CryptoPunks team initially <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts/status/1738301564195164622">released</a> CryptoPunks721 in <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts/status/1737556934281003451">December</a>. They <a href="https://twitter.com/0xQuit/status/1748073786300334357">encountered some issues</a>, having to fix those and relaunch on Thursday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Punks, thanks for your patience. The team has identified and fixed the issue with the Stash contract, and CryptoPunks721 has been relaunched.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><a href="https://721.cryptopunks.app/">Per</a> the website, CryptoPunks721 is the official CryptoPunks smart contract for converting CryptoPunk tokens into ERC-721 tokens by ‚Äúwrapping‚Äù them.</p>
<p>ERC-721 is a data standard on <strong>Ethereum</strong> on which most NFT collections are built. However, CryptoPunks predates the creation of the ERC-721 standard. Therefore, to work smoothly with certain protocols, it must be converted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe conversion process is called ‚Äúwrapping‚Äù and creates a CryptoPunks721 wrapped CryptoPunk,‚Äù the team said.</p>
<p>Wrapping enables owners to use their NFTs on platforms or in ecosystems that primarily support fungible tokens. This includes NFT marketplaces and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.</p>
<p>CryptoPunks can also be unwraped at any time.</p>
<p>The wrapper contract is gas-optimized, said the team, using about half of the gas as the third-party contract for wrapping, unwrapping, and transferring CryptoPunks.</p>

Unlike weather, however, NFT news forecasts are a bit more difficult, so we can never be sure what to expect.</p>
<p>After several days of drops, the 24-hour sales volume is up today by 4.55% to $36,306,092, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">according</a> to <strong>CryptoSlam</strong>.</p>

<p>Today in NFT news, read about Cardano entering the top 10 blockchain list by NFT sales volume, Ethereum recording the highest volume since June last year, and NFTs attracting Corporate America.</p>
<h2>Cardano NFT Trading Volume Lands in Top 10</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-prediction-as-ada-struggles-in-corrective-pattern-breakout-or-breakdown-ahead.htm">Cardano</a></strong> has <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">entered</a> the top blockchains by NFT trading volume.</p>
<p>That said, it ‚Äì as most blockchains over the past 24 hours ‚Äì is mostly in red. Sales are down 19% to $117,127, while the buyers are up 13%.</p>

<p>When it comes to sales volume among the top 10, the only green chains (and the day‚Äôs winners) are <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/flow-price-prediction-as-300-million-pushes-flow-up-35-whats-going-on.htm">Flow</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-franklin-templeton-with-1-5-trillion-aum-indicates-interest-in-solana-1000-sol-incoming.htm">Solana</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-fidelitys-spot-ethereum-etf.htm">Ethereum</a></strong>, respectively.</p>

<p>Among the top 10 in this period, Solana is the best performer, with a rise in volume of 43%.

<h2>Ethereum Records Highest Volume Since June</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On Thursday, January 18, the trading volume of the <strong>Ethereum</strong> NFT market hit $42.7 million. This was the first time this number exceeded $40 million since the end of June last year.</p>
<p>The news was first <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1748541866457584038">published</a> by journalist Colin Wu.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the second-highest <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs">daily volume</a> was $32.52 million, seen on January 12.</p>
<p>Since Thursday, however, the trading volume has gone back down, though to somewhat higher levels than the weeks prior and on par with those recorded in early December last year.</p>
<p>Friday recorded $29.6 million, Saturday $28.2 million, and Sunday $25.6 million.</p>

<p>The weekly volume, too, has shot up to the heights first seen since June 2023.</p>
<p>As recorded on January 15, the weekly volume was up to just below $204 million. A week earlier, it stood at $168.9 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the end of June last year saw $216.6 million in weekly trading volume.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the highest point reached was a whopping 1.4 billion in April 2022.</p>

<h2>NFTs Are Attracting Corporate America</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Following the drop in NFT markets compared to two years ago, profits are far away, but Corporate America is still finding useful ways to utilize NFTs, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/01/19/forget-boredapes-and-cryptopunks-nfts-are-making-a-comeback-in-corporate-branding/">according</a> to Forbes.</p>
<p>Per the report,</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúNow that the market has crashed, a much less ambitious version of NFTs are finding a welcome home in the marketing departments of corporate America.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Making the rounds in NFT news, companies like <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-news-summary-mastercard-launches-start-path-crypto-meta-bringing-nft-minting-trading-to-instagram.htm">MasterCard</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coca-cola-and-top-daos-join-coinbases-onchain-summer-web3-festival-for-base-launch.htm">Coca-Cola</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/starbucks-celebrates-20-years-of-pumpkin-spice-latte-with-nft-collectibles.htm">Starbucks</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/immutable-eliminates-fees-in-zkevm-gaming-solution-more-news.htm">Lufthansa</a></strong> have all found ways to employ these tokens. And sneaker companies ‚Äúmay represent the perfect marriage of NFT technology and brand marketing,‚Äù Forbes wrote.</p>
<p>The companies that decided to launch their own collections include <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nike-rtfkt-nft-collections-generate-1-4-billion-in-trading-volume.htm">Nike</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/investor-purchases-330-adidas-nfts-using-smart-contract-328-more-than-cap.htm">Adidas</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jay-zs-roc-nation-and-puma-collaborate-on-nft-enhanced-sneakers.htm">Puma</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Nike‚Äôs Dunk Genesis collection ‚Äúwas a huge success,‚Äù according to Steven Vasilev, co-founder of NFT studio <strong>RTFKT</strong>, purchased by Nike in December 2021. ‚ÄúEven though the market is still down, our products are still bringing in new people. [‚Ä¶] Where Nike serves athletes, we serve creators.‚Äù</p>
<p>Many of these collections are used through a loyalty program, so trading is discouraged. Hence, these won‚Äôt contribute to volume on NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p>However, Paul Brody, global blockchain lead at consulting firm <strong>Ernst &amp; Young</strong>, argued that,</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúIt can turn out to be really great advertising. Your blockchain wallet is gonna become a bit like your public trophy case.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that ‚Äúwe&#8217;re headed for a future that is more and more NFTs as souvenirs and as public trophies and not as transferrable financial assets.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-18-january.htm">NFT</a>) is seeing another mixed day with NFT news varying in sentiment.</p>
<p>Sales volume was down 13% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing and is currently at $42,893,676.</p>
<p>NFT transactions have seen a 9% drop in the same period. And while sellers are down 3.5%, buyers are up nearly 10%.</p>
<p>MintID is the best performer among the top 10 collections by sales volume. It went up 382% in a day to $2.2 million. The second-best <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mutant-ape-planet-nft-designer-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-faces-5-years-in-prison.htm">Mutant Ape Yacht Club</a></strong> increased 74% to $949,433.</p>
<p><strong>CryptoUndeads</strong>, though taking the first place among the top 10, has also seen the largest drop in volume: 72% to $2.3 million. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pudgy-penguins-unveils-web3-game-pudgy-world-powered-by-zksync-era.htm"><strong>Pudgy Penguins</strong></a> follow it¬†with a 49% drop to $2 million.</p>
<p>Decreased sales volume certainly hasn‚Äôt slowed down the NFT news mill.</p>
<p>Today in NFT news, read about Coinbase NFTs‚Äô new AI-powered feature, the Nifty Island‚Äôs open beta, and Nyan Heroes‚Äô early access play-to-airdrop and its first airdrop quiz.</p>
<h2>Coinbase‚Äôs Marketplace Unveils AI-generated NFT Feature</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Creating NFTs can be quite complicated ‚Äì and potentially pricy ‚Äì for the average user.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arguments-conclude-in-coinbase-and-sec-case-judge-failla-holds-on-decision.htm">Coinbase‚Äôs</a> </strong>NFT marketplace has revealed <strong>Instamint</strong>. This novel feature is powered by artificial intelligence (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/ai-crypto-coins/">AI</a>) to enable all users to generate their own NFTs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can now create AI-generated NFTs with Coinbase NFT Instamint.</p>
<p>Try it here: <a href="https://t.co/lmHeWvwLtg">https://t.co/lmHeWvwLtg</a> <a href="https://t.co/wWRcgID4Mj">pic.twitter.com/wWRcgID4Mj</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The new tool is meant to simplify the NFT creation process, possibly helping aspiring artists.</p>
<p>To generate ‚Äúan on-chain collection, for you, or for sale,‚Äù as the website <a href="https://nft.coinbase.com/mint/base">says</a>, a user just needs to add a photo and name, describe the future NFT, and set the gas price in ETH.</p>
<p>The last one is optional, starting with $0.01.</p>
<p>Coinbase NFT <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-nft-marketplace-launches-in-beta-plans-to-move-beyond-ethereum.htm">launched in beta</a> in June 2023.</p>
<p>The platform has been built as an open marketplace where users can trade NFTs utilizing their own non-custodial wallets, such as <strong>MetaMask</strong>, without having to use the Coinbase Wallet, the team said.</p>
<p>The exchange also noted that it planned to decentralize the marketplace by ‚Äúmoving [features] from Coinbase tech to decentralized solutions.‚Äù It would also add support for NFTs on blockchains other than <strong>Ethereum</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has launched yet another series of digital collectibles, sparking controversy in the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s latest creation is hosted on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> blockchain but has a unique twist.</p>
<h2>Trump Digital Trading Cards on Bitcoin Ordinals Come with Limitations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
What sets these digital collectibles apart is that they cannot be traded on their owners until December 2024. This limitation has left many enthusiasts scratching their heads.</p>
<p>In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/CollectTrump/status/1748054959843622941" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent post on X</span></a>, the official Trump Cards account said collectors who are willing to invest $99 for 100 of the &#8220;mugshot edition&#8221; NFTs, which were issued on the Polygon blockchain in December, will also receive a unique digital card, known as an &#8220;ordinal,&#8221; on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s announcement on social media touted these as &#8220;The First Ever Trump Trading Cards officially created on the Bitcoin Blockchain!&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TRUMP DIGITAL TRADING CARDS on BITCOIN ORDINALS <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f7e7.png" alt="üüß" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The FIRST EVER Trump Trading Cards on Bitcoin. Read this thread <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b07.png" alt="‚¨á" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, the announcement thread featured grammatical errors and non-standard capitalization, drawing further attention to the venture.</p>
<p>The catch is that only 200 of these &#8220;one of one&#8221; Ordinals will be minted.</p>
<p>This limitation, supposedly aimed at preventing them from being seen as &#8220;investment vehicles,&#8221; has paradoxically diminished their appeal as NFTs in the eyes of potential buyers.</p>
<h2>Donald Trump&#8217;s Foray in NFTs and Digital Collectibles</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-and-ex-us-president-donald-trump-launches-official-nft-project-this-is-what-you-need-to-know.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a>, the former president released the NFT collection, dubbed ‚ÄúTrump Cards,‚Äù in December 2022.</p>
<p>The NFT collection features a series of digital ‚Äúcards‚Äù depicting Trump in various iconic poses and situations, which include Trump as a muscle-bound wrestling champion, Trump holding a basketball, and even Trump in space.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donald Trumps in 2021: Crypto is dangerous. It can be an explosion like we have never seen before.</p>
<p>Donald Trump in 2022: I&#39;m doing my first official NFT collection. <a href="https://t.co/lHRxWUYNqw">pic.twitter.com/lHRxWUYNqw</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to data from OpenSea, the series of NFTs has generated over $26 million in trading volume.</p>
<p>Trump launched his second series of Trump Trading Cards in August last year, which also sold out immediately after release.</p>
<p>The second collection featured 47,000 tokens, each with a price tag of $99, this time with limited one-of-one NFTs and autographed cards.<br />
Speculation surrounding the ownership of the NFT projects has been rampant since its initial release.</p>
<p>On the official Trump Trading Cards website, it says that CIC Digital LLC allowed NFT INT LLC, the company behind the NFT project, to use <a href="https://collecttrumpcards.com/">Trump‚Äôs likeness, name, and image</a> under a paid licensing agreement.</p>
<p>The project‚Äôs website also claims that funds raised from the NFTs won‚Äôt be used for Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign.</p>
<p>In an April filing, Trump <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-filing-reveals-trump-earned-up-1-million-from-nft-sales-heres-what-you-need-know.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed that he has raked in up to $1 million</span></a> from the sales of his digital trading cards.</p>
<p>The filing was part of his personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, which also showed that the American politician earned millions from speaking engagements.</p>
<p>According to the filing, Trump holds the position of ‚Äúmanager, president, secretary and treasurer‚Äù at CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cryptic message has recently surfaced on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> blockchain, leaving the crypto community buzzing with curiosity.</p>
<p>The message, discovered <a href="https://www.ord.io/55365041" rel="sponsored">within Ordinals inscription 55,365,041</a>, has ignited the imaginations of Bitcoin enthusiasts. Many are eager to decipher its enigmatic meaning and speculate about the possibility of a new and intriguing Ordinals art project. The message reads:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;10,000 sats, side by side. A single UTXO, untouched inside. Born together, cursed at heart. Built with code, Bitcoin Art.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Accompanying this cryptic text is a sequence of numbers, 391481082118 &ndash; 391481092117.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: A mysterious message was just inscribed on an Uncommon Sat which appears to have on-chain ties to an unrevealed 10K collection inscribed 1 hour before the Jubilee</p>
<p>Message ‚Üí <a href="https://t.co/LvKQuQsrrG">https://t.co/LvKQuQsrrG</a><br />Parent ‚Üí <a href="https://t.co/Sf7vqH5jhf">https://t.co/Sf7vqH5jhf</a><br />Children ‚Üí <a href="https://t.co/BYC78QH0iH">https://t.co/BYC78QH0iH</a> <a href="https://t.co/SBRYZtiFhW">pic.twitter.com/SBRYZtiFhW</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ord.io (@ord_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/ord_io/status/1746797464877744202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
<h2>What Does the Message Mean?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
To understand the cryptic message fully, we need to delve into the intricacies of the cryptocurrency world.</p>
<p>In the realm of cryptocurrency, &#8220;UTXO&#8221; stands for Unspent Transaction Output, referring to the remaining amount of a particular cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, after a transaction has occurred.</p>
<p>These unspent funds can subsequently be used in new transactions, providing a foundation for the broader blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>The mysterious message has left the Ordinals community puzzled, with many speculating that it could hint at a potential Ordinals art project or NFT profile picture (PFP) collection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that numerous NFT projects feature 10,000 unique images or assets, making this interpretation a plausible theory.</p>
<p>However, until more details emerge, Bitcoin enthusiasts can only engage in speculative sleuthing while searching for clues before any official revelation occurs.
</p>
<h2>Not Much Details in the Ordinals Inscription</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Leonidas, a pseudonymous NFT historian and Ordinals collector claimed they &#8220;didn&#8217;t really leave us much info about what the collection actually is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The repeating nature of the inscription, akin to the famous &#8220;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&#8221; message from the classic film &#8220;The Shining,&#8221; further intensifies the mystery.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;Born together, cursed at heart&#8221; could allude to the inscription&#8217;s association with a &#8220;cursed&#8221; parent Ordinal.</p>
<p>A quick search on Ordiscan reveals a connection to another inscription, -471,460, which features an image of a tower or obelisk.</p>
<p>While the term &#8220;Cursed Ordinals&#8221; might evoke notions of a horror movie, it actually refers to Ordinals that were initially overlooked by the Ord indexer, resulting in their absence from wallets and marketplaces.</p>
<p>These cursed inscriptions, like the tower image, were assigned negative numbers until the issue was resolved.</p>
<p>&#8220;The original version of the Ordinals indexer did not catch them; the newer versions do,&#8221; Leonidas explained, clarifying that giving these inscriptions negative numbers was the solution.
</p>
<h2>Other Inscriptions Tied in the Mystery</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Interestingly, the so-called &#8220;cursed ordinal&#8221; had ties to another parent inscription, 53,383,387, which featured a white door under a black arch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just had the Jubilee upgrade a week ago that &#8216;blessed&#8217; the edge cases that cause cursed inscriptions. So now all new inscriptions created in weird ways get a normal positive number and are not cursed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This update, however, leaves the previously cursed inscriptions forever marked with negative numbers, effectively locking a supply of approximately 470,000 cursed inscriptions.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the Ordinals protocol in January of the previous year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-token-tap-1-billion-market-cap-as-btc-moves-past-43500.htm">over 55 million items have been minted</a> on the Bitcoin blockchain, as reported by a Dune data dashboard.</p>
<p>These items encompass a wide range of content, from a clone of the classic first-person shooter Doom to a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator.</p>
<p>Additionally, artists and collectors have utilized Ordinals to inscribe artwork and PFP collections on the blockchain while establishing a standard for deploying fungible tokens on Bitcoin.</p>
