Retik Finance (RETIK) has emerged as a compelling alternative to Solana (SOL), experiencing a meteoric rise in its presale phase.  As of the latest update, Retik Finance has surged past an impressive milestone, accumulating over $19,000,000 in presale funds. This remarkable feat has been fueled by a surge of interest from investors and significant contributions from whale wallets, demonstrating the platform&#8217;s potential for substantial growth.</p>
<h2><b>Presale Dynamics of Retik Finance (RETIK)</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Retik Finance has entered its seventh presale stage, offering its tokens at an enticing price of $0.1. The project&#8217;s commitment to security and reliability is evident through its meticulous audit conducted by Certik, a respected blockchain security firm. This endorsement adds a significant layer of credibility to Retik Finance, reassuring investors of its trustworthiness. Moreover, the project has solidified its presence on leading cryptocurrency tracking platforms, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, further enhancing its reputation and visibility within the market. The presale phase has exceeded expectations, with Retik Finance successfully selling 289,336,507 RETIK tokens, resulting in a remarkable presale fund surpassing $19,000,000. This achievement underscores the confidence and enthusiasm of investors who recognize the inherent value and potential growth opportunities associated with RETIK. The substantial inflow of investors and the participation of whale wallets have contributed to Retik Finance&#8217;s rapid ascent, cementing its position as a promising utility token poised for significant growth.<a href="https://retik.com/?utm_source=cryptonews&amp;utm_medium=cryptonews0321" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161050" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706982157-retik-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="82" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706982157-retik-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706982157-retik-banner-300x48.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1706982157-retik-banner-150x24.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Retik Finance Unique Features</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><b>Retik Swap &#8211; Redefining Token Trading</b></h3>
<p>At the heart of Retik Finance&#8217;s ecosystem lies Retik Swap, a decentralised exchange (DEX) offering a seamless token trading experience with remarkably low fees. Operating on the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, Retik Swap distinguishes itself from traditional order book exchanges. Instead of direct matching with a counterparty, all trades occur against a liquidity pool. The AMM model, governed by the equation x * y = k, dictates asset pricing in a decentralised exchange like Retik. This mathematical formula ensures that trades on Retik Swap are executed autonomously via smart contracts, providing users with an innovative, autonomous, and liquid trading environment. Liquidity providers (LPs) play a crucial role by supplying liquidity to the smart contract, collectively sustaining the market&#8217;s operation.</p>
<h3><b>Stake &amp; Earn &#8211; Active Participation for Passive Income</b></h3>
<p>In the realm of decentralised finance, Retik Finance provides users with an opportunity to actively contribute to the network&#8217;s security and functionality through staking. By staking RETIK tokens, users not only support the network but also earn additional RETIK tokens as a bonus. The staking mechanism requires users to lock their RETIK tokens into a smart contract for a specified period. This commitment ensures that staked tokens are used to validate transactions, secure the network, and facilitate various functions within the Retik Finance ecosystem. The rewards distributed as a percentage of the staked amount incentivize users to actively participate, fostering a more engaged and committed user base within the Retik ecosystem.</p>
<h3><b>Perpetual Futures &amp; Options &#8211; Advanced Trading Solutions</b></h3>
<p>Retik Finance introduces a SuperDEX, utilising advanced technology to redefine the decentralised exchange trading experience. The platform offers perpetual futures contracts, enabling users to engage in leveraged trading, going long or short on cryptocurrency values without actual ownership. While this opens up opportunities for high profits, it also introduces risks, emphasising the importance of understanding and effective risk management. Options trading, a sophisticated financial instrument, is another dimension of Retik Finance&#8217;s offerings. Users can buy or sell the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified strike price and future date. This feature enables various trading strategies for speculation or risk management, providing increased leverage in speculative trades. In the Retik option protocol, each option type corresponds to a specific Ethereum Smart Contract, indicating the base and quote tokens, strike price, and expiration date. The transparent and tradable nature of options as ERC20 tokens ensures a decentralised and accountable trading environment.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Retik Finance&#8217;s phenomenal success in its presale, surpassing $19,000,000 in funds, positions it as a formidable player in the decentralised finance arena. With a comprehensive suite of features including Retik Swap, staking, lending and borrowing, perpetual futures, and options trading, Retik Finance offers a diverse and innovative platform for users seeking advanced financial solutions in the DeFi space. As the cryptocurrency and DeFi landscapes continue to evolve, Retik Finance&#8217;s commitment to security, transparency, and diversified services positions it as a noteworthy alternative to Solana and a promising player in the broader decentralised finance ecosystem. Investors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly watching as Retik Finance unfolds its vision for a decentralised and dynamic financial future.</p>

Often described as the &#8220;Ethereum killer,&#8221; Solana (SOL) has long been a dominant force in the crypto sphere. But now, with the emergence of Retik Finance, investors have a fresh and potentially more affordable opportunity that&#8217;s turning heads in the market.</p>
<h2><b>The Rise of Solana (SOL)</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Before we delve into the details of Retik Finance&#8217;s ambitious aspirations, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the backdrop against which it is emerging. Solana, often referred to as the &#8220;Ethereum killer,&#8221; has been a standout performer in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. It gained widespread recognition in 2021, experiencing an astonishing surge of over 11,000%, which catapulted it to new heights. However, success can often come with challenges, and Solana was no exception. After its meteoric rise, it faced a significant setback during the 2022 crypto winter. Its value plummeted from a peak of $260 to below $10 by June, leaving many investors questioning its long-term potential. Nevertheless, Solana embarked on an impressive turnaround in 2023, posting gains of over 1000% and regaining its footing in the altcoin market.</p>
<h2><b>The Birth of Retik Finance: A Solana Rival</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Amidst the ebb and flow of Solana&#8217;s journey, Retik Finance has emerged as a formidable challenger. Priced at just $0.1, it represents a more affordable and potentially profitable alternative for investors looking to enter the market. This new entrant aims to disrupt the status quo and provide investors with a fresh perspective on what a blockchain project can achieve.</p>
<h2><b>2024 Price Projections: $18 Target</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Now comes the exciting part: price projections for Retik Finance in 2024. Experts in the cryptocurrency space have been closely monitoring this project&#8217;s developments, and their predictions are turning heads. With a current price of $0.1, the ambitious target for 2024 stands at $18 per token, a remarkable increase in value that has investors and enthusiasts buzzing with anticipation.</p>
<h3><b>Why Retik Finance Has Captured Attention</b></h3>
<p>Several factors contribute to the growing attention and enthusiasm surrounding Retik Finance:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Innovation</b>: Retik Finance is not merely a Solana clone but brings its own unique features and capabilities to the table. Its development team has been hard at work, aiming to distinguish it from existing players and cater to various use cases within the crypto space.</li>
<li><b>Utility</b>: The success of a cryptocurrency often hinges on its utility and real-world applications. Retik Finance positions itself as a versatile blockchain with applications extending beyond simple transactions. This utility-driven approach has garnered attention and is viewed as a catalyst for future growth.</li>
<li><b>Accessibility</b>: Perhaps one of its most attractive features, Retik Finance&#8217;s affordability opens the door to a broader range of investors. With a lower price per token, it fosters inclusivity and encourages a diverse and engaged community, potentially contributing to the project&#8217;s success</li>
<li><b>Market Trends</b>: The cryptocurrency market is characterised by trends and cycles. Timing plays a crucial role in investment decisions, and Retik Finance is gaining momentum at an opportune moment. If it can capitalise on favourable market conditions, it may be well on its way to achieving its ambitious price target.</li>
<li><b>Competitive Spirit</b>: Healthy competition within the blockchain space can drive innovation and improvements. By positioning itself as a rival to Solana, Retik Finance is motivated to continually enhance its offerings and stay ahead in the race.</li>
<li><b>Tokenomics</b>: Carefully designed tokenomics, including supply, distribution, and incentives, support the project&#8217;s growth and value appreciation. These factors are crucial in creating a robust ecosystem that can thrive.</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Conclusion: An Affordable and Promising Alternative</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The emergence of Retik Finance as a new Solana rival priced at just $0.1 has injected fresh energy and excitement into the cryptocurrency market. With an $18 price target for 2024, this project has garnered considerable attention and drawn investors seeking a more accessible entry point compared to SOL. As with any investment, due diligence and careful consideration are essential when exploring opportunities in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. As the crypto journey unfolds, Retik Finance is undoubtedly a project to watch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pandoshi (PAMBO) is an emerging crypto project that aims to champion decentralization, privacy, and monetary freedom. With an ecosystem of decentralized products, Pandoshi seeks to emulate the meteoric growth seen by Polygon (MATIC) in 2021.</p>
<h2>An Introduction to Pandoshi</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s vision, Pandoshi manifests the ideals behind blockchain technology &#8211; decentralization, privacy, and financial autonomy. Its mission is to build an ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) products, including a layer-2 blockchain, decentralized exchange (DEX), non-custodial <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a>, metaverse, crypto debit cards, and more.</p>
<p>At Pandoshi&#8217;s core are the utility token PAMBO and the governance token BAMBOO. PAMBO powers transactions across Pandoshi products as the native token. Meanwhile, BAMBOO allows community members to vote on the project&#8217;s future direction. Unlike PAMBO which has a fixed supply, BAMBOO is inflationary without a supply cap.</p>
<p>With 50% of the total supply going to public presales, PAMBO takes a community-focused approach. Its buyback-and-burn mechanism makes it deflationary, with the token burns continuing until 80% of the circulating supply is removed.</p>
<h2>The Polygon (MATIC) Growth Story</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In 2021, Polygon saw meteoric growth in adoption and price. Its native token, MATIC, rose over 10,000% by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>In November 2021, Malaysia-based Enegra Group moved its $3.4 billion equity token offering from Ethereum to Polygon. This shift enabled faster and cheaper transactions for investors. Polygon&#8217;s infrastructure allowed Enegra to seamlessly migrate tokens while retaining the same wallet addresses. Other protocols, like SushiSwap, Decentraland and OpenSea, were also launched on Polygon.</p>
<p>This adoption and network effects spawned bullish momentum on MATIC’s price. Polygon reached an all-time high of $2.91 on DDecember27, 2021. MATIC currently trades 80% below this all-time high.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshicrpnews11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-156713" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706195213-pambo-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="80" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706195213-pambo-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706195213-pambo-banner-300x47.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706195213-pambo-banner-150x23.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<h2>Pandoshi&#8217;s Growth Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As an emerging project, Pandoshi seems poised to emulate Polygon&#8217;s growth trajectory in 2024. Its ecosystem aims to solve many pain points holding back crypto adoption &#8211; scalability, usability, and fees.</p>
<p>For example, Pandoshi is launching PandaChain &#8211; a layer-2 proof-of-stake blockchain. PandaChain will boost scalability and reduce fees via innovations like zkEVM and PolyBFT consensus. It bridges to Ethereum while supporting ERC token standards.</p>
<p>On usability, Pandoshi launched its non-custodial wallet for easy onboarding. The wallet is now available on Android, with an iOS version underway. PandoshiSwap will also make token swaps accessible for pro and new users alike.</p>
<p>With wider adoption, the deflationary PAMBO token can see massive price appreciation. Currently in presale at $0.01 per PAMBO, the token has enormous room for growth, like MATIC. Pandoshi also plans to list PAMBO on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Uniswap after its launch.</p>
<p>Moreover, 50% of PAMBO&#8217;s supply goes to public presales, making it a community-focused project. PAMBO buybacks-and-burns further boost holding incentives. With network effects, the token can easily 100x as Polygon&#8217;s MATIC did.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In 2021, Polygon grew rapidly by providing much-needed scalability and usability to crypto users. Riding on this adoption, its token MATIC surged exponentially in value as well. As an emerging project, Pandoshi seems set to chart a similar trajectory to Polygon in 2024. With innovations across decentralization, usability, and tokenomics, the foundations are laid for PAMBO to break out. If executed well, PAMBO can easily replicate MATIC&#8217;s 10,000% explosion.</p>

<p>Solana (SOL) had some of the most impressive gains in the early days of its launch. Since then, few others have achieved such a level of success. After a hard 2022, SO started recovering, and by the end of 2023, it was showing signs of a recovery. However, even the ongoing rise of Solana (SOL) will never replicate its early gains.</p>
<p>If you missed Solana&#8217;s first and second rise (SOL), there is still hope for you, thanks to a new blockchain project called Pandoshi (PAMBO). The project is currently in the presale stage but shows signs of a major upswing.</p>
<h2>The Rise of Pandoshi (PAMBO)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Pandoshi presale has demonstrated impressive success, garnering over $3.5 million in just a few weeks since its inception. This significant accomplishment underscores the robust interest and potential the project has in the crypto marketplace. Currently, Pandoshi is advancing through its third presale stage, preparing to transition into the fourth stage which will see an uptick in token price, signifying a pivotal moment for the project and its backers.</p>
<p>Contrary to initial appearances, Pandoshi is much more than a mere meme coin. It represents a comprehensive, independently operated, and decentralized platform. The project&#8217;s whitepaper reveals a deep understanding of professionalism and technical intricacies, anchoring itself firmly in the tenets of decentralization, financial privacy, and community-led governance.</p>
<p>Key Features of Pandoshi&#8217;s Ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Eco-Friendly Layer-2 Network</b>: Operating on a Proof of Stake protocol, Pandoshi offers an eco-conscious alternative to traditional Proof of Work models.</li>
<li><b>Decentralized Exchange and Wallet:</b> Pandoshi provides heightened security and autonomy through its decentralized exchange and non-custodial wallet.</li>
<li><b>Metaverse and Educational Integration</b>: The inclusion of Metaverse gaming and educational platforms adds depth and diversity to the ecosystem.</li>
<li><b>Cryptocurrency Prepaid Cards</b>: These cards offer global digital asset management without the need for KYC procedures.</li>
<li><b>Commitment to Transparency:</b> Pandoshi&#8217;s transparent approach and its clearly outlined roadmap have garnered trust among investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the heart of the Pandoshi ecosystem lies the PAMBO token, initially introduced on the Ethereum blockchain. This token is deflationary in nature, thoughtfully crafted to appreciate in value as its scarcity increases. It employs a buy-and-burn approach, systematically decreasing its supply to boost its value over time.</p>
<p>As Pandoshi embarks on its journey, its unique approach and forward-thinking features position it as a significant player in the crypto industry. Looking ahead, the project aims to broaden its exchange presence and continue enriching its comprehensive ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshicrpnews11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-156713" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706195213-pambo-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="80" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706195213-pambo-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706195213-pambo-banner-300x47.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706195213-pambo-banner-150x23.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<p>Pandoshi recently celebrated a significant achievement with the beta launch of its <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a> on the Google Play Store, an event they eagerly announced on Twitter. This important development, coinciding with their ongoing presale, represents a major step forward in the project&#8217;s growth, particularly in its ability to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains and plans to incorporate non-EVM chains in the future. To further broaden its impact, Pandoshi is also developing an iOS version of the wallet, aiming to attract a larger user base.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Pandoshi Wallet on the Google Play Store has played a crucial role in enhancing the project&#8217;s reputation in the market, effectively dispelling doubts and boosting investor confidence in its commitment to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. This move underscores Pandoshi&#8217;s commitment to open-source development and governance driven by its community, aligning with investor preferences for privacy and decentralization. The wallet&#8217;s launch has triggered a surge in investor interest, with many rapidly participating in the presale to capitalize on this promising venture.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Solana (SOL) is already at its peak. Those who got in early reaped big. For everyone else, now is an opportunity to recreate the magic of Solana (SOL) with Pandoshi (PAMBO). Analysts have projected a modest increase of 100X for PAMBO tokens once they launch.</p>

<h2>What is Immediate Savage 360?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-savage-360">Immediate Savage 360</a> describes itself as a web-based service that offers users a diverse range of trading and investing features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our primary objective is to assist you in attaining optimal returns on your investment&#8221;, claims the official website while highlighting a wide range of trading features that it may support.</p>
<p>According to the website, Immediate Savage 360 acts as a gateway to harnessing the power of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-trading-bots.htm">crypto trading bot</a> to make investing hands-free. The platform also claims to provide a suite of tools to help generate high-quality trading signals.</p>
<p>Per the claim, the website does it by establishing partnerships with internationally regulated brokers from more than 120 countries. Users from these countries can reportedly access the platform using a simple sign-up process.</p>
<p>In terms of fees, the site says that it doesn&#8217;t charge any for registration. However, it does say that the platform will take a portion of the profit as a commission for trading. This pay-for-profit model is good for investors who only want to pay for a platform if it generates gains.</p>
<p>Getting started with Immediate Savage 360, however, isn&#8217;t free of charge. While the site claims to charge no registration fee, access to its trading tools is only available after depositing the minimum amount &#8211; $250.</p>
<p>Beginners might find this amount to be a bit much, especially since first-party accounts of users and historical data highlighting the efficacy of this platform are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Due to the ambiguous nature of the platform in regards to its legitimacy, we recommend that investors only use it after thoroughly researching it.</p>
<h2>Immediate Savage 360 Pros and Cons</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Listed below are the pros and cons we came across as we went through the content of the Immediate Savage 360 website:</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ol>
<li>Simple sign-up process</li>
<li>Multiple future-centric tools</li>
<li>Robust <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">crypto signals</a></li>
<li>Claims to provide a good win rate</li>
<li>Is available in more than 120 countries</li>
<li>Reportedly has partnered with regulated partners</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ol>
<li>No information about its trading partners</li>
<li>Requires a minimum deposit of $250</li>
<li>Does not feature a manual trading facility</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Does Immediate Savage 360 Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Savage 360 has clearly stated that it offers users an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">AI crypto trading bot</a> that finds trading opportunities and executes trades on their behalf.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s true, it would work in a fashion similar to other trading platforms. Investors can come to the website and create a count. After which, the platform will, as the site puts it, secure the personal details behind SSL encryptions.</p>
<p>Once users complete the registration process, which includes KYC, Immediate Savage 360 reportedly unlocks the trading features for users.</p>
<p>One of the features of the site could be to customize the trading bot before turning it on. Before customization, users may look at the other features that Immediate Savage 360 reportedly provides, including comprehensive market news and insightful commentaries.</p>
<p>There are also discussions about other cutting-edge price prediction tools that Immediate Savage 360 reportedly has, but the platform does not touch on them.</p>
<h2>Immediate Savage 360 &#8211; Top Features</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-savage-360">The Immediate Savage website</a> doesn&#8217;t provide a detailed list of what its features are. Based on similar platforms we&#8217;ve reviewed, here are some possible features to expect:</p>
<h3>Simplified Sign Up</h3>
<p>Immediate Savage 360 claims to make it easy for users to start using the platform. The experience is reportedly &#8220;seamless, with no obstacles involved&#8221;. Users can simply enter their details, verify their accounts, and get started.</p>
<h3>Security Features</h3>
<p>We gleaned from the content that the platform reportedly has an array of security features. It discusses the presence of SSL encryption when giving us information about the sign-up process. It also talks about KYC requirements, which state that users must go through before they can start using the platform.</p>
<h3>Access to Marketing Insights</h3>
<p>Per the site&#8217;s claims, users will be able to access a wide array of market analysis tools and updates to make informed investment decisions. There are technical analysis tools available as well, per the claims, which allow Immediate Savage 360 to generate AI-driven insights.</p>
<h3>Support for Multiple Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>The platform claims that it supports an array of cryptocurrencies. However, it has only highlighted one &#8211; Bitcoin. It is likely that the platform supports more assets. However, we recommend talking to the customer support team before making any assumptions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i><img />Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.</i></p>
<h2>Immediate Savage 360 Fees</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the official website, Immediate Savage 360 does not charge any fees. However, investors are told that the platform does charge a commission if their investments return a profit. It is a generic way for platforms like these to generate revenue. However, we are still in the dark about the commission rate.</p>
<h2>Immediate Savage 360 Minimum Deposit</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In order to access any of the highlighted features that this crypto trading platform reportedly supports, investors must deposit at least $250. The website states that this amount has been preset by the brokers who are affiliated with Immediate Savage 360.</p>
<h2>Is Immediate Savage 360 a Scam?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Savage 360 claims to be a simplified trading platform that lets investors navigate the complex world of crypto trading. Every claim that the platform has made and every feature that has been highlighted in its website&#8217;s content focuses on this particular theme.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make any large claims of generating profits by giving us any ludicrous win rate. It also highlights the risks involved with crypto trading, dedicating an entire paragraph at the bottom of its home page content.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean whatever has been written on the site has any proof online to back it up. Third-party reviews that have covered it also talk about the same features as we do. However, their tone regarding Immediate Savage 360&#8217;s offerings is more positive. It was surprising to us since none of them have proof to attest to the claims the platform makes.</p>
<p>Customer testimonials are another factor that we considered when assessing this platform, and we didn&#8217;t find any first-hand accounts. While we can ignore this if the site is new, the dates when other third-party reviews were written show that Immediate Savage 360 has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>When we take these factors together, it is not clear whether Immediate Savage 360 is a scam or a legitimate trading platform. On one hand, the site&#8217;s web app is very functional. And on the other, many of the claims the site has made can&#8217;t be verified.</p>
<p>Therefore, we recommend exercising caution when using the trading site. Invest only what you can afford to lose, and know that crypto trading doesn&#8217;t guarantee profits.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Use Immediate Savage 360?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Immediate Savage 360 website has highlighted four steps to start using the platform</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Register on Immediate Savage 360</h3>
<p>The first step is registration. Users need to go to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-savage-360">official Immediate Savage 360 website</a> and fill out the registration form. The platform states that email and phone numbers must be provided during this step since they are crucial for the next step of the process.</p>

<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Verification Process</h3>
<p>After investors take the first step toward registration, they will go through a comprehensive Know Your Customer (KYC) process. The platform states that to get started, users must deposit a photograph and a government-issued ID. The platform reportedly uses AI-driven mechanics to verify the account.</p>
<p>Note: We recommend holding off on providing any verification details without talking to the customer support team.</p>
<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Funding the Account</h3>
<p>Investors must then take steps to fund the account. Once the registration process is complete, investors will reportedly be directed to a broker&#8217;s account into which they will need to use Visa, Mastercard, Wire Transfer, Skrill, or WebMoney to make a deposit of $250.</p>
<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Start Trading Live on Immediate Savage 360</h3>
<p>After investors have funded the account, they can start trading live on Immediate Savage 360. The platform doesn&#8217;t talk about any demo trading account. We recommend investors find out whether a demo trading account is available first. It is a good way to learn about trading before getting started.</p>
<h2>How to Delete an Immediate Savage 360 Account?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The platform does not highlight anything about deleting an Immediate Savage 360 account. Investors can look for a terminate account button on their personalized dashboards. Alternatively, they can talk to the customer support team to get their accounts removed.</p>
<p>That being said, if a user does not have any money left in the account, they can just leave it dormant. It is likely that after a period of 3 or 4 months, their accounts will be removed.</p>
<h2>Have Celebrities Endorsed Immediate Savage 360?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are no celebrities online who have shown any sort of support for Immediate Savage 360. There is not one celebrity mentioned anywhere on the website&#8217;s content. Social media sites also say nothing about it.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that there isn&#8217;t any celebrity who supports this platform. However, if you come across any such claim, make sure that it has the proof to back it up.</p>
<h2>Who is the Founder of Immediate Savage 360?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Savage 360 states that the platform was created in three years by a bunch of &#8220;visionaries&#8221;. However, information about who these visionaries were is not available online. The only thing said about them is that the team is also comprised of programmers.</p>
<p>Social media platforms also don&#8217;t highlight anything about the platform or its makers.</p>
<h2>Latest Bitcoin News</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Here are the latest updates about Bitcoin to keep up with in order to make better investment decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin has blown past its $43k mark where it currently stands. It is likely that BTC will accumulate above this range for a long time.</li>
<li>Google&#8217;s Crypto Policy has been updated, and from now on, crypto coin trust ads will be allowed.</li>
<li>CoinGlass <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/Balance">reports</a> that the Bitcoin exchange balance has dropped by 1 million BTC since 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Savage 360 is a crypto trading platform that reportedly has a slew of features both veteran and seasoned traders would appreciate. It talks about providing users with an autonomous trading system as well as a comprehensive market analysis facility.</p>
<p>While these claims sound enticing, none of them could be supported by trusted parties. The site&#8217;s content is mostly focused on marketing, and some of its requirements &#8211; like KYC &#8211; are concerning since the platform has not named its founders. We recommend that investors take all the precautions necessary before investing.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>What is Immediate Savage 360?</strong></p>
<p>Immediate Savage 360 is a crypto trading platform claiming to offer users a robust range of tools to trade autonomously. The platform requires a minimum deposit of $250.</p>
<p><strong>Is Immediate Savage 360 legit?</strong></p>
<p>Immediate Savage 360 describes itself as an all-in-one solution, claiming to provide users with everything they need to trade better.

<p><em>Disclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content</em></p>
<p>Claiming to provide an ecosystem that democratizes financial knowledge, Immediate Core stands as a trading platform that addresses the root of crypto education &#8211; simplicity. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-core">official website of the platform</a> highlights the presence of a gateway that allows anyone from anywhere to gain access to financial education.</p>
<p>How good are the educational resources provided on the platform? Discover the answer to this question in our Immediate Core review.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i><img />Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.</i></p>
<h2>What is Immediate Core?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Core doesn&#8217;t portray itself as a platform that offers financial education. Instead, it states that it connects eager learners to top-notch investment education firms. It also says that it does so free of charge in the spirit of inclusivity and as a way to democratize financial education.</p>
<p>The platform portrays its desire to make it easy for people to acquire investment knowledge as its core value proposition. &#8220;Anyone who wants to develop an understanding of the investment sector can depend on the pathway we provide&#8221;, the official website claims.</p>
<p>However, the website does not go deeper into its services. It doesn&#8217;t name the educational firms that users get connected to either. Also, while the platform claims to provide services free of charge, the same cannot be said about the educational firms it reportedly connects users to.</p>
<p>That said, it does highlight that it provides articles breaking down the evolving market trends, special lessons, and access to enhanced educational materials through its services.</p>
<h2>Immediate Core Pros and Cons</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Listed below are the few pros and cons we came across as we analyzed the platform&#8217;s offerings:</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ol>
<li>Claims to provide a simplified UI</li>
<li>Asserts to have partnered with top educational firms</li>
<li>Offers lessons for multiple types of assets and investments</li>
<li>States that no fee is charged</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ol>
<li>Does not reveal the names of the educational companies it has partnered with</li>
<li>No info available about the fee</li>
<li>Provides no insight into the founders of the platform</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Does Immediate Core Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It becomes immediately clear upon assessing the content given on the official website that Immediate Core does not provide <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-auto-trading-platforms.htm">automated trading services</a>. There are no promises of profits or guarantees to make it big in the market. The only factor it highlights is the presence of top-notch investment education.</p>
<p>Getting access to the learning materials happens soon after a user has created an account. The platform states that users are put through a seamless registration process that takes a short time.</p>
<p>Then, users are reportedly connected to an investment education firm that teaches the ways to navigate the financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>How are these companies selected, and what are the lesson-related tiers provided? These are not the questions answered on the website&#8217;s content. However, Immediate Core does say that users will get access to tailored assistance and insights.</p>
<p>When it comes to the types of educational materials users have access to, Immediate Core has provided some details by giving a brief explanation of mutual funds. However, it seems to be a small marketing-focused content that shouldn&#8217;t be put too much stake in.</p>
<p>Investors are advised to sign-up and get started to clearly see what the platform has to offer.</p>
<h2>Immediate Core &#8211; Top Features</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The core of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-core">Immediate Core&#8217;s website services</a> are reportedly educational training. which doesn&#8217;t provide us with a lot of features to cover. However, upon analyzing the platform a bit more deeply, we came across the following claims:</p>
<h3>Tuition on Evolving Market Trends</h3>
<p>The website&#8217;s content highlights the importance of analyzing the changing market trends and claims to provide blogs highlighting the latest market updates.</p>
<h3>Customized Education</h3>
<p>According to the website, users will have access to top-tier educational tools that are customized according to the user&#8217;s needs. This approach, per the website, allows investors to go at their own pace as they learn about financial instruments and other aspects.</p>
<h3>Multiple Modules</h3>
<p>Immediate Core states that investors will be able to learn about different financial instruments. These will include stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3>Multiple Modes of Learning</h3>
<p>Per the website, learners can expect to learn through various means. It claims that users won&#8217;t only have access to articles, but books, videos, and webinars are also accessible.</p>
<h3>Simple Registration Process</h3>
<p>The registration process on Immediate Core does not take any time, per the site&#8217;s claims. Users can just come to the website, sign up, and connect with a suitable investment education company.</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><img />Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.</i></p>
<h2>Immediate Core Fees</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Core claims that financial education is delivered through the platform without any charges. However, it does not say whether the education firms offering lessons charge anything. We recommend talking to the customer support team regarding this issue before moving forward.</p>
<h2>Immediate Core Minimum Deposit</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since Immediate Core is not an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">AI crypto trading bot</a> or any other trading platform, there is no need for it to ask for any minimum deposit. Furthermore, the website does state that the lessons are provided free of charge.</p>
<p>That being said, it would be wise to ask the customer support team if there are any premium features for which there is any subscription model. If it is, the amount paid may be considered the minimum deposit.</p>
<h2>Is Immediate Core a Scam?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Core does not provide any trading features. On the website, all it does is highlight the crypto education-related features that it supports. Based on this information, the website does not look like a scam.</p>
<p>However, the information available online about this website is conflicting. For one, the site admits that Immediate Core is just used as a marketing term, which means users may encounter other platforms with the same name.</p>
<p>We did come across multiple websites of the same name, and one of them portrayed Immediate Core as a crypto trading site.</p>
<p>It is important to note that most third-party reviews that we found online portrayed this platform as a trading service provider &#8211; which is a major concern.</p>
<p>On the website, however, no trading services are mentioned. That being said, we would have liked for there to be some first-hand accounts from the user base that could confirm some of the features this platform has.</p>
<p>As a result, we can&#8217;t say for certain whether this platform is a scam or a legitimate platform. We recommend diving deep into its learning features to find that out.</p>
<h2>How to Use Immediate Core?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If you&#8217;re interested in the learning experience that Immediate Core claims to offer, follow the steps below to get started:</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Create an Account on Immediate Core</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-core">official Immediate Core website</a> and start the account creation process. Enter your details in the registration form and proceed. The platform states that registration won&#8217;t take more than a couple of minutes, which means you&#8217;ll likely receive an email with a link to click and confirm your identity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-158454" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706602301-create-an-account-on-immediate-core.png" alt="Create an Account on Immediate Core" width="659" height="572" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706602301-create-an-account-on-immediate-core.png 1145w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706602301-create-an-account-on-immediate-core-300x260.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706602301-create-an-account-on-immediate-core-1024x889.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706602301-create-an-account-on-immediate-core-768x667.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706602301-create-an-account-on-immediate-core-150x130.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Talk to the Support Team</h3>
<p>It is possible that post registration, a customer support team member will reach out to you to help you learn about the platform. This might be the stage where you get partnered with an investment education company. Answer all the questions that you&#8217;re asked.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to ask about any fee-related requirements. Inquire about the site&#8217;s subscription model, if there is any, before proceeding.</p>
<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Start Learning</h3>
<p>Once you have been partnered with an investment education company, start learning. Keep track of your progress as you learn, and assess the lessons to see if they are too basic or too advanced. If the site&#8217;s claims are true, you might receive investment education out of the norm, which is a positive.</p>
<h2>How to Delete an Immediate Core Account?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There is nothing written on the website that could tell us how to delete an Immediate Core account. You can look at your dashboard and look for a terminate account button. However, read the terms and conditions carefully beforehand. Find out whether deleting the account in the middle of a month will allow the remainder of your subscription fee (if any) to be returned to you.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can talk to the customer support team and ask them about the account deletion process.</p>
<h2>Have Celebrities Endorsed Immediate Core?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We did not come across any facility noteworthy enough on Immediate Core to warrant celebrity interest. The site itself doesn&#8217;t say anything about having any celebrity support.</p>
<p>However, as time goes by and this platform becomes popular, you may come across AI-driven adverts showing celebs talking about this platform. These adverts are mostly fake.</p>
<h2>Who is the Founder of Immediate Core?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the About Us page of the website, the Immediate Core&#8217;s team is comprised of a group of innovators who came together to get rid of the learning gaps that exist within the financial world.</p>
<p>However, nothing more has been said about them on the platform. Social media sites are also not saying anything about them. It is likely that the team has decided to stay anonymous. Under normal circumstances, that would be a red flag. But considering the services that the platform claims to provide, we can look past it.</p>
<h2>Latest Bitcoin News</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Here are the latest updates about Bitcoin to know about for Q1 of 2024:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bitcoin has moved above the $43k mark, and analysts say that it will move up more in the coming days.</li>
<li>Experts claim that Bitcoin&#8217;s bull run will likely be sustainable.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">Crypto presales</a> are getting traction amidst the current market conditions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Core describes itself as a provider of investment education and reportedly does so with the help of partner investment companies. It doesn&#8217;t make any large claims of profits, nor does it say anything about the ease of learning.</p>
<p>However, the platform is not clear on the types of lessons provided and the names of partner education companies. No one knows who the makers of this site are either. Therefore, we recommend that our readers conduct thorough research before moving forward.</p>
<p>Alternatively, check out our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-courses.htm">list of the top crypto courses</a>.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><a href="https://aimeme.ai/">AI Meme</a> ($AIM) is a humorous Web3 project that combines two highly recognizable cornerstones of modern culture: the chaotic and often degenerate world of memes paired with the seemingly explosive rise of AI. AI Meme upgrades modern memes to the next level, bringing them to life and turning them into AI companions. Each companion is interactive and customizable. The name alone positions the project directly in the middle of the AI and the Meme markets, securing its position through name recognition alone.</p>
<p>AI Meme offers users a way to engage with memes directly for the first time. The companions are dynamic and smart and can be personalized. The features range from fun conversations to any of the helpful activities an AI may be used for. It also marks a new evolution in AI interactivity. AI is often hard to understand and interface with, but AI Meme gives the technology a more human touch. The platform will introduce a marketplace for these AI Meme NFTs, allowing users to buy, accessorize, and even customize the meme’s inherent personalities.</p>
<p>Isn’t it about time that we all get our own, unique AIs just like we see in the movies rather than a one-size-fits-all Siri or Alexa? A project like this was inevitable. And now it’s here.</p>
<p><b>A Proven Track Record</b></p>
<p>The company behind AI Meme is known as Jogo Media LTD. Our team has seen success for the past three years in the industry. Our projects have ranged from marketing to blockchain development, and our experience speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Among other strengths, our team has a mix of experience, including expertise in blockchain, AI and gaming. But our approach goes beyond product development. We strive for transparency, accountability, and communication.</p>
<p>Every aspect of this project has been crafted carefully and diligently. We’re not just another company taking a chance on Web3. We have stepped into the spotlight and are staking our reputation on the success of the project.</p>

<p><b>The Product: An AI Companion Modeled After Modern Memes</b></p>
<p>AI Meme introduces AI-powered meme companions. These digital companions are the centerpiece of the AI Meme ecosystem, designed to transform how users interact within the often confusing and intimidating world of AI.</p>
<p><b>Key Features</b></p>
<p><b>Interactive</b>: The AI companions are programmed to respond and interact with the humans in a smart, flowing way, so that the interaction seems real and spontaneous, like a conversation.</p>
<p><b>Customizable</b>: each of the AI chatbots comes with different personalities – qualities usually found in famous memes but with an added twist of personalization.</p>
<p><b>Utilities</b>: Beyond entertainment, the companions can adapt themselves to the user, assist in everyday tasks, set reminders, and help with research and learning.</p>
<p>AI Meme has already developed a functional <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/meme-based-ai-personal-assistant-has-arrived-aimeme-ai-aim/">prototype</a> of the technology, which serves as a tangible representation of the project&#8217;s vision and the potential capabilities of the core concept.</p>
<p><b>AIM Token Utility</b></p>
<p><b>The AIM Token Ecosystem</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy Your Companion: Dive into the meme market and find your AI Meme buddy.</li>
<li>Buy Your Accessories: Personalize your AI NFTs with the latest meme fashion and tools.</li>
<li>Buy Your Games: AIM tokens are your tickets to various games and activities.</li>
<li>Buy Your Vote: Each token holder has a voice; even small voices are heard.</li>
<li>Buy Your Staking: Stake AIM tokens to earn rewards, yield, and increase your vote.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the AI Meme universe grows, AIM tokens will continue to unlock new and exciting features and utilities, ensuring the platform remains vibrant and engaging.</p>
<p><b>DAO Governance</b></p>
<p>AIM token holders are not just investors; they&#8217;re key decision-makers. The project uses a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model, giving every token holder a voice in the platform&#8217;s direction and decisions. Token stakers, identified as the ASACDWST (the Alpha Super Awesome Cool Dynamite Wolf Squadron Team), have enhanced voting power, amplifying their influence in the project&#8217;s governance.</p>
<p><b>Token Burn Mechanism</b></p>
<p>AI Meme employs a strategic token-burning mechanism. When users spend AIM tokens on AI NFTs, accessories, or other utilities, these tokens are burned, reducing the overall supply. This deflationary approach increases the rarity and potential value of the remaining tokens, bolstering the platform&#8217;s economic strength and sustainability.</p>
<p><b>The AIM PoS Staking Overview</b></p>
<p><b>User Benefits</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Earn rewards as a token of appreciation for community members&#8217; investment and trust.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Platform Stability and Accessibility</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Staking contributes to the AIM network&#8217;s security, encouraging long-term investment and growth.</li>
<li>Staking periods are pre-defined, which is essential for ensuring network stability and appreciation in token value.</li>
<li>Our accessible, straightforward staking system is designed for all levels of crypto experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Transparency and Sustainability</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Clear communication about reward calculations, schedules, and staking terms ensures transparency.</li>
<li>Environmentally conscious PoS staking practice aligns profitability with sustainability goals.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">During our evaluation of Immediate Maximum, we observed a scarcity of information about the team and a notable absence on social media. Additionally, the platform lacks celebrity endorsements or user reviews, diminishing its transparency relative to industry counterparts.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Who is the Founder of Immediate Maximum?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p class="p1">Immediate Maximum does not specify the founder or team members behind the platform. The website doesn’t list any social media handles of the team that could reveal their identities. A lack of transparency on this front might create some transparency issues. However, it’s common for founders in the crypto space to remain anonymous. With that being said, it’s important to approach the platform with caution and conduct proper research before investing any money.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Latest Bitcoin News</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price</a> has dipped below $40,000, linked by some analysts to Graycale selling BTC.</li>
<li class="li1">Bitcoin mining difficulty drops for the first time in 2 months, with increased sustainable energy usage.</li>
<li class="li1">Bitwise becomes the first Spot Bitcoin ETF provider to provide a wallet address.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3"><b>The Verdict</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p class="p1">The assessment of Immediate Maximum reveals a platform with both potential benefits and areas of caution. While the collaboration with reputed educational firms and the emphasis on individualized training appear promising, the lack of specific details on fees, security measures, and team qualifications raises concerns about transparency. Users are encouraged to exercise due diligence, scrutinize available information, and seek clarity on ambiguous aspects before fully engaging with the platform.</p>
<p class="p1">The platform&#8217;s claim of being fee-free may require closer scrutiny, and users should be vigilant regarding potential hidden costs. Immediate Maximum&#8217;s commitment to accessibility and collaboration with educational firms could offer valuable resources, but users should approach the platform with a discerning eye and ensure that their expectations align with the available features and services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>X Mining is a hot new cloud mining platform designed to revolutionize how individuals engage with Bitcoin mining in 2024.</p>
<p>By integrating the convenience of tokenized staking with the reliability of blockchain, X Mining is set to democratize access to Bitcoin mining, making it accessible, profitable, and environmentally sustainable for a global audience.</p>
<h2><b>Innovative Cloud Mining Solution</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/ext/xmining/en">X Mining</a> introduces an innovative cloud mining solution designed to make Bitcoin mining accessible and profitable for a broader audience. By leveraging blockchain, X Mining&#8217;s platform allows individuals to participate in mining operations by purchasing and staking $XMINING tokens.</p>
<p>This approach eliminates the need for technical knowledge and significant hardware investment, traditionally required for mining activities. The platform&#8217;s transparent system ensures ease of use and growth potential for participants. By staking $XMINING tokens, users become part of a mining operation.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="XMINING INTRODUCES A REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH TO BTC MINING!!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4HAzF3K1lO0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>They are eligible for rewards allocation based on the proportion of their stake in the overall pool, with high annual yields. The process is designed to be simple, enabling anyone to earn from crypto mining with minimal effort. X Mining&#8217;s solution focuses on environmental sustainability and efficiency, aiming to democratize Bitcoin mining by making it profitable and accessible to individuals regardless of their technical background.</p>
<h2><b>High Staking Rewards For Early Investors</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
X Mining&#8217;s Staking Rewards program offers a lucrative opportunity for token holders to earn passive returns. Staking on X Mining allows token holders to receive rewards, with 162.3 $XMINING tokens allocated for every Ethereum block.</p>
<p>These rewards are distributed over 36 months, based on the proportion of an individual&#8217;s stake in the total pool and a set annual yield rate.</p>
<p>The current estimated annual rewards rate stands at 81%, with rewards calculated monthly and daily to provide consistent earnings. A total of 6,406,984 $XMINING tokens are already staked, showing strong investor trust.</p>
<h2><b>X Mining Tokenomics And Presale</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
X Mining&#8217;s tokenomics and presale structure are designed to make Bitcoin mining accessible and profitable for a wider audience. The platform&#8217;s presale phase offers early access to $XMINING tokens at a lower price before public trading begins.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://x-mining.io/Whitepaper.pdf">X Mining whitepaper</a>, the total supply of $XMINING tokens is set at 210 million, with a significant portion, 55% or 115.5 million tokens, allocated for the presale.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706104405-screenshot-2024-01-24-at-7-22-56.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-156006 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706104405-screenshot-2024-01-24-at-7-22-56.png" alt="X Mining Tokenomics" width="900" height="481" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706104405-screenshot-2024-01-24-at-7-22-56.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706104405-screenshot-2024-01-24-at-7-22-56-300x160.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706104405-screenshot-2024-01-24-at-7-22-56-768x410.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706104405-screenshot-2024-01-24-at-7-22-56-150x80.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>The platform follows a staged pricing structure during the presale, starting at $0.007 per token and increasing through the next stages to incentivize early participation. The final listing price is projected at $0.025, suggesting potential growth for early investors.</p>
<p>The distribution of tokens also includes allocations for community rewards (15%), Bitcoin mining operations (15%), staked tokens (10%), and marketing (5%), ensuring a balanced approach to growth, reward, and promotion. This new crypto project has also been successfully <a href="https://coinsult.net/projects/xmining/">audited by Coinsult</a> &#8211; a reputable cryptocurrency consultancy offering regulatory compliance reviews and much more.</p>
<h2><b>Growth Plans</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
X Mining&#8217;s roadmap outlines a structured plan for developing and expanding its platform, focusing on making Bitcoin mining accessible and sustainable.</p>
<p>In Q1 2024, X Mining will launch its presale and staking rewards, giving early buyers the opportunity for users to earn high rewards. This period is crucial for attracting initial investors and creating the platform’s market presence. This period will also see the development of user-friendly staking interfaces and community forums for user interaction.</p>

<p>The focus will shift to platform development and user incentives in Q2 2024, introducing an advanced user interface featuring better staking features and implementing referral programs to incentivize further staking participation.</p>
<p>Q3 2024 is dedicated to growth and expansion, increasing platform awareness and participation through expanded marketing efforts, and integrating user feedback to improve staking processes. New technological partnerships will also be explored to improve the staking platform further.</p>
<p>The roadmap ends in Q4 2024 with a review and future planning stage, analyzing the year&#8217;s progress, hosting community events to discuss future improvements, and laying the groundwork for sustainable growth in staking rewards and platform features.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Immediate Neupro Ai?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. Fast reaction to rapid changes is the only way to make gains both in the long term and the short term. Autonomous trading platforms providing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-auto-trading-platforms.htm">automated trading capabilities</a> make it happen.</p>
<p>Immediate Neupro Ai claims to be one of them. Calling itself a collective of skilled experts, the platform asserts that it lets them guide investors to find lucrative trading opportunities,</p>
<p>&#8220;Our primary goal for our investors is to help them gain financial prosperity&#8221;, the platform claims. Immediate Neupro Ai also claims to connect users to a vibrant trading community, giving users access to a degree of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-social-trading-platforms-for-cryptocurrency-fans.htm">social trading possibilities</a>.</p>
<p>Underscoring these facilities is an array of innovative solutions that the website claims will provide investors with comprehensive support. These features, according to the platform, are instrumental in buying and selling a wide range of assets &#8211; and not just cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The platform discusses assets like oil, forex, commodities, and more. However, it never goes in-depth to list these assets available. That is a concern since another claim that Immediate Neupro Ai makes is making valuable learning materials available to all traders.</p>
<p>The platform reportedly supports these features through a selection of enhanced security measures. These facilities, as the website puts it, maintain a secure trading environment and protect users&#8217; data.</p>
<p>The website&#8217;s content portrays Immediate Neupro Ai as a platform with hybrid trading capabilities. Its talk of analysis makes it look like manual facilities are available for its users. However, much of the content has been dedicated to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-trading-bots.htm">crypto trading bot</a>, promising hands-free trading with profitable results.</p>
<p>Exciting as these features might be, evidence online to support their existence is few, which is probably because the site itself is new. Therefore, we recommend exercising caution. Invest carefully and remember when you are venturing into the trading markets, profits are never guaranteed.</p>
<h2>Immediate Neupro Ai Pros and Cons</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The limited content available on the website made us aware of the following pros and cons:</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ol>
<li>The platform supports hybrid trading features.</li>
<li>It reportedly connects users with the best exchanges on the market.</li>
<li>It claims to provide investors with educational materials.</li>
<li>Multiple assets are supported, including cryptocurrencies and oil.</li>
<li>A team of skilled experts is reportedly in place to assist with trading.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ol>
<li>Offers no insight into its fee structure.</li>
<li>Shies from talking about the founders of the platform.</li>
<li>There are no first-hand accounts online to substantiate any claims the site makes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Does Immediate Neupro Ai Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We have already touched upon how Immediate Neupro Ai leverages a hybrid trading interface to provide investment opportunities to traders. However, what is important to know is that the platform itself is just a gateway, providing access to other exchanges.</p>
<p>It means that once users come to the website, they can register and get connected with a suitable trading exchange. Whether or not they connect with the right exchange will depend on the quality of the account manager provided.</p>
<p>Once at the exchange&#8217;s platform, investors may be able to leverage its features. However, since there are many exchanges involved, it is possible that some support manual trading features and others have an autonomous trading facility.</p>
<p>The website says that the platform provides users with tools to comprehensively analyze the market. It could mean that these exchanges offering manual trading facilities may provide access to trading charts and other perks.</p>
<p>When it comes to exchanges that offer automated trading, users may be able to personalize their trade settings to navigate the market how they want.</p>
<p>Also, since the platform reportedly supports a wide array of assets, it is a possibility that these assets are divided among different exchange. The versatility can also be seen in the platform&#8217;s claims of providing educational materials. We believe that some partners of the platform might offer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-courses.htm">crypto trading courses</a> to users.</p>
<h2>Immediate Neupro Ai &#8211; Top Features</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-neupro-ai">official website</a>, the platform has highlighted a handful of features for investors; here is a list of some of them:</p>
<h3>Multiple Innovative Tools</h3>
<p>Immediate Neupro Ai claims that investors will get access to a host of innovative tools to make their investment experience flawless. The platform talks about integrating live data and comprehensive analysis to provide a bird&#8217;s eye of the current crypto market, keeping investors abreast of the latest developments in the crypto space.</p>
<h3>Multiple Investment Options</h3>
<p>According to the website, investors will get access to a large array of tradeable assets. The ones that have been named on the official website&#8217;s home page are cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange, oil, and commodities. On the About Us page, the platform has highlighted exquisite metals, bonds, and ETFs. We don&#8217;t know if this is the limit of assets that it supports or if entities like options and indices are also available on Immediate Neupro Ai.</p>
<h3>Multiple Education Materials</h3>
<p>The platform claims to empower traders with a wide range of educational resources, interactive webinars, and insightful tutorials to help them get ready to trade in even volatile markets. While the types of investment materials have not been named, it is possible that these materials may include videos, audio files, articles, and more.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Security Options</h3>
<p>Per the website, a lot of effort has been put into making sure that investors feel safe while trading. The platform states that it has taken additional steps, such as implementing a privacy shield to ensure that investors stay secure as they engage with the trading facilities.</p>
<h3>Precise Indicators</h3>
<p>According to the website, Immediate Neupro Ai has a host of precise indicators that use advanced algorithms to give investors a better view of the market. These tools, per the platform, can generate precise trading signals that traders can use to make informed investment decisions.</p>

<h2>Is Immediate Neupro Ai a Scam?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There has been a lot of buzz online in regard to certain platforms providing autonomous services. Most of them have been marked as a scam. Is Immediate Neupro Ai one of them?</p>
<p>In our findings, the platform doesn&#8217;t have any large claim that needs proper verification. While it asserts to offer precise <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">trading signals</a>, it never states that profits are guaranteed. While it claims to provide manual trading services, it never states that accessing these services will be simple.</p>
<p>However, there are many aspects of the platform that give us pause. The content on the website, for one, has not been separated well. As we went through the homepage&#8217;s content from top to bottom, we found ourselves reading the same things over and over again, but in different ways.</p>
<p>Another problem we had was with the platform&#8217;s marketing tone. Too many words have been used to describe the efficacy of the trading features, but there has been no insight into what kind of trading features users will have access to.</p>
<p>However, we can&#8217;t fault Immediate Neupro Ai for that since it reportedly acts only as an intermediary. Third-party reviews of this platform were also of no help. Most of them have made bullish claims about the website, also highlighting the efficacy of its features. However, none of them gave us a critical analysis of the platform.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not prudent for us to clearly state whether this platform is a scam or a legitimate trading system. Investors must make their own decisions and choose wisely.</p>
<h2>How to Start Using Immediate Neupro Ai?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If investors find the features highlighted on the Immediate Neupro Ai website appealing, they can follow the steps below to start trading.</p>

<p>After the details are sent, an account manager will reach out to ask certain questions. Traders may have to answer queries about their trading expertise and whether they want manual or autonomous trading features. It is likely that the platform will use that information to connect them with the best exchange for them.</p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Deposit the Minimum Amount</h3>
<p>Different exchanges may ask for different initial deposits, even though the platform asks for $250. We recommend talking to the account manager about it beforehand. Then, they must use the available methods to make the required deposit when prompted.</p>
<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Start Trading on Immediate Neupro Ai</h3>
<p>It is likely that making the initial deposit will establish a connection with an exchange. Investors may then look at the exchange&#8217;s trading facilities to start trading. However, we recommend looking for a demo trading account first. It offers paper trading, allowing investors to practice trading before jumping into the live markets.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investors won&#8217;t get any information about how to delete their Immediate Neupro Ai accounts by looking at the content, as there is no mention of it anywhere. However, they may talk to the exchanges partnered with the platform about it. It is likely that there are some primilary steps to terminating the account, including retrieving all the amount from the platform.</p>
<h2>Have Celebrities Endorsed Immediate Neupro Ai?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The official website does not make any claim about having any celebrity backing. The third-party reviews that have covered the platform agree that there are no celebrities endorsing or actively supporting Immediate Neupro Ai. However, as the platform gains more popularity, claims of celebrity support may start to circulate. We recommend ignoring them as they are unlikely to be true.</p>
<h2>Who is the Founder of Immediate Neupro Ai?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Neupro Ai does not talk about its founders. With the way information has been laid out on the About Us page, it is likely that the founders have decided to stay anonymous. While it is very normal when crypto trading is concerned, the platform reportedly supports traditional assets as well. which makes the lack of founder details a red flag.</p>
<h2>Latest Bitcoin News</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Those wanting to stay informed when trading must always stay abreast of the Bitcoin updates.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Bitcoin price has declined once again and has reached the $40k mark.</li>
<li>Due to Bitcoin&#8217;s bearish price action, over $83 million worth of BTC has been liquidated.</li>
<li>Investors are eyeing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrencies</a> as a way to invest in more innovative crypto projects.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Neupro Ai portrays itself as a complex trading interface with everything a discerning investor would need to navigate the market. It purportedly has hands-free trading options backed by advanced algorithms. There are also claims that it produces accurate trading signals to make even manual trading profitable. However, the issue lies in the fact that most of these claims cannot be proven.</p>
<p>Third-party reviews that have covered it have a narrow perspective, and first-hand customer testimonials are nowhere to be found. There is also no news about who its founders are. While these factors indicate that the platform is new, it still warrants more careful analysis of the platform before moving forward.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, a new contender has emerged with the potential to rival Polygon&#8217;s success. Pandoshi, currently priced at a modest $0.008, is capturing the attention of crypto investors. With its innovative approach and a strong focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), Pandoshi has a strategic roadmap and unique features, coupled with a robust community-driven ethos, position it as a serious competitor in the blockchain space. As we move through 2024, industry analysts are projecting an impressive ascent for Pandoshi, predicting that it could soar to as high as $10.</p>
<h2>Pandoshi (PAMBO)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Upon first glance, one might mistakenly categorize Pandoshi as merely another meme coin, but in reality, it represents something far more substantial. Pandoshi stands as a fully autonomous and decentralized ecosystem, deeply rooted in the principles of decentralization, the protection of financial privacy, and empowering its community to significantly influence its trajectory.</p>
<p>At the core of Pandoshi&#8217;s technology is a Layer-2 network that utilizes the Proof of Stake protocol, offering an environmentally friendlier alternative to the traditional Proof of Work models. The ecosystem is rich with features, including decentralized exchange (DEX), <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">secure wallet</a> fully managed by users, engaging Metaverse games, educational resources like Pandoshi University, and cryptocurrency-compatible prepaid cards, all operating seamlessly without the requirement for Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the Pandoshi ecosystem is the PAMBO token, which was initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain. PAMBO is designed as a deflationary asset, with mechanisms in place to gradually reduce its supply and increase its value over time. This includes a buy-and-burn strategy, where tokens are purchased at market rates and then permanently retired from circulation.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshicrpnews4">Click Here To Buy PAMBO Tokens</a></p>
<p>A key factor in enhancing the value of PAMBO is its integration into the project&#8217;s decentralized exchange, which imposes transaction fees. These fees are strategically used to further buy and retire PAMBO tokens, thereby reducing the circulating supply and potentially increasing the token&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>As of now, Pandoshi&#8217;s presale is progressing through five structured stages. In its current fourth stage, the token is priced at $0.008. Moving to the fifth and final stage, the price is expected to reach $0.01 in the final stage, marking a significant milestone for Pandoshi and its investors.</p>
<p>Pandoshi has recently achieved a noteworthy milestone by launching the beta version of its <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a> on the Google Play Store, a development enthusiastically shared on their Twitter feed. This move, occurring concurrently with the project&#8217;s presale phase, marks a significant expansion, particularly in its capability to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains and its future integration of non-EVM chains. Further enhancing its reach, an iOS version of the wallet is also being planned, set to cater to an even broader user base.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-155555" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706030890-pambo-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="80" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706030890-pambo-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706030890-pambo-banner-300x47.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706030890-pambo-banner-150x23.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>The release of the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a> on the Google Play Store has been instrumental in elevating Pandoshi&#8217;s standing within the market, effectively alleviating investor concerns and reinforcing confidence in the project&#8217;s commitment to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.</p>
<p>This strategic decision showcases Pandoshi&#8217;s focus on open-source development and community-driven governance, attributes that are highly valued by investors who emphasize privacy and decentralization. The availability of the wallet has sparked a notable increase in investor interest, with many quickly joining the presale to seize this emerging opportunity.</p>

Pandoshi, a fresh and innovative cryptocurrency, is rapidly gaining traction within the blockchain community. Known for its unique approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and a strong commitment to user autonomy and privacy, Pandoshi stands out as a formidable competitor in the crypto space.</p>
<p>With its recently launched <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a> and a presale phase that has captivated investors, this emerging digital currency, currently valued at a mere $0.008, is not just another addition to the crypto universe but a potential game-changer.</p>
<h2>Pandoshi (PAMBO): Emerging Solana Competitor</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pandoshi is swiftly emerging as a noteworthy contender in the blockchain field, having impressively raised over $2 million shortly after its introduction. This surge of investor support highlights a deep-seated belief in its future potential. Anchored in the core ideals of blockchain technology, Pandoshi is pioneering in decentralization, privacy protection, and empowering its users with financial autonomy, all the while keeping its community at the forefront of its development trajectory.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s backbone is a Layer-2 network based on the Proof of Stake protocol, adding efficiency and sustainability to its structure. The Pandoshi ecosystem boasts an array of features, including a decentralized exchange, the user-friendly <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a>, an array of Metaverse gaming experiences, and educational ventures like Pandoshi University.</p>
<p>Moreover, its ecosystem is complemented by cryptocurrency-compatible prepaid cards, simplifying the management of digital assets worldwide without the hassle of KYC checks.</p>
<p>Pandoshi&#8217;s presale is strategically segmented into five distinct phases, currently in its fourth phase with the token priced at $0.008. The final phase of the presale is set to elevate the token&#8217;s value to $0.01, marking a crucial milestone for the project.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-155549" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706030420-pambo-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="80" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706030420-pambo-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706030420-pambo-banner-300x47.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706030420-pambo-banner-150x23.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" />At the core of Pandoshi&#8217;s ecosystem is the PAMBO token, which is integral to its various platforms like PandaChain and Pandoshi University and benefits from a strategic buy-and-burn policy. This deflationary approach makes PAMBO accessible through direct purchases or active engagement in community initiatives.</p>
<p>Recently, Pandoshi announced the launch of the beta version of the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a> on the Google Play Store, a significant stride in its development plan that was eagerly shared on Twitter. This crucial step, achieved during the ongoing presale phase, supports EVM-compatible chains and lays the groundwork for future expansion to non-EVM chains. An iOS version is also in the works, set to further extend its reach.</p>
<p>The successful launch of the wallet has been a turning point, erasing doubts and reinforcing the faith of investors in Pandoshi&#8217;s commitment to the DeFi space. This aligns with the project&#8217;s focus on open-source development and community-driven governance, appealing to a growing audience that values privacy and decentralization. The wallet&#8217;s availability has prompted a surge in investor interest, indicating a rush to participate in the presale.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the open-source nature of the Pandoshi Wallet, readily available on GitHub, underscores the project&#8217;s commitment to transparency and collaborative progress. This initiative not only boosts Pandoshi&#8217;s standing in the DeFi arena but also solidifies its role as a proponent of decentralized finance principles.

<h2>What is Immediate Intal AI?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-intal-ai">Immediate Intal AI</a> boasts that it delivers to users smart trading capabilities. With them, the platform reportedly enhances a person&#8217;s trading experience. &#8220;You need the edge to stay ahead in the fast-paced market&#8221;, the site claims. Therefore, it asserts that it delivers cutting-edge technology to optimize its trading strategy.</p>
<p>Calling that tech Immediate Intal 2.0, the platform states that trading is revolutionized with its advanced features. Investors will reportedly have access to sophisticated analytics and real-time data. Per the website, this approach will help investors make better trading decisions.</p>
<p>Per the claims, investors are not beholden to using a single type of asset to trade. Besides crypto, stocks and forex are also supported, with Immediate Intal AI claiming to provide different platforms to support them.</p>
<p>One of the versions is Immediate Intal 360, which reportedly allows users to have access to a wide market and a wide range of assets.</p>
<p>However, the content of the website only presents vague highlights of the types of features users may have access to. None of them have been named. Third-party reviews are equally vague, providing bullish answers without providing any detailed insight.</p>
<p>When it comes to fees, nothing has been mentioned. When it comes to founders, nothing has been mentioned. These factors can be counted among red flags. Therefore, investors are advised to be careful when dealing with Immediate Intal AI.</p>
<h2>Immediate Intal AI Pros and Cons</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The limited content available on the Immediate Intal AI website allowed us to find the following pros and cons:</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>It asserts that users will be provided with sophisticated analytical tools</li>
<li>Claims to provide AI-powered trading features</li>
<li>Supports forex, cryptocurrencies, and stocks</li>
<li>Claims to have robust security features</li>
<li>Autonomous trading facilities available</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no information available on the website about the founders</li>
<li>Feature-related information is not available</li>
<li>No detail is provided about the fees</li>
<li>No information is available about the minimum deposit</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Does Immediate Intal AI Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The mixed content available on the website makes it difficult to understand how Immediate Intal AI might work. At the start of the content, it talks about giving users access to sophisticated analytical tools that are powered by AI.</p>
<p>It talks about how investors can leverage Immediate Intal 2.0 to strategize as there are <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-robo-advisors.htm">robo advisors</a> provided to them to help them trade better.</p>
<p>Those indicate the presence of manual trading features where users may trade manually using features backed by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Going further down the content, we also found the website talking about the presence of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-trading-bots.htm">crypto trading bot</a>. It indicates that trades might be automated on that platform. When we take these factors together, we get an image of a hybrid trading platform.</p>
<p>Immediate Intal AI also describes itself as a secure trading site, putting multiple security systems in place to safeguard user&#8217;s assets. However, it hasn&#8217;t explained what those features are.</p>
<p>These factors don&#8217;t make it clear how the site works. We recommend assessing the platform and talking to the customer support team for answers.</p>
<h2>Immediate Intal AI &#8211; Top Features</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-intal-ai">Immediate Intal AI</a> hasn&#8217;t highlighted any notable features on the platform. However, we have been able to leverage something upon reading the content.</p>
<h3>Smarter Trading Solutions</h3>
<p>The platform claims that through it, users will have access to refined trading strategies. Per the website, investors will be able to leverage the different iterations of Immediate Intal AI to create strategies related to their asset of choice. For instance, those who want to trade in oil can leverage Immediate Intal AI 2.o.</p>
<h3>Simplified Sign-up Process</h3>
<p>According to the website, the process to sign up and get started with trading is simple. Only minor details. such as name, email, and phone number are required. There are no KYC requirements mentioned, which means that the platform may be available in most regions of the globe.</p>
<h3>Supported on Multiple Devices</h3>
<p>While the platform doesn&#8217;t make it clear whether it is a web app or software that should be downloaded, the website we had access to was available everywhere. It wasn&#8217;t troublesome for us to engage with the website through smartphones, tablets, or desktops. It indicates that users might be able to engage with different trading solutions while on the move.</p>
<h3>Autonomous Trading Features</h3>
<p>Immediate Intal AI review doesn&#8217;t make people always trade manually, per the claims. According to the platform, it also boasts autonomous trading features. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">AI crypto trading bot</a> is reportedly active around the clock, giving complete assistance to traders even when they aren&#8217;t logged in.</p>
<h3>Support for Multiple Assets</h3>
<p>One of the key aspects that became clear to us when we assessed the platform is that Immediate Intal AI supports assets beyond cryptocurrencies as well. Per the website, investors can trade stocks and forex. While the platform does not highlight the names of the assets under these categories, the content has hinted that one of the stocks that investors can engage with is oil. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, however, only Bitcoin and Ethereum are mentioned.</p>
<h3>Demo Trading Account</h3>
<p>While the platform does not say it outright that investors will have access to a demo trading account, some third-party reviews have reported that it is available. Through this account, investors may be able to assess how everything works before choosing the live trading option.</p>

<h2>Immediate Intal AI &#8211; Fees</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We couldn&#8217;t find any discussion about &#8220;fees&#8221; anywhere on the website. While the lack of this term could mean that Immediate Intal AI may have a fee-free structure, we are not so sure. The features that this platform reportedly provides are big. And the lack of details could mean the presence of some hidden fee. We recommend talking to the customer support team before investing.</p>
<h2>Immediate Intal AI &#8211; Minimum Deposit Requirement</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Intal AI doesn&#8217;t provide any information in relation to its minimum deposit. Does it mean there are no minimum deposits to use this website? No. It means that investors must talk to the customer support team to get the answers. Expect to pay anywhere around $250 to $300 when using this website.</p>
<h2>Is Immediate Intal AI a Scam?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Intal AI is very private when it comes to sharing key information. The home page of the platform is sparsely populated with headings highlighting some of the key features it may have. When it comes to the tools available, it has only named some, like AI Market Intelligence, Risk Evaluation, Advanced Analytics, Trend Forecasting, and Data Visualization.</p>
<p>However, the platform has refused to go into detail about what these features provide. Furthermore, there also seem to be multiple versions of the website within the platform itself, each dedicated to different assets. However, upon reading the content, we couldn&#8217;t find a solid distinction between any of them.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of third-party reviews. While there are many to be found online, none of them have provided a clear picture of how the platform might work. Some have said that the platform delivers top-tier features, and others talk about it having a nearly 90% win rate. However, none of them have given a deep analysis of the website.</p>
<p>When it comes to customer testimonials, we came up empty.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean the site is a scam. The lack of details could mean that it has reserved most information for registered users. That said, we advise investors to still remain cautions when using this website.</p>
<h2>How to use Immediate Intal AI?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The steps below will allow you to start trading on Immediate Intal AI:</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Create an Account</h3>
<p>The first step is to go to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-intal-ai">official Immediate Intal AI website</a> and create an account. The process will take you roughly five minutes. It involves entering key details, such as name, email, and phone number, and waiting for the verification link to arrive.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-153058 " src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705557488-register-on-immediate-intal-ai.png" alt="Register on Immediate Intal AI" width="780" height="351" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705557488-register-on-immediate-intal-ai.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705557488-register-on-immediate-intal-ai-300x135.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705557488-register-on-immediate-intal-ai-1024x461.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705557488-register-on-immediate-intal-ai-768x346.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705557488-register-on-immediate-intal-ai-150x67.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Deposit the Minimum Amount</h3>
<p>Since the platform seems to have different iterations for different types of assets, you may be asked for different minimum deposits for each. Talk to the account manager properly to get all the answers related to the platform.</p>
<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Start Trading</h3>
<p>Once you have made the required deposit, log on to the website and start using the platform. We recommend trying out the demo account first (if available). That would help you with understanding the intricacies of the platform before starting.</p>
<h2>How to Delete an Immediate Intal AI Account?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are no details available online about how one can delete their Immediate Intal AI account. Investors may want to check out the dashboard to look for a delete account button. Or, they may have better luck talking to the customer support team for answers.</p>
<h2>Have Celebrities Endorsed Immediate Intal AI?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There is no celebrity who has actively endorsed Immediate Intal AI on the website. We also did not find anyone batting for this trading platform on any of the third-party reviews that we came across.</p>
<p>Even if you come across any such claims, we recommend ignoring them since it is important to judge the website based on its own merits.</p>
<h2>Who is the Founder of Immediate Intal AI?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Intal AI doesn&#8217;t talk about who founded the website. The limited content that we could find on the About Us page told us that multiple professionals were involved in its development. However, there is a small chance of that being true since nowhere, even on the social media website, has there been a word about Immediate Intal AI.</p>
<h2>Latest Bitcoin News</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Here are the latest pieces of Bitcoin news to know for Q1 2024.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bitcoin is experiencing a high level of volatility as the token is struggling to stay above the $40k mark.</li>
<li>Multiple high-level investors continue to be skeptical about Bitcoin since its price dropped after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.</li>
<li>As a hedge against the current volatility, investors are looking to invest in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrencies</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Intal AI claims to provide multiple versions of the platform itself. There is a 2.0 version, a 360 version, and the standard version &#8211; all reportedly designed to cater to different types of traders. However, information about these features is not available online.</p>
<p>Social media is silent when it comes to founders; most of the claims the platform has made cannot be verified, and third-party reviews we came across are not impartial. Therefore, we recommend that our readers take all precautions necessary before investing.</p>

<h2>What is Immediate XGen?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The current volatility that the market is going through has made it necessary to look for trading platforms that can make investment effortless. One of the platforms that purportedly make it possible is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-xgen">Immediate XGen</a>.</p>
<p>According to the website, this platform is instrumental in unlocking a spectrum of trading opportunities. &#8220;The platform will provide you with a plethora of trading prospects&#8221;, the site claims. Helping with this is reportedly a user-centric UI that will assist newcomers eager to explore the markets and seasoned traders seeking to diversify their portfolios.</p>
<p>Multiple compelling trading opportunities have been listed on the platform. The first one among them is the diversified trading options. Users reportedly will have access to both manual and automated trading modes. With manual trading modes, investors will reportedly have complete control.</p>
<p>However, it is the hands-free trading mode that got our attention. The platform says that the onboarded <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-trading-bots.htm">crypto trading bot</a> executes trades based on pre-defined strategies. The platform does not talk about the win rate that this system is able to achieve.</p>
<p>Another key aspect that the platform has highlighted is the inclusive approach to novices and experts. The platform says that there is an educational hub in place to help new traders gain insight. Seasoned traders, on the other hand, can reportedly gain access to tools to help them diversify their investments.</p>
<p>As enticing as these claims might be, proofs supporting them are few online. We have also been unable to access the platform since even accessing the demo trading account comes with a minimum deposit requirement of $250. Investors are, therefore, advised to take all the precautions needed before trading on this website.</p>
<h2>Immediate XGen Pros and Cons</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

Immediate XGen states that it is a hybrid trading system. Users can reportedly leverage the platform&#8217;s Ai-backed features to create trading strategies and engage with trading hands-on.</p>
<p>The Immediate XGen Ai features are also reportedly supported by tools such as educational hubs and portfolio management systems. Within the educational hub, investors reportedly gain access to features that help them learn more about crypto. While it hasn&#8217;t been stated what kind of educational materials are delivered, we believe that blogs, articles, and video tutorials might be available.</p>
<p>With the portfolio management tools, users may potentially get access to ways to monitor the markets and their investment history.</p>
<p>The other type of trading that Immediate XGen has highlighted is automated trading. Investors can set up the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">AI crypto trading bot</a> reportedly and then let it run 24/7, finding trading opportunities and executing them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the extent of what we could find in how the platform works. There may also be other variables involved. But we recommend talking to the customer support team for answers.</p>
<h2>Immediate XGen &#8211; Top Features</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Listed below are the features that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-xgen">Immediate XGen</a> states are the highlights of the platform:</p>
<h3>Intuitive Interface for All Users</h3>
<p>Per the site&#8217;s claims, Immediate Xgen keeps a lot of stock on simplicity and user-friendliness. This is why it asserts that it provides a smooth trading experience for individuals of all backgrounds. Per the website, whether an investor is a novice or a seasoned trader, they will get access to all the tools necessary to interact with the market properly. The website also claims that the demo trading account is equally powerful. There are also comprehensive trading guides available, designed to give users the right introduction to the crypto industry.</p>
<h3>Real-time Trading Signals</h3>
<p>According to the website, users will get access to real-time crypto trading signals to make informed trading decisions. These signals are reportedly delivered using email or through the application itself. The platform also talks about technical indicators that investors can leverage to discern where the price of an asset is going.</p>
<h3>Multi-Device Support</h3>
<p>According to the claims, investors don&#8217;t need to worry about where and when while using Immediate XGen. The platform has multi-device support, accessible through computer, tablet, and smartphone. &#8220;No trading opportunities will be missed&#8221;, according to the website, and users will be able to access flexible trading opportunities from anywhere.</p>
<h3>Robust Online Security</h3>
<p>Immediate XGen claims to prioritize the protection of a user&#8217;s deposits and transactions. The platform has reportedly implemented a robust encryption technology to secure personal details and safeguard information. The platform claims that users will be able to trade with confidence when using the platform.</p>
<h3>Round-the-clock Customer Support</h3>
<p>The platform claims that all types of traders will be able to access high-end customer care services. Per the claims, these experts will be able to help investors analyze the market or help them set up autonomous trading facilities.</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><img />Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.</i></p>
<h2>Immediate XGen &#8211; Fees</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate XGen doesn&#8217;t say anything on the website about any fee. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean the platform necessarily has a fee-free structure. We believe that there might be some transactional fee, withdrawal, or deposit fee involved. And like with any other autonomous trading platform, investors must expect there to be a commission.</p>
<h2>Immediate XGen &#8211; Minimum Deposit Requirement</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate XGen has the same requirement as a minimum deposit as other platforms. Those who sign up for the first time must deposit at least $250 before getting started. The platform states that it is a &#8220;modest&#8221; deposit. However, novice users might find this deposit a little too much, especially since the platform doesn&#8217;t highlight many of its key details.</p>
<h2>Is Immediate XGen a Scam?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In order to assess a website, it is important to take a critical look at its offerings. That&#8217;s what we did for Immediate XGen. Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t come across any information that could mark it as a scam or a legitimate trading platform.</p>
<p>For instance, the site&#8217;s claims of providing a robust trading interface fit for all types of traders couldn&#8217;t be verified by us. However, this is because most of its trading features are locked behind a mandatory deposit requirement. These features include the demo trading account, which made independent testing of the platform impossible.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are some third-party reviews that gave us pause. Most of the third-party platforms that have reviewed this platform&#8217;s offerings talk of it as an investment education platform, covering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-courses.htm">crypto courses</a> and lessons related to other forms of assets. While the platform does talk about providing users access to an educational hub, we could not find anything that would suggest investors have access to a full-fledged educational page.</p>
<p>Then there is a lack of customer testimonials that we have to consider. There are no first-hand accounts available online that could tell us how the platform performs.</p>
<p>These details make the legitimacy of the platform fuzzy. Therefore, we recommend investors take all the necessary precautions before diving into this platform.</p>
<h2>How to use Immediate XGen?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The following steps will let you start using Immediate XGen right away:</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Create an Account on Immediate XGen</h3>
<p>First, visit the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-xgen">official Immediate XGen website</a> and start the account creation process. Enter your name, email, and other details, and wait for the call from the account manager to arrive. An account manager will reportedly then give you an insight into how the site works.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-153094" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705563397-create-an-account-on-immediate-xgen.png" alt="Create an Account on Immediate XGen" width="752" height="1045" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705563397-create-an-account-on-immediate-xgen.png 961w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705563397-create-an-account-on-immediate-xgen-216x300.png 216w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705563397-create-an-account-on-immediate-xgen-737x1024.png 737w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705563397-create-an-account-on-immediate-xgen-768x1068.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705563397-create-an-account-on-immediate-xgen-150x209.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Deposit the Minimum Amount</h3>
<p>If you agree with the platform&#8217;s fee structure, use the link provided to make a deposit. You can use multiple ways to deposit the required amount. Most ways to deposit are fiat. So, make sure that you have enough to get started.</p>
<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Start Trading on Immediate XGen</h3>
<p>Once you have topped up your trading account with the required amount, you can get started with the trading process. Make sure to check out the demo trading account first to get an idea of how everything works.</p>
<h2>How to Delete an Immediate XGen Account?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Information about how one can delete an Immediate XGen account is not available on the official website. However, there are a couple of things you can try.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in and go to the dashboard to delete your account. Make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before proceeding since account deletion may also remove any funds that you have inside it.</li>
<li>Talk to the customer support team and request them to delete your account.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, if you have exhausted your minimum deposit, you can stop engaging with the website. There is a chance that a dormant account will be deleted automatically.</p>
<h2>Have Celebrities Endorsed Immediate XGen?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
No celebrities online or anywhere else have come out in support of Immediate XGen. Even the website does not talk about having any celebrity backing. So, we recommend that you ignore any such claims that you come across.</p>
<h2>Who is the Founder of Immediate XGen?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the About Us page of Immediate XGen, a collective of dedicated, motivated, and seasoned young entrepreneurs were involved with the making of Immediate XGen. Per the site&#8217;s claims, these makers have a strong foundation in the blockchain industry. However, the platform hasn&#8217;t provided any details when it comes to their names or professions.</p>
<h2>Latest Bitcoin News</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Here are the latest news about Bitcoin to stay updated with the market:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Bitcoin rally has corrected, with BTC dipping to retest the $40k level.</li>
<li>Within days of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Bitcoin ETF net inflows have reached close to $1 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">Crypto presales</a> are being considered strong options amidst the current uncertainty of the crypto market.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate XGen presents users with a hybrid trading platform. On one side, it talks about sophisticated trading features that will make it easy to trade manually. And on the other, it talks about sporting an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-auto-trading-platforms.htm">automated trading platform</a> for those who want to engage with trading hands-free.</p>
<p>The issue is that both of these claims cannot be proved from third-party reviews available online. Furthermore, the platform does not talk about its team, only mentioning a few marketing terms. Due to these factors, we are not sure whether Immediate XGen is a scam or a legitimate trading system. We recommend investing wisely if you choose to use it.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>What is Immediate XGen?</strong></p>
<p>Immediate XGen portrays itself as a next-gen trading platform supporting both manual and automated trading modes. It talks about providing robust crypto signals to manual traders and automated trading services to those who want a hands-free trading experience. However, investors are advised to exercise caution when using this platform.</p>
<p><strong>Has Elon Musk endorsed Immediate XGen?</strong></p>
<p>There are many rumors floating around online talking about Elon Musk supporting a crypto trading platform. However, rumors are all they are. There is no indication of the Dogefather actively pushing any cryptocurrency exchange in the past, and it is unlikely that he will show any interest in what Immediate XGen has to offer.</p>

<p><em>The world of cryptocurrency has seen a surge in popularity over the past few years, with many investors turning to digital currencies as a way to diversify their portfolios.

<h2>Is Immediate Turbo Legit or a Scam?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Turbo asserts its ability to connect users with educational firms focused on providing insights into <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trading-tools/">cryptocurrency trading and tools</a>. Despite the enticing claims, the platform lacks transparency regarding the nature of these &#8220;educational firms&#8221; and the methods employed to educate users about trading.</p>
<p>Although the platform itself does not impose fees, there is no clarification on potential charges associated with consulting the educational firm. Furthermore, a reliable service to address the informational gaps about the platform is notably absent.</p>
<p>Considering these aspects, one might question the overall legitimacy of the platform. Users are advised to exercise prudence when engaging with Immediate Turbo and should only invest after conducting thorough research.</p>

<h2>What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate Turbo?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Immediate Turbo website does not mention a requirement for a minimum deposit, probably because it doesn’t offer any trading services. There isn’t a mention of any fees charged by the “educational firms” which can be limiting for users prioritizing transparency.</p>
<h2>Immediate Turbo Customer Support</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Turbo offers users an option to get in touch via its contact page. To reach out to the team, individuals are required to furnish their name, email, and a message outlining any inquiries or issues they wish to address. It&#8217;s important to highlight that, in our investigation of Immediate Turbo, we noticed the lack of a specialized customer support team available via phone or email for aid.</p>
<h2>How to Start Trading on Immediate Turbo?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3>Step 1: Navigating to the Registration Page</h3>

<h2>How to Delete an Immediate Turbo Account?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Immediate Turbo platform presently lacks detailed instructions regarding the account deletion procedure. Users are encouraged to explore their account settings and look for a deletion option, following a structure akin to that of other platforms. While specific steps are not explicitly provided, users should find the deletion option within the account settings. In case users encounter any challenges, they have the option to contact customer support for further help.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Immediate Turbo introduces a compelling idea by emphasizing cryptocurrency education. Its accessible interface and dedication to a range of investments are praiseworthy, but uncertainties arise due to a lack of transparency from the founders, unclear information about educational institutions, and limited customer support.</p>
<p>The legitimacy of the platform may be in question, prompting users to approach it with caution. The absence of clearly outlined fees introduces an element of uncertainty. Prospective users are encouraged to conduct comprehensive research before getting involved with Immediate Turbo, taking into consideration the ambiguous aspects that cast doubt on its overall dependability.</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
