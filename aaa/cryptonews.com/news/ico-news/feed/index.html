Crypto has its own version of meme stocks &#8211; meme coins &#8211; with traders always hunting the next Dogecoin to explode when noticed by Elon Musk, the next Shiba Inu, or most recently the next Pepe to outperform the entire market by tens of thousands of percent.</p><p>Does $WSM have what it takes to be the next big crypto? This Wall Street Memes token price prediction reviews the project&#8217;s roadmap and future upside potential.</p><h2>Wall Street Memes Price Prediction &#8211; Key Points</h2><span class="replacer"></span><ul>
<li><strong>2024 &#8211; 2025:</strong> While the $WSM listing price hasn&#8217;t been confirmed, with the incremental price stages during the presale and its 2 billion supply &#8211; 50% of which is allocated to the presale &#8211; the Wall Street Memes market cap at launch will be just under $35 million. New meme coins that build a community often test the $100 million market cap level shortly after their ICO.</li>
<li><strong>Up to 2030:</strong> Meme coins already often outperform BTC and ETH &#8211; if the next crypto bull run takes place after 2024&#8217;s Bitcoin halving the rise of meme assets could continue. New entrants to crypto as the blockchain sees mass adoption could gravitate towards coins like Wall Street Memes, backed by a community whose content Elon Musk has at one point interacted with. Pepe hit an almost $2bn market cap in 2023 even as a relatively unknown asset.</li>

</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the Wall Street Memes Crypto Project?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Prior to launching its new crypto token, the Wall Street Memes community itself was based around an Instagram and Twitter community and a legacy NFT project. Its main accounts are:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes" rel="sponsored"><u>@wallstmemes</u></a> on Twitter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallstbets/" rel="sponsored"><u>@wallstbets</u></a> on Instagram</li>
</ul><p>It also has a separate Twitter and IG for NFT focused posts, and a recently launched <a href="https://discord.gg/4E538pzeGX" rel="sponsored"><u>Discord</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" rel="sponsored"><u>Telegram</u></a>, the preferred platforms for new crypto projects. Prior to creating those to organize its presale, Wall Street Memes already benefitted from an existing backing of one million followers.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&#8221;https://twitter.com/wallstmemes/status/1662474606794493954[/embed]
<p>In 2021 the platform developed its first NFT project, the Wall St Bulls on OpenSea, selling out that mint <a href="https://newsdirect.com/news/wall-street-memes-crypto-presale-raises-100k-in-a-flash-is-wsm-token-next-pepecoin-or-shiba-inu-592230125" rel="sponsored"><u>in 32 minutes</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It continues to launch new NFT projects, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/wall-street-memes-crypto-presale-raises-100k-minutes-after-launch-next-pepe-coin-or-dogecoin.htm"><u>Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs</u></a> in May 2023 and with meme coins being the most exciting assets of the year, announced its WSM coin presale shortly after.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Price Prediction 2024</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Our resident crypto analyst reviewed the Wall Street Memes presale on its launch day, shortly after it had raised its first $100,000 which took a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>He compares to some recent meme coin presales including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-love-hate-inu-token.htm">Love Hate Inu</a> (LHINU) which pumped on exchanges by several fold before a correction.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe title="Wall Street Meme Presale Is Now LIVE!

<p>In 2023, Wall Street Memes managed to complete one of the most successful presales &#8211; raising more than $15 million. In September 2023, the token conducted its initial exchange offering.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<h2>WSM Token Price Forecast for Future Years</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While volatile and high risk, often having a post-ICO dump, many crypto experts have stated meme coins rank among the easiest ways to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-make-money-with-cryptocurrency.htm">make money with cryptocurrency</a> as they are an inefficient market. They can do what other crypto assets cannot &#8211; make exponential gains in a matter of days, as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe (PEPE) most famously showed &#8211; alongside Floki Inu, Wojak, Turbo and many more.</p>
<p>Earlier this year for example <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1648137350059311105" rel="sponsored"><u>Altcoin Sherpa</u></a> tweeted a thread to his 195k followers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re kind of the original NFT in a lot of ways. Meme coins are built around a simple idea that&#8217;s easy for people to understand (ie. a Dog). You don&#8217;t need a big brain to understand it and you don&#8217;t need to go through complicated steps to work with it (ie. DeFi). We all want to get rich and to get rich fast. What better way than to do it with meme coins?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While he cautioned that some meme tokens are scams, rugpulls, or just have low utility, he stated they can have &#8216;500x&#8217; upside potential or more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can then retrace by 90% or deeper &#8211; making investing early the best bet, at the pre-ICO, IDO or IEO stage, during pre-sale rounds if they are open to the public.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/114499/276490/pepe-price-chart.jpg" alt="Pepe Price Chart"></figure>
<p>The Pepe price for example corrected 80% after an explosive bull run far beyond what GameStop stocks achieved, making many holders millionaires. Even the Ethereum price at one point retraced 95% (from $1,440 to $80) before setting new all-time highs.</p>
<p>The most upside potential tends to be realized by following the trading mantra of <i>buy low, sell high</i>, and sticking to well-established projects with a trusted team.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes draws on their experience of launching successful NFT projects &#8211; that did not scam investors and are still around today. Wall St Bulls NFTs have 3,532 owners according to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" rel="sponsored"><u>OpenSea</u></a>.</p>
<p>In 2022 <a href="https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1567221067625676802" rel="sponsored"><u>@MacnBTC</u></a> tweeted to his 414k followers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Someone with a $10,000 portfolio should not focus on buying $ETH and $BTC but rather possibly aim to get whitelisted in NFT projects and gamble on dogecoins that either go x50 or -100%.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His sentiment is similar &#8211; that DOGE themed cryptos, or meme tokens in general can have 50x potential and can also fail completely. That averages out to a high profit potential, as long you adopt a risk management strategy &#8211; e.g. keeping a diversified portfolio and not over-investing in one crypto project.</p>
<p>See our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>list of crypto presales</u></a> for some other options to invest in early. We rank the Wall Street Memes presale our top pick currently for being on its earliest stages and history in the NFT and meme space.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wall Street Meme NEW 10X CRYPTO PRESALE - Next Crypto to Explode? $WSM 100x Crypto Gem &#x1f525;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2DTEOjOVxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes tokenomics are highlighted in the video above, with 100% available to the community &#8211; including 50% sold during the WSM presale, 30% for future community rewards and 20% for CEX and DEX liquidity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There not being any team tokens set aside can guard against an issue a similar project faced &#8211; Wall Street Baby (WSB). After claiming to be the official token of the Wall Street Bets Reddit, insiders on the $WSB project team dumped a large portion of the WSB token supply on the market, causing a 90% crash in the Wall Street Baby price.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Place To Buy Cryptos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although the Wall Street Memes token is not yet listed on Binance, it has high prospects for a potential listing due to its popularity among investors.</p>
<p>Binance offers many cryptos for trading, providing users access to popular and emerging digital assets. The platform caters to beginners and experienced traders by offering basic and advanced trading interfaces, including spot, margin, and futures trading.</p>
<p>The platform also focuses on security, using reliable practices such as two-factor authentication (2FA), cold storage of assets, and an insurance fund to protect user funds.</p>
<p>User-Friendly Mobile Application: The Binance mobile app is highly rated for its usability, allowing users to trade, manage their portfolios, and access other services.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="900" height="462" class="wp-image-136746 size-full aligncenter" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="Binance buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto-768x394.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Binance&#8217;s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading platform allows users to buy and sell cryptos directly with each other, supporting multiple payment methods. This feature has particularly benefited regions with limited access to traditional banking services.</p>
<p>Binance is known for its competitive fee structure, charging a standard 0.1% for both makers and takers. This rate can be further reduced by using BNB to pay for fees or by attaining higher VIP levels based on trading volume.</p>
<p>Binance offers staking services, allowing users to earn rewards by holding certain cryptos. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) varies depending on the asset and the duration of staking, providing an additional income stream for investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Binance</a>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t invest unless you&rsquo;re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A conservative Wall Street Memes price prediction might be for WSM to test the $100 million market cap level, which recent new meme coin launches we reviewed such as Sponge and Tamadoge reached. In the most bullish case, Pepe still has a ~$600 million market cap even after its deep correction, and two meme coins rank in the top fifteen cryptocurrency assets &#8211; SHIB valued at $5 billion and DOGE in the top ten with a $10 billion market cap.</p>
<p>Having an established community leads to more holders rather than short term traders looking to take profit early and move onto the next asset. NFT investors also usually hold their digital assets for a longer period, and many of the Wall St Bulls NFT community may have formed the early investors into $WSM.</p>
<p>The project is also building up publicity with a $50,000 airdrop hosted on outreach platform <a href="https://gleam.io/xKLkf/wall-street-memes-50000-airdrop" rel="sponsored"><u>Gleam.io</u></a>, to be shared between five winners.</p>

Join Fight Out and discover a new world of fitness and community.<br><br>Join the presale now at <a href="https://t.co/z34Nkx3ffi">https://t.co/z34Nkx3ffi</a>!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Masterclass?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Masterclass</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Blockchain?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Blockchain</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Web3</a> <a href="https://t.co/xKNWdkw2dv">pic.twitter.com/xKNWdkw2dv</a></p>&mdash; Fight Out (@FightOut_) <a href="https://twitter.com/FightOut_/status/1626914458332286981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>With Fight Out, you&#8217;ll be able to unlock and proudly display a unique NFT avatar that reflects your fitness progress. Users will be able to track and compare stats with others to make every workout an exciting challenge.</p><p>Users can also earn REPS tokens, which incentivize them to work out at home or in the gym. These tokens can be redeemed for discounts on subscriptions, merchandise, and gym memberships.</p><p>Fight Out is positioning itself to make inroads in the fitness sector by fostering a community-driven, personalized, and goal-oriented environment. Investors have a unique chance to take advantage of this investment opportunity that offers bonuses up to 50% in the project&#8217;s token presale for investments over $50,000. FGHT tokens have already raised close to $4.39 million in the presale period, with the next phase soon to begin at higher prices.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/fightout/en"><strong><u>Visit Fight Out Now</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Republic Note: Upcoming ICO Shares in Republic&#8217;s Success</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Republic, an alternative investment platform, is launching its own digital security called Republic Note. The Republic Note is a profit-sharing instrument with a finite supply that aims to bring profit to investors by distributing dividends when companies succeed.</p><p>The Republic ecosystem provides individual investors access to a wide range of investment opportunities, including early-stage startups, growth-stage/pre-IPO technology companies, crypto, e-sports and video games, real estate, and Main Street investments. The platform has connected over 2.5 million investors from 100+ countries and enabled them to invest a combined $1.5 billion in global projects.</p><p>Republic Note will allow investors to own a piece of the profits from certain Republic business lines and will be backed by Republic Core&#8217;s profit-sharing interests in select portfolio companies.</p><p>Some of the companies that have raised capital with Republic include <a href="https://www.space.com/meet-spacex-crew-dragon-crew-6-astronauts"><u>SpaceX</u></a>, Avalanche, and Gumroad. When corporations experience a successful exit resulting in cash proceeds, some of the money will go to the Republic Note pool.</p><p>Once the total amount of allocations reaches $2 million, proportional payouts will be given to all owners of Republic Notes. Subsequent distributions will happen each time this threshold is reached (or earlier depending on the decision made by Republic Core).</p><h2><strong>Charging Towards a Sustainable Future: The Innovations of C+Charge</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Electric vehicle (EV) owners face challenges in finding nearby charging stations and dealing with vague pricing. C+Charge aims to address these issues by offering a mobile app for EV owners that provides real-time data on nearby charging options and diagnoses the vehicle for any charging issues.</p><p>C+Charge is also developing its own charging stations and partnering with existing ones while allowing users to pay with the exclusive CCHG token. The blockchain technology utilized by the CCHG <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-today-17-february-memag-matic-fght-lrc-cchg-fil-ria.htm"><u>cryptocurrency</u></a> guarantees efficient and transparent transactions, providing users with a superior payment processing experience. In addition to streamlined payments, EV owners who use C+Charge will also earn carbon credits through Goodness Native Tokens (GNT), which can be stored in the C+Charge app to be traded.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How can technology help the future of mobility?<br><br>Technology brings more data and connectivity to mobility efficiency<br><br>We allow our users to find the nearest charging stations with the real-time data analysis<br><br>Buy some <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCHG&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$CCHG</a> now<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b07.png" alt="⬇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/ixe18bPqzI">https://t.co/ixe18bPqzI</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/presale?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#presale</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Refi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Refi</a> <a href="https://t.co/CKFdS1YLXL">pic.twitter.com/CKFdS1YLXL</a></p>&mdash; C+Charge (@C_Charge_Token) <a href="https://twitter.com/C_Charge_Token/status/1626974897086902274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>C+Charge has already sold out the first stage of its presale and has raised over $1.261 million. Now is the ideal time to purchase CCHG, as its token price will continue to rise in the upcoming ICO stage 3.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/c-charge/en"><strong><u>Visit C+Charge Now</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>TagoVerse&#8217;s Mental Health Platform</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The mental<strong> </strong>healthcare industry has long struggled to provide affordable and quality counseling to those in need. With the growing number of people experiencing mental health issues, the demand for therapy and advice has risen sharply. TagoVerse is looking to help by creating the world&#8217;s first mental health metaverse.</p><p>TagoVerse is creating a platform where individuals can easily connect with mental health professionals from anywhere in the world. TagoVerse also has its own token in its ecosystem which can be used as a reward for users who contribute to the growth of the platform.</p><p>The platform is designed with an &#8220;Evolve to Earn&#8221; mechanism, where experts and contributors must earn their rewards through successful bookings and high ratings. The token can also be used to pay for products and services on the platform, or for staking, which earns interest and grants administrative rights.</p><p>To ensure fairness and efficiency, TagoVerse has divided its tokenomics as follows: 40% for the staking program and ecosystem development, 8% for reserved, 5% for DEX liquidity, 10% for marketing and community, 12% for private funding round &amp; 7% for IDO, 3% for advisors, and 15% for the foundation.</p><h2><strong>Backstage in the Events Industry</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Backstage is a new company specializing in event financing that offers a solution to the financing issues facing the event industry. The event industry has always been a high-risk market, and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/covid-19-pandemic-made-1-6-mn-youth-idle-in-pakistan-world-bank-report-123021900813_1.html"><u>Covid-19 pandemic</u></a> has further complicated matters. With restrictions still in place, the industry is struggling to finance its activities.</p><p>Backstage&#8217;s vision is to digitize the event industry, making it more resilient, circular, and profitable. The company is developing technologies that support B2C, B2B2C, and B2B services. Backstage is creating an NFT ticketing platform that will be followed by new technology and business models based on transparency, circularity, and sustainability. Backstage&#8217;s NFT platform offers a second element of innovation that includes the creation of NFT tickets that act as a sales channel for artists and venues.</p><p>The company&#8217;s ecosystem, called &#8220;The Stage,&#8221; connects blockchain-based applications powered by the BKS utility token, community, and industry. The Stage includes the BKS marketplace, NFT ticketing, loyalty NFTs, BKS launchpad, crypto POS wallet, and staking and LP staking.</p>

As a result, the price of the D2T token will be capped at a maximum price of $0.0533 in stage 4 of its pre-sale.</p><p>To help refine its product and go live in record time, Dash 2 Trade recently onboarded new talent.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the initial coin offering (ICO) market keeps shrinking, new trends are starting to emerge, offering investors new opportunities. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/2a3bc8487c.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/2a3bc8487c.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/2a3bc8487c.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/2a3bc8487c.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/2a3bc8487c.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/2a3bc8487c.jpg 1254w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/LukaTDB</figcaption></figure><p>Projects offering utility tokens are becoming less popular, while those offering service or security tokens are growing, according to a <a href="https://icorating.com/pdf/74/1/8TuF3swJWq8J82o4CnGI6dyEn3GQYhw9qdKTAE7U.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report</a> from rating agency <b>ICORating</b>. However, despite being in decline, utility token offerings together with hybrid token offerings are still the most successful ones, the report showed. </p><p>&#8220;Compared to Q2, the number of projects offering service tokens increased by 6.55%. The share of projects offering security tokens increased by 1.66%. The number of projects with utility tokens decreased by 10.07%,&#8221; according to the agency.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29edade62e.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29edade62e.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/29edade62e.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/29edade62e.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/29edade62e.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/29edade62e.png 1238w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: ICORating</figcaption></figure><p>Almost half of all ICOs in Q3 offered service tokens (a token used as the internal currency to pay for project services), while a quarter went for utility tokens (tokens of the protocol itself). The numbers keep halving, with around 12.5% of projects offering hybrid tokens (payment for services + bonuses for work performed), around 6.5% selling security tokens (tokens secured by an obligation, like promises of dividend payment, receipt of company shares, etc.), etc.</p><p>However, just because half of all ICOs are offering a certain type of token, doesn&rsquo;t mean that this is what investors want. Hybrid, reward and utility tokens are the ones raising the most capital in this quarter, while cryptocurrencies, security and service tokens all raised less than a median amount of USD 250,000. Service tokens were also the most likely to fail, with around half of those projects not making it. Only hybrid token projects had more successful projects than failed ones. What this could indicate is that investors are looking for more options offered in the tokens, preferably returns coming from multiple sources (both from services and bonuses, for example), and that project teams are a bit slow to catch on. </p><p><b>Number of unsuccessful ICOs by token type</b></p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 1222w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: ICORating</figcaption></figure><p>All in all, ICOs raised around USD 1.8 billion dollars in Q3 &#8211; a steep downturn compared to Q2, when USD 8.3 billion was collected. 57 percent of them were unable to raise more than USD 100,000, and only 4% managed to get listed on exchanges (compared with 7% in Q2.)</p><p><b>Number of successful projects and their funding</b></p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 1456w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: ICORating</figcaption></figure><p>Close to half of all ICOs originated in Europe. This could arguably stem from the fact that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on ICOs, requiring them to follow a legal framework and ramping up their vigorous oversight of the industry. Recently, the SEC settled charges with two such companies, <b>Airfox</b> and <b>Paragon Coin</b>, mandating they register their offerings as securities and reimburse investors due to improperly offering digital tokens.</p><p>Other US authorities are stepping up to help regulate the space as well. Maksim Zaslavskiy, a former institutional developer and self-proclaimed businessman, is now facing up to five years in prison for orchestrating two fake ICOs last year. Following the case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), said that they will &ldquo;continue to pursue any individual who seeks to profit by exploiting others.&rdquo; Further, the SEC also filing related civil charges against Zaslavskiy, which are to be settled following the court&rsquo;s criminal sentencing.</p><p>Following these cases, the SEC published a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/digital-asset-securites-issuuance-and-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading</a>,&rdquo; detailing the way ICOs are to be held in order to stay compliant with current regulations, mostly telling future ICOs to register. The community&rsquo;s reaction to this is mixed: Reddit user u/WantedToGetInvolved writes, &ldquo;Blockchain companies should move away from these restrictive frameworks and take innovation elsewhere,&rdquo; while u/elizabethgiovanni writes, &ldquo;This is good news because funds and organizations and high net individuals won&rsquo;t touch this space without know what risk they&rsquo;re exposing themselves to.&rdquo;</p><p>The regulatory difficulties in the US are prompting some investors to skip this market completely. Recently, Antanas Guoga, Member of European Parliament, a serial entrepreneur, investor, and backer of <i>Cryptonews.com</i>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/soprano-ice-cream-and-security-tokens-exploring-new-crypto-t-2889.htm">announced </a>the acquisition and upcoming security token offering (STO) of an ice cream chain called <b>Soprano</b>. &ldquo;Europe is definitely the jurisdiction for STOs, because we don&rsquo;t have the draconian security laws that America has. America will be off the books, as they&rsquo;re very difficult and expensive to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the cryptoverse and the initial coin offering (ICO) landscape are changing, startups need to adapt in order to find the best way to move forward. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 1254w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/MatusDuda</figcaption></figure><p>One of the examples is <b><a href="https://hiway.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hiway</a></b>, a developer of a marketplace for work focused on the blockchain industry. Even after two years of development, they had to change their prototype launch plans and review their crowdsale process. At the same time, their private sale is currently happening. The softcap is still undetermined, while their hardcap is USD 8 million.</p><p><i>Cryptonews.com</i> talked to Simon Rikmenspoel, the founder and CFO of Hiway, about how they have adapted. In either case, he said that the startup is &ldquo;almost ready to share a working platform.&rdquo;</p><p><b>How does the current <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/icos-hit-new-low-but-production-picking-up-2595.htm">downturn in the crowdsale market</a> and the rise of venture capital funding affect your plans and how do you respond to this?</b></p><figure class="left"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 300px, 300px" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 956w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Simon Rikmenspoel</figcaption></figure><p>It affected our plans completely. Instead of doing a &#8216;normal&#8217; funding round, we chose to focus more on the development of the platform, because there might be less people who will show their interest in the platform by way of the crowdsale (because of the market). So instead of spending a lot of funds on arranging a crowdsale, we prefer more marketing with obtaining freelancers and just getting the platform up and running as the main goal.</p><p><b>The private sale is currently happening, but your website has no other details about the timeline of your token (WAY) sale.</b></p><p>Currently, we are focusing on launching the prototype. Since we are launching a utility token, the most important thing is that someone buying the token is able to use it on the platform. Otherwise it&rsquo;s not a utility token. Besides, currently we are in the phase that we are looking for investors willing to invest long term, with belief in our ideas and those who are able to help us scale the platform.</p><p><b>How is the landscape of blockchain-related startups changing and how does it affect Hiway?</b></p><p>I think that we are slowly moving towards a landscape in which the companies that promised to change a lot are almost ready to launch. It will be interesting to see those projects trying to deliver their promises and if not, I could imagine quite a negative energy surrounding the industry. But as always that&rsquo;s something that is not in our reach to change, so it would be a waste of time to focus on it. Crypto is a very flexible market. All new, so I think it&rsquo;s needed to keep watching all innovations and adapt when the market needs us to adapt.</p><p><b>According to your roadmap, the Hiway prototype had to be delivered in Q3 2018. Why has it not happened yet?</b></p><p>While we were building the prototype we ended up building already more than we thought we would. So we changed the plan from prototype &#8216;look and feel&#8217;, into a prototype were we could on-board freelancers and clients so that we can start building a user-base. Being who we are, we wanted to do this with the quality standard we ask ourselves and therefore needing a bit more time. Quality over quantity, so to say.</p><p><b>You are working towards removing the need to trust third parties, but you keep data in a central database that you control. How does that fit in with each other?</b></p><p>Although all data is centralized (because of the need for a fast platform), the hashes of the data will be stored on the blockchain. So only the parties working together will be in control for as long as they made the contract.</p><p>_____</p><h2 data-param="1" id="new-concepts">New concepts</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Two of the new concepts Hiway is offering are: quality jury and job value reserve. Quality jury is there to ensure no substandard work is being done, and serve as mediators to resolve any disagreements. Job value reserve, meanwhile, represents an automated system that will increase the amount of WAY tokens paid to a freelancer when the token price declines and will decrease the amount of tokens paid when prices inflate. Instead of a worker losing out due to price movements, they should always receive fair compensation for the work they do. Initially, the platform will accept dollars and euros. </p><p>The founder explained that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite difficult to find a way to make sure people keep the same amount of fiat reward when a token would fluctuate&rdquo; while their system of the reserve is &ldquo;the most interesting solution.&rdquo;</p><p>However, he stressed that before this will be live, there will be a lot of testing and running different scenarios to know how it will all work out, &ldquo;but we feel that we are on the right track.&rdquo;</p><p>Talking about the jury system, Rikmenspoel said that it &ldquo;will always be &#8216;pooled&#8217; from people/users from the same industry, with a specific rating in different aspects of their profile. Helping the system will grant them a bonus, both in rating online as well as a financial reward.&rdquo;</p>

However, in unrealized losses, they have around USD 25 million &#8211; although the gain more than makes up for it. Joining Filecoin are <b>Golem</b>, &ldquo;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/airbnb-for-computers-announces-the-big-step-1553.htm">AirBnB for computers</a>&rdquo;, with an estimate of around USD 20 million in realized gains and unrealized gains of more than USD 70 million, while <b>DigixDAO</b>, a smart assets company, only has unrealized gains &#8211; but more than USD 95 million of those.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="here-are-top-20-icos-by-total-loss-from-change-in-value-of-eth-holdings-usd-million">Here are top 20 ICOs by total loss from change in value of ETH holdings, USD million</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bb/237a934798.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bb/237a934798.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bb/237a934798.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bb/237a934798.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bb/237a934798.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bb/237a934798.png 1339w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Ethereum Blockchain, BitMEX Research, TokenAnalyst, Token Data, Price data from Etherscan</figcaption></figure><p><b>Sirin Labs</b>, a developer of blockchain-based smartphones and computers, leads the list with losses, with more than USD 40 million total lost. <b>Status</b>, a mobile Ethereum operating system, and <b>Fusion</b>, a cryptofinance platform, are two more ICOs that have lost more than USD 30 million. <b>Monetha</b>, a blockchain-based platform that aims to provide &#8220;universal/transferable trust&#8221; for the e-commerce industry, is an interesting example: although it has more than USD 10 million in unrealized losses, it also has more than USD 5 million in realized gains.

However, the blog post by BitMEX concludes that, &ldquo;the &lsquo;panic sell&rsquo; thesis is either false or will only occur to a lesser extent than some expect.&rdquo; Also, an earlier research showed that &ldquo;smaller ICO projects present a higher risk for panic selling of their ether holdings,&rdquo; as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ether-firesale-sale-risk-comes-from-small-icos-research-2501.htm">previously reported.</a> </p><p>Moreover, BitMEX stressed that a number of the ICOs will not deliver on these promises in spite of gains: &ldquo;In our view, the level of accountability in some of these ICOs is low, for instance even obtaining information about the amount raised, which currencies the raise occurred in, which Ethereum addresses are used and if the funds are spent/sold or not, can be challenging. Therefore fruits of these investments may disappoint in our view.&rdquo;</p><p>The researchers also noted that many of these projects are competing over the same scarce resources, developers. </p><p>&#8220;One could argue that the volume of capital obtained by these ICOs could inflate the cost of these resources (perhaps the less experienced developers). This may not only plague the crypto-currency ecosystem with higher costs, but also to some extent some startups in the wider technology industry, for many years,&#8221; they concluded.</p>

This is a sector in which Korean companies can really thrive.&rdquo;</p><p>Another regional governor, Lee Chul-woo of North Gyeongsang province, has also stated his keenness to build a Zug-style, ICO-friendly &ldquo;Crypto Valley.&rdquo;</p><p>Leading academics have also voiced their support of ending the ICO ban, with professors Ha Tae-hyung of Suwon University and Yoon Soon-deok of Hansei University calling for the government to legalize ICOs. Per Business Post, the professors told a parliamentary select committee that they believed ICOs should be issued in special, regulated zones within the country, or to follow the American lead on ICO issuance in order to let the blockchain industry &ldquo;evolve.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, in an editorial for the Electronic Times, journalist Jang Ji-young called on the South Korean government to follow Israel&rsquo;s lead in blockchain policy-related matters. Jang said that the ICO ban has forced South Korean blockchain startups to relocate abroad, and accused the government&rsquo;s policy of allowing over USD 27 billion to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; to overseas exchanges as a result of its blockchain-and cryptocurrency-related regulations.</p>

COTI stand for Currency Of The Internet. It is advertised on the website as &ldquo;Digital currency built for payments,&rdquo; fast and scalable like <b>Visa</b> payments (thousands of transactions per second), secure and decentralized like Bitcoin. On top of this, it promises a &ldquo;Trust Scoring Engine, Mediation System, currency exchange and decentralized governance.&rdquo;<br>
The COTI network will be powered by a distributed ledger called The Cluster, based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structure &ndash; the same technology that powers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/iota/">IOTA</a>. In DAG-based networks, a transaction must validate the previous two transactions to be confirmed. The ecosystem is made out of four participants: node operators, end users, mediators, and merchants.</p><p><b>Who the team members are?</b><br>

David Assaraf, COO, previously worked as the chief internal auditor at <b>HSBC Israel</b>. Their CFO is Yair Lavi, a financial specialist who was previously CEO and finance director at <b>Plus500UK</b>, an online trading platform.</p><p><b>At what stage the project is?</b><br>
The community presale was completed, and according to data from ICOdrops, the token sale itself starts September 15th. According to a blog post by the startup, the team also pushed forward a new version of their whitepaper recently.</p><p><b>What the main future milestones in their roadmap are?</b><br>
Their minimum viable product (MVP) release is set for September 2018, and in December this year is when the testnet should be launched. The mainnet launch is set for July 2019. The roadmap also expects mass adoption by December 2019.</p><p><b>Fundraising status:</b><br>
Presale ended, raising USD 3 million in 27 hours, according to their website. Token sale is set to begin on September 15th, and their end goal is USD 30 million.</p><p><b>Most important partnerships?</b><br>
<b>Processing.com</b>, a multicurrency processing company;<br>
<b>Bancor</b>, a standard for a new generation of cryptocurrencies called Smart Tokens;<br>

Song&rsquo;s views were echoed by MP Kim Kyung-jin of the Democracy and Peace Party, a prominent member of the National Assembly&rsquo;s Science and IT committee.</p><p>MPs also want legal clarification over the island province of Jeju&rsquo;s bid to allow ICOs on its territory. As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/island-province-wants-to-lead-the-way-for-south-korea-ico-ch-2207.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously reported</a> on <i>Cryptonews.com</i>, Jeju&rsquo;s pro-crypto governor is hoping to use the territory&rsquo;s special legal status to legalize ICOs, and create a regional hub for blockchain startups.</p><p>Also, the National Assembly&rsquo;s Legislation Bureau has called on the ministry to clarify the legal nature of the ICO ban &ndash; possibly in response to lawyers who have been looking for ways around the ban.</p><p>MP Jung Byung-guk of the Assembly&rsquo;s third biggest party, Bareunmirae, is set to call a special committee debate on &ldquo;ICO Guidelines.&rdquo; Jung hopes the debate will be tabled with the Industry 4.0 committee before the month&rsquo;s end.</p><p>Per Sisa Magazine, a special National Assembly committee will convene to discuss blockchain technology-related matters on August 30 &ndash; with ICO regulations likely to be on the agenda again.</p>

It&#8217;s not an endorsement.</i></p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b7/d3f996f64f.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b7/d3f996f64f.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5b7/d3f996f64f.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5b7/d3f996f64f.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5b7/d3f996f64f.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5b7/d3f996f64f.jpg 1254w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/jakkapan21</figcaption></figure><p>Today we are looking at <b>Moonlight</b>.</p><p><b>What problem(s) does it target?</b><br>
Moonlight is a decentralized workforce platform on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-is-neo-and-how-it-grows-1840.htm">NEO blockchain</a> with the goal of changing how organizations recruit and scale their workforce. The project is trying to solve the issue of organizations allocating too many resources when optimizing project teams, and individuals&rsquo; skill sets not being properly utilized.<br>
Moonlight will use the NEO blockchain to deploy a network of trustless resumes that will anchor the platform&rsquo;s tools. The task matching-making service will have issuers, or organizations creating tasks, and resolvers, the organizations that bid on and fulfill tasks. Every task completed by an organization is published to the blockchain along with the skills required for it, building up the trustless resume of the organization.</p><p><b>Who the team members are?</b><br>
The Moonlight team is comprised of core members of the <b>City of Zion</b>, a global group of open-source developers that support the NEO smart economy ecosystem. Advisors include Nathaniel Walpole, product designer at <b>Neon Exchange</b>, Christopher Dienes, senior statistician at <b>Wiland</b>, and Ethan Fast, co-founder of City of Zion and Neon Exchange.</p><p><b>At what stage the project is?</b><br>
Token sale ongoing, and the token is already listed on <b>Switcheo</b>. According to roadmap, private beta release is still pending, although it was set for Q2 2018.</p><p><b>What the main future milestones in their roadmap are?</b><br>
Q3 2018 should see the Marketplace Public Beta Release, while Q2 2019 is when the Project Management Public Beta Release is set to happen.</p><p><b>Fundraising status:</b><br>
According to data from ICOdrops, token sale is happening from August 11th until August 31st and the project has already raised almost half its goal of USD 8.3 million.</p><p><b>Most important partnerships?</b><br>
<b>Neo Global Capital</b>: an investment fund for the NEO blockchain-related projects;<br>
<b>City of Zion</b>: a global, independent group of open source developers, designers and translators which support the NEO core and ecosystem;<br>
<b>Thor Token</b>: a project set to &ldquo;fix the gig economy for freelancers and on-demand companies.&rdquo;</p><p><b>How large their community is?</b><br>
Their subreddit has 607 subscribers, the Twitter account is followed by more than 3,800 people, while their Telegram channel has around 18,000 members. None of those is very active. </p><p><b>What other similar projects are?</b><br>

Source: FOAM</figcaption></figure><p>Today we are looking at the <a href="https://foam.space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">FOAM Protocol</a>.</p><p><b>What problem(s) does it target?</b><br>
The team behind the FOAM Protocol is looking at the mapping services available today, and the deficiencies they have. It describes itself as a &ldquo;consensus-driven map and open protocol for decentralized geospatial data markets.&rdquo;<br>
In other words, it&rsquo;s a map, with a few extra kinks provided by the underlying Ethereum blockchain. <br>
The main problems the protocol targets, include the censorship and centralization of location service providers; problems with accuracy and privacy, as well as location encoding standards. It aims to solve these problems with its own solutions, which include Crypto-Spatial Coordinates, the Spatial Index and Visualizer, and Proof of Location. </p><p><b>Who the team members are?</b><br>
The core team counts a dozen people, with another six being collaborators. The core team includes professionals from architecture and urban planning, developers and engineers from BlockApps, a platform for enterprise-grade blockchain applications. Worth specific mention is Jens Krause, functional programmer and ex <b>Cardano SL</b> developer, and Matt Liston, co-founder of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/we-tested-augur-and-this-is-how-it-went-2358.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Augur</b></a> (special advisor at FOAM). </p><p><b>At what stage the project is?</b><br>
The project itself is in beta, which is already available for curious eyes over on <a href="https://beta.foam.space/welcome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this link</a>. FOAM token sale is active at the time of writing.  </p><p><b>What the main future milestones in their roadmap are?</b><br>
The roadmap is yet to be published. The whitepaper is mostly technical, without detailing on the exact steps needed to reach a complete product. </p><p><b>Fundraising status:</b><br>
Token sale just launched, at the time of writing. The fundraising goal is 24 million USD, with 30% tokens available on sale. Soft cap is 15 million. Another quarter of the token supply is left for advisors, partners, employees, founders and a reserve for grants and a foundation. Another quarter will be left for compensatory purposes, and 10% will be allocated for future developer grants. Another 35% will be set aside for mining rewards.</p><p><b>Most important partnerships?</b><br>
The project is backed by <b>Consensys</b> and <b>Navel</b>, to name a few. Partners include <b>Trusted Aliance</b>, <b>Enterprise Ethereum Alliance</b>, <b>uPort</b> and <b>Dether</b>. </p><p><b>How large their community is?</b><br>
Their Telegram channel counts 12,000 members, Twitter 8,000 and Reddit 538 subscribers.</p><p><b>What other similar projects are?</b><br>
<b>XYO Project</b>.</p>

Jura&rsquo;s founders claim that every blockchain comes with a tradeoff. You can&rsquo;t have increased <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/security/">security</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/decentralization/">decentralization</a>, without lowering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/scalability/">transaction speeds</a>. If the project is successful, Jura, a &lsquo;paradigm-shifting suite of four technologies&rsquo;, could eliminate that tradeoff. The project is comprised of its own data structure (called Fusus), Proof of Utility (PoU) system, Dynamically monitored and distributed sharding, and an AI (Artificial Intelligence) security layer.</p><p>Proof of utility is a new framework designed to validate transactions, and the new sharding technique enables parallel processing of requests. It also should ensure that if a node gets dropped, it will be rerouted to another active shard. </p><p><b>Who the team members are?</b><br>
The team is seven people strong, comprising of names with strong ties to cryptography. Core team includes Iris Yang (B.S. in Applied Math, Columbia University), Donglin Wu Dafflon (Named one of Forbes Asia&rsquo;s 30 under 30 in 2016), Cameron Wang (Ph.D. in math at Princeton), and Alex Dang, Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the Columbia University. </p><p><b>At what stage the project is?</b><br>
The project is still in its infancy, while its whitepaper was published only recently. The team is also currently working on the design prototype of key components. Those were the two things planned for Q2 2018. Q3 has ERC-20 token generation in store, as well as PoU-based consensus framework and FUSUS (data structure, the core of the project).</p><p><b>What the main future milestones in their roadmap are?</b><br>
Sharding architecture integration and testnet launch are planned for the end of 2018. Smart contract implementation should see the light of day in Q1 2019, while the mainnet should be launched in Q2 2019.</p><p><b>Fundraising status:</b><br>
No information on any funds raised so far. An initial coin offering (ICO) is on the cards, as the ICO Drops site expects the token sale to happen &lsquo;soon&rsquo;. Goals are yet to be determined. While it&#8217;s being speculated that a hard cap of 20 million USD, and between 20% and 25% tokens on sale.</p><p><b>Most important partnerships?</b><br>
No announced partnerships yet.</p><p><b>How large their community is?</b><br>
Despite being in relative infancy, the community is pretty big. Jura Network&rsquo;s Telegram channel is 25,000 strong, and quite lively, with new people coming in droves. The company&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t gloat with similar results on Twitter, where it currently has just above 2,000 followers.</p><p><b>What other similar projects are?</b><br>

MultiVac tackles one of the fundamental problems of blockchain as a technology. It says that blockchain is stuck in a triangle between <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/decentralization/">decentralization</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/security/">security</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/scalability/">scalability</a>, and that startups have to sacrifice one to have the other two. It argues that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are &lsquo;completely unscalable&rsquo;. MultiVAC looks to solve the fundamental problems of how to create shards from network nodes for transaction and smart contract processing in a trustworthy manner, allowing the network to scale; how to process transactions and update records using trusted shards in the use case of transaction processing; and how to verify the correct and honest execution of smart contract code by network nodes in the use case of smart contract processing.</p><p><b>Who the team members are?</b><br>
The team comprises of people with Ph.D.s in computer science, as well as senior engineers at powerhouses like <b>Google</b>, <b>Facebook</b> or <b>Pinterest</b>. </p><p><b>At what stage the project is?</b><br>
For Q2 2018, the team planned the release of the technical whitepaper (already released), design and development of the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) sharding transaction, design and development of the Sharding Ledger &amp; Storage, as well as the design and development of the interactive transaction verification.</p><p><b>What the main future milestones in their roadmap are?</b><br>
By the end of the year, the team plans to release the testnet, as well as to refine and release new features. For the start of 2019, the team plans to launch the mainnet, as well as full-function union debugging and update. Finally, they&#8217;re planning to do some stress testing and security scanning.</p><p><b>Fundraising status:</b><br>
Token sale dates, as well as the goals, are yet to be determined.</p><p><b>Most important partnerships?</b><br>
<b>TGL Capital</b>, an investment firm dedicated to empowering frontier market entrepreneurs, with a focus on opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa.<br>

<b>JRR Crypto</b>, a distributed investment banking group with focus on the blockchain industry and cryptocurrency.</p><p><b>How large their community is?</b><br>
MultiVAC has two Telegram channels, the MultiVAC Channel, with 5,000 subscribers, and the MultiVAC Community, with 19,000 subscribers. They have 3,346 Twitter followers, and they post regularly on Twitter.</p><p><b>What are other similar projects?</b><br>

Source: Twitter</figcaption></figure><p>So what can you do to fix the issue? You set up another token project, of course! There are at least two projects that are currently tackling the abovementioned problems. The problem of fake and crooked ICOs is being tackled, among others, by <b>TruStory</b>, a startup that is &ldquo;trying to design a world where the token only has value if it is necessary, and because it&rsquo;s necessary it has value.&rdquo;</p><p>Right off the bat, it had to explain that it in fact is not an ICO and there is no token sale of any kind (but the project will have its own token). The community was quick to question the usefulness of such a project, with some saying it was a &ldquo;useless project to spot useless tokens has its own useless token,&rdquo; while others were disputing the founder&rsquo;s (Preethi Kasireddy) expertise, saying &ldquo;Founder was working in <b>Mercury Protocol</b> which is complete vaporware.&rdquo; Previously, Kasireddy was a banking analyst with the investment bank <b>Goldman Sachs</b>, worked at <b>Andreessen Horowitz</b>, the Silicon Valley investment powerhouse, and <b>Coinbase</b>, the US-based crypto exchange and wallet service, according to TechCrunch.</p><p>Still, the problem that this startup is trying to solve is real and it did already raise USD 3 million (<b>Pantera Capital</b>, <b>Kindred Ventures</b>, <b>Coinbase Ventures</b>, and others were among investors) to identify ICO scams more successfully.</p><p>The company is currently looking to test its solutions in the real world. Luckily for them (and unluckily for most of the crypto world), they&rsquo;ll have plenty of examples to choose from.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s just half of the problem. What about unsuccessful, dead ICOs? Dead coins have no value, right? </p><figure class="left"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b5/71c1be5348.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 300px, 300px" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b5/71c1be5348.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5b5/71c1be5348.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5b5/71c1be5348.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5b5/71c1be5348.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5b5/71c1be5348.jpg 1452w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: a YouTube video screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>Well, according to the folks at <b>CoinJanitor</b>, false. Dead coins and failed ICOs do have value locked inside them, and they believe they can &#8216;unlock&#8217; that value. Besides unlocking the value, CoinJanitor also looks to bring in all the communities of different dead coins under one roof, bringing experience, expertise and partnerships together.</p><p>And finally, it says that the crypto market will benefit from such a project, as &lsquo;unlocked&rsquo; value from dead coins can be returned to the ecosystem for a significant boost. </p><p>&#8220;The network effect created through the amalgamation of dead coin communities is the cornerstone of our value proposition. As we integrate more dead or failed coin communities under the CoinJanitor umbrella, that network effect should grow, compounding the value of our token,&#8221; the startup explained.</p><p>Some in the community looks at this project favorably, saying things like &ldquo;we need a garbage bin for all the scam/dead crypto projects&rdquo;, or that it&rsquo;s simply a &ldquo;great idea&rdquo;. While others wonder &#8220;How should this work at all?&#8221; </p><p>ICOs are a new and exciting way of starting up a business, which comes with its own set of advantages and challenges. The abovementioned problems currently perceived as the biggest among the challenges, so let&rsquo;s see how they get tackled.</p>

Source: Metadium </figcaption></figure><p>Today we are looking at <a href="https://metadium.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Metadium</a>.</p><p><b>What problem(s) does it target?</b><br>
Metadium claims it believes a person&rsquo;s identity is at a &lsquo;status quo&rsquo; nowadays, with different characteristics scattered around the world, both offline and in the digital realm. It wants to tackle the problem individuals currently have with managing, protecting and using their identity whenever, wherever and however they need to.<br>
It aims to support a secure decentralized digital identity, where personal data can only be shared with explicit consent from the data owner. The infrastructure is based on blockchain, with users being able to use both Metadium and the company&rsquo;s Meta ID on other platforms and services. <br>
But it&rsquo;s not just individuals that are faced with problems &ndash; businesses are faced with data integration challenges, too. In order to expand globally, businesses sometimes need to use the help of attestation agencies, adding extra layers of unnecessary complexity. Metadium says this is particularly true among startups. </p><p><b>Who the team members are?</b><br>
The team is comprised of more than a dozen people, mostly blockchain and MetaID App and Server developers. One of the co-founders is Ryan Uhr, also a co-founder of <b>Coinplug</b> (Korean bitcoin exchange, wallet and payment processor). Among the advisors is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/roger-ver/">Roger Ver</a>, CEO of <b>Bitcoin.com</b>.</p><p><b>At what stage the project is?</b><br>
It is currently at the &lsquo;Metadium Initiative&rsquo;, which includes building up the Metadium team, wrapping up the Metadium prototype and releasing the application programming interface (API).</p><p><b>What the main future milestones in their roadmap are?</b><br>
Future milestones include Open Beta Service Demo, expected in Q4 2018, as well as the launch of the mainnet in Q1 2019. In the same quarter, the Metadium team should scale up and the Blockchain 1.0 should be released.  </p><p><b>Fundraising status:</b><br>
Token sale set from July to August according to data from ICOdrops, with no further details currently available.</p><p><b>Most important partnerships?</b><br>
<b>FBG Capital</b>, a digital asset management firm.<br>
<b>Kenetic</b>, a blockchain firm. <br>
<b>BlockTower</b>, a cryptocurrency investment firm.<br>
<b>Connect Capital</b>, a blockchain and digital assets investments fund.</p><p><b>How large their community is?</b><br>
A total of 951 Twitter followers, and just above 10,000 Telegram channel members, which seem pretty lively.</p><p><b>What are other similar projects?</b><br>
