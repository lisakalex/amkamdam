<p>28 Indian crypto platforms have registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit, the country’s Minister of State for Finance said. </p>
<p>In response to queries in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-protocol-algorand-forms-strategic-collaborations-in-india-for-web3-push.htm">India’s</a> bicameral Parliament, Indian Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary told the Parliament’s Lower House in a <a href="https://sansad.in/ls/questions/questions-and-answers">written reply</a> that 28 virtual digital asset service providers had been given the green flag by the country’s anti money-laundering department. </p>
<p>Notable exchanges such as CoinDCX, WaxirX and CoinSwitch have all successfully registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), while none of the 28 entities appear to be offshore companies.</p>
<p>The move follows India’s Finance Ministry’s announcement in March, when the government unit mandated that crypto businesses will have to register with the FIU and adhere to various processes outlined in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). </p>
<p>Crypto businesses in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/india-seeks-extradition-of-prime-suspect-in-240m-crypto-scam.htm">India</a> are now legally obligated to carry out verification processes like Know Your Customer (KYC). Entities subject to the PMLA are also required to uphold and maintain KYC details, along with other pertinent documents related to transactions, clients, and beneficial owners.</p>
<p>Chaudhary also affirmed that the guidelines and reporting requirements for crypto service providers are applicable to offshore crypto exchanges serving the Indian market. This approach is taken to reinforce future crypto regulations in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indian-authorities-prepare-chargesheet-in-240m-crypto-scam.htm">India</a>, aiming to protect its citizens from potential exchange collapses.</p>
<p>“Appropriate action under PMLA” would be taken against non-compliant offshore platforms, Chaudhary added. </p>
<p>Alongside heightened regulatory compliance, the Indian crypto market is grappling with additional challenges, notably in the realm of taxation. The government&#8217;s imposition of a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on crypto transactions exceeding INR 10,000 and a 30% tax on profits has reverberated throughout the industry.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) has also been openly critical of crypto, and has called for a cryptocurrency ban. </p>

<p>Osmosis and UX Chain are preparing to merge in a move that seeks to create a comprehensive DeFi hub.</p>
<p>Subject to approval, the merger would result in the fusion of lending protocol UX Chain’s lending logic and algorithms with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/aaron-kong-growth-strategy-lead-at-osmosis-labs-cosmos-ecosystem-decentralized-exchanges-interoperability-ep-247.htm">Osmosis’</a> decentralized exchange, the largest DEX on Cosmos.</p>
<p>In an announcement posted on Osmosis’ forum on Sunday, the companies jointly detailed a <a href="https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/merger-between-osmosis-and-umee/780">plan</a> for the proposed merger. The procedure will take place in incremental steps, starting with the assimilation of UX Chain’s codebase into the Osmosis Chain.</p>
<p>“When looking through the Cosmos, it is clear that Osmosis has shown a dominant presence as the most successful DEX in the ecosystem,” Osmosis said in its post. “Concurrently when looking at lending platforms in Cosmos it is quite apparent that the Umee UX Chain is the dominant lending platform in Cosmos with more special features than any other lending platform in crypto. Considering the potential synergies, we’re proposing a merger of these blockchain protocols into one of the most powerful DeFi ecosystems possible.”</p>
<p>The merger seeks to maximize the capabilities of both platforms, with the initial phase expected to include the harmonization of shared total value locked across the two networks. During this preliminary step, both chains will maintain the separate trading of their respective tokens — the Osmosis token and the UX token.</p>
<p>There might also be a subsequent step involving the consolidation of the two tokens, potentially through a token swap or migration process. As per the proposal, this phase aims to establish a unified token representing both networks. The specific configurations for the token swap will be determined through community governance.</p>
<p>“Each chain will have a separate governance vote from each blockchain network,” said Brent Xu, co-founder of UX Chain, in an interview with <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/265824/osmosis-ux-chain-merger-cosmos">The Block</a>. “The community governance will manage the processes separately for each network toward achieving consensus around the end goal of creating the DeFi hub.”</p>
<p>The proposed merger seeks to empower UX Chain to enhance the mesh security of Osmosis—the network&#8217;s ability to secure other blockchain projects. This could be achieved by leveraging the combined expertise or merging validator sets from both networks. </p>
<p>UX Chain and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/namada-osmosis-to-co-fuse-blockchain-to-fund-public-goods.htm">Osmosis</a> may also investigate opportunities to develop advanced liquidations, native margin trading, and MEV markets.</p>
<p>“This proposal to merge the Umee UX DeFi experience into the Osmosis chain would enable some really powerful new features and functionalities for our users — and we’re excited to continue our collaboration with UX Chain with what the community decides is best,” <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rebus-announces-public-coin-distribution-via-osmosis.htm">Osmosis</a> co-founder Sunny Aggarwal said.</p>

<p>Forkast Labs has laid off a majority of its editorial staff after completing a merger with data provider CryptoSlam.</p>
<p>According to sources cited by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/265619/forkast-layoff-cryptoslam">The Block</a>, the crypto news site underwent a series of layoffs throughout the year, leading to the eventual decision to suspend editorial operations by the end of November.</p>
<p>In January, Forkast.News merged with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-shows-signs-of-recovery-with-surging-crypto-prices-nft-sales.htm">CryptoSlam</a> to form a &#8220;Web3-focused data intelligence and media platform&#8221; under the new brand Forkast Labs. However, the crypto news site seems to have ceased publishing articles and video content last month, with the latest article dated November 22. </p>
<p>“Forkast.News is now Forkast Labs,” the website currently says.</p>
<p>“The majority of editorial operations have been incorporated into Forkast Labs as a result of the merger between Forkast and CryptoSlam earlier this year,” according to an internal memo the company shared with its staff last month. “There will be an increased focus on the data side going forward.”</p>
<p>According to its website, Forkast Labs is focused on exploring new frontiers in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-web3-gaming-investment-arena-overcorrecting-possibly-wax-exec-says.htm">Web3</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptopunks-and-bored-apes-dip-as-nft-500-index-falls-despite-crypto-rally.htm">NFTs</a>, and the metaverse. Back in March, the company unveiled a suite of indices, including the Forkast 500 NFT Index, showcasing its commitment to staying at the forefront of digital trends. It also formed a partnership with The Sandbox, signaling its entrance into the world of metaverse indexing. </p>
<p>CryptoSlam, a non-fungible token data tracker, was established in 2018 and secured $9 million in funding in January 2022, with Animoca Brands leading the investment round. The merger between CryptoSlam and Forkast.News was orchestrated by Yat Siu, founder and executive chairman of Animoca, as reported by Bloomberg in January. Forkast.News is also part of the Animoca portfolio. </p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Forekast.News previously <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/19/2232082/0/en/Forkast-Ltd-raises-1-7-million-seed-round-to-expand-global-coverage.html">raised a $1.7 million seed round</a> in 2021. </p>
<p>CoinDesk, another crypto news outlet, underwent significant restructuring by laying off 45% of its editorial staff in August. Subsequently, it was sold to Bullish, a crypto exchange led by former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley, in an all-cash deal last month.</p>

<p>The Central Bank of Solomon Islands has revealed a partnership with Japanese blockchain Soramitsu to launch a proof-of-concept for a CBDC named Bokolo Cash. </p>
<p>In a Keynote <a href="https://www.cbsi.com.sb/keynote-address-of-the-prime-minister-at-the-launching-of-the-proof-of-concept-central-bank-digital-currency-bokolo-cash/">speech</a> on Tuesday, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said his country was embarking on the CBDC journey with the goal of leveraging technology as “a catalyst for inclusive and sustainable development, ultimately fostering shared prosperity across our beautiful nation.”</p>
<p>Bokolo Cash will be equivalent to one Solomon Islands dollar, and citizens will be able to use it for transactions in retail environments within the capital city of the island nation, Honiara, as well as for person-to-person transfers.</p>
<p>Commercial banks will test wholesale transfers, along with simulated cross-border payments and remittances. Additionally, users will be subjected to a “two-tier” Know Your Customer verification process, according to Soramitsu.</p>
<p>Bokolo Cash is set to run on a specifically tailored blockchain built on Hyperledger’s Iroha, while will also integrate with Soramitsu’s public Sora blockchain. Through this connectivity, users will have the ability to conduct transfers using QR codes and leverage the self-custody Fearless Wallet, a product developed by Soramitsu.</p>
<p>While the project started in early November, the official announcement was only unveiled earlier this week. The pivotal legislative step, the CBSI Amendment Act 2023, necessary to empower the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands to issue the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/canadians-support-cash-payments-over-cbdcs-report.htm">CBDC</a>, was successfully enacted on November 3rd.</p>
<p>“By embracing digital currency, we position our nation at the forefront of the global technological landscape,” Sogavare continued in his speech. “The CBDC Pilot Project signifies our commitment to embracing the future, capitalizing on the efficiency, transparency, and security that digital currency offers.”</p>
<p>The Solomon Islands, comprising over 900 islands to the west of Papua New Guinea with a population of approximately 700,000, is now part of a growing trend among island nations exploring <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/project-tourbillon-cbdcs-can-meet-privacy-requirements-bis-research-reveals.htm">CBDC</a>. Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Mauritius have previously experimented with CBDC. Notably, the Eastern Caribbean countries have already embraced an official <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-apex-banks-jump-on-e-cny-pilot-trial-program-the-rise-of-global-cbdc-issuance.htm">CBDC</a> known as DCash.</p>

<p>A memecoin minted shortly after billionaire <a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=137427&amp;action=edit">Charlie Munger’s death</a> experienced a staggering surge of over 31000% on Wednesday, but lost more than 98% of its value the next day. </p>
<p>As news broke of the Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman’s death, the MUNGER memecoin rose more than 31000% as investors quickly ran to decentralized exchanges with millions of dollars worth of Ether and stablecoins.</p>
<p>Daily trading volume for MUNGER peaked at $3.5 million on Wednesday, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0x7993868ef2c6f8b4e7e01c933e096db555f67ac6/#TradeHistory">CoinMarketCap.</a></p>
<p>However, the token suffered a substantial decline of over 98% in value on Thursday following revelations about the token’s smart contract which was revealed to contain erroneous functions, enabling developers to impose restrictions on the sale of the asset.</p>
<p>The smart contract included a blacklist function and authorization that could potentially manipulate users into approving a malicious smart contract, according to <a href="https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0x7993868ef2c6f8b4e7e01c933e096db555f67ac6">GeckoTerminal.</a></p>
<p>Daily trading for MUNGER now sits at less than $40,000 at time of writing, with the token now worth $0.00000003039.</p>
<p>Often referred to by Warren Buffett as his closest partner and right-hand man, Munger was a steadfast skeptic of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bitcoin-dips-nearly-1-eyes-etfs-mungers-critique-in-market-rally.htm">Bitcoin</a> and cryptocurrencies in general. He once described Bitcoin as “detestable.”</p>
<p>“I’m not proud of my country for allowing this crypto s***,” Munger said earlier this year. “It’s worthless, it’s no good.”</p>
<p>Munger’s reasons for his dislike of Bitcoin were based on its volatility and the lack of established regulatory frameworks. He also previously expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s potential facilitation of criminal activities, including drug dealing, terror funding, kidnapping, and extortion.</p>
<p>“I don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth, nor do I like just shuffling out of your extra billions of billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air,” he once said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of memecoins are created daily, and they have a rich and storied history of capitalizing on breaking news to pump highly speculative tokens of questionable origin. Last week, a newly minted CZ token, spawned right after Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s resignation as Binance&#8217;s CEO, experienced an 18,000% surge.</p>
<p>However, the rapid rises also come with significant risks. Memecoins such as MUNGER are frequently subjected to “rug-pulling” by their anonymous creators, who withdraw liquidity, leaving investors with substantial losses.</p>

<p>A federal judge has accepted confidential materials from Jump Crypto Holdings in discovery as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Terraform Labs.</p>
<p>In a Nov. 28 filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge Jed Rakoff <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150.135.0.pdf">sanctioned</a> the confidential treatment of specific materials generated by Jump Crypto Holdings, the cryptocurrency division of Jump Trading.</p>
<p>“The Court retains discretion to make public any confidential materials in connection with future motion practice or trial,” the filing read. “If such disclosure is contemplated, the Court will provide prior notice to counsel for Jump so that counsel may be heard on any objections.”</p>
<p>Jump Trading had <a href="https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1722296209971241250">reportedly</a> come under investigation by the SEC for its purported role in the events that triggered the depegging of TerraUSD (UST) and the subsequent decline of the Terra ecosystem, a major catalyst for the crypto market downturn of 2022.</p>
<p>Prior to the collapse of Terraform Labs, Jump Crypto had a notable role in the company&#8217;s ecosystem, engaging in funding rounds with the goal of creating a reserve for Terra&#8217;s stablecoin, UST. </p>
<p>However, in May, investors filed a lawsuit against Jump Trading, accusing the firm and its CEO, Kanav Kariya, of manipulating the price of UST to secure approximately $1.3 billion in profits.</p>
<p>According to the SEC, Terraform Labs loaned Jump 30 million Terra tokens in November 2019 and an additional 65 million <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-lunc-jumps-28-50-whats-driving-the-surge.htm">LUNA</a> in September 2020. </p>
<p>Terra claimed that the &#8220;loans&#8221; were intended to enhance liquidity; however, the SEC asserted that the trading firm was consistently selling LUNA into the market.</p>
<p>In February this year, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gary-gensler-remains-tight-lipped-on-future-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">SEC</a> filed charges against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon, alleging their involvement in a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. The case is still ongoing, with both the SEC and Terraform Labs submitting motions for summary judgment in October. Jury selection is scheduled to begin next year on January 29 in New York, should the case proceed to trial.</p>
<p>Montenegro authorities <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-founder-do-kwons-extradition-approved-by-montenegrin-court-heres-the-latest.htm">arrested Kwon in June</a> for using forged travel documents, leading to a four-month prison sentence. On November 24, a Montenegrin court granted approval for Kwon’s extradition, pending the Minister of Justice’s approval. He could be extradited to either the United States or South Korea to face the charges.</p>
<p>In addition to the SEC&#8217;s civil suit, Do Kwon is also facing criminal charges in the United States regarding the collapse of the Terraform ecosystem.</p>

<p>Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said he would not “pre-judge” the future of spot Bitcoin ETFs when asked if the SEC would take any action soon regarding the matter. </p>
<p>Speaking at a conference hosted by the Healthy Markets Association on Wednesday, Gensler reiterated his position that Bitcoin is a commodity, while also continuing to express apprehension about the overall state of the crypto industry.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like common sense versus the hyperbole in this field,” Gensler said. “This is a field that is rife with bad actors and rife with fraud and manipulation and money laundering.”</p>
<p>Several asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have been waiting patiently for the SEC to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The companies have filed multiple applications over the past few months, but have all faced delays so far. </p>
<p>When asked about Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam’s remarks regarding the necessity of additional authority for the derivatives regulator to supervise crypto, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-executive-flags-gary-genslers-speech-highlights-secs-shortcomings.htm">Gensler</a> conveyed his support for granting the CFTC increased authority, particularly surrounding bitcoin.</p>
<p>Gensler has previously called the agency’s review method a “time-tested process.”</p>
<p>“When an asset manager is seeking to take something public, these exchange traded products need to register with the SEC, and they go through a filing, somewhat similar to going public, like an IPO,” Gensler said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV2-UJWwMiE">Bloomberg TV</a> last month.</p>
<p>“And so it’s really the work of our Division of Corporation Finance that gives feedback, our Division of Trading and Markets of course looks at the filings,” he continued. “This is a time tested process that goes back decades. The staff of the SEC, it’s called the Disclosure Review Team, but in that group, they respond and give feedback to potential issuers.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the SEC engaged in new discussions with delegates from Invesco and BlackRock to explore possible strategies for addressing concerns related to &#8220;balance sheet impacts and risks.&#8221; The SEC had also convened meetings with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-keeps-quiet-on-bitcoin-etf-plans-after-grayscale-ruling-heres-the-latest.htm">Grayscale</a> and BlackRock last week, as outlined in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-301179-767742.pdf">memo</a> released by the regulatory agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gary-gensler-crypto-frauds-extend-beyond-a-single-case.htm">Gensler</a>, a former chair of the CFTC, has previously asserted that numerous cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. </p>
<p>During the conference, he also referenced a prior speech in which he likened the lack of compliance in the crypto industry to the conditions of the 1920s, a period before the implementation of federal securities laws.</p>
<p>“That was being kind,” he remarked on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Decentralized crypto exchanges Velodrome and Aerodrome have warned users about a front-end security breach on their websites.</p>
<p>In X posts published on Wednesday, Velodrome and Aerodrome warned users against interacting with their websites until further notice.</p>
<p>“Our frontend is currently compromised,” the Velodrome team wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1729771762752135463">X</a>. “Please do not interact with Velodrome for the time being. The team are investigating and will communicate more here when we have it.”</p>
<p>The same warning was posted on Aerodrome’s X account.</p>
<p>The security breach seems to involve a domain name system (DNS) attack targeting the Aerodrome and Velodrome’s official websites. DNS is a widely utilized protocol crucial for the functioning of websites. </p>
<p>In DNS attacks, hackers seize control of a site and redirect users to a phishing site linked to a malicious contract, with the intention of illicitly acquiring users&#8217; funds.</p>
<p>On-chain analyst ZachXBT identified two specific addresses that funds from Aerodrome and Velodrome were being sent to, providing a glimpse into the amount of damage the hackers caused. At time of writing, a combined $70,000 worth of crypto assets have been drained into these two addresses.</p>
<p>“Looks like stolen funds are going to these two addresses: 0x02BA13f39D7df9C3F7592257b636eD6C7CC4ae78 [and] 0xf64fCEdFCe714Bbe835761e54D7067f2f8231443,” ZachXBT <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1729777066780815540">wrote</a> on X. </p>
<p>Aerodrome provided an alternate solution, asking its users to only access Aerodrome from its decentralized frontend.</p>
<p>“Please ensure you are accessing Aerodrome only from our decentralized frontend at <a href="http://aero.drome.eth.limo">http://aero.drome.eth.limo</a>,” Aerodrome <a href="https://twitter.com/aerodromefi/status/1729795692577624465">posted</a> on X, while also noting that “protocol funds are safe and contracts are unaffected.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/velodrome-introduce-aerodrome-dex-coinbases-base-network.htm">Velodrome</a> is the second-largest decentralized exchange protocol on the OP Mainnet (previously Optimism) based on total value locked and revenue. The company currently boasts over $139 million in total locked value.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aerodrome is the largest protocol on Base in terms of total value locked (TVL), holding over $63 million in funds.</p>
<p>Last month, Web3 credentials and rewards platform Galxe <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-credentials-platform-galxe-refund-396000-affected-users-post-dns-attack-heres-latest.htm">announced</a> its intention to refund over $396,000 to more than 980 users who were impacted by a significant DNS attack.</p>
<p>The project has also pledged to supplement the refunded amount by an additional 10% as a gesture of goodwill, as outlined in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTfVZefCJZf4d2ZPdmXfqhD_dg69ARiD3T5zuVje-5xwhx6Q4DSAVv6rCMyXvQ02SvVIjwhD4kX3VN4/pubhtml">shared document</a>.</p>

<p>The company said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paxos-receives-in-principle-approvals-from-the-financial-services-regulatory-authority-to-issue-stablecoins-and-conduct-digital-asset-services-from-the-abu-dhabi-global-market-302000692.html">press release</a> published on Wednesday that the approvals would allow Paxos to issue stablecoins and provide cryptocurrency brokerage and custody services.</p>
<p>The in-principle approvals granted to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/deloitte-paxos-share-insights-on-stablecoins-and-financial-innovation-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Paxos</a> are specifically for two new entities established within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). </p>
<p>“Today’s announcement marks yet another milestone in Paxos’ ability to provide billions of users with safe and trusted digital asset services,” said Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos. “Our IPAs from the FSRA, on the heels of our IPA from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, solidify our commitment to pursuing international growth through regulated frameworks. Paxos is unique in the industry for this approach and we will continue expanding our regulatory licensing to serve global enterprises as a trusted, innovative partner.”</p>
<p>The company added that expanding to Abu Dhabi would solidify its position as the “most comprehensively regulated blockchain platform in the world,” adhering to the highest operating standards in New York, Singapore and the ADGM.</p>
<p>A Paxos spokesperson told <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/265174/paxos-stablecoin-abu-dhabi-expansion">The Block</a> that the full approvals are expected in the first half of next year, and will empower the company to launch new stablecoins backed by USD and other currencies from Abu Dhabi. However, Paxos is presently concentrating on the introduction of a new stablecoin backed by USD.</p>
<p>Paxos’ expansion into Abu Dhabi follows closely on the heels of receiving in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for its new local entity, which is set to introduce a USD-backed stablecoin in Singapore.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://paxos.com/2023/11/16/paxos-receives-in-principle-approval-from-mas-for-new-entity-that-will-issue-usd-backed-stablecoin-in-singapore/">statement</a> released on November 15, Paxos announced that it had <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-issuer-paxos-receives-preliminary-nod-from-singapore-regulator.htm">obtained preliminary approval from the MAS</a> for its newly established entity, Paxos Digital Singapore Pte. Ltd.</p>
<p>Similar to its Singaporean counterpart, the Paxos unit in ADGM will help the establishment of partnerships akin to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptocom-paypal-paxos-partner-for-paypal-usd-integration-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">PayPal</a> in the U.S., according to The Block’s spokesperson. It will also have the capability to onboard customers based in Abu Dhabi for its crypto brokerage and custody services.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Paxos boasts support from prominent investors such as Bank of America, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and Coinbase Ventures. With over $540 million in total funding to date, the company achieved a valuation of $2.4 billion in its latest Series D funding round in 2021.</p>

<p>DOGE-1, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-adoption-grows-to-5-million-wallet-addresses-can-doge-reach-10.htm">Dogecoin</a>-funded SpaceX moon mission, has received a key regulatory approval from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. </p>
<p>The approval is one of the precursors to the final Federal Communications Commission license, which the mission is still yet to receive.</p>
<p>The project was first unveiled in May 2021, with space technology firm Geometric Energy Corporation currently in the process of developing the DOGE-1 satellite. This satellite is scheduled to be deployed into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>In an X <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelReidGEC/status/1729650317191422051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1729650317191422051%7Ctwgr%5Eedbf28f2d0d3a8ae82740becbab1bad51ada19c0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Ftech%2F2023%2F11%2F29%2Fdogecoin-funded-spacex-doge-1-moon-mission-gets-a-step-closer-to-launch%2F">post</a> published on Tuesday, Samuel Reid, CEO of Geometric Energy Corporation, confirmed that DOGE-1 had received approval for DOGE-1 X-Band, but was still waiting on other approvals.</p>
<p>“The National Telecommunications and Information Administration approved DOGE-1 X-Band (0083-EX-CN-2022 on <a href="http://ntia.doc.gov/">http://ntia.doc.gov</a>),” Reid said in his post. “We have yet to get the FCC license grant which will address X-Band and S-Band.”</p>
<p>The DOGE-1 satellite will feature a miniature screen designed to showcase advertisements, images, and logos, with the content being broadcast to Earth. Notably, the launch of DOGE-1 will mark the first instance of a satellite being entirely funded using <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hollywood-meets-crypto-director-uses-netflix-funds-for-risky-dogecoin-bet.htm">DOGE</a> tokens.</p>
<p>The launch of DOGE-1 was initially <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1391523807148527620">announced</a> in May 2021 by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who disclosed that the satellite would be part of a rideshare collaboration aboard a rocket launched jointly by Intuitive Machines and NASA.</p>
<p>The planned launch of DOGE-1 has faced repeated delays attributed to Intuitive Machines&#8217; launch provider, SpaceX. Consequently, the originally scheduled launch for 2022 has been postponed, with the current target set for January 2024.</p>
<p>DOGE-1 isn’t the only Dogecoin-related moon mission currently in the works.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Dogecoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/astrobotic-to-send-physical-dogecoin-to-the-moon-in-2024.htm">announced</a> plans to send a physical Dogecoin to the Moon next year in collaboration with space robotics firm Astrobotic Technology.</p>
<p>The upcoming Peregrine Mission One (PM1) by Astrobotic is poised to ferry 21 payloads, featuring cargo contributed by various entities including governments, companies, universities, and NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.</p>
<p>As a part of the PM1 mission, the rocket is slated to carry a physical Bitcoin token sponsored by crypto exchange BitMEX. Additionally, it will transport a replica of the Genesis Block, commissioned by Bitcoin Magazine, symbolizing the first block of Bitcoin ever mined. </p>

<p>Chainlink has enhanced its native staking mechanism through the introduction of Chainlink Staking v0.2, featuring an increased pool size of 45 million.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainlink-staking-v0-2-is-now-live-301999507.html">press release</a> on Tuesday, the initiation of the v0.2 upgrade will commence with a nine-day Priority Migration phase for current v0.1 stakers.</p>
<p>During this period, users will have the opportunity to transfer their staked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chainlink-price-prediction-as-link-surges-16-6-in-two-weeks-can-link-reach-100.htm">LINK</a> and associated rewards to v0.2. The access is set to gradually broaden, with Early Access scheduled for December 7 and General Access on December 11.</p>
<p>With the staking pool size elevated to 45 million LINK, equivalent to 8% of the existing circulating supply, the decentralized computing protocol aims to attract a broader range of LINK token holders. </p>
<p>“Because we are seeing a consistent increase in the amount of value secured by and paid for over the Chainlink Network, it’s increasingly important to improve the cryptoeconomic security of the network,” said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. “Staking v0.2 introduces important new security features and sets the system up for even further growth in the year to come.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/white-hat-hackers-awarded-300k-after-uncovering-critical-chainlink-vrf-vulnerability.htm">Chainlink</a> plays a pivotal role in supplying blockchain applications with external real-world data as the most widely used oracle network in the crypto space. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vodafone-and-chainlink-collaborate-on-blockchain-enabled-proof-of-concept-for-global-trade.htm">Chainlink</a> first introduced staking in December, enhancing the token’s utility and allowing LINK holders to support the performance of oracle services. Initially, staking was limited to securing the Ethereum ETH/USD price feed, with a capped pool of 25 million LINK tokens.</p>
<p>Chainlink Staking v0.2 was created with the intention of introducing a more versatile unbonding mechanism, enabling stakers to withdraw their staked tokens with increased efficiency. The upgrade also brings improved security guarantees to the staking process. The modular architecture of Chainlink Staking v0.2 is designed for enhanced adaptability, simplifying the integration of future upgrades and improvements into the system.</p>
<p>Chainlink Staking v0.2 will also incorporate “dynamic rewards mechanisms that can seamlessly support new sources of rewards in the future,” the team said.</p>
<p>Once the Priority Migration period concludes on December 7, 2023, at 12 PM ET, LINK token holders who meet at least one predefined criterion on the updated Early Access Eligibility List will be eligible to stake up to 15,000 LINK in v0.2, assuming the v0.2 pool capacity has not been reached.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of Early Access on December 11, 2023, at 12 PM ET, the v0.2 staking pool will become available for General Access. During this phase, anyone will have the opportunity to stake up to 15,000 LINK, contingent upon the v0.2 pool not reaching its maximum capacity.</p>

<p>In particular, the company intends to support TON Play, a gaming infrastructure initiative built upon the TON blockchain. This framework enables the development of gaming applications on TON, facilitating their launch on the messaging app Telegram. Additionally, it provides the capability to seamlessly transfer existing web-based games to the messaging application.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.jito.network/blog/announcing-jto-the-jito-governance-token/">statement</a> released on Monday, the company disclosed plans to create 1 billion JTO tokens to facilitate the governance of its Jito Network. This includes tasks such as establishing fees for the JitoSOL staking pool, overseeing revenue, and managing the DAO treasury.</p>
<p>Initially, 115 million JTO tokens will be in circulation. The allocation plan designates 34% of the tokens for community growth, 25% for ecosystem development, 24.5% for core contributors, and 16% for investors.</p>
<p>With the launch of JTO tokens, Jito Foundation seeks to empower “community members to have a direct impact on the decision-making and direction of the Jito Network,” the organization said.</p>
<p>As part of the Jito Foundation, Jito Labs constructs infrastructure aimed at alleviating the adverse effects of maximum extractable value on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-gains-6-65-in-third-week-of-november-will-the-bullish-momentum-continue.htm">Solana</a>.</p>
<p>Solana Foundation said last month that <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/254589/solana-foundation-says-nearly-a-third-of-stake-running-through-jito-labs-client">nearly a third</a> of its stake is running through the Jito Labs client, while the Jito Foundation revealed in its announcement that the Jito MEV network of validators is currently being utilized by over 40% of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-shows-remarkable-performance-but-attention-turns-to-a-rising-newcomer.htm">Solana</a> network&#8217;s stake weight.</p>
<p>10% of the tokens will be distributed as an airdrop to Jito community members, the Jito Foundation added, acknowledging its members’ contributions to bootstrapping the network and ensuring their participation in governance right from the outset.</p>
<p>The Foundation is overseen by two independent Directors, Matt Shaw and Glenn Kennedy, and a supervisor provided by FFP Corporate Services. Webslinger, an advisory firm specializing in prominent crypto projects, will serve as the DAO administrator.</p>
<p>Token holders will wield ultimate control over the Foundation, possessing the authority to remove both the supervisor and the two independent directors. Jito noted that its Foundation would release regular transparency reports to keep stakeholders informed.</p>
<p>Jito Foundation will be governed by its Constitution, Bylaws and Articles of Association and Memorandum of Association, with the company promising to provide further detail when possible.</p>
<p>Jito Labs investors include Solana Ventures and Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko. Last year, the company <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jito-labs-raises-usd-10m-from-multicoin-capital-framework-ventures-build-performant-mev-infrastructure-for-solana.htm">raised $10 million</a> in a Series A funding round led by Multicoin Capital and Framework Ventures, with other investors including Alameda Research, Solana Ventures, Delphi Digital and Robot Ventures.</p>

<p>The decentralized exchange protocol recovered the funds following a security attack last week.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-exploited-in-46-million-attack-due-to-infinite-money-glitch.htm">initial attack</a> last week, KyberSwap said that it had lost a total of $47 million from its concentrating liquidity pools.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a portion of the funds recovery was successfully achieved through negotiations with the operators of front-running bots. Approximately $5.7 million in cryptocurrency, extracted from KyberSwap pools on the Polygon and Avalanche networks during the hack, has been reclaimed, the exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1728800315955437743">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>Under the negotiated agreement, the operators of the bots committed to returning 90% of the embezzled funds to a designated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-announces-first-ever-arb-token-liquidity-pools-liquidity-mining-trading-campaigns-arbitrum.htm">KyberSwap</a> address on the Polygon network. As an incentive, a 10% bounty was offered to the operators for their cooperation in the recovery process, meaning KyberSwap will recover $4.67 million in total. </p>
<p>According to KyberSwap’s update, the recovered funds include 361.92 axl-wstETH ($870.5k), 441.8 WETH ($919k), 261.5 wstETH (~$624k), 711,430.9 WMATIC (~$547.8k), 443,011.6 USDT (~$443k), 385,630.7 USDC (~$385.6k), and 65,130 USDT (~$65.1k).</p>
<p>The hacker specifically targeted KyberSwap’s Elastic pools, affecting funds across various blockchains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<p>This negotiation stands apart from discussions with the primary event&#8217;s hacker, who had previously expressed a willingness to engage in talks. Although the team had proposed a white hat bounty, it appears that progress in those negotiations has not been achieved thus far.</p>
<p>The hacker exploited a vulnerability associated with the tick interval boundaries in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/proof-of-trust-btcx-consider-ipos-kyberswap-leaves-malta-mor-5554.htm">KyberSwap’s</a> concentrated liquidity pools. The hackers used the vulnerability to artificially double the liquidity and drain the pools of their assets.</p>
<p>After this initial recovery of funds, KyberSwap reassured its users that it would continue to do anything possible to retrieve the rest of the stolen money. </p>
<p>“Following this recovery of users’ funds from the frontrun bots, we will continue to support law enforcement and cybersecurity on track down and recovery of users’ funds from the perpetrator of the exploit attack,” KyberSwap said. </p>

<p>Police in Hong Kong have begun investigating the crypto trading platform after more than 130 people said they had been scammed. </p>
<p>South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3242822/hong-kong-police-vow-make-arrests-after-hounax-virtual-asset-trading-platform-allegedly-tricks-131">reported</a> on Saturday that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kongs-victory-securities-to-offer-digital-asset-services-in-retail-markets.htm">Hong Kong</a> authorities had vowed to make arrests soon in light of reports of over $15.4 million being stolen on Hounax.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Securities and Futures Commission had listed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-banxa-and-cardanos-yoroi-wallet-enable-in-app-fiat-on-off-ramping-bybit-reveals-personality-based-trading-nft-usdt-competition.htm">Hounax</a> as a suspicious crypto trading platform after it was found to have lied about its ties with a financial institution and a venture capital firm.</p>
<p>“The scammer impersonated investment experts and lured people to invest in virtual currencies through a virtual asset trading platform with promises of high returns,” said Chan Wai-kei, superintendent of the force’s commercial crime bureau. “But when the investors went to withdraw the money, they were unable to do so.”</p>
<p>Chan said that the police had received 88 reports from 131 individuals who alleged losses totaling $15.4 million. The age range of the victims was from 19 to 78, with the largest reported loss of $1.54 million belonging to a 69-year-old retired woman.</p>
<p>The platform, which claimed to be Singaporean-ran, had commenced operations earlier this year and seemed to focus on Hong Kong investors, according to Chan. However, he clarified that the police did not uncover any connections between Hounax and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpex-scandal-wont-deter-hong-kongs-web3-market-development-says-treasury-secretary.htm">JPEX crypto exchange scandal</a>, which impacted over 2,500 individuals and resulted in losses exceeding $192 million. </p>
<p>Chief Inspector Or Wing-yan disclosed that the alleged Hounax scammers engaged individuals via social media and WhatsApp, luring them into group chats with “hot tips.” Victims were then prompted to download the company app through a hyperlink and transfer funds to a third-party account to boost their investment account.</p>
<p>Despite initially witnessing apparent returns, victims soon discovered that these gains were fictitious, and their transferred funds had been moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>“In the beginning, the victims would see quick returns in the investment account, but those were just meaningless numbers made up by the scammers to gain their trust,” Or said. “In fact, the moment they transferred the funds to the third-party account, the money was transferred away.</p>
<p>Withdrawal attempts were met with rejection or demands for an “verification” fee, reaching up to 80% of the initial funds, under the guise of complying with international anti-money laundering regulations.</p>
<p>Even after victims paid the fee, they found themselves unable to retrieve their money, as the “investment managers” vanished and victims were ousted from the group chats. None of the victims ever encountered the scammers in person, complicating the investigation.</p>
<p>Chan noted that arrests were imminent, and the police had requested telecom companies and social media platforms to block the website and associated accounts.</p>

<p>The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is showing no signs of letting up in its battle against crypto firms.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/romerostatement112123">statement</a> published on Tuesday regarding the resolution of the Binance case, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cftc-chairman-u-s-regulators-lack-authority-to-prevent-another-major-crypto-collapse.htm">CFTC</a> Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero declared, “There are no pirate ships in US markets. Access to US customers is a privilege, not a right.”</p>
<p>Romero added that the CFTC’s case against former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and the crypto exchange was just the beginning, and that her Commission would continue to “aggressively go after crypto platforms operating in U.S. markets that seek to evade the CFTC’s customer protection regime.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Zhao agreed to pay $50 million in fines after pleading guilty to violating money laundering rules. Binance, the crypto exchange he co-founded in July 2017, was hit with a $4.3 billion fine for noncompliance and money laundering offenses – the largest fine in crypto history.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cftc-states-50-of-reported-cases-involved-crypto-in-released-enforcement-results.htm">CFTC</a> is set to receive a share of the settlement as Binance permitted US customers to engage in trading unregistered cryptocurrency derivatives.</p>
<p>Romero noted that Binance was aware that its platform facilitated illegal activities by terrorist organizations such as Hamas and darknet marketplaces such as Hydra.</p>
<p>“Instead of shutting down this criminal activity financing, Binance turned a blind eye and even advised users how to circumvent Binance’s superficial controls,” Romero added.</p>
<p>Romero also stated that there would be no tolerance for using VPNs to mask internet addresses or circumvent know-your-customer rules, emphasizing a strict approach as crypto regulations tighten.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement112123b">statement</a>, CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham said that the agency’s jurisdiction has no borders.</p>
<p>“It should be crystal clear that the CFTC will not stop in its pursuit of non-U.S. entities,” she said.</p>
<p>Pham noted that the case against Binance resulted in two first-ever legal precedents: the first alleged charge of evasion under CFTC Rule 1.6(a) for activities outside the United States relating to swaps, and the first alleged charges for individual liability against a chief compliance officer.</p>
<p>Sister agency the Securities and Exchange Commission has similarly pledged to intensify its efforts against crypto firms engaged in illegal activity, as evidenced by its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-faces-sec-charges-for-unlawful-crypto-trading-operations.htm">recent lawsuit</a> against the crypto exchange Kraken. The SEC is also currently embroiled in various ongoing legal disputes with Ripple, Coinbase, and Binance.</p>

<p>The email further informed the recipients that, within the next 48 hours, they could supposedly claim a guaranteed allocated amount of counterfeit NANSEN tokens. The scammers included a link in the email, intending to redirect users to a potentially compromised website.</p>
<p>Scammers are disseminating phishing emails through an email address seemingly registered on networkforgood.com, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/DeFiBuck/status/1727684272453251197?s=20">reports</a> on X. At the time of writing, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-sales-spike-to-129m-in-november-with-blur-leading-the-charge-nansen.htm">Nansen</a> has not issued any public statements on the situation.</p>
<p>Officer’s Notes recommends reporting any suspected phishing links to databases like chainabuse.com, cryptoscamdb.org, and phishtank.org, which could help diminish the success rates of such attacks.</p>
<p>Officer’s Notes also said that user data from a previous third-party database leak in September might have been used to target Nansen users.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/68-of-nansens-third-party-vendor-impacted-by-cyber-attack-what-happened-1.htm">Two months ago</a>, a Nansen third-party vendor suffered a security breach, impacting nearly 7% of the system’s users. Those affected by the breach reportedly had their email addresses and passwords exposed, and in several cases, their blockchain addresses were also compromised.</p>
<p>Immediately after, Nansen stated its commitment to identifying and notifying those affected by the breach, urging them to change their passwords. Nansen also reassured users that their wallet funds remained unaffected by the incident.</p>
<p>Crypto investors are experiencing a surge in phishing emails following the recent leakage of user data from platforms like friend.tech and TrueCoin.</p>
<p>Despite allegations of a database leak involving over 100,000 users, Friend.tech has refuted these claims. </p>
<p>“This is just someone scraping our public API that shows the association between public wallet addresses and public Twitter usernames,” friend.tech <a href="https://twitter.com/friendtech/status/1693641339395531072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1693641339395531072%7Ctwgr%5E831749da2043fea412bc3375e8e39303a3f2b854%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fnansen-phishing-emails-flood-crypto-investors-inbox">wrote</a> on X. “It&#8217;s like saying someone hacked you by looking at your public Twitter feed.”</p>

<p>InfStones, a crucial node operator affiliated with Lido Finance, is poised to temporarily remove its Ethereum validators from the liquid staking protocol.</p>
<p>In response to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/security-firm-dwallet-labs-uncovers-vulnerability-with-1-billion-of-crypto-at-risk.htm">substantial vulnerability</a> uncovered by security researchers at dWallet Labs, the operator plans to execute key rotations as a proactive security measure.</p>
<p>InfStones was informed of the vulnerability associated with the open-source library Tailon in July 2023, and the issue has been successfully addressed since then.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://0d.dwalletlabs.com/the-billion-dollar-exploit-collecting-validators-private-keys-via-web2-attacks-4a385a5bb70d">dWallet Labs</a>, a hacker exploiting this vulnerability would have had the capability to obtain the private keys of validators across various blockchain networks, potentially leading to losses equivalent to over $1 billion in cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-breaches-2000-resistance-time-to-buy.htm">Ether</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-records-uptick-following-reports-of-potential-4-billion-settlement-with-the-doj.htm">BNB</a>.</p>
<p>“Over one billion dollars of staked assets were staked on all of these validators, and such an attacker would have been able to gain full control of all of them,” the security firm said. </p>
<p>Lido, the largest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum, manages over 9.23 million Ether, boasting a market value surpassing <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/lido?denomination=ETH">$19 billion</a>. Lido protocol empowers users to deposit ETH and engage in network staking via validator nodes, with the validator nodes then issuing derivative tokens to users which serve as a representation of their staked deposits.</p>
<p>A cadre of contributors, referred to as operators, bears the responsibility of operating these ETH validator nodes. They furnish the essential IT infrastructure and servers indispensable for the seamless functioning of the nodes.</p>
<p>Lido Finance verified that the vulnerability was tied to potential root-level access, affecting 25 of InfStones’ validator servers. Luckily, the company also noted that there was no evidence of any key leakage or exploitation that arose from this issue.</p>
<p>“To clarify: There is currently no indication of key leakage or compromise, and the vulnerability may not affect validators related [to] the Lido protocol,” the company <a href="https://twitter.com/LidoFinance/status/1727326935708016981">said</a> in an X post on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In its security report, dWallet Labs asserted that the vulnerability had the potential to trigger a security breach affecting the ETH staked through InfStones&#8217; nodes on Lido. In response, the firm recommended the rotation of validator keys for all nodes that might have been exposed to this vulnerability.</p>
<p>InfStones has taken a proactive stance by agreeing to withdraw its validators and shift to new keys, according to Lido. The decision is now contingent upon government approval.</p>
<p>To ensure continuity and stability, the ether that was initially staked on the potentially affected validators is set to be redirected into the Lido protocol for re-staking.</p>

<p>“The crypto game feels a bit more fair today,” Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell said in an X <a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1727514704480989672">post</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the wake of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao stepping down as CEO and pleading guilty to criminal charges of money laundering, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm">Powell</a> held nothing back in his assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>“The last 12 months have answered 2 nagging questions from shareholders: 1. How are they going so fast? 2. How are they getting away with it?” Powell wrote. “It&#8217;s hard to keep faith while your market share dwindles and the only enforcement that&#8217;s happening is against the good guys.”</p>
<p>Powell added that Kraken is playing the long game, with shareholders who understand that patience will be needed during this uncertain time in crypto and indeed, for Kraken.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, we have very long-term oriented shareholders who understand that this holy mission is a marathon, and that we must lead by example,” Powell added.</p>
<p>On Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-237">charged</a> Kraken with operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.</p>
<p>The SEC had previously <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25637">charged</a> Kraken in February with the failure to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. Kraken’s parent firms settled the charges by coughing up $30 million in “disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.”</p>
<p>“Message is clear: $30m buys you about 10 months before the SEC comes around to extort you again,” Powell said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1726794688433369290">separate post</a> following the Monday lawsuit. “Lawyers can do a lot with $30m but the SEC knows that a real fight will likely cost $100m+, and valuable time. If you can&#8217;t afford it, get your crypto company out of the U.S. warzone.”</p>
<p>Self-policing is crucial as crypto companies “clearly cannot count on timely protection,” Powell continued. He asserted that Coinbase, Ripple, and Kraken would remain “easy targets” for the SEC, while claiming that “each dodgy operation represents an opportunity for governments to scapegoat crypto and tighten the noose.”</p>
<p>“Going after the most egregious offenders offshore would require effort. It&#8217;s not about protecting people,” he said. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/news/kraken-continues-to-fight-for-its-mission-and-crypto-innovation-in-the-united-states">blog post</a> published on Monday after the filing of the SEC’s lawsuit against Kraken, the company emphasized that the SEC’s assertion characterizing its products as investment contracts was “incorrect as a matter of law, false as a matter of fact, and disastrous as a matter of policy.”</p>
<p>“As most securities law experts know, there is not a single law on the books supporting this position,” Kraken noted. “The allegation is hollow; there is no such thing as an exchange, broker dealer, or clearing agency for investment contracts. The SEC is demanding compliance with a regime that doesn’t exist.”</p>

<p>Long-time partner Joseph Naggar, who was highly influential in GoldenTree Asset Management’s expansion into crypto investments, is set to leave the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/foresight-ventures-acquires-the-block-in-70-million-deal.htm">The Block</a> <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/264200/goldentree-partner-who-led-crypto-push-set-to-leave-firm">reported</a> on Wednesday that Naggar’s exit is set to leave <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/goldentree-asset-management-reveals-53-million-position-sushiswap.htm">GoldenTree’s crypto unit</a> in a period of uncertainty, with two anonymous sources quoted as being unsure as to whether the unit would still exist.</p>
<p>GoldenTree notified investors about Naggar’s forthcoming departure several weeks ago, as per one source. Both sources indicated that Naggar played a pivotal role in driving GoldenTree’s foray into the crypto space, helping the company make investments in numerous crypto startups.</p>
<p>GoldenTree is now exploring different options for the future of its crypto division, including the possibility of spinning it off, according to the same sources.</p>
<p>Naggar’s name is notably absent from a GoldenTree <a href="https://www.goldentree.com/people#executive">webpage</a> that lists members of the Executive Committee, a position to which he was appointed back in 2011.</p>
<p>GoldenTree is a prominent New York-based asset management company that manages a portfolio exceeding $51 billion in assets, according to its website. GoldenTree specializes in various credit opportunities, encompassing high yield bonds, leveraged loans, private credit, distressed debt, and more.</p>
<p>Naggar became a part of GoldenTree in 2007, assuming the role of partner and head of structured products. Prior to joining GoldenTree, he spent a decade at Morgan Stanley, where he held the position of managing director in the bank’s Global Principal Credit Group. </p>
<p>GoldenTree made its first investment into the crypto space in 2021, and has currently participated in 26 deals, according to data from The Block Research. The company’s crypto portfolio encompasses investments in various entities such as Ledn, Anchorage Digital, Stader Labs, Trust Machines, and Ondo Finance.</p>
<p>In a March 2022 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/goldentree-asset-management-hires-avi-felman-as-head-of-digital-asset-trading-301497098.html">announcement</a>, the firm announced that its partners had been individually involved in personal crypto investments for several years, and that the company saw “an attractive and increasing opportunity set that can be captured in GoldenTree’s opportunistic strategies.”</p>
<p>Naggar said at the time that the digital asset ecosystem was becoming “increasingly relevant” for institutional investors.</p>
<p>“Having invested personally in the asset class for years, there is an increasingly well-developed infrastructure as well as a growing continuum of opportunities that lend itself to active management,” Naggar said. “I am confident GoldenTree’s rigorous fundamental and relative value driven process, as well as our robust risk management infrastructure, will position the firm well to deliver differentiated returns in the asset class.”</p>
