<p>Digital asset investment products recorded $176 million in inflows last week extending the positive run to 10 consecutive weeks hitting huge numbers not recorded in years.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://a.storyblok.com/f/155294/x/babbfcada6/coinshares-digital-asset-fund-flows-04-12-23.pdf">CoinShares Digital Asset Weekly Fund Flow report</a> shows strong bullish sentiment from investors across multiple countries signaling another uphill run as the year winds up.</p>
<p>The $176 million total fund flow last week has pushed the value in the last 10 weeks above $1.76 billion, a figure not recorded since Oct 2021 after future-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) were rolled out in the United States.</p>
<p>2021 was also the year the market soared to record highs with Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) tapping an all-time higher above $64,000 and multiple altcoins making a rally on the back of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/institutional-investors-flock-to-bitcoin-pushing-inflows-past-1-billion-in-2023.htm">renewed institutional investment</a> in the market.</p>
<p>This year has seen a significant boost changing the tide from last year&#8217;s plunging figures caused largely by macroeconomic factors and internal market pressures. Top assets like BTC have posted a 100% growth this year as institutional investors rally around digital assets.</p>
<p>The ten weeks of consecutive inflows translate to 4% of the Assets Under Management (AUM) showing a rise in investment after months of struggles in a bear market.</p>
<p>AUM has now surged 107% this year and stands at $46.2 billion following an increase in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity but remains far off the all-time of $86.6 billion posted in 2021.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin records massive gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin led the gains as expected after investors sunk in $133 million further extending its good to another week despite short Bitcoin recording three weeks of outflows with $3.6 million in the last seven days.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">anticipation for a spot Bitcoin ETF</a> in the United States continues to drive growth around the market with more firms predicting an approval hangs in the horizon.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC trades for $41,570, a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 12% boost in the last seven days as bulls continue to apply pressure towards the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Ether lights altcoin path</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) recorded inflows of $31 million increasing its positive inflows to 5 weeks totaling $134 million after a slow start to the year. Multi-asset products Ripple (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a>) saw inflows of $2.3 million and $0.5 million respectively.</p>
<p>Solana (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">SOL</a>) continued its inflow in consecutive weeks although way behind Ethereum in terms of volume. The institutional investor favorite recorded inflows of $4.3 million and has recorded a year-to-date (YTD) gain of $143 million.</p>
<p>On the geographical front, Canada recorded the highest inflow of $79 million while Germany and the United States saw $56.9 million and $53.5 million. On the other side of the divide, Switzerland, Australia, and Sweden recorded outflows.</p>

<p>South Africa’s financial regulator, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) is set to review the applications of 36 cryptocurrency companies seeking operational licenses in the country this month.</p>
<p>According to a report <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cryptocurrency/517973-major-update-on-crypto-asset-service-provider-licensing-in-south-africa.html">published by local media sources</a>, the regulator will commence the review process this month after it received 138 license proposals from firms seeking to become crypto asset service providers (CASP).</p>
<p>The FSCA will use several guideline principles including market participation, consumer protection, and risk management to find eligible firms for the licenses.</p>
<p>According to the report, the body disclosed that it received 93 applications in October and 128 as of Nov 30 marking the final day of applications and opening up the record process.</p>
<p>Of the submitted applications, 19 were withdrawn as a result of a lack of experience and improper operational policies, procedures, and repeated factors.</p>
<h2>South Africa to focus on investor safety</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per the report, the government will look at the range of services provided by the companies, particularly the number, quality, and if they offer tools that support the general market like payment and custodial rails. Experts say this would increase safe investment in the country as its digital asset users grow.</p>
<p>The companies will be assessed by their level of internal regulation as Know-your-customer (KYC) requirements will be taken into consideration alongside conflicts of interest, disclosures, etc.</p>
<p>Cyber risk management to protect users will be looked into with credit counterparty risk management and complaint handling to avoid issues of consumer dissatisfaction and weakened investor confidence in the market.</p>
<p>All this is required as the local market grows in light of the recently released study by the regulator. The study shows a growth in monthly transaction volumes marking the highest point in the country with the total figure at ZAR8 billion.</p>

<h2>Other countries to emulate MiCA</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The digital asset market has faced multiple incidents of scams in recent years leading to increased regulatory pressure on the markets which many have argued for and against across crypto spaces.</p>
<p>The major incident that drove this push was the fall of the Terra Network and the subsequent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">implosion of FTX</a> occasioning billions of losses and swirling the regulatory hammer around stablecoin and virtual asset exchanges.</p>
<p>As African countries shape up their regulatory framework, experts including several blockchain associations have pointed to the European model; the Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-framework-signed-into-law-by-eu-officials.htm">MiCA</a>) as the guiding framework in terms of stakeholder collaboration and cross-country partnerships to create the landmark rules.</p>
<p>The body will determine the application of 76 licenses as follows; 36 crypto firm assessments will be released at the Licensing Executive meeting on Dec 12 while 22 firm applications will be on Feb 13 2024 at the licensing meeting.</p>

<p>A malicious actor has stolen over $2 million from Safe Wallet users in the past week through address poisoning theft raising the total victim count to 21. </p>
<p>Several blockchain security firms have tracked suspected activity from different transactions resulting in losses from Safe Wallet totaling $2 million.</p>
<p>On Dec 3 cryptocurrency scam detection platform, Sacm Sniffer <a href="https://twitter.com/realscamsniffer/status/1731236292166590507?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">wrote on X (formerly Twitter)</a> that about 20 wallets have lost $2.05 million last from address poisoning attacks adding that the same attacker was responsible for draining $5 million from 21 users in the last four months.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">about ~10 Safe wallets have lost $2.05 million to &quot;address poisoning&quot; attacks in the past week.</p>
<p>the same attacker has stolen $5 million from ~21 victims in the past four months so far. <a href="https://t.co/fu4kxaI3py">pic.twitter.com/fu4kxaI3py</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) <a href="https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1731236292166590507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Dune analytics also <a href="https://dune.com/scamsniffer/address-poisoning-attack">reported the development</a> from Scam Sniffer posting the affected wallets and time range of stolen assets with the source pointing to address poisoning.</p>
<p>Address poisoning is an old tactic deployed by bad actors to deceive users into <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/address-poisoning-crypto">sending assets to the wrong wallets</a>. It entails a hacker creating an almost similar address usually with the same start and end characters.</p>
<p>The scammer then proceeds to “poison” the transaction history by sending funds of almost similar amounts regularly to the destination wallet in a bid to make the victim copy the scammer&#8217;s wallet from the transaction history and send new funds to the address.</p>
<h2>Florence Finance saga </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last week, Scam Sniffer also reported another case of address poisoning involving a bad actor carting away <a href="https://drops.scamsniffer.io/post/multiple-safe-wallets-lose-2-million-to-address-poisoning-attacks/">$1.5 million worth of assets</a>. Florence Finance is reported to have the funds from Safe Wallet to the address that contaminated the transfer history.</p>
<p>In the calculated move, the malicious actor deployed a contaminated address generated by create2 before converting the address to DAI to prevent a freeze after taking hold of the asset.</p>
<p>This type of incident has occurred previously as Scam Sniffer reported that SlowMist shared a similar transaction involving create3 with asset losses of $1.66 million.</p>
<p>According to the blockchain security firm, the UI of the transaction history shows the last four digits of the wallet addresses are closely related leading to the victim copying the address. </p>
<p>It was also pointed out that a particular user was quite lucky as the wallet was seen to hold $10 million in total assets but only $400,000 was lost due to the address poisoning.</p>
<h2>Users to take extra caution to change the tide</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In recent years, there has been a surge in cryptocurrency scams causing millions of losses, weakened investor confidence, and more regulatory scrutiny. </p>
<p>While hackers deploy a range of tactics to drain virtual asset platforms, some incidents can be prevented or reduced by proper monitoring and added checks by the platform and users. </p>
<p>Platforms can send a reminder each time a transfer is made to a new wallet while users should rely on something other than transaction history and always carry out a cross-validation. </p>

<p>Popular Bitcoin (BTC) critic Alex De Vries says the asset uses about 16,000 liters of water which can fill a pool for each transaction on the network, a claim that has sparked diverse reactions. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-sustainability/fulltext/S2949-7906(23)00004-6">study released</a> on Nov 29, De Vries opined that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has a growing water footprint in addition to its already existing high energy usage. The claims have received several reactions including pushbacks by pro-BTC commentators and support from some analysts.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Due to growing international concerns around drinking water availability, it is crucial to understand the water footprint of Bitcoin mining and its potential impact. Siddik et al. estimate that Bitcoin mining was responsible for consuming 1,572.3 gigaliters (GL) of water in 2021.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the report, BTC&#8217;s water footprint has surged in recent years as adoption and mining activity continue to grow. The network recorded a surge of water usage by 166%  in 2021 compared to 2020 figures.</p>
<p>Notably, 2021 was essentially a bull market that saw the asset tap its all-time high boosting the overall ecosystem. While the water footprint in 2021 stood at 1,573.7 GL, it was a mere 591.2 GL the previous year.</p>
<p>The combination of cooling systems and indirect sources is the reason behind the huge numbers. However, the trend can be reversed by immersion cooling and moving to sources that do not require fresh water and an ultimate change in network software.</p>
<p>The report comes at a time when Bitcoin miners are already facing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uzbekistan-permits-only-legal-entities-mine-cryptocurrencies-using-solar-power.htm">headwinds from regulators</a> over its high energy usage compared to several countries. Authorities and climate activists continue to mount pressure on miners by issuing outright bans, resuming energy supply, and imposing taxes to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>In 2021, China banned digital asset mining activities citing climate concerns setting the time for other government sanctions. This year, Kazakhstan has reduced the supply of electricity to Bitcoin miners while the White House attempted to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/white-house-council-reignites-30-percent-tax-crypto-mining.htm">impose a 30% cryptocurrency mining tax.</a></p>
<h2>More regulations? Analysts are divided </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some Analysts have said the study might impact the industry negatively as tighter mining regulations would be imposed. However, others wrote it off calling the comparison unfair adding that he has always been a Bitcoin critic. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why the <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BBCNews</a> article on Bitcoin and Water is a monument to journalistic laziness<a href="https://t.co/BRGRXzAeBW">https://t.co/BRGRXzAeBW</a></p>
<p>The day after the Independent publish the results of a high quality independent study on Bitcoin, the BBC publish the junk-science of a known anti-Bitcoin lobbyist using…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>His research platform previously published Bitcoin transactions comparing each to “<i>808,554 Visa transactions or 60,802 hours of watching YouTube.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This metric has been downplayed by the Cambridge University Center for Alternative Finance as they noted that, “<i>transaction throughput is independent of the network’s electricity consumption. Adding more mining equipment and thus increasing electricity consumption will have no impact on the number of processed transactions.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Similarly, Daniel Batten added that De Vries has a niche for making widely inaccurate statements about Bitcoin coupled with the fact that he is a staff of the Dutch central bank and a long-standing critic of the top cryptocurrency. </p>

<p>Celsius&#8217; Bitcoin (BTC) mining plans face obstacles as a United States judge hints at a possible new vote to clear deviations.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/celsius-network-faces-roadblocks-pivot-bitcoin-mining-2023-11-30/">Reuters report </a>on Nov 30, Celsius may require another creditor vote to change its business operations from a lending and staking enterprise to a digital asset mining model.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174911302380000000037.pdf">released plans to operate as a mining company</a> after the bankruptcy case to avoid regulatory scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amid other concerns.</p>
<p>US Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn who oversees the judicial process noted a deviation from the terms creditors voted on and what is being considered by the company.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>This is not the deal that the creditors voted on. The revised deal could face substantial opposition&#8221; from creditors.” </i></p></blockquote>
<p>The main issue in the agreement is a potential resistance from creditors which could take the process multiple steps backwards as the Judge urges the company to reach an agreement with the SEC.</p>
<p>Although the Commission didn’t expressly reject the company’s plan, Celsius stated that the financial regulator may be unwilling to approve a deal that includes staking and lending-related activities which it has opposed in the country citing improper registrations.</p>
<h2>Celsius pleads case</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The crypto lender argued through its attorney Chris Koenig at a court session on Thursday that there isn’t a need for another vote as this deal is good for all creditors because it affords the company the ability to pivot into a mining business.</p>
<p>The company might see this as a clear pathway towards a more sustainable future as mining operations may not come under further regulatory pressure by the SEC which has fined Kraken over its staking activities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kraken will pay $30 million to settle US SEC allegations that it broke securities rules with its crypto-asset staking products <a href="https://t.co/pNF6QeXm0k">https://t.co/pNF6QeXm0k</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Bloomberg (@business) <a href="https://twitter.com/business/status/1623786663418757121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Some analysts also argue that Bitcoin mining is currently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miners-daily-profits-top-44-million-reaches-highest-point-since-april-2022.htm">profitable at the moment</a> after several months in the woods with rising asset prices wiping out losses recorded last year. Miners remained underwater throughout last year with many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miners-daily-profits-top-44-million-reaches-highest-point-since-april-2022.htm">thinking outside the box</a> to stay afloat deploying measures including selling BTC reserves, pivoting to Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing, and selling assets.</p>
<p>Two customers expressed their dissent to the procedure asking for a full liquidation of the company.</p>
<p>Under the company’s former bankruptcy agreement, the new operation was expected to see $225 million in digital assets which would be managed by Fahrenheit. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/court-approves-celsius-networks-bankruptcy-exit-transition-to-bitcoin-miner.htm">new deal will give its creditors </a>a 67% recovery as opposed to 61.2% under the previous deal.</p>
<p>US Bitcoin Corp, a company in the consortium together with Arrington Capital will manage the company&#8217;s mining business going forward.</p>

<p>The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has partnered with the Algorand Foundation to launch a blockchain academy in a bid to train staff on the technology.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Algorand Impact Summit on Nov 30, Robert Pasicko, a UNDP expert announced the partnership to drive sustainable development as the agency performs its core functions including poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-nations-development-programme-partners-with-algorand-to-launch-a-blockchain-academy-302001081.html">press release</a>, the Algorand Foundation, the body responsible for the development of the Algorand network, will launch a blockchain academy in 2024 to equip over 22,000 UNDP employees globally with associated skills.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>The Algorand Blockchain Academy will launch in 2024 and is designed to bolster UNDP staff capacity through education and training in blockchain technology and its practical applications for sustainable development.”</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>DLT education for sustainable development</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The distributed ledger technology (DLT) education program will consist of lectures, assignments, and workshops tailored for employees across 170 countries.</p>
<p>Duro Unger-Lee the head of education at Algorand noted that the partnership with UNDP will drive innovation in many ways for the good of most communities.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>We see this education and tooling initiative as a critical first step toward identifying and delivering actionable, on-the-ground use-cases of blockchain to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in a number of areas.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Pasicko also added that blockchain technology will be used to address complex global challenges with workers acquiring the necessary skills.</p>
<p>“<i>We are thrilled to be in a position to leverage the credibility and expertise of the Algorand Foundation and key members of their ecosystem in order to upskill, empower, and inspire UN practitioners around the world,” </i>he added</p>
<h2>Blockchain to solve global problems</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Over the years, several international organizations have leveraged DLT to solve problems in diverse industries leading to wider research and adoption of the technology.</p>
<p>The recent Algorand and UNDP partnership highlights four cardinal issues; financial inclusion, supply chain transparency, real-world asset tokenization, and digital identity.</p>
<p>As the UNDP goes on its social welfare mission, people in disadvantaged rural areas need to be brought into fiscal planning and development to reverse the trend of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/blockchain-technology-future-of-latin-americas-financial-system.htm">unbanked population</a>.</p>

<p>Bringing financial services closer to every community will solve poverty in many ways as people will have the right incentives to create businesses to cater to people in border towns.</p>
<p>For more efficiency, supply chain transparency is needed to tackle production and distribution issues. From food production to pharmaceuticals, blockchain can automate the entire process, saving costs and expanding businesses.</p>
<p>There is also a recurring issue of fake and substandard products which can be solved by utilizing DLT from production to retail stores.</p>
<p>As big traditional finance firms move towards tokenization of assets, the United Nations and other international organizations look to bring the initiative to more countries as part of broader plans toward sustainability.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brazil-issue-digital-ids-for-its-214-million-citizens-using-blockchain-technology.htm">digital identities</a> will be created to ease agency operations in multiple countries.</p>

<p>The number of Canadian cryptocurrency users has dropped in 2023 due to bear market fears and wider macroeconomic factors, a new survey shows.</p>
<p>A Crypto Asset Survey <a href="https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-11/inv-research_20231129_crypto-asset-survey-2023.pdf">published by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC)</a> was conducted to show consumer interaction with virtual assets, investment experience, major drivers, and key market determinants.</p>
<p>According to the survey, Canadian ownership of digital assets fell from 13% in 2022 to 10% this year, signaling a poor trend some experts say was caused by plunging prices due to the bear market and tightening regulations.</p>
<h2>Virtual asset utility plummets among holders</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Participants hold the view that digital assets would not play a major role in sectors of the economy as was previously touted. Last year, 38% of the country believed that assets would be instrumental in the future of finance but presently only 26%.</p>
<p>Despite this, 34% of citizens believe the tide will turn in the future while 49% of users who held they believe in 2022. A shocking revelation by the survey in the declining interest of Canadians is that average ownership per user has increased.</p>
<p>This means that while the average number of users left the market, the remaining holders significantly increased their holdings as the mean market value surged to $82,992 this year from $52,975 in 2022.</p>
<p>Most notably, 77% of Canadian citizens regret being exposed to digital assets, a growth from 68% last year as the majority say their assets are not performing as they have anticipated.</p>
<p>In terms of exposure, over 50% of the country has a full grasp on the sector which often translates to increased adoption. A recent report by the Bank of Canada also shows that the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/CBDC/">CBDC</a>) project is not widely anticipated as users still prefer utilizing current payment options.</p>

<h2>Canadians point to the crypto winter</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The 2021 bull market led to a massive adoption across many jurisdictions as several assets climbed to new all-time highs and institutional investors showed a renewed stance in the market. The bull run led to many projections of users in traditional finance and increased decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers.</p>
<p>However, the following year was riddled with huge market crashes led by the Terra Network and subsequently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">FTX implosions which wiped billions</a> off the market cap.</p>
<p>These events led to lower investor confidence with several traders recording losses coupled with regulators clamping down on most sectors of the market.</p>
<p>As a result, the prices of top assets including Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) plummeted over 55%. This year has seen a major price uptick with several assets rebounding over 100% but most users are still in losses because they invested in 2021 amid high prices.</p>

<p>Antpool has announced steps to give back 83 Bitcoin (BTC) paid in error as a transaction fee to the user days after the incident. </p>
<p>Blockchain security firm, PeckShield <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshieldalert/status/1730160502951829681?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">posted an update from Antpool on X</a> (formerly Twitter) on the 83 BTC gas fee which sparked diverse reactions across cryptocurrency circles.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The mining pool stated that it would refund the fee demanding the affected user to contact them while fulfilling certain requirements to determine ownership of the asset.</p>
<p>“<i>Dear users, on November 23rd, some user submitted 83 BTC as gas fee. The risk control system of Antpool temporarily froze the fee when packaging the transaction. Please contact us before 00:00 (UTC+8) on December 10 2023 and verify personal identity in the following way. After verification, Antpool will refund the fee.” </i></p>
<p>According to the update, the steps to be followed include the preparation of a signing tool which could be Bitcoin Core or Electrum after which the affected user is expected to use the private key of the wallet to sign a message “Antpool” and then forward signed text to the customer support; <a href="mailto:support@antpool.com">support@antpool.com</a>. </p>
<h2>$3.1 million in transaction fees </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On Nov 23, the crypto ecosystem was hit with the news of a Bitvoiner who <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoiner-pays-3-1-million-transaction-fee-analysts-debate-possible-factors.htm">spent 83 BTC approximately $3.1 million</a> on transfer fees. The user was making a transfer of 139 BTC and parted away with 83 BTC leaving the recipient with 55.77 BTC. </p>
<p>Antpool mined the specific block and has now released new information on the return process. At the time the whole community and experts shared their opinion on the issue that led to one of the highest transaction fees.</p>
<p>Initial analysts pointed to the replace-by-fee feature which allows transactions in the mempool to be replaced by another for a higher fee. </p>
<p>Developer Mononaut posted on X that the affected may not have known that orders cannot be canceled and might have made those transactions with hopes of cancellation.</p>
<h2>Antpool follows precedents </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
When such mistakes occur, the mining pool usually refunds the user if possible although in some cases, the users were only able to recover 50% of assets. In September, Paxos paid a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/500000-bitcoin-fee-blunder-paxos-revealed-as-responsible-party.htm">$500,000 transaction fee</a> to move 2,000 worth of assets.</p>
<p>Days later, the miner who received the fee announced the return to the company although many users joked that the assets should be shared among the community. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was annoyed and regretted agreeing to refund that 20 BTC. Especially when I saw the person claiming it kept saying EST instead of EDT/UTC. Last time a Zcash guy did that, I blocked his entire company.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A user claimed to be the victim of the 83 BTC transfer fee claiming a hack resulted in the expensive gas fee. </p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>It was my BTC that paid the high fee. I created a new cold wallet, transferred 139BTC to it and it got transferred out to another wallet immediately. </i><i>I can only imagine that someone was running a script on that wallet and that the script had a weird fee calculation.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Canadians are less enthusiastic about a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) opting for traditional payment methods despite wider awareness, a new survey shows.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Forum-Research-Digital-Canadian-Dollar-Consultation-Report.pdf">Digital Canadian Dollar Public Consultation Report</a> published by the Bank of Canada highlighted the overall sentiments of consumers towards a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/CBDC/">CBDC</a> in light of recent blockchain activities and future payment initiatives.</p>
<p>Generally, Canadians do not embrace the technology,  as anticipated by pro-CBDC experts casting negative light on the current state of the technology.</p>
<p>According to the survey that took responses from 89,423 participants, 95% have heard about the CBDC or possess sufficient information on how the technology worked showing massive public awareness.</p>
<p>In most cases, massive public awareness of 95% is expected to trickle into a larger adoption but that might not be the case for a Canadian CBDC as consumers want other options.</p>
<h2>Participants want laws to protect cash as a payment option</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per the study, a large portion of participants prefer cash transactions and push for laws to mandate merchants to accept cash during transactions despite the growing popularity of digital payments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137929" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd.webp" alt="" width="1189" height="858" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd.webp 1189w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd-300x216.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd-1024x739.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd-768x554.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1189px) 100vw, 1189px" /></p>
<p>This sentiment has also been shared in the United Kingdom where the public consultation also revealed that users fear that digital payment systems may replace cash calling on authorities to protect the payment option.</p>
<p>However, financial authorities explained that a potential digital pound will not replace cash as a payment option but complement it as the jurisdiction seeks ways for faster and seamless cross-border settlements.</p>
<p>Over 82% of respondents said that the Bank of Canada should not research the capabilities of the CBDC as they chose their current payment methods. The respondents also noted that they didn’t expect the public survey to sway the bank’s drive toward the CBDC.</p>
<p>On the country’s cryptocurrency usage, 15% of the respondents hold digital assets with that demographic more open to support a state-backed digital currency.</p>
<p>Participants express their hope for widely accepted CBDC to benefit and lean towards privacy and security in the utility of the currency.</p>
<p>Consumers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/europes-data-agencies-express-concerns-over-privacy-standards-with-digital-euro.htm">flagging privacy concerns</a> has been the norm in recent weeks with users saying central banks should not gather additional details of their transactions in a bid to monitor their behaviour. Authorities have also dismissed this fear assuring users of anonymity.</p>
<h2>Mixed feelings for the future</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although the reports of the survey show low expectations, pro-CBDC experts view the technology as a potential game changer in finance with a wider reach to disadvantaged users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, opinion surveys suggest that the government will do more to educate on the utility of the technology and not just a replacement for private cryptocurrencies.  Canadian authorities have issued several regulations on the stablecoins and the larger crypto ecosystem citing investor protection concerns.</p>
<p>In August, a Bank of Canada <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sdp2023-15.pdf">report showed that citizens were not incentivized</a> to use a CBDC as the majority of the population had good access to financial services.</p>

<p>The Bank for International Settlement (BIS) has released the final report on Project Tourbillion, its privacy-inclined Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project.</p>
<p>A Nov 29 release shows a pathway to <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp80.pdf">achieving privacy standards</a> in CBDC deployment and usage with two prototypes; eCash 1.0 and eCash 2.0 alongside other features geared towards anonymity.</p>
<p>“<i>Project Tourbillon introduces a new privacy paradigm that balances user needs and public policy objectives: payer anonymity. For example, a consumer who pays a merchant using CBDCs does not disclose personal information to anyone, including the merchant, banks, and the central bank.”</i></p>
<p>The project highlights privacy, security, and scalability as key components in rolling out a new model <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/CBDC/">CBDC</a> to allay the fears of the public.</p>
<h2>Basic attributes dominate two models</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Payer anonymity is central to the project as it protects the payer&#8217;s data and limited information about the payee. While the payer remains protected, the identity of the merchant is revealed to the payer but remains only disclosed to the central bank.</p>
<p>The Central will not see personal payment data as it monitors circulation in the applied jurisdiction. The authors noted that the move seeks to create safe digital currency with regulatory clamping down on illicit transactions without jeopardizing user privacy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>A consumer paying a merchant with CBDCs is anonymous to all parties, including the merchant, banks, and the central bank.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This model also integrates security features to ensure confidentiality and prevent incidents of cyber threats while projecting scalability at all times.</p>
<p>Scalability remains pivotal in creating cross-border payment systems as they need to adjust to different mechanisms without endangering performance, especially in peak seasons characterized by huge transactions.</p>
<p>The first prototype eCash 1.0 aims at unconditional payment anonymity and when deposits are made to a merchant, the Central Bank adds it to a list of spent assets to prevent double-spending and counterfeit transactions.</p>
<p>eCash 2.0 model stores unspent notes onboarding more security features while leaning towards privacy. Despite this, there is a requirement for users to fulfill the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements at a chosen commercial bank to use the digital currency.</p>
<p>The bank remains responsible for the consumer data throughout the process as is the case with traditional finance models.</p>
<h2>Privacy fears continue in Europe</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/100000-south-koreans-will-start-using-cbdc-next-year.htm">rapid development of CBDCs</a> has been celebrated by users across several jurisdictions although skeptics argue about loopholes in the existing models.</p>
<p>Privacy is the top of consumer fears in Europe with data agencies issuing statements on potential violations proposing new models for financial authorities in the region.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines has warned users that cryptocurrency exchange, Binance is operating without the required license.</p>
<p>In a Nov 28 <a href="https://www.sec.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023Advisory-against-Binance.pdf">press release</a>, the regulator stated that the exchange lacks authorization to sell securities to the public in the Philippines adding that users should exercise caution.</p>
<p>“<i>Based on the Commission’s database, the operator of the platform BINANCE is NOT REGISTERED as a corporation in the Philippines and OPERATES WITHOUT THE NECESSARY LICENSE AND/OR AUTHORITY to sell or offer any form of securities as defined under Section 3.1 of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC), to engage in the business of buying or selling securities” </i></p>
<p>The Commission noted that its primary investigations reveal that Binance has conducted several promotional campaigns on social media to attract Filipinos to invest and trade securities or other assets on the platform. </p>
<h2>Facilitators risk fines and jail time </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the regulators, the website of the exchange stated that it facilitates trades among a wide range of products including spot leveraged trading, options, and derivatives and while it may be registered in other jurisdictions, the exchange lacks such standing in the country.</p>
<p>As the global exchange cannot establish and operate by offering services to local markets, the SEC urged to exercise full caution before making any exposure to “<i>unregistered online investment platforms.”</i></p>
<p>The regulatory body warned individuals and entities who aid the company in its operations in the country would be liable to twenty-one years in prison, five million pesos, or both.</p>
<blockquote><p>“…<i>those who act as salesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers of the BINANCE platform in selling or convincing people to invest in this platform within the Philippines even through online means may be held criminally liable under Section 28 of the SRC and be penalized with a maximum fine of Five Million Pesos (P 5,000,000.00) or imprisonment of Twenty One (21) years or both.” </i></p></blockquote>
<h2>Binance is still in the regulatory web</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per the statement, investment products can only be sold in the country if the securities offered to the public have been registered with the SEC through a written filed application with all relevant information attached.</p>
<p>Also, the issuer must be a licensed dealer registered in the Philippines and must possess a secondary license to trade securities.</p>
<p>In recent months, Binance has been at the center of several regulatory investigations as officials allege a lack of proper regulations. The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-binance-sued-by-cftc-over-offering-unregistered-crypto-derivate-trading-products-us.htm">filed a lawsuit against the company</a> for offering products targeted at U.S. consumers without registration.</p>
<p>This development comes amid the Binance-DOJ investigation in the U.S. that has seen CEO Changpeng Zhao now out pleading guilty as part of a wider $4.3 billion settlement that rocked the industry last week. </p>

<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants public opinion on the spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications of Franklin Templeton and Hashdex.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2023/34-99030.pdf">announcement</a> on Nov 28, the Commission highlighted the next phase in the scrutiny of spot BTC ETF applications filed by both companies after several weeks of uncertainty.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137549" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701253808-05df0cc7-e969-49c3-8b76-dc62317a4518.webp" alt="" width="2089" height="1485" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701253808-05df0cc7-e969-49c3-8b76-dc62317a4518.webp 2089w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701253808-05df0cc7-e969-49c3-8b76-dc62317a4518-300x213.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701253808-05df0cc7-e969-49c3-8b76-dc62317a4518-1024x728.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701253808-05df0cc7-e969-49c3-8b76-dc62317a4518-768x546.webp 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701253808-05df0cc7-e969-49c3-8b76-dc62317a4518-1536x1092.webp 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701253808-05df0cc7-e969-49c3-8b76-dc62317a4518-2048x1456.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2089px) 100vw, 2089px" /></p>
<p>The SEC has requested official public comments to aid its decision on whether to approve or reject the spot ETF approval and its Forms 19b-4.</p>
<p>Form 19b-4 is a document approved by the Trading and Markets Division of the SEC for public disclosure of certain details on an application before a potential approval.</p>
<h2>Market manipulation concerns linger</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the release, the financial regulator seeks information primarily regarding market manipulation and fraud concerns alongside the issue of Coinbase being the custodian and price discovery efforts.</p>
<p>This continues to be a recurring issue as the SEC has rejected all previous spot Bitcoin ETF applications citing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/another-round-of-bitcoin-spot-etf-rejections-likely-bitgo-ceo.htm">market manipulation concerns</a> with the crypto community pushing back by citing similar approvals in other sectors and calling Gary Gensler’s approach to the market as stifling rapid development.</p>
<p>“<i>The Commission is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration… the rules of a national securities exchange be &#8216;designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices&#8217; and &#8216;to protect investors and the public interest.”</i></p>
<p>The Commission explained that the institution of any proceeding is not conclusive proof that the SEC has reached a decision concerning issues relating to the ETF but a call for interested persons to provide comments geared towards a rule change.</p>
<p>This latest development is standard procedures for ETF applications under review by the SEC and will span 35 days. Both applications were filed to the Commission and September with great optimism following recent events and renewed institutional interest in the market.</p>
<h2>Optimism grows with new developments</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Hashdex spot Bitcoin ETF would be traded on the New York Stock Exchange Arca, Franklin Templeton’s will be on Cboe BZX. Comments will be due 21 days with a further two weeks window for rebuttals.</p>
<p>Hashdex applications have been explained to be structured as a futures ETF that would have spot BTC and would not rely on Coinbase. The company proposes reliance only on pricing while BTC will be acquired from other exchanges including the CME.</p>
<p>Along social media spaces, there is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-updates-bitcoin-etf-prospectus-after-discussing-with-sec.htm">renewed optimism</a> about the SEC approving a spot BTC ETF in the near future which will usher a new cycle in the market. The regulator previously delayed making decisions on the ETF applications.</p>

<p>The European Union (EU) parliament has called on member-states to take the lead in the creation of digital worlds in terms of strategy and technology implementation.</p>
<p>In a Nov 29 <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231127IPR15413/virtual-worlds-the-next-digital-transition-must-align-with-eu-values">press release</a>, the body urged relevant parties in the jurisdiction to take charge as the metaverse takes shape globally striving to set new standards for stakeholders.</p>
<p>The European Parliament Committee on Internal Markets and Consumer Protection passed a report which seeks to analyze opportunities, risks, and policy implementation for the local market.</p>
<p>The Committee recognizes the level of work done and the direction of the body but aims for more <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/virtual-worlds-opportunities-risks-and-p/product-details/20230908CDT12142">regulation in the digital single market</a> noting that the region stands to gain a lot by playing a leading role in global markets.</p>
<p>While pushing this narrative, the lawmakers called for more global collaboration towards the metaverse creating interoperable networks across borders regardless of the underlying technology deployed by companies.</p>
<p>The parliament adopted the draft with 31 votes in favor, two against, and eight absentees signifying a united front to the committee&#8217;s proposals.</p>
<h2>EU leads the way</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pablo Arias Echeverria, the rapporteur explained that the region cannot afford to repeat the last mistakes in the digital revolution and should aim to light the path of the metaverse.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Europe cannot afford to lag in the next digital revolution nor can we repeat past mistakes. As we step into Web 4.0 with the development of virtual worlds, we have to lay a foundation, rooted in strong EU digital rules, guiding principles, and values. Europe has to lead this transition, placing citizens at the heart of our digital future!”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Major benefits of virtual worlds include shaping how citizens work,  interact, and create content and want EU values at the center of the tech drive. Key to this are rules bordering on fundamental human rights and consumer protection demands ensuring that the private data of users is safe and secure while interacting with virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Recently, the EU has been at the forefront of tackling several <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/europes-data-agencies-express-concerns-over-privacy-standards-with-digital-euro.htm">privacy concerns</a> borne out of proposals within the region including fears expressed by data agencies on the digital euro. Some consumers feel that the plan for the digital euro could expose user data and have backed several plans to curb any occurrence although regulators suggest that the fears are overblown.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ec-1f1e7.png" alt="🇬🇧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> UK Residents Flags Privacy Concerns in Digital Pound Consultations: Bank of England</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/bankofengland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bankofengland</a> says the majority of feedback from the public consultation on the digital pound revolved around privacy and fiat scarcity concerns.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a><a href="https://t.co/15tcNj02KA">https://t.co/15tcNj02KA</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The EU also called for a level playing field to create sustainability for domestic businesses and to drive consumer education on rights and responsible use of technology.</p>
<p>According to the statement, if things are done right it could offer large benefits for the economy with ripple effects in education, employment, and skill development. However, concerns include addiction, impact on sleep, and cybersickness.</p>

<p>Spain’s tax administration agency, popularly called Agencia Tributaria has released new rules governing digital asset reporting in the country that will see holders declare their foreign-held assets.</p>
<p>The tax agency <a href="https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/procedimientoini/GI55.shtml">released form 721</a>, a tax reporting form for users that hold assets in non-Spanish exchanges. Per the announcement, the submission period for the form will kick off on Jan 1 2024 with a deadline on March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Corporate entities and individuals will be required to declare their holdings according to their portfolios in their appropriate forms. While firm 721 is required for non-Spanish exchanges, citizens who utilize self-custody wallets are to report their holdings using form 714, the standard wealth tax form.</p>
<p>The benchmark for individuals under the new regulations starts from users holding over €50,000 approximately $55,000 in foreign assets.</p>
<h2>Spain and crypto taxation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Spain has been on course to roll out wider digital asset tax rules after the government began a crackdown to stop the under-reporting of digital asset holders in the country.</p>
<p>In April, the country issued 328,000 notices to residents who failed to pay their digital asset taxes the previous year with the agency still unsatisfied with current figures despite a year-on-year (YoY) growth in the past three years.</p>
<p>This year’s unpaid notices grew by 40% to 328,000 while 2022 students stood at 150,000, a massive jump from 15,000 notifications in 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>The reason for the gradual growth is the increasing information that the Spanish Tax Agency has about operations with cryptocurrencies, and that information will be expanded next year with the new reporting obligations planned for crypto exchanges.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>A major challenge for regulators in taxing digital assets has been the initial framework due to the nature of cryptocurrencies and their enforcement. The real question posed is how the government intends to know the exact amount citizens own in crypto which leads to collaboration with centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Over the years, users have developed other methods including deploying decentralized exchanges and privacy coins to make their asset holdings as regulators swarm in.</p>
<p>David Kemmerer, the CEO of CoinLedger opined that the tax agency may likely request the information directly from exchanges.</p>
<p>“<i>The Spanish government is likely coming to the realization that crypto tax compliance is relatively low within the taxpayer base compared to other asset classes. Their warning letters are a way to drive further tax compliance amongst their tax base,” he added. </i></p>
<p>As several tax administrations roll out regulations, users express mixed feelings over the development with users on one hand saying excessive taxes are <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spanish-crypto-investors-fleeing-to-portugal-to-escape-taxes-say-lawyers.htm">harmful to adoption</a> especially in a bear market while others see it as key to regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>This year, Spain has made multiple efforts at virtual asset regulations including pushing a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spain-moves-to-adopt-mica-six-months-before-deadline-cites-investor-protection-heres-more.htm">comprehensive framework</a> for the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA).</p>

<p>TRM Labs has announced a partnership with Australian digital asset exchange Swyftx to reward virtual asset users who take steps to protect their accounts against fraudulent actors in the country.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/trm-labs-announces-collaboration-with-swyftx-to-combat-scams-in-australia">press release</a>, the blockchain analytics firm announced that it would be the first world trial aimed at incentivizing users to strengthen security amid the high number of scams recorded this year.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>TRM Labs, the leader in blockchain intelligence solutions, and Australian crypto exchange Swyftx launched a world-first trial today that will pay crypto users to protect themselves against fraudsters through training and by enabling stronger security features to protect their accounts.”</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>Two-factor authentication central to agreement </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the terms, users will be trained to prevent possible scams and identify bad actors in the market by onboarding new security features on their accounts. Users will be incentivized with 10 Australian dollars worth of Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) to activate a two-factor authentication on their account. </p>
<p>Two-factor authentication method has long been deployed by most crypto firms to add an extra layer of security in addition to the usual one-layer passwords. The hallmark of this positive incentive has been hailed as prioritizing security while seeking to drive investment in the market. </p>
<p>Swyftx will pay an initial 2000 users that fulfill the terms of the tests including the completion of an education course created in partnership with TRM Labs to enlighten users on the patterns of bad actors in investment scams. </p>
<p>The course will be offered with its learning platform and is to report suspected cases of fraud to TRM’s scam reprinting subsidiary chainabuse.com, a platform that allows users to flag illegal activity across several chains acting as a public forum with vast data where users can view comments and potential credibility before engaging with networks.</p>
<h2>All hands on deck as scams surge </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The tests will span one week and merge with the Scam Awareness Week from Nov 27 to Dec 1 with Swyftx going with the theme “Resist, Research, Report.” </p>
<p>Jason Titman, the Chief Operating Officer of Swyftx urged users to sieve through messages to detect potential bad actors through warning signs.</p>
<p>“<i>We’re asking Aussie crypto users to do three simple things. Resist the urge to quickly send money to any crypto wallet that claims to be an investment opportunity. Do research on scams so you can spot the warning signs. And report suspected scams that involve crypto to Chainabuse so we can bring more scammers to justice.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>TRM Labs identified over $9 billion sent to fraudulent actors around the same period when it was reported that Australians have lost $221 million to related scams, a huge 162% surge from 2021 figures. </p>
<p>The Australian government has since ramped up efforts to tackle all forms of industry-related scams including instituting legal actions against certain companies. Some institutions also <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/newsroom/2023/06/changes-on-payments-to-crytocurrency-exchanges.html">restricted several cryptocurrency payments</a> citing possible exposure to fraud. </p>

<p>Cryptocurrency products recorded a massive $346 million in weekly inflows, marking the highest figure in the past nine weeks of consecutive gains. </p>
<p>A CoinShares <a href="https://a.storyblok.com/f/155294/x/95bb6acaca/coinshares-digital-asset-fund-flows-27-11-23.pdf">Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report</a> shows a growing bullish sentiment in the market after positive signs from institutional investors as they continue to acquire exposure to cryptocurrency products for nine consecutive weeks. </p>
<p>The total inflow recorded last week totaled $346 million as anticipation of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-plea-deal-boosts-approval-odds-for-bitcoin-spot-etf.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF approval</a> spurs a new cycle in the market. According to analysts at CoinShares, the amount of gains recorded in nine weeks has become the highest since the 2021 bull run.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Ethereum record massive surge </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Market leader Bitcoin notched inflows of $312 million last week raking up the yearly total to $1.5 billion while short Bitcoin saw the third week of outflows with $0.9 million. Assets under management (AUM) has soared to its highest point in 18 months after it moved past $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>With rising prices and increasing decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, investors and crypto users are staking more coupled with acquisitions of more products through asset management increasing the sector’s AUM.</p>
<p>Ethereum has turned the tide on the altcoin front posting $34.8 million in inflows last week raising the positive run to four consecutive weeks after multiple weeks of outflows despite the launch of  ETH ETFs. Ether now trades above the $2,000 mark although several commentators say the asset continues to trade below par as many asset managers rank it a favorite cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) which has been an institutional investor favorite for the major parts of the year notched inflows but was behind Ethereum as total flows to its products stood at $3.5 million. Other altcoins including Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK) posted slight gains of $0.8 million and $0.6 million. </p>
<p>On the geographical front, Canada and Germany led the pack with 87% of the total inflows. While Canada recorded $199 million, Germany posted $101.5 million followed by the United States and Switzerland with $30.2 million and $14.6 million respectively.</p>
<h2>ETF hype drives upturn </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The bull run saw most virtual assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin hit all-time highs before a subsequent fall in 2022 due to weakened investor confidence caused by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">collapse of Terra and FTX</a> alongside wider economic factors like the Feds tackling inflation, etc. </p>
<p>This year the market has moved into the green zone with BTC posting over <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency/btcusd">128% increase year-to-date (YTD)</a> while ETH is up 74% in the same period. The rise in the prices of assets was sparked by the application of BlackRock for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Afterward, several firms made similar applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) swinging wider institutional sentiment toward cryptocurrencies. Although the SEC has rejected previous spot Bitcoin ETF applications citing possible market manipulations, experts have projected that approval is imminent with recent developments.</p>

<p>Digital asset wallet-draining platform, Inferno Drainer has closed shop after helping bad actors drain millions from several cryptocurrency platforms.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://t.me/InfernoDrainer/150">recent Telegram post</a>, the firm announced an end to its operations citing a need to move on after helping several malicious actors pull off phishing scams and others worth over “<i>$80 million.” </i></p>
<p>“<i>The end of the craziest journey. Inferno Drainer is shutting down. It has been a long ride with all of you and we’d like to thank you from our heart. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever.”</i></p>
<p>The scam-as-a-service provider stated that all files, servers, and devices will be preserved for users to have a smooth transition to a new service as they please while making a split.</p>
<p>Per the post, the platform also warned users and companies not to be deceived by scam accounts claiming to be the company for the purposes of future scams adding that they won’t make a subsequent return.</p>
<p>“A big thank you to everyone who has <i>worked with us such as Drakan and every other customer, we hope you can remember us as the best drainer that has ever existed and that we succeeded in helping you in the quest of making money,” </i>the statement reads.</p>
<h2>100,000 victims: More regulation needed </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Inferno Multichain Drainer like other infamous drainers is responsible for several hacks by assisting bad actors with the toolkit and taking a percentage of the drained sum.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Inferno Drainer, a scam vendor specializing in multi-chain scams, has stolen $5.9 million in assets from nearly 4,888 victims through over 689 phishing websites targeting popular projects.<a href="https://t.co/OEjdzHm2Ls">https://t.co/OEjdzHm2Ls</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) <a href="https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1659484958388539392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The platform became popular among bad actors in 2023 following the end of Monkey Drainer and it took a 20% cut of stolen assets. According to the web3 scam detector, Scam Sniffer the platform has <a href="https://dune.com/scamsniffer/inferno-drainer">stolen over $70 million</a> from about 100,000 victims. </p>
<p>While many scam-as-a-service platforms are still in operation, the announced shutdown of Inferno Drainer has led to a high sigh of relief as several blockchain security firms including CertiK as one of the most damaging kits in the entire ecosystem.</p>
<h2>A crackdown on bad actors? </h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After huge scams and bankruptcies, regulators have ramped up efforts to secure investor assets on two fronts; ensuring properly secure platforms through arresting and prosecuting scammers and licensing platforms.</p>
<p>This year has seen millions wiped away through scams leading to wider calls to clamp down on bad actors stealing user assets and reducing the bullish drive of investors in the market. </p>
<p>Last week over <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/htx-resumes-bitcoin-and-ether-services-after-30-million-hack.htm">$90 million was stolen</a> from HTX and the HECO bridge in addition to the multiple incidents recorded this year alone. Although it has not been disclosed if the hackers had assistance from scamming platforms, the crypto community needs fewer bad actors to make the industry safer and reduce unwanted criticism from anti-virtual asset commentators.</p>

<p>Digital asset exchange HTX has resumed deposits and withdrawal services for major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and others after it was drained for $30 million.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.htx.com/support/en-us/detail/34955336230022">announcement on Nov 26</a>, the exchange said services have been restored for certain virtual assets via the ERC20 blockchain adding that many more services will resume shortly.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Dear HTX users, </i><i>we are pleased to announce that HTX has resumed the withdrawal services for certain cryptos via ERC20 blockchain, including HOT, LINK, MANA, NEXO, PRO, LITH, FTT, LOOKS, SUSHI, FET, MATIC, SNX, MKR, AAVE, LINA…”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The statement also pointed to the planned airdrop meant to boost community participation after it suffered a major hack. It says the airdrop is targeted at all users who hold Rockets to be determined as 1 USDT and holding top assets like HT, BTC, ETH will have ticket values multiplied.</p>
<p>As the hack sparked a huge controversy, the exchange noted that its vast reserves would cover all losses and will continue to investigate and beef up security to prevent a similar infamous event in the future.</p>
<p>“<i>Since its founding, HTX has remained committed to a policy of 100% reserves, ensuring our capacity to meet the withdrawal needs of all users.”</i></p>
<h2>Justin Sun throws more light</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a related development, the exchange’s advisor Justin Sun wrote in a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1728748251791196345?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">posts on X</a> (formerly Twitter)  that major cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, TRX, and USDT are now fully functional on the platform and expects restoration all all others by next week.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a>) deposits and withdrawals have now been fully reinstated on <a href="https://twitter.com/HTX_Global?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HTX_Global</a>. As of now, all major currencies including BTC, ETH, TRX, and USDT are available for complete deposit and withdrawal functionality on HTX.</p>
<p>&mdash; H.E. Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1728748251791196345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“<i>The majority of the work has been accomplished, and we aim to restore the remaining currencies gradually in the next few days, with all work expected to be completed by next week.”</i></p>
<p>Sun has been in the news following major hacks of platforms he has an interest in, raising security concerns with many users urging for more safety measures.</p>
<h2>Four unfortunate events</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last week, HTX formerly Houbi was hacked for about $30 million becoming another Sun-related platform to suffer an attack following HECO bridge, Poloniex, and a previous HTX hack.</p>
<p>HTX <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heco-chain-htx-hit-by-100m-hack-justin-sun-says-exchange-will-cover-all-losses.htm">suffered a major hack</a> alongside a similar occurrence on the HECO bridge resulting in over $86 million in losses. Sun acknowledged the incident on both platforms on X stating that all losses will be fully compensated, suspending deposits and withdrawals while noting that full services will be restored once the risks have been identified and addressed.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/poloniex-to-resume-deposits-and-withdrawal-services-after-100-million-exploit-heres-more.htm">Poloniex also suffered a massive $100 million hack</a> that caused a stir within the wider community with the exchange also assuring to restore all losses. The platform offered a white hat bounty of $10 million for an easy return of assets after noting that the identity has been found and will initiate criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>Hong Kong’s investment management firm, Victory Securities has obtained approval to offer digital asset services to retail clients expanding the country’s number of cryptocurrency licences.</p>
<p>In a Nov 24 <a href="https://victorysec.com.hk/en/article/correspondences/read/press20231124">press release</a>, the company made the announcement that it obtained a license from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to offer digital asset services adding that this development makes it the first licensed corporation to offer those associated services to clients.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Victory Securities… </i><i>which has been rooted in Hong Kong for 50 years, has made significant progress in the field of virtual assets and became the first company in Hong Kong to obtain approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (&#8220;SFC&#8221;) to provide retail investors with A licensed corporation for virtual asset trading and advisory services.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the statement, Victory Securities will integrate virtual assets with the traditional finance ecosystem and allow retail clients to participate in the model getting and trading assets seamlessly.</p>
<p>The company also hailed the commitment of the Hong Kong authority as it sets itself to become the destination of the International Virtual Asset Center.</p>
<p>Seeking to connect both branches of finance, the firm wants to create a platform where users can flexibly allocate assets and offer investment advice to retail users including periodic research reports.</p>
<p>In line with modern regulatory requirements to provide adequate information on products and assess user knowledge before they can invest, the company wrote that it would focus on investor education, and research and will continue to partner with regulatory agencies.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong’s web3 revolution</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Victory Securities now joins the rank of firms with retail crypto licenses in Hong Kong. Previously the regulatory nod has been given to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kongs-hashkey-breaks-retail-ground-with-trading-app-hsk-token-to-follow.htm">HashKey and OSL Securities</a>.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-retail-investors-more-interested-crypto-than-ever-before-reveals-sfc-survey.htm">lauded for a positive stance</a> toward digital assets after releasing a regulatory framework for retail markets to protect all parties in the sector.</p>
<p>The rules which were released on June 1 give companies a level playing field while protecting investors according to Julia Leung, the chief legal officer at the SFC while Gary Tiu, the head of regulation at OSL said the regime should be studied and replicated in other markets.</p>

<p>However, virtual asset exchange Bitget <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-bitget-to-cease-operations-in-hong-kong-whats-going-on.htm">announced a closure of business in Hong Kong</a> on December 13 citing market considerations as reasons why it will not pursue previous plans for a local license.</p>
<p>“<i>Due to business and market-related considerations, we have decided not to apply for a Virtual Asset Trading Platform (VATP) license in Hong Kong.”</i></p>
<p>Similar efforts are being recorded in Dubai, Brazil, and Singapore as they clear up the digital asset structure to pass proper regulations like Europe’s success with the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation.</p>

<p>Dutch-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitvavo has received regulatory green light in France to act as a digital asset service provider.</p>
<p>In a Nov 23 <a href="https://bitvavo.com/en/blog/bitvavo-gains-regulatory-approval-in-france">press release</a>, the company disclosed the milestone and reiterated its wider expansion plans with hopes of becoming the largest crypto exchange in Europe.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have received registration approval from the French Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) as a Digital Asset Service Provider <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1eb-1f1f7.png" alt="🇫🇷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>This registration aligns with our goal to be Europe&#39;s top crypto exchange,  enabling us to support French customers in their crypto journey. <a href="https://t.co/yDcpqoguKf">pic.twitter.com/yDcpqoguKf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Bitvavo (@bitvavocom) <a href="https://twitter.com/bitvavocom/status/1727724516246172099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Receiving the much-desired regulatory nod from the French regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) allows the firm to launch its products and services in the local market.</p>
<p>France remains a regional hub for most firms seeking to expand their reach in Europe as its regulators have stressed the need to protect and function around a framework that protects all parties.</p>
<p>Notably, the passage of the Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-framework-signed-into-law-by-eu-officials.htm">MiCA</a>) regulation has made Europe attractive to global investors making the licensing regime easier and protecting stakeholders.</p>
<p>Mark Nuvelstigen the CEO of Bitvavo believes Europe can change the game for crypto worldwide with its single-country cryptocurrency licensing regime where one permit is enough to operate in the entire region.</p>
<p>Nuvelstign described the French market as a great opportunity for the company with new studies revealing a surge in the number of its citizens being exposed to digital assets. The statement cited a recent survey where French citizens own 9% of crypto in their investment portfolio making it the second most popular asset class in the country.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i><i>Securing registration with the French AMF marks a pivotal moment for us. We are excited about bringing our consumer-focused offering to the French market.”</i></p></blockquote>
<h2><i> </i>Bitvavo’s expansion agenda</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The company plans to roll out multiple products and services across the continent as it prepares to become the largest digital asset exchange in the continent.</p>
<p>According to its Chief Executive, the exchange’s 1.5 million users will get a boost in confidence to trust the expansion plan as they continue their crypto journey.</p>
<p>“<i>The launch in France is part of our ambition to become the leading crypto exchange in Europe. Our nearly 1.5 million European users value us as their go-to trusted and secure platform for crypto trading and investing. French customers can now start their crypto journey with us.”</i></p>
<p>This new milestone comes after the company secured regulatory <a href="https://bitvavo.com/en/blog/regulatory-approval-in-austria">approval in Austria</a> after filing applications for major regional markets. The company stressed regulatory compliance describing its operations as fully compliant with transparent transaction fees and licensing.</p>
<p>Binance’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-coin-price-prediction-as-changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-after-doj-settlement-will-bnb-rally-or-dump-now.htm">settlement with the Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> has raised concerns among stakeholders on registration to avoid any lawsuits from regulators in the future.</p>
