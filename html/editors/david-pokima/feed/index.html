<p>Solana‚Äôs smartphone, Saga, underperforms months after hitting the market with about 2,500 units sold raising internal and wider concerns over the model.</p>
<p>Speaking on an <a href="https://youtu.be/xwFBD2hzChk?si=TomamJThhHprLx3N">Unchained podcast</a> on Dec 6, Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana‚Äôs founder reflected on the journey so far for the smartphone and other issues relating to the Solana blockchain including developments, roadmap, and price growth.</p>
<p>Current sales figures point to underperformance in the market as the future of the phone remains uncertain due to market dynamics and less attraction from developers still hinged limited adoption.</p>
<p>According to the founder, the company would need to drive sales to 20,000 to 50,000 users as a base level for developers to deploy more applications to the smartphone.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>‚ÄúI think 25,000 to 50,000 units to feel like there is a hardcore user base for developers to be compelled to ship applications.‚Äù</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Yakovenko noted that in light of market realities, Saga‚Äôs future may take another course although internal company discussions are still ongoing. The company will likely pivot to a cheaper secondary device for iPhone users for a smart wallet.</p>
<p>When asked about his phone usage, he added that he doesn‚Äôt use Saga exclusively because of his business applications on his iPhone adding that Saga is being used as an ‚ÄúNFT phone.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>We have to decide if there‚Äôs a place for a smart wallet, a much cheaper version that an iPhone user could use as a secondary device. We haven‚Äôt seen a ton of signal whether that‚Äôs a compelling enough thing to sell 50,000 units.‚Äù</i></p>
<p>He explained the growth in Progressive Web Apps and Pass-keys as they reduce the differences between regular and specialized iPhones.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs also changed over the last year and a half is that mobile interfaces like progressive web apps and passkeys have shrunk the difference between a dedicated device to the kind of tools that developers can use to get that experience on a regular phone.‚Äù</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The smartphone was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-solana-mobile-saga-launches-can-sol-reach-1-2023.htm">rolled out earlier this year</a> for $1,000 but later slashed to $599. Despite the community hype on the web3 device, the phone has been poor so far in the market below the expectations of several analysts.</p>
<h2>Solana‚Äôs growth in the market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Away from the performance of the smartphone, Yakovenko spoke on the progress of the blockchain in recent times particularly the growing roadmap and popularity of the asset.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">collapse of FTX</a> in 2022, Solana went downhill plunging over 50% due to the exchange holding a significant number of SOL. Despite last year‚Äôs saga, the asset peaked with increased decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers in previous months.</p>

<p>The Financial Conduct Authority has added cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex to its warning list of firms that may not be fully authorized to render trading services in the country.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/poloniex-polo-digital-assets-ltd-poloniexcom-poloniexorg">official publication</a> on Dec 6, the financial regulator warned users from dealing with the company adding that the firm may be promoting financial services without proper regulations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Firms and individuals cannot promote financial services in the UK without the necessary authorization or approval. This firm is not authorized by us and may be targeting people in the UK.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Seychelles-based firm has been added to the list as part of a wider push by British regulators to protect investors following previous losses recorded in the global market.</p>
<p>Per the release, the body advises users on the potential risk of continued interaction with the firm adding that users will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) meaning there would be no avenue to recover lost assets if things go south.</p>
<p>The publication advises users under its purview to only deal with authorized firms as they have greater protection under the law.</p>
<h2>FCA&#8217;s wider industry regulations continue</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The FCA says it received over 291 applications from crypto firms seeking to become fully compliant in the jurisdiction but has only approved 38 before bound forward to announce in October that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uks-fca-adds-143-crypto-exchanges-including-huobi-owned-htx-and-kucoin-to-warning-list.htm">140 crypto firms are included</a> in its warning list.</p>
<p>As global authorities ramp up crypto regulations, the FCA has released new rules and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-financial-watchdog-flags-common-failures-in-crypto-marketing.htm">guidelines for financial promotion</a> in the crypto market requiring firms to disclose risk warnings.</p>
<p>In addition to risk warnings, digital asset adverts will introduce a cool-off period for first-time investors to avoid possible risks while bonuses for referrals will also remain prohibited.</p>
<p>These new policies have sparked uncertainty in the UK market as described by several analysts because they can limit and stifle user adoption in the market. On the other hand, pro-regulation circles have hailed the rules to provide more sanity in the system to prevent an infamous incident in the future that could result in wide losses.</p>
<h2>A series of unfortunate events for Justin Sun</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The placing of Poloniex on the FCA‚Äôs warning list comes after several Justin Sun‚Äôs linked digital asset companies suffered hacks raising concerns among community members if both incidents may be linked.</p>
<p>On Nov 10, Poloniex <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-security-firm-peckshield-reports-suspicious-activity-in-poloniex-exchange-wallet-60-million-drained.htm">suffered a massive $100 million hack</a> leading to a suspension of trading activities and an internal investigation by the company. Sun revealed the exchange would reinstate all losses while seeking measures to recover assets from the bad actors including offering a $10 million white hat bounty.</p>
<p>The exchange gradually resumed deposits and withdrawal services before the HECO bridge was compromised with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heco-chain-htx-hit-by-100m-hack-justin-sun-says-exchange-will-cover-all-losses.htm">$86 million drained </a>and HTX also losing assets due to a hot wallet breach in November.</p>

<p>The Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi has launched a blockchain geared towards tracking carbon emissions and facilitating trading amid growing climate concerns.</p>
<p>In a Dec 5 <a href="https://twitter.com/tiiuae/status/1731974526508916824?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">post on X (Twitter)</a>, the institute disclosed that its Cryptography Research Center has launched the blockchain as it represents the country‚Äôs commitment and drive to leading the world‚Äôs climate narrative.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our Cryptography Research Center (CRC)¬†today launched its very own blockchain-powered carbon trading platform to facilitate international trade in carbon tokens. <a href="https://t.co/0ablTqxfbY">pic.twitter.com/0ablTqxfbY</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Technology Innovation Institute (@TIIuae) <a href="https://twitter.com/TIIuae/status/1731974526508916824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Our Cryptography Research Center (CRC) today launched its very own blockchain-powered carbon trading platform to facilitate international trade in carbon tokens.‚Äù</i></p>
<p>The new revelation comes during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28) with pledged pledges to lower emissions and steer multiple sectors towards greener energy.</p>
<p>Utilizing the concept of carbon trading and tracking will give firms the right idea of their environmental impact and its deployment on the blockchain means it is public, encouraging wider participation which will drive bigger players to fulfill all promises.</p>
<h2>Carbon tracking to reduce emissions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the statement, the projects will allow for the trade of carbon tokens internationally, monitor greenhouse projects, and incentivize platforms to participate to lower emissions as a whole.</p>
<p>Organizations record their emissions on the network in a manner open for all spurring users to create tokens that measure carbon removed from the company‚Äôs operation either through capture or trading.</p>
<p>Developed as a lightweight blockchain, its operation has been described to minimally affect the environment as it aids climate action as part of the wider goals of the government.</p>
<p>The network will also have auditors to make the entire process safe, transparent, secure, and accurate.</p>
<p>Over the years, the United Nations and several international organizations have tipped <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/battle-against-climate-crisis-dont-overlook-blockchain">blockchain technology to solve real-world issues</a> like climate change through tracking emissions and global carbon trading.</p>
<p>As a result of the openness of the technology, the industry will have the right data on their activities without relying on third-party expert monitoring which may be cumbersome while costing more.</p>
<p>Another positive of utilizing distributed ledger technology (DLT) to tackle climate change is community participation in solving modern problems with modern solutions.</p>
<h2>Blockchain projects go green</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In line with global objectives and criticism of the sector&#8217;s energy usage, certain blockchain firms have made a switch to greener energy or changed their mode of operations.</p>
<p>Most notable was recorded in 2021 when the Ethereum blockchain transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake model reducing its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-live-latest-news-updates.htm">carbon footprint by 99%</a> as it got rid of miners replacing them with validators.</p>
<p>The network also launched the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) aimed at bringing industry players and traditional tech firms to reduce emissions, a move that has gained significant participation from Microsoft and other firms. On Dec 6, OKX Ventures, an arm of OKX crypto exchange joined the ECO to partner with industry leads in curbing climate change.</p>

<p>OKX Ventures, the investment arm of cryptocurrency exchange OKX has joined the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) to partner towards sustainable climate goals.</p>
<p>In a Dec 6 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/okx-ventures-joins-ethereum-climate-platform-as-a-launch-partner-to-advance-sustainability-in-web3-302007102.html">press release</a>, the company announced the decision to join the platform and highlighted plans targeted to decarbonize the web3 ecosystem amid recent climate reports on the sector‚Äôs energy usage.</p>
<p>According to the release, the firm in partnership with the exchange team plans to utilize advanced technology to expedite the decarbonization of blockchains and support more sustainable energy use in mining and trading-related activities.</p>
<blockquote><p>¬†‚Äú<i>OKX Ventures, with the support of the OKX Web3 team, joined a coalition of companies dedicated to expediting decarbonization and amplifying climate action through the deployment of cutting-edge technology and the cultivation of digital environmental assets.‚Äù</i></p></blockquote>
<p>In reducing greenhouse gases and increasing climate benefits, the company cited its approach using proof-of-reserves to track and validate on-chain as a way of lowering emissions.</p>
<p>OKX now joins big technology corporations like Microsoft, Polygon, and the Near Foundation to collaborate in climate action towards web3 firms.</p>
<h2>¬†All hands on deck for climate sustainability</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Industry executives continue to support recent climate initiatives to pivot to renewable energy solutions like the setting up of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uzbekistan-permits-only-legal-entities-mine-cryptocurrencies-using-solar-power.htm">solar-powered Bitcoin mines</a> and switching to immersion cooling systems.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Speaking on the recent partnership, Jeff Ren, OKX Ventures Partner noted that it underscores the company‚Äôs commitment to social responsibility and environmental stewardship through innovative solutions.</p>
<p><i>‚Äú‚Ä¶</i><i>We embrace this opportunity and responsibility to pioneer sustainable blockchain innovation to create lasting value for both people and the planet.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Anna Lerner, the Executive Director of ECP expressed delight over the partnership adding that it shows a new era of eco-conscious blockchain advancement.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Through this partnership, the OKX Ventures and Web3 teams are demonstrating their leadership in sustainable innovation across Web3. Its partnership with the </i><i>Ethereum</i><i>Climate Platform and support of Gitcoin demonstrate a dedication to ESG principles</i>.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Switch to green energy can save miners</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Ethereum Climate Platform was set up after the much anticipated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-live-latest-news-updates.htm">Ethereum Merge</a> which saw the network transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to collaborate with industry leaders and wider traditional players seeking ways to reduce emissions through the use of technology.</p>
<p>The Ethereum Merge was notable because it reduced the network‚Äôs energy usage by 99% a bold step after multiple reports on huge mining energy consumption leading to wide backlash from climate activists and the government.</p>
<p>The Chinese government flagged Bitcoin mining activities as a major cause of many cities missing their climate target leading to an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-hashrate-close-to-full-recovery-after-chinas-mining-ban.htm">outright ban of mining-related activities</a> in the country setting the pace for mining migration.</p>
<p>This year, the Kazakhstan government has <a href="https://digitalbusiness.kz/2023-09-28/kompanii-mayneri-pozhalovalis-tokaevu-na-neposilnuyu-platu-za-tsifrovoy-mayning/">reduced the supply of electricity</a> to Bitcoin miners as several climate activists continue pushing against the Proof-of-Work model to validate transactions.</p>
<p>The United States attempted to roll out a 30% tax on digital asset miners citing an unfair use of energy supply leading to more pressure on daily users.</p>

<p>The digital asset market has recorded massive bullish activity in recent weeks with the prices of most cryptocurrencies soaring to positions not seen in over 18 months.</p>
<p>Aside from asset prices, decentralized finance (DeFi) activities are also high in terms of volumes and staking as investors look to reap rewards before the end of the year.</p>
<p>A recent market report from on-chain analytics firm CCData <a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/digital-asset-management-review-november-2023?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=79486371&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_5YFkBl7KmekrmRJj7xm_hqm8t6_66NVPj-giXDIvi07BGVmWlhal28qSFk8eh7ww2HRK6-a1jApIirShPUzdQ9dY19Q&amp;utm_content=79486371&amp;utm_source=hs_email">shows growth in Assets Under Management (AUM)</a> around virtual asset products, weekly inflows, and renewed appetite by firms and investors for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF.</p>
<p>Per the data, institutional clients&#8217; interest in DeFi products maintained momentum in October and bolstered 14% to $43.3 billion at the end of November although at press time, the figure is above the $45 billion mark, a sign of a growing market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Digital asset investment products recorded $176 million in inflows last week extending the positive run to 10 consecutive weeks. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a><a href="https://t.co/fcK19i66sj">https://t.co/fcK19i66sj</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The recent rise means the AUM in crypto assets has seen a year-to-date growth (YTD) of 120% although the current bullish drive is still way below its all-time high in 2021 when it surpassed $74 billion.</p>
<p>A notable finding from the research is the daily average of trading volume which stood at $481 million climbing a massive 35.3% from the previous month.</p>
<p>The bull run of 2021 which drives the market was stunted following rapid inflation in most traditional markets leading to tightening measures that made investors withdraw from risky assets and low trader sentiments caused by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">industry collapses</a>.</p>
<p>On-chain data points to an uptick in AUM towards the end of the second quarter when spot Bitcoin ETF applications began taking shape and decentralized applications (DApps) volume surged.</p>
<h2>Positive market forces spiked AUM</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the report, the uptick recorded in AUM is based on several factors including growing investor confidence, increased anticipation for a spot BTC ETF, more participants in the ETF process, and pressure towards the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Last month saw strategic moves by firms <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-spot-ethereum-etf-until-january-2024.htm">involved in the ETF process</a> as Fidelity, WisdomTree, BlackRock, Grayscale, etc all met with the financial regulator to either amend filings or discuss further prospects and receive feedback from the Commission.</p>
<p>While the SEC is yet to approve any spot Bitcoin ETF applications citing possible market manipulation concerns many wealth managers are positioning for an imminent approval as the market expects a new liquidity cycle.</p>
<p>Bitcoin‚Äôs uphill run has been instrumental to the rise in AUM as the market leader remains top in terms of investment product inflows. Bitcoin exchanges hands at over $44,000 up by 160% this year with <a href="https://jbutterfill.medium.com/volume-159-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-0103828f4a3d">investment products recording 12%</a> in November and standing slightly over $31.8 billion.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) products also surged last month after previous losses. The leading altcoin products grew by 12% to hit $1.75 billion while Solana (SOL) based products spiked 99% pushing its AUM to $424 million.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has recorded a massive uptick in the past week surging above 14% as the wider market rebounds igniting bullish sentiments hinged on several factors.</p>
<p>The refueled rally of the market leader comes on the heels of increased network activity pushed by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-perspectives-from-mike-novogratz-ordinals-milestone-secs-request-coinbase.htm">BTC Ordinals</a>, popularly referred to as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), institutional investor&#8217;s anticipation for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, and a generally bullish outlook.</p>
<p>BTC Ordinals (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ordi/">ORDI</a>) has skyrocketed 850% in 39 days and has tapped $1 billion in market capitalization becoming the first BRC-20 to hit the milestone despite facing multiple criticisms on its utility to the network based on congestion issues recorded earlier in the year.</p>
<p>At press time, the token trades above $55 marking a 7.7% increase over the past day and over 200% in the last seven days as trading volume continues over the $1 billion mark.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Ordinals were rolled out in January allowing users to make inscriptions on the Bitcoin network. Recent on-chain data points to record activities with more than 48 million Ordinals inscribed on the network bringing in $149 million in transaction fees.</p>
<p>Binance monthly market research highlighted the growth of Ordinals as it spurred the network to record more transaction fees than Ethereum, against the usual expectations.</p>
<h2>BTC hovers $43,500</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The price of Bitcoin has soared in recent weeks as its bulls remain keen on wiping out losses recorded in the bear market.</p>
<p>Notably, the price of the asset has soared above 25% in 30 days and has posted a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency/btcusd">162% increase year-to-date (YTD)</a> due to the massive slump recorded in 2022 as a result of the wider economic factors like the Feds raising interest rates and industry factors including the collapse of Terra Network and the subsequent implosion of FTX.</p>
<p>This year‚Äôs growth was sparked off by a renewed institutional interest in the market coming off the heels of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-community-divided-over-blackrocks-recent-bitcoin-etf-application.htm">BlackRock‚Äôs spot ETF application</a> which was followed by many big firms making similar moves spurring the asset‚Äôs price above $31,000 and a further drive to this point.</p>
<p>The anticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF continues to grow as multiple analysts predict a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">possible window of approval</a> by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with several firms predicting a new investment cycle in the market.</p>
<h2>Ordinals criticisms resurfaces</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite adding its quota to the surge of Bitcoin and serving as an avenue to save Bitcoin miners to make funds at a time when operations were in the woods, many within the community still heap criticisms on inscriptions.</p>

<p>The Central Bank of Italy and South Korea have announced a partnership to collaborate on key areas like payment systems and IT in the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).¬†</p>
<p>A Dec 5 <a href="https://www.bancaditalia.it/media/notizia/protocollo-d-intesa-tra-la-banca-d-italia-e-la-bank-of-korea-in-materia-di-it-e-sistemi-di-pagamento/">press release</a> by La Banca d‚ÄôItalia disclosed the agreement which would see both central banks follow the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at strengthening both IT and payment systems of both countries&#8217; digital currencies.¬†</p>
<blockquote><p><i>‚ÄúThe Bank of Italy and the Bank of Korea have signed a Memorandum of Understanding aimed at strengthening collaboration on IT and payment systems.‚Äù</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The terms of the MoU stress on mutual sharing of knowledge gathered from the extensive research both institutions have embarked on in recent years. All topics on Information Communication Technology and real-time payment and settlement integrations will also be shared by both countries.</p>
<p>Per the statement, Luigi Federico Signorini the General Director of the Bank of Italy participated in the memorandum and signed the protocol.</p>
<h2>CBDC collaborations across borders¬†</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A major key point in rolling out <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/CBDC/">CBDCs</a> by several governments has been getting cross-border payments as a way to rival private cryptocurrencies and connect different continents and regions without stress on the part of consumers.¬†</p>
<p>Another technological issue being researched across many central banks is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/europes-data-agencies-express-concerns-over-privacy-standards-with-digital-euro.htm">privacy implications</a> of a CBDC rollout with several governments backing a model that gives private corporations more powers while ensuring the safety of user data.¬†</p>
<p>Recently, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published a report on Project Tourbillon, a research done on ensuring CBDC transactions are done with the highest privacy standards through technology integrations.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b8.png" alt="üí∏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The Bank for International Settlement has released the final report on Project Tourbillion, its privacy-inclined CBDC project.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBDC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CBDC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BIS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BIS</a><a href="https://t.co/T3bCfxkJfa">https://t.co/T3bCfxkJfa</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The project releases two models; eCash 1.0 and eCash 2.0 meant to ensure the standards of privacy transactions without compromising security and scalability even at peak periods across countries.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Project Tourbillon introduces a new privacy paradigm that balances user needs and public policy objectives: payer anonymity. For example, a consumer who pays a merchant using CBDCs does not disclose personal information to anyone, including the merchant, banks, and the central bank.‚Äù</i></p>
<h2>Italy and Korea scale up digital currency efforts¬†</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Italy has been researching modern solutions to settle distributed ledger technology (DLT) transactions while looking to introduce the Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-framework-signed-into-law-by-eu-officials.htm">MiCA</a>) legislations in the country in line with the uniform objectives of the European Union (EU) and to protect investors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea has unveiled plans to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/100000-south-koreans-will-start-using-cbdc-next-year.htm">onboard 100,000 citizens</a> to purchase items and make deposits in line with its planned CBDC pilot billed for September to October 2024.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>The pilot project will be conducted first in the fourth quarter of 2024. The possibility of conducting separate pilots will be considered as well if banks propose new individual projects.‚Äù</i></p>

<p>The bullish drive of institutional investors in recent weeks can be seen across several market metrics as digital assets soar to levels not recorded in months.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">traded sideways</a> for most of the year before soaring above $2,000 following the recent market uptick which has sent the wider market capitalization over $1.5 trillion and ignited bullish sentiments.</p>
<p>At press time, institutional investors&#8217; funds in Ethereum products stand<a href="https://a.storyblok.com/f/155294/x/babbfcada6/coinshares-digital-asset-fund-flows-04-12-23.pdf"> at $10 million year-to-date (YTD)</a>, turning the tide after several weeks in the woods while its assets under management (AUM) is over $8.8 billion.</p>

<p>The CoinShares <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-151-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-9be13b6861c3">Weekly assets flows</a> recorded outflows from the altcoin giant for several weeks despite positives recorded on the main network in terms of developments.</p>
<p>Most analysts viewed the poor run of Ethereum as the massive slide recorded last year following wider economic factors and industry collapses. ETH plunged over 55% in 2022 alongside Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">BTC</a>) as Federal Reserve policies, inflation factors, and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">collapse of the Terra Network and FTX</a> sent prices tumbling.</p>
<p>This year marked a renewed surge of institutional investors in the market but the majority of the growth was seen around Bitcoin as anticipation for a spot ETF grew following the application of BlackRock and other institutional giants with strong optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a filing.</p>
<p>As a result, while Bitcoin products recorded inflows for weeks which now stand at over $1.6 billion YTD, Ethereum products have struggled with several weeks of outflows leading to net inflows of $10 million YTD.</p>
<h2>Ethereum leads altcoin gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Several analysts opined an uptick in the performance of ETH at the start of the year as a result of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-live-latest-news-updates.htm">network‚Äôs Merge</a> which saw its transition of Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. A recent survey showed that most wealth managers backed the asset as the crypto with the highest growth potential.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Last week, Ethereum saw inflows of $31 million extending the recent run of consecutive inflows to five weeks totaling $134 million outshining Solana (SOL) which was described as an altcoin favorite after weeks on consecutive inflows.</p>
<p>While ETF demand fueled the run of Bitcoin, the launch of several future Ethereum failed to drive the growth as predicted along many circles.</p>
<p>At press time, ETH trades above $2,200 with bulls locking sights on another run to end the year.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has continued to drive the market this year with surging investment fund figures with anticipation of an ETF approval and a bull run. Last week, institutional investors poured in $132 million igniting a positive momentum pushing DeFi figures above $46 billion and altcoins to yearly highs.</p>

<p>The digital asset market recorded an 11% uptick last month with Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK) becoming the top-performing assets as decentralized finance (DeFi) volumes surge, a new report shows.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://public.bnbstatic.com/static/files/research/monthly-market-insights-2023-12.pdf">Binance Monthly Market Insight</a> report shows a growth in the general outlook as most cryptocurrencies surge in value pushing the total market cap over $1.5 trillion.</p>
<p>According to the report, November started with bulls dictating the pace of the market with a 12% increase in the first half before making a slight correction as described as an oscillation between bullish and bearish sentiments.</p>
<p>In October and November, the market gained 19% and 11% respectively signalling a strong finish to the year recovering losses from previous months occasioned by wider macroeconomic factors. Only Junaury‚Äôs 30% surge beats the last two in growth metrics.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú<i>All the top 10 coins ended November with positive gains, with SOL and LINK¬† followed with a 29.11% increase. Solana‚Äôs resurgence in the crypto Solana Breakpoint, drew over 13,000 attendees to one of its four venues, highlighting the growing community interest.‚Äù¬†</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin fees outpace Ethereum</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last month, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) recorded more transaction fees than Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>), a deviation from the regular pattern recorded in several years due to higher network activity on Ethereum hinged on the higher concentration of decentralized applications on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Notably, the new trend stayed constant for nearly two-thirds of the month hitting its widest point in two years. The disparity was fueled by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/six-figure-prices-for-bitcoin-rock-ordinals-and-etherrock-nfts-reignite-hopes-for-return-of-nft-mania.htm">increasing demand of Bitcoin Ordinals</a>, the popularly described non-fungible token of the market leader which boosted activities on the network clogging the mempool earlier this year.</p>
<p>According to recent data from CryptoSlam, Ordinal transactions were at the highest in November with about $367 million culminating in the high number outpacing Ethereum.</p>
<h2>DeFi volumes soar</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The bull run has led to an uptick in DeFi volumes including the rapid movement of institutional funds into digital asset products. Overall, total value locked (TVL) across DeFi platforms has surged 11% in the past 30 days with Solana (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">SOL</a>) registering a 56% increase.</p>
<p>This year, Solana has been described as an institutional investor favorite after weeks of record inflows even when altcoin figures were at a record low. Altcoin leader Ethereum also notched an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-asset-funds-record-346-million-inflows-as-assets-under-management-surge-past-45-3-billion.htm">increase in institutional inflow</a> in recent weeks as its asset price broke through the $2,000 mark.</p>
<p>Optimism and Avalanche also recorded gains in DeFi TVL of 17% and 16% respectively. NFT volumes posted a turnaround from plunging volumes in previous months. Last month, NFT volumes stood at $0.91 billion marking a 200% growth.</p>

<p>Digital asset investment products recorded $176 million in inflows last week extending the positive run to 10 consecutive weeks hitting huge numbers not recorded in years.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://a.storyblok.com/f/155294/x/babbfcada6/coinshares-digital-asset-fund-flows-04-12-23.pdf">CoinShares Digital Asset Weekly Fund Flow report</a> shows strong bullish sentiment from investors across multiple countries signaling another uphill run as the year winds up.</p>
<p>The $176 million total fund flow last week has pushed the value in the last 10 weeks above $1.76 billion, a figure not recorded since Oct 2021 after future-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) were rolled out in the United States.</p>
<p>2021 was also the year the market soared to record highs with Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) tapping an all-time higher above $64,000 and multiple altcoins making a rally on the back of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/institutional-investors-flock-to-bitcoin-pushing-inflows-past-1-billion-in-2023.htm">renewed institutional investment</a> in the market.</p>
<p>This year has seen a significant boost changing the tide from last year&#8217;s plunging figures caused largely by macroeconomic factors and internal market pressures. Top assets like BTC have posted a 100% growth this year as institutional investors rally around digital assets.</p>
<p>The ten weeks of consecutive inflows translate to 4% of the Assets Under Management (AUM) showing a rise in investment after months of struggles in a bear market.</p>
<p>AUM has now surged 107% this year and stands at $46.2 billion following an increase in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity but remains far off the all-time of $86.6 billion posted in 2021.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin records massive gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin led the gains as expected after investors sunk in $133 million further extending its good to another week despite short Bitcoin recording three weeks of outflows with $3.6 million in the last seven days.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">anticipation for a spot Bitcoin ETF</a> in the United States continues to drive growth around the market with more firms predicting an approval hangs in the horizon.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC trades for $41,570, a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 12% boost in the last seven days as bulls continue to apply pressure towards the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Ether lights altcoin path</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) recorded inflows of $31 million increasing its positive inflows to 5 weeks totaling $134 million after a slow start to the year. Multi-asset products Ripple (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a>) saw inflows of $2.3 million and $0.5 million respectively.</p>
<p>Solana (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">SOL</a>) continued its inflow in consecutive weeks although way behind Ethereum in terms of volume. The institutional investor favorite recorded inflows of $4.3 million and has recorded a year-to-date (YTD) gain of $143 million.</p>
<p>On the geographical front, Canada recorded the highest inflow of $79 million while Germany and the United States saw $56.9 million and $53.5 million. On the other side of the divide, Switzerland, Australia, and Sweden recorded outflows.</p>

<p>South Africa‚Äôs financial regulator, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) is set to review the applications of 36 cryptocurrency companies seeking operational licenses in the country this month.</p>
<p>According to a report <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cryptocurrency/517973-major-update-on-crypto-asset-service-provider-licensing-in-south-africa.html">published by local media sources</a>, the regulator will commence the review process this month after it received 138 license proposals from firms seeking to become crypto asset service providers (CASP).</p>
<p>The FSCA will use several guideline principles including market participation, consumer protection, and risk management to find eligible firms for the licenses.</p>
<p>According to the report, the body disclosed that it received 93 applications in October and 128 as of Nov 30 marking the final day of applications and opening up the record process.</p>
<p>Of the submitted applications, 19 were withdrawn as a result of a lack of experience and improper operational policies, procedures, and repeated factors.</p>
<h2>South Africa to focus on investor safety</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per the report, the government will look at the range of services provided by the companies, particularly the number, quality, and if they offer tools that support the general market like payment and custodial rails. Experts say this would increase safe investment in the country as its digital asset users grow.</p>
<p>The companies will be assessed by their level of internal regulation as Know-your-customer (KYC) requirements will be taken into consideration alongside conflicts of interest, disclosures, etc.</p>
<p>Cyber risk management to protect users will be looked into with credit counterparty risk management and complaint handling to avoid issues of consumer dissatisfaction and weakened investor confidence in the market.</p>
<p>All this is required as the local market grows in light of the recently released study by the regulator. The study shows a growth in monthly transaction volumes marking the highest point in the country with the total figure at ZAR8 billion.</p>

<h2>Other countries to emulate MiCA</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The digital asset market has faced multiple incidents of scams in recent years leading to increased regulatory pressure on the markets which many have argued for and against across crypto spaces.</p>
<p>The major incident that drove this push was the fall of the Terra Network and the subsequent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">implosion of FTX</a> occasioning billions of losses and swirling the regulatory hammer around stablecoin and virtual asset exchanges.</p>
<p>As African countries shape up their regulatory framework, experts including several blockchain associations have pointed to the European model; the Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-framework-signed-into-law-by-eu-officials.htm">MiCA</a>) as the guiding framework in terms of stakeholder collaboration and cross-country partnerships to create the landmark rules.</p>
<p>The body will determine the application of 76 licenses as follows; 36 crypto firm assessments will be released at the Licensing Executive meeting on Dec 12 while 22 firm applications will be on Feb 13 2024 at the licensing meeting.</p>

<p>A malicious actor has stolen over $2 million from Safe Wallet users in the past week through address poisoning theft raising the total victim count to 21.¬†</p>
<p>Several blockchain security firms have tracked suspected activity from different transactions resulting in losses from Safe Wallet totaling $2 million.</p>
<p>On Dec 3 cryptocurrency scam detection platform, Sacm Sniffer <a href="https://twitter.com/realscamsniffer/status/1731236292166590507?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">wrote on X (formerly Twitter)</a> that about 20 wallets have lost $2.05 million last from address poisoning attacks adding that the same attacker was responsible for draining $5 million from 21 users in the last four months.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">about ~10 Safe wallets have lost $2.05 million to &quot;address poisoning&quot; attacks in the past week.</p>
<p>the same attacker has stolen $5 million from ~21 victims in the past four months so far. <a href="https://t.co/fu4kxaI3py">pic.twitter.com/fu4kxaI3py</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) <a href="https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1731236292166590507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Dune analytics also <a href="https://dune.com/scamsniffer/address-poisoning-attack">reported the development</a> from Scam Sniffer posting the affected wallets and time range of stolen assets with the source pointing to address poisoning.</p>
<p>Address poisoning is an old tactic deployed by bad actors to deceive users into <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/address-poisoning-crypto">sending assets to the wrong wallets</a>. It entails a hacker creating an almost similar address usually with the same start and end characters.</p>
<p>The scammer then proceeds to ‚Äúpoison‚Äù the transaction history by sending funds of almost similar amounts regularly to the destination wallet in a bid to make the victim copy the scammer&#8217;s wallet from the transaction history and send new funds to the address.</p>
<h2>Florence Finance saga¬†</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last week, Scam Sniffer also reported another case of address poisoning involving a bad actor carting away <a href="https://drops.scamsniffer.io/post/multiple-safe-wallets-lose-2-million-to-address-poisoning-attacks/">$1.5 million worth of assets</a>. Florence Finance is reported to have the funds from Safe Wallet to the address that contaminated the transfer history.</p>
<p>In the calculated move, the malicious actor deployed a contaminated address generated by create2 before converting the address to DAI to prevent a freeze after taking hold of the asset.</p>
<p>This type of incident has occurred previously as Scam Sniffer reported that SlowMist shared a similar transaction involving create3 with asset losses of $1.66 million.</p>
<p>According to the blockchain security firm, the UI of the transaction history shows the last four digits of the wallet addresses are closely related leading to the victim copying the address.¬†</p>
<p>It was also pointed out that a particular user was quite lucky as the wallet was seen to hold $10 million in total assets but only $400,000 was lost due to the address poisoning.</p>
<h2>Users to take extra caution to change the tide</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In recent years, there has been a surge in cryptocurrency scams causing millions of losses, weakened investor confidence, and more regulatory scrutiny.¬†</p>
<p>While hackers deploy a range of tactics to drain virtual asset platforms, some incidents can be prevented or reduced by proper monitoring and added checks by the platform and users.¬†</p>
<p>Platforms can send a reminder each time a transfer is made to a new wallet while users should rely on something other than transaction history and always carry out a cross-validation. </p>

<p>Popular Bitcoin (BTC) critic Alex De Vries says the asset uses about 16,000 liters of water which can fill a pool for each transaction on the network, a claim that has sparked diverse reactions.¬†</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-sustainability/fulltext/S2949-7906(23)00004-6">study released</a> on Nov 29, De Vries opined that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has a growing water footprint in addition to its already existing high energy usage. The claims have received several reactions including pushbacks by pro-BTC commentators and support from some analysts.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú<i>Due to growing international concerns around drinking water availability, it is crucial to understand the water footprint of Bitcoin mining and its potential impact. Siddik et al. estimate that Bitcoin mining was responsible for consuming 1,572.3 gigaliters (GL) of water in 2021.‚Äù</i></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the report, BTC&#8217;s water footprint has surged in recent years as adoption and mining activity continue to grow. The network recorded a surge of water usage by 166%¬† in 2021 compared to 2020 figures.</p>
<p>Notably, 2021 was essentially a bull market that saw the asset tap its all-time high boosting the overall ecosystem. While the water footprint in 2021 stood at 1,573.7 GL, it was a mere 591.2 GL the previous year.</p>
<p>The combination of cooling systems and indirect sources is the reason behind the huge numbers. However, the trend can be reversed by immersion cooling and moving to sources that do not require fresh water and an ultimate change in network software.</p>
<p>The report comes at a time when Bitcoin miners are already facing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uzbekistan-permits-only-legal-entities-mine-cryptocurrencies-using-solar-power.htm">headwinds from regulators</a> over its high energy usage compared to several countries. Authorities and climate activists continue to mount pressure on miners by issuing outright bans, resuming energy supply, and imposing taxes to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>In 2021, China banned digital asset mining activities citing climate concerns setting the time for other government sanctions. This year, Kazakhstan has reduced the supply of electricity to Bitcoin miners while the White House attempted to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/white-house-council-reignites-30-percent-tax-crypto-mining.htm">impose a 30% cryptocurrency mining tax.</a></p>
<h2>More regulations? Analysts are divided¬†</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some Analysts have said the study might impact the industry negatively as tighter mining regulations would be imposed. However, others wrote it off calling the comparison unfair adding that he has always been a Bitcoin critic.¬†</p>

<p>Similarly, Daniel Batten added that De Vries has a niche for making widely inaccurate statements about Bitcoin coupled with the fact that he is a staff of the Dutch central bank and a long-standing critic of the top cryptocurrency. </p>

<p>Celsius&#8217; Bitcoin (BTC) mining plans face obstacles as a United States judge hints at a possible new vote to clear deviations.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/celsius-network-faces-roadblocks-pivot-bitcoin-mining-2023-11-30/">Reuters report </a>on Nov 30, Celsius may require another creditor vote to change its business operations from a lending and staking enterprise to a digital asset mining model.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174911302380000000037.pdf">released plans to operate as a mining company</a> after the bankruptcy case to avoid regulatory scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amid other concerns.</p>
<p>US Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn who oversees the judicial process noted a deviation from the terms creditors voted on and what is being considered by the company.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú<i>This is not the deal that the creditors voted on. The revised deal could face substantial opposition&#8221; from creditors.‚Äù¬†</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The main issue in the agreement is a potential resistance from creditors which could take the process multiple steps backwards as the Judge urges the company to reach an agreement with the SEC.</p>
<p>Although the Commission didn‚Äôt expressly reject the company‚Äôs plan, Celsius stated that the financial regulator may be unwilling to approve a deal that includes staking and lending-related activities which it has opposed in the country citing improper registrations.</p>
<h2>Celsius pleads case</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The crypto lender argued through its attorney Chris Koenig at a court session on Thursday that there isn‚Äôt a need for another vote as this deal is good for all creditors because it affords the company the ability to pivot into a mining business.</p>
<p>The company might see this as a clear pathway towards a more sustainable future as mining operations may not come under further regulatory pressure by the SEC which has fined Kraken over its staking activities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kraken will pay $30 million to settle US SEC allegations that it broke securities rules with its crypto-asset staking products <a href="https://t.co/pNF6QeXm0k">https://t.co/pNF6QeXm0k</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Some analysts also argue that Bitcoin mining is currently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miners-daily-profits-top-44-million-reaches-highest-point-since-april-2022.htm">profitable at the moment</a> after several months in the woods with rising asset prices wiping out losses recorded last year. Miners remained underwater throughout last year with many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miners-daily-profits-top-44-million-reaches-highest-point-since-april-2022.htm">thinking outside the box</a> to stay afloat deploying measures including selling BTC reserves, pivoting to Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing, and selling assets.</p>
<p>Two customers expressed their dissent to the procedure asking for a full liquidation of the company.</p>
<p>Under the company‚Äôs former bankruptcy agreement, the new operation was expected to see $225 million in digital assets which would be managed by Fahrenheit. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/court-approves-celsius-networks-bankruptcy-exit-transition-to-bitcoin-miner.htm">new deal will give its creditors </a>a 67% recovery as opposed to 61.2% under the previous deal.</p>
<p>US Bitcoin Corp, a company in the consortium together with Arrington Capital will manage the company&#8217;s mining business going forward.</p>

<p>The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has partnered with the Algorand Foundation to launch a blockchain academy in a bid to train staff on the technology.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Algorand Impact Summit on Nov 30, Robert Pasicko, a UNDP expert announced the partnership to drive sustainable development as the agency performs its core functions including poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-nations-development-programme-partners-with-algorand-to-launch-a-blockchain-academy-302001081.html">press release</a>, the Algorand Foundation, the body responsible for the development of the Algorand network, will launch a blockchain academy in 2024 to equip over 22,000 UNDP employees globally with associated skills.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú<i>The Algorand Blockchain Academy will launch in 2024 and is designed to bolster UNDP staff capacity through education and training in blockchain technology and its practical applications for sustainable development.‚Äù</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>DLT education for sustainable development</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The distributed ledger technology (DLT) education program will consist of lectures, assignments, and workshops tailored for employees across 170 countries.</p>
<p>Duro Unger-Lee the head of education at Algorand noted that the partnership with UNDP will drive innovation in many ways for the good of most communities.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú<i>We see this education and tooling initiative as a critical first step toward identifying and delivering actionable, on-the-ground use-cases of blockchain to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in a number of areas.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Pasicko also added that blockchain technology will be used to address complex global challenges with workers acquiring the necessary skills.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>We are thrilled to be in a position to leverage the credibility and expertise of the Algorand Foundation and key members of their ecosystem in order to upskill, empower, and inspire UN practitioners around the world,‚Äù </i>he added</p>
<h2>Blockchain to solve global problems</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Over the years, several international organizations have leveraged DLT to solve problems in diverse industries leading to wider research and adoption of the technology.</p>
<p>The recent Algorand and UNDP partnership highlights four cardinal issues; financial inclusion, supply chain transparency, real-world asset tokenization, and digital identity.</p>
<p>As the UNDP goes on its social welfare mission, people in disadvantaged rural areas need to be brought into fiscal planning and development to reverse the trend of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/blockchain-technology-future-of-latin-americas-financial-system.htm">unbanked population</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bringing financial services closer to every community will solve poverty in many ways as people will have the right incentives to create businesses to cater to people in border towns.</p>
<p>For more efficiency, supply chain transparency is needed to tackle production and distribution issues. From food production to pharmaceuticals, blockchain can automate the entire process, saving costs and expanding businesses.</p>
<p>There is also a recurring issue of fake and substandard products which can be solved by utilizing DLT from production to retail stores.</p>
<p>As big traditional finance firms move towards tokenization of assets, the United Nations and other international organizations look to bring the initiative to more countries as part of broader plans toward sustainability.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brazil-issue-digital-ids-for-its-214-million-citizens-using-blockchain-technology.htm">digital identities</a> will be created to ease agency operations in multiple countries.</p>

<p>The number of Canadian cryptocurrency users has dropped in 2023 due to bear market fears and wider macroeconomic factors, a new survey shows.</p>
<p>A Crypto Asset Survey <a href="https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-11/inv-research_20231129_crypto-asset-survey-2023.pdf">published by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC)</a> was conducted to show consumer interaction with virtual assets, investment experience, major drivers, and key market determinants.</p>
<p>According to the survey, Canadian ownership of digital assets fell from 13% in 2022 to 10% this year, signaling a poor trend some experts say was caused by plunging prices due to the bear market and tightening regulations.</p>
<h2>Virtual asset utility plummets among holders</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Participants hold the view that digital assets would not play a major role in sectors of the economy as was previously touted. Last year, 38% of the country believed that assets would be instrumental in the future of finance but presently only 26%.</p>
<p>Despite this, 34% of citizens believe the tide will turn in the future while 49% of users who held they believe in 2022. A shocking revelation by the survey in the declining interest of Canadians is that average ownership per user has increased.</p>
<p>This means that while the average number of users left the market, the remaining holders significantly increased their holdings as the mean market value surged to $82,992 this year from $52,975 in 2022.</p>
<p>Most notably, 77% of Canadian citizens regret being exposed to digital assets, a growth from 68% last year as the majority say their assets are not performing as they have anticipated.</p>
<p>In terms of exposure, over 50% of the country has a full grasp on the sector which often translates to increased adoption. A recent report by the Bank of Canada also shows that the country‚Äôs Central Bank Digital Currency (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/CBDC/">CBDC</a>) project is not widely anticipated as users still prefer utilizing current payment options.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Canadians point to the crypto winter</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The 2021 bull market led to a massive adoption across many jurisdictions as several assets climbed to new all-time highs and institutional investors showed a renewed stance in the market. The bull run led to many projections of users in traditional finance and increased decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers.</p>
<p>However, the following year was riddled with huge market crashes led by the Terra Network and subsequently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">FTX implosions which wiped billions</a> off the market cap.</p>
<p>These events led to lower investor confidence with several traders recording losses coupled with regulators clamping down on most sectors of the market.</p>
<p>As a result, the prices of top assets including Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) plummeted over 55%. This year has seen a major price uptick with several assets rebounding over 100% but most users are still in losses because they invested in 2021 amid high prices.</p>

<p>Antpool has announced steps to give back 83 Bitcoin (BTC) paid in error as a transaction fee to the user days after the incident.¬†</p>
<p>Blockchain security firm, PeckShield <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshieldalert/status/1730160502951829681?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">posted an update from Antpool on X</a> (formerly Twitter) on the 83 BTC gas fee which sparked diverse reactions across cryptocurrency circles.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update <a href="https://t.co/iDooDKJ0ts">pic.twitter.com/iDooDKJ0ts</a></p>
<p>&mdash; PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1730160502951829681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The mining pool stated that it would refund the fee demanding the affected user to contact them while fulfilling certain requirements to determine ownership of the asset.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Dear users, on November 23rd, some user submitted 83 BTC as gas fee. The risk control system of Antpool temporarily froze the fee when packaging the transaction. Please contact us before 00:00 (UTC+8) on December 10 2023 and verify personal identity in the following way. After verification, Antpool will refund the fee.‚Äù¬†</i></p>
<p>According to the update, the steps to be followed include the preparation of a signing tool which could be Bitcoin Core or Electrum after which the affected user is expected to use the private key of the wallet to sign a message ‚ÄúAntpool‚Äù and then forward signed text to the customer support; <a href="mailto:support@antpool.com">support@antpool.com</a>.¬†</p>
<h2>$3.1 million in transaction fees¬†</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On Nov 23, the crypto ecosystem was hit with the news of a Bitvoiner who <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoiner-pays-3-1-million-transaction-fee-analysts-debate-possible-factors.htm">spent 83 BTC approximately $3.1 million</a> on transfer fees. The user was making a transfer of 139 BTC and parted away with 83 BTC leaving the recipient with 55.77 BTC.¬†</p>
<p>Antpool mined the specific block and has now released new information on the return process. At the time the whole community and experts shared their opinion on the issue that led to one of the highest transaction fees.</p>
<p>Initial analysts pointed to the replace-by-fee feature which allows transactions in the mempool to be replaced by another for a higher fee.¬†</p>
<p>Developer Mononaut posted on X that the affected may not have known that orders cannot be canceled and might have made those transactions with hopes of cancellation.</p>
<h2>Antpool follows precedents¬†</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
When such mistakes occur, the mining pool usually refunds the user if possible although in some cases, the users were only able to recover 50% of assets. In September, Paxos paid a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/500000-bitcoin-fee-blunder-paxos-revealed-as-responsible-party.htm">$500,000 transaction fee</a> to move 2,000 worth of assets.</p>
<p>Days later, the miner who received the fee announced the return to the company although many users joked that the assets should be shared among the community.¬†</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was annoyed and regretted agreeing to refund that 20 BTC. Especially when I saw the person claiming it kept saying EST instead of EDT/UTC. Last time a Zcash guy did that, I blocked his entire company.</p>
<p>Ref:<a href="https://t.co/MQh0ijLR11">https://t.co/MQh0ijLR11</a><a href="https://t.co/lxtcFH9mq3">https://t.co/lxtcFH9mq3</a></p>
<p>So what should I do?</p>
<p>&mdash; Chun (@satofishi) <a href="https://twitter.com/satofishi/status/1702095123981738437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A user claimed to be the victim of the 83 BTC transfer fee claiming a hack resulted in the expensive gas fee.¬†</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú<i>It was my BTC that paid the high fee. I created a new cold wallet, transferred 139BTC to it and it got transferred out to another wallet immediately.¬†</i><i>I can only imagine that someone was running a script on that wallet and that the script had a weird fee calculation.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Canadians are less enthusiastic about a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) opting for traditional payment methods despite wider awareness, a new survey shows.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Forum-Research-Digital-Canadian-Dollar-Consultation-Report.pdf">Digital Canadian Dollar Public Consultation Report</a> published by the Bank of Canada highlighted the overall sentiments of consumers towards a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/CBDC/">CBDC</a> in light of recent blockchain activities and future payment initiatives.</p>
<p>Generally, Canadians do not embrace the technology,¬† as anticipated by pro-CBDC experts casting negative light on the current state of the technology.</p>
<p>According to the survey that took responses from 89,423 participants, 95% have heard about the CBDC or possess sufficient information on how the technology worked showing massive public awareness.</p>
<p>In most cases, massive public awareness of 95% is expected to trickle into a larger adoption but that might not be the case for a Canadian CBDC as consumers want other options.</p>
<h2>Participants want laws to protect cash as a payment option</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per the study, a large portion of participants prefer cash transactions and push for laws to mandate merchants to accept cash during transactions despite the growing popularity of digital payments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137929" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd.webp" alt="" width="1189" height="858" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd.webp 1189w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd-300x216.webp 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd-1024x739.webp 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701341795-80661216-b32a-45a2-80dc-d612e7336fdd-768x554.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1189px) 100vw, 1189px" /></p>
<p>This sentiment has also been shared in the United Kingdom where the public consultation also revealed that users fear that digital payment systems may replace cash calling on authorities to protect the payment option.</p>
<p>However, financial authorities explained that a potential digital pound will not replace cash as a payment option but complement it as the jurisdiction seeks ways for faster and seamless cross-border settlements.</p>
<p>Over 82% of respondents said that the Bank of Canada should not research the capabilities of the CBDC as they chose their current payment methods. The respondents also noted that they didn‚Äôt expect the public survey to sway the bank‚Äôs drive toward the CBDC.</p>
<p>On the country‚Äôs cryptocurrency usage, 15% of the respondents hold digital assets with that demographic more open to support a state-backed digital currency.</p>
<p>Participants express their hope for widely accepted CBDC to benefit and lean towards privacy and security in the utility of the currency.</p>
<p>Consumers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/europes-data-agencies-express-concerns-over-privacy-standards-with-digital-euro.htm">flagging privacy concerns</a> has been the norm in recent weeks with users saying central banks should not gather additional details of their transactions in a bid to monitor their behaviour. Authorities have also dismissed this fear assuring users of anonymity.</p>
<h2>Mixed feelings for the future</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although the reports of the survey show low expectations, pro-CBDC experts view the technology as a potential game changer in finance with a wider reach to disadvantaged users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, opinion surveys suggest that the government will do more to educate on the utility of the technology and not just a replacement for private cryptocurrencies.¬† Canadian authorities have issued several regulations on the stablecoins and the larger crypto ecosystem citing investor protection concerns.</p>
<p>In August, a Bank of Canada <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sdp2023-15.pdf">report showed that citizens were not incentivized</a> to use a CBDC as the majority of the population had good access to financial services.</p>

<p>The Bank for International Settlement (BIS) has released the final report on Project Tourbillion, its privacy-inclined Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project.</p>
<p>A Nov 29 release shows a pathway to <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp80.pdf">achieving privacy standards</a> in CBDC deployment and usage with two prototypes; eCash 1.0 and eCash 2.0 alongside other features geared towards anonymity.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Project Tourbillon introduces a new privacy paradigm that balances user needs and public policy objectives: payer anonymity. For example, a consumer who pays a merchant using CBDCs does not disclose personal information to anyone, including the merchant, banks, and the central bank.‚Äù</i></p>
<p>The project highlights privacy, security, and scalability as key components in rolling out a new model <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/CBDC/">CBDC</a> to allay the fears of the public.</p>
<h2>Basic attributes dominate two models</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Payer anonymity is central to the project as it protects the payer&#8217;s data and limited information about the payee. While the payer remains protected, the identity of the merchant is revealed to the payer but remains only disclosed to the central bank.</p>
<p>The Central will not see personal payment data as it monitors circulation in the applied jurisdiction. The authors noted that the move seeks to create safe digital currency with regulatory clamping down on illicit transactions without jeopardizing user privacy.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú<i>A consumer paying a merchant with CBDCs is anonymous to all parties, including the merchant, banks, and the central bank.‚Äù</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This model also integrates security features to ensure confidentiality and prevent incidents of cyber threats while projecting scalability at all times.</p>
<p>Scalability remains pivotal in creating cross-border payment systems as they need to adjust to different mechanisms without endangering performance, especially in peak seasons characterized by huge transactions.</p>
<p>The first prototype eCash 1.0 aims at unconditional payment anonymity and when deposits are made to a merchant, the Central Bank adds it to a list of spent assets to prevent double-spending and counterfeit transactions.</p>
<p>eCash 2.0 model stores unspent notes onboarding more security features while leaning towards privacy. Despite this, there is a requirement for users to fulfill the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements at a chosen commercial bank to use the digital currency.</p>
<p>The bank remains responsible for the consumer data throughout the process as is the case with traditional finance models.</p>
<h2>Privacy fears continue in Europe</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/100000-south-koreans-will-start-using-cbdc-next-year.htm">rapid development of CBDCs</a> has been celebrated by users across several jurisdictions although skeptics argue about loopholes in the existing models.</p>
<p>Privacy is the top of consumer fears in Europe with data agencies issuing statements on potential violations proposing new models for financial authorities in the region.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>United Kingdom users have also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-residents-flags-privacy-concerns-in-digital-pound-consultations-bank-of-england.htm">expressed fears of possible privacy violations</a> although authorities have assured that the models proposed remove associated risks.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines has warned users that cryptocurrency exchange, Binance is operating without the required license.</p>
<p>In a Nov 28 <a href="https://www.sec.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023Advisory-against-Binance.pdf">press release</a>, the regulator stated that the exchange lacks authorization to sell securities to the public in the Philippines adding that users should exercise caution.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Based on the Commission‚Äôs database, the operator of the platform BINANCE is NOT REGISTERED as a corporation in the Philippines and OPERATES WITHOUT THE NECESSARY LICENSE AND/OR AUTHORITY to sell or offer any form of securities as defined under Section 3.1 of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC), to engage in the business of buying or selling securities‚Äù¬†</i></p>
<p>The Commission noted that its primary investigations reveal that Binance has conducted several promotional campaigns on social media to attract Filipinos to invest and trade securities or other assets on the platform.¬†</p>
<h2>Facilitators risk fines and jail time¬†</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the regulators, the website of the exchange stated that it facilitates trades among a wide range of products including spot leveraged trading, options, and derivatives and while it may be registered in other jurisdictions, the exchange lacks such standing in the country.</p>
<p>As the global exchange cannot establish and operate by offering services to local markets, the SEC urged to exercise full caution before making any exposure to ‚Äú<i>unregistered online investment platforms.‚Äù</i></p>
<p>The regulatory body warned individuals and entities who aid the company in its operations in the country would be liable to twenty-one years in prison, five million pesos, or both.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶<i>those who act as salesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers of the BINANCE platform in selling or convincing people to invest in this platform within the Philippines even through online means may be held criminally liable under Section 28 of the SRC and be penalized with a maximum fine of Five Million Pesos (P 5,000,000.00) or imprisonment of Twenty One (21) years or both.‚Äù¬†</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>Binance is still in the regulatory web</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per the statement, investment products can only be sold in the country if the securities offered to the public have been registered with the SEC through a written filed application with all relevant information attached.</p>
<p>Also, the issuer must be a licensed dealer registered in the Philippines and must possess a secondary license to trade securities.</p>
<p>In recent months, Binance has been at the center of several regulatory investigations as officials allege a lack of proper regulations. The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-binance-sued-by-cftc-over-offering-unregistered-crypto-derivate-trading-products-us.htm">filed a lawsuit against the company</a> for offering products targeted at U.S. consumers without registration.</p>
<p>This development comes amid the Binance-DOJ investigation in the U.S. that has seen CEO Changpeng Zhao now out pleading guilty as part of a wider $4.3 billion settlement that rocked the industry last week.¬†</p>
