<p>Blue-chip cryptocurrency markets are pumping on Monday led by Bitcoin (BTC), which just surpassed $42,000 for the first time since April 2022, taking its four-day run of gains to move than 10%.</p>
<p>A cocktail of bullish catalysts are being cited as supporting the BTC rally, including; 1) ongoing optimism for near-term <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> which is pumping optimism about institutional adoption, 2) an improving macro outlook as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-waller-increasingly-confident-policy-is-right-spot-2023-11-28/">investors bet a Fed rate cutting cycle is near</a>, 3) chatter about <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/qatars-sovereign-wealth-fund-dives-into-bitcoin-with-potential-500b-investment-confirmed-news-or-just-rumors.htm">Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund stepping in to buy BTC</a>, and other factors such as bullish technicals and the upcoming BTC halving.</p>
<p>Bitcoin bulls will be expecting a near-term test of the next major resistance level just under $43,000 within days, and possibly a retest of 2022 highs around $48,000 before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was last up 3% in the past 24 hours and at fresh yearly highs above $2,200.</p>
<p>While the near-term outlook for major cryptocurrencies is strong, investors looking to secure quick exponential gains will continue to turn to the highly illiquid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers as per decentralized exchange analytics website <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/gainers">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>10000X ($10000X)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called 10000X ($10000X) that was launched last week has seen an impressive 800% pump in the past 24 hours according to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x830590df97b5a181ecc665f94e5287b75692606c">DEXTools</a>, making it one of the best-performing shitcoins of the day.</p>
<p>$10000X last had a market cap of around $250,000, with over $175,000 having changed hands in the past 24 hours and the token having accumulated over 300 holders and nearly $300,000 in liquidity.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools’ security audit, the token has three smart contract alerts, so investors should exerice caution that the token might be a scam.</p>
<h2><strong>Baby Grok ($BABYGROK)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called Baby Grok has pumped up an impressive 500% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xf77c0c6d0484a7be578f5b7619bce92698e30dc3">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>$BABYGROK last had a market cap of around $4.4 million, with the token having accumulated over 900 holders.</p>
<p>Bulls should be aware that the latest price pump has been driven by just $265,000 in 24 hour trading volumes and liquidity is thin at just $110,000, so a few big sell orders could quickly see all recent gains reversed.</p>
<h2><strong>Safefloki ($SaFLok)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A new shitcoin called Safefloki ($SaFLok) has exploded up more than 300% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x5436e99b04cffd08fb20b2841c0485ee826a1c2a">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The token last had a market cap of around $165,000, locked liquidity of around $156,000, just under 250 holders and an impressive $670,000 in 24-hour trading volumes.</p>
<p>But investors should be wary of three concerning aspects to its smart contract, as identified in DEXTools’ security audit, including the potential that the token is a so-called “honeypot” scam.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139141" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701716158-ftt.png" alt="" width="923" height="522" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701716158-ftt.png 923w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701716158-ftt-300x170.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701716158-ftt-768x434.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701716158-ftt-150x85.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px" /></p>
<p>So-called “scandal” tokens are seeing a massive pump as risk appetite in the broader crypto market amps up as Bitcoin (BTC) hits fresh highs for the year above $42,000.</p>
<p>Scandal tokens are cryptocurrencies/tokens associated with failed or defunct crypto projects/firms that were struck down by high-profile scandals.</p>
<p>While the failure of their associated project/firm renders these tokens pretty much useless and worthless, speculators still view them as potentially offering short-term trading opportunities.</p>
<p>One feature of such coins as that they are often heavily shorted, raising the prospect of a potential short squeeze.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the best scandal coins to buy now.</p>
<h2><strong>FTT Token ($FTT)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
$FTT, the utility token that used to offer its holders various trading benefits on FTX’s now failed and defunct exchange has been forming an ascending triangle in recent weeks.</p>
<p>These chart patterns tend to form ahead of bullish breakouts.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-indicates-ftx-revival-ftt-rallies.htm">Assuming FTT does break higher</a>, a more than 2x rally back towards $10 per token could be on the cards.</p>
<p>Of course, owning FTT remains highly risky, given the token has lost all of its original utility thanks to FTX’s downfall.</p>
<h2><strong>Terra Luna Classic (LUNC)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-lunc-becomes-best-performer-of-the-week-1-lunc-incoming.htm">Terra Luna Classic (LUNC)</a>, the cryptocurrency that powers the original Terra blockchain that experienced a spectacular blowup in May 2022, has been enjoying a spectacular resurgence in recent days.</p>
<p>At the current price of $0.00025, LUNC is up nearly 400% since its October lows.</p>
<p>Analysts have cited various factors such as plans to revive the Terra blockchain’s stablecoin UST to its 1:1 peg by buying up Bitcoin and continued support and burns from Binance as helping the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>However, it remains a highly risky bet as very few people or crypto market participants continue to use the blockchain in wake of 2022’s disaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Terra Luna (LUNA)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-re-enters-top-100-crypto-as-inqubeta-qube-smashes-5-6-million-presale-mark.htm">LUNA</a>, the cryptocurrency that powers the new Terra blockchain launched by Terraform Labs in the immediate aftermath of the original Terra ecosystem’s block-up but has since been wracked with scandal amid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-faces-fraud-charges-new-york-following-arrest-montenegro.htm">Terra creator Do Kwon’s arrest</a>, has also been pumping in recent days.</p>
<p>LUNA was last just above $1.0 per token, up around 2.5x since October.</p>
<p>Like the Terra Luna Classic blockchain, very few crypto market participants are using the blockchain, so it remains a highly risky bet.</p>
<h2><strong>Better Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While the possibility of a short-squeeze means the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies could offer good short-term gains, they remain highly risky.</p>
<p>Investors looking for an even better chance of making quick gains with coins that aren’t linked to high-profile scandals should check out some of the top presale projects.</p>
<p>Here are some of cryptonews.com’s favorite up-and-coming projects.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</strong></p>
<p>Despite only launching its presale a few weeks ago, Bitcoin ETF Token has already been able to pull in over $2.7 million from investors because of its audacious pitch into the lucrative Bitcoin ETF theme that underpins the current crypto rally.</p>
<p>$BTCETF is also garnering attention because of its DeFi attributes.</p>
<p>$BTCETF tokens can be bought in presale today and staked to earn an annual percentage yield currently sitting at 487%, as per the project’s official staking <a href="https://btcetftoken.io/en/dashboard">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Buy BTCETF Here</a></p>
<h2><strong>Meme Kombat ($MK)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another exciting new presale that has been generating a lot of hype recently has been for a crypto start-up called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a>.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat blend together the world of crypto gaming and gambling with its exciting platform were users are able to bet on the outcomes of exciting battles between characters based on some of the crypto world’s most popular meme coins.</p>
<p>Early $MK investors can also benefit from generous staking rewards, which are currently more than 100% annually.</p>
<p>The project has already raised close to $2.4 million, despite launching just weeks ago.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin (BTC) price, which briefly surpassed $42,000 on Monday for the first time since April 2022, has risen back above El Salvador’s average purchase price, putting the emerging Central American nation’s crypto bet back in the green.</p>
<p>El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele proclaimed via a tweet on X earlier on Monday that the nation’s BTC “investments are in the black!”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">El Salvador&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> investments are in the black!</p>
<p>After literally thousands of articles and hit pieces that ridiculed our supposed losses, all of which were calculated based on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>’s market price at the time&#8230;</p>
<p>With the current <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> market price, if we were to sell… <a href="https://t.co/gvl2GfQMfb">pic.twitter.com/gvl2GfQMfb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1731653743668572498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bukele hit back at the “literally thousands” of articles that had been written about El Salvador’s supposed paper losses on its BTC investments in the past, all of which had cited the current Bitcoin market price.</p>
<p>He noted that at the current market price (in the mid-$41,000s at the time of his tweet), El Salvador is now sat on a tidy profit of $3.6 million.</p>
<p>As per a screenshot shared by the president detailing the nation’s BTC portfolio, El Salvador current owns around $130 million worth of BTC, having bought the cryptocurrency at an average price of $40,479 over the past two years.</p>
<p>El Salvador is estimated to own around 2,750 BTC.</p>
<h2><strong>Will President Nayib Bukele Sell BTC Holdings?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“We have no intention of selling… that has never been our objective” Bukele was keen to emphasise.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware that the price will continue to fluctuate in the future, this doesn’t affect our long-term strategy”.</p>
<p>Bukele has long been an avid supporter of Bitcoin, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-as-legal-tender-el-salvadors-risky-financial-maneuver-struggles-to-pay-off.htm">introducing the cryptocurrency as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021</a> and offering technical support for Bitcoin integration into the country’s economy.</p>
<p>Bukele believes Bitcoin offers countries such as El Salvador a chance to escape from the dominance of the inflationary US dollar.</p>
<p>Assuming the Bitcoin bull run continues, which seems likely as a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-with-rates-peak-now-looks-hold-an-eventual-pivot-lower-2023-12-04/">dovish pivot in Fed policy</a> seemingly nears and as institutional adoption <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">optimism grows with spot Bitcoin ETFs expected to soon gain approval in the US</a>, other South American nations such as Argentina may be eyeing making a similar Bitcoin bet.</p>
<p>Libertarian Argentinian President-elect Javier Milei has promised to dismantle to country’s central bank as the nation experiences triple-digit annual inflation, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pro-bitcoin-javier-milei-wins-argentina-presidential-elections.htm">is a known fan of Bitcoin.</a></p>

<p>Well-known Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist Max Keiser tweeted on X late on Sunday that Qatar could be a big bullish driver for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, suggesting that rumors are getting “very loud” that the country’s sovereign wealth fund could be looking to scoop up $500 billion of BTC.</p>

<p>While the rumours around Qatar’s plans to enter the bitcoin market remain unconfirmed and have not been reported widely yet amongst by reputable crypto news outlets as fact, speculation that major sovereign wealth funds are looking to enter the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC market</a> is likely having a positive effect on the price action.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-breaks-through-42000-up-6-6-in-24-hours.htm">surpassed $42,000 on Monday for the first time since April 2022</a> and at current levels in the $41,600s, is up around 5% in the last 24 hours and more than 10% in the past four days.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">BTC’s</a> latest pump higher comes amid 1) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-waller-increasingly-confident-policy-is-right-spot-2023-11-28/">dovish bets that the US Federal Reserve will be cutting interest rates</a> within the coming quarters, 2) ongoing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">optimism that spot Bitcoin ETFs will soon gain approval in the US</a>, home to the world’s largest and most liquid financial markets.</p>
<p>Other bullish narratives, such as the upcoming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> next April and the fact that BTC appears to be following almost perfectly in the footsteps of its classic roughly four-year market cycle (which involves a one-year bear market followed by a three-year bull market), are also likely acting as tailwinds.</p>
<p>Bullish short-term technical developments add further weight to the bullish thesis – BTC recently broke convincingly to the north of an ascending triangle pattern, and the cryptocurrency has consistently held above its 21DMA in recent weeks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139123" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1.png" alt="" width="947" height="627" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1.png 947w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1-300x199.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1-768x508.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701712245-btc-1-150x99.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" /></p>
<p>Late April 2022 highs close to $43,000 are the next notable level of resistance for the bulls to target, though BTC appears odds on to test 2022 highs in the $48,000 area within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s tone on the risks faced by the US economy just shifted in a dovish direction, spurring a pump in the price of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) to new yearly highs at $39,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/powell-says-fed-move-carefully-interest-rates-with-risks-more-balanced-2023-12-01/">Powell noted</a> that risks that the Fed doesn’t raise interest rates enough to combat inflation versus the risk that it over-tightens and unnecessarily weakens the economy have become more balanced.</p>
<p>His comments come after recent economic data has shown the US economy cooling and with a key metric of US inflation (the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-spending-slows-october-weekly-jobless-claims-rise-slightly-2023-11-30/">Core PCE Price Index</a>) averaging 2.5% annualized over the past six months.</p>
<p>Previously, Powell had been amongst the Fed policymakers warning that further interest rate hikes remained likely, and his shift in tone comes after his normally hawkish Fed policymaker colleague <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-waller-increasingly-confident-policy-is-right-spot-2023-11-28/">Christopher Waller</a> said earlier in the week that the argument for rate cuts in 2024 was building.</p>
<p>Powell’s remarks sent US stock prices higher and bond yields tumbling as investors ramped up bets on rate cuts to begin in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">CME’s Fed Watch Tool</a>, the money market implied likelihood of the Fed cutting interest rates back to 5.00-5.25% from 5.25-5.5% by March rose to over 60% on Friday from under 45% on Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a>, still viewed by many as a risk sensitive asset, has typically in recent years had a positive correlation to US stock prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has also benefitted in an environment of easing financial conditions, characterized by falling bond yields and rising liquidity.</p>
<p>A rate cutting cycle would be expected to trigger a substantial easing of financial conditions that could be a major bullish driver for the Bitcoin price.</p>
<h2><strong>Where is Bitcoin (BTC) Headed Next?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As rate cut expectations rise and, with it, expectations for a more Bitcoin-favorable liquidity backdrop, macro is a major tailwind for BTC right now.</p>
<p>But BTC continues to also benefit from crypto specific bullish narratives, such as an expected acceleration of institutional adoption and new buying pressure in the wake of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US, which are <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">expected to get the green light by early 2024</a>.</p>
<p>A sharp rise in the assets under management of Proshares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF, a Bitcoin futures-based ETF, to new all-time highs shows that institutions are already scrambling to gain bullish exposure to the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</p>
<p>Institution-driven elevated buying pressure in 2024 is expected to be coupled by a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s structural sell pressure from network validators (or “miners”), with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin issuance rate set to fall in half next April</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin miners need to constantly sell a portion of the Bitcoin they mine in order to pay for their operations.</p>
<p>This cocktail of bullish themes is likely to mean that Bitcoin remains a buy on the dips, as has consistently been the case in recent weeks.</p>
<p>After pumping 28.5% in October, Bitcoin was supported by an uptrend and its 21DMA throughout November.</p>
<p>With the cryptocurrency having new seemingly broken convincingly to the north of the prior resistance at $38,000, short-term bullish speculators will be eyeing an near-term move above $40,000 and on towards resistance in the form of the April 2022 highs just above $43,000.</p>

<p>Some might even be targeting a test of the 2022 highs at $48,000 before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is backing off after hitting fresh highs for the year in the $38,800s earlier in the session, but at current levels in the $38,300s, is still up close to 2% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Other major cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">Ether</a> (ETH), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> (XRP), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> (SOL) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cardano/">Cardano</a> (ADA) were all also trading with moderate gains over the same time period, with analysts citing a recent uptick in demand for Bitcoin futures ETFs as a sign that institutional demand for crypto continues to pick up.</p>
<p>Regulated crypto investment products have been enjoying inflows in recent weeks thanks to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-could-attract-3b-on-first-day-and-up-to-55b-over-five-years-analysts.htm">bets that spot Bitcoin ETFs will soon garner approval in the US</a>, which is widely viewed as bullish for the BTC price.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just released weaker than expected <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-manufacturing-stays-depressed-november-ism-2023-12-01/">US ISM Manufacturing PMI figures</a> for November strengthens the narrative that the US economy is cooling, just as Fed policymakers appears to be warming to the idea of interest rate cuts next year.</p>
<p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee on Friday remarked that US Core PCE inflation data released earlier in the week was in fitting with inflation falling back to the bank’s 2% goal, a viewpoint that could be used to argue in favor of a lowering of interest rates in 2024.</p>
<p>If the Fed does start lowering interest rates in 2024, this would result in a broad easing of financial conditions and injection of new liquidity into the economy, which has historically been bullish for BTC and the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>While the crypto market outlook subsequently continues to look bright, traders looking to turn even quicker profits will continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets.</p>

<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>

<p>Blue-chip cryptocurrencies continue to consolidate within recent intra-day ranges, with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering in the upper $37,000s just below yearly highs as traders digest the latest US inflation figures and commentary from Fed policymakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-spending-slows-october-weekly-jobless-claims-rise-slightly-2023-11-30/">Core PCE Price Index inflation figures for October</a> came in as expected at 0.2% MoM, underpinning bets that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-holds-ground-ahead-us-inflation-test-2023-11-30/">Fed won’t need to hike interest rates again</a> and may start cutting rates in early 2024, though various Fed policymakers on Thursday warned that more rate hikes remain a possibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> bulls will remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s short-term price prospects, with the cryptocurrency having continually found strong support at its 21DMA in recent weeks and threatening <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-brace-for-breakout-towards-40000-as-this-bullish-technical-pattern-forms-where-next-for-the-btc-price.htm">a break towards $40,000</a>.</p>
<p>A recent uptick in demand for the Proshares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF, a US-based bitcoin futures ETF that recently hit an all-time high in asset under management (AUM), shows that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gary-gensler-remains-tight-lipped-on-future-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">optimism about near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> remains high and institutions continue to position themselves in the expectations of more BTC price upside.</p>
<p>Dips may continue to be aggressively bought into for now.</p>

<p>With blue chip markets quiet, crypto traders looking to turn quick exponential profits will continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers of the day according to decentralized exchange (DEX) analytics websites <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/gainers">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<h2>Eternal AI ($MIND)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called Eternal AI ($MIND) that was launched on Thursday has seen explosive upside of more than 10,000% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xa3a0f67a1eb55988c3e3f1c36e4133d39a6312b3">DEXTools</a>, making it the best-performing shitcoin of the day.</p>
<p>The token’s market cap was last around $1.65 million, with 24-hour trading volumes of around $1.9 million and just over 900 holders.</p>
<p>The token also has around $225,000 in locked liquidity, but investors should be cautious given its 5% buy and sell tax, other smart-contract issues (as per DEXTools’ audit) and its downvote rating on the platform of around 43%.</p>
<h2>BABYFROGE ($BABYFROGE)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called BABYFROGE ($BABYFROGE) that was launched on Thursday has seen explosive upside of more than 7% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xcbf31a5bd3ee6398867fd1edd69cce845b9ea1c5">DEXTools</a>, making it one of the best-performing shitcoins of the day.</p>
<p>The token’s market cap was last around $400,000, with 24-hour trading volumes of around $400,000 and just over 350 holders.</p>
<p>The shitcoin also has liquidity of around $180,000, though it isn’t locked, so investors should be cautious of a potential rug pull attempt.</p>
<h2>Betrock ($BETROCK)</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto casino token Betrock ($BETROCK) has pumped more than 300% in the last 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x5b8e7de9d5b3c793978d8f9816ef659983e2677d">DEXTools</a>, making it a top-performing shitcoin.</p>
<p>Its market cap was last around $235,000, with around $80,000 in locked liquidity and 24-hour trading volumes of around $200,000.</p>
<p>But investors should be aware of its 3% and 3.31% buy and sell taxes and a few other concerning aspects to its token smart contract, as identified by DEXTools’ audit.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has just received approval from a bankruptcy court to sell its stakes in digital trusts managed by Grayscale Investments, according to a <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MjYwMjgzNg==&amp;id2=-1">bankruptcy court document</a> filed on Friday.</p>
<p>This move is part of FTX&#8217;s strategic efforts to repay billions owed to creditors.</p>
<p>The assets, valued at about $744 million last month, form a key component of FTX&#8217;s plan to manage its bankruptcy.</p>
<p>These stakes in various digital trusts, devised by Grayscale and Bitwise, offer investors direct exposure to cryptocurrencies without the need to take self-custody of them.</p>
<p>FTX&#8217;s approach in selling these assets aims to maximize their value while minimizing market disruptions, as outlined in the court documents.</p>
<p>The fallen exchange got the green light to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-court-approves-ftxs-request-liquidate-crypto-assets-which-coins-will-impacted.htm">start selling its crypto holdings</a> in mid-September.</p>
<h2><strong>FTX on a Mission to Return Assets to Debtors</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since filing for bankruptcy last year amidst fraud allegations, FTX has been on a mission to recover assets and address a complex network of debts.</p>
<p>This includes obligations to customers who invested cash and cryptocurrencies on the platform.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-customers-may-see-90-asset-return-by-q2-2024-amended-proposal.htm">FTX&#8217;s administrators have successfully recovered around $7 billion in assets</a>, including $3.4 billion in crypto, highlighting the scale and complexity of the company&#8217;s financial entanglements.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s green light for FTX to proceed with these asset sales is a critical step in the company&#8217;s restructuring process. It underscores the challenges faced by cryptocurrency exchanges in balancing asset liquidation with maintaining stable market conditions.</p>
<p>This is particularly vital given the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the potential impact of such substantial asset sales.</p>
<p>As FTX embarks on this crucial phase of its asset liquidation and restructuring, the broader cryptocurrency community and market observers will be closely watching <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-crypto-asset-sales-will-not-crash-market-coinbase-report.htm">how these sales affect the market</a>.</p>
<p>The development comes after FTX unveiled a plan to kickstart a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-unveils-reboot-plan-for-new-offshore-exchange-under-new-leadership.htm">new offshore cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Blue-chip cryptocurrencies are consolidating close to recent highs, with Bitcoin (BTC) having once again challenged year-to-date highs earlier in the session in the $38,400s.</p>
<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was last trading in the $37,800s, roughly flat on the day as traders monitor commentary from a top US Treasury official, who warned that crypto firms and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/deputy-u-s-treasury-secretary-puts-bad-actors-in-crypto-on-notice-delivers-remarks-at-d-c-policy-summit.htm">USD-stablecoin issuers need to take action against bad actors</a> using their platforms to avoid regulatory action.</p>
<p>Crypto traders and investors fear that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">Tether</a>, the issuer of the world’s most widely used USD-stablecoin USDT, might be in the US government’s firing line and this could be keeping the market slightly nervous on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, the broader macro backdrop remains positive, with stocks and gold still in a multi-week uptrend and US bond yields still trending lower as macro investors bet on rate cuts from the Fed next year, with the latest bets provoked by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-view-usa-2023-11-29/">dovish commentary from Fed policymaker Christopher Waller</a> who is normally considered more of a hawk.</p>
<p>Buy-the-dip is likely to remain the best strategy for Bitcoin, with lows consistently getting shallower in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed, amid expectations of near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, the April 2024 halving of the BTC inflation rate and an improving macro backdrop, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-nears-38k-bull-run-etf-hopes-up.htm#:~:text=The%20pivot%20point%20stands%20at,cushions%20at%20%2434%2C419%20and%20%2433%2C140.">medium-term price predictions are likely to remain bullish</a>, as is likely also the case for major altcoins.</p>
<p>But traders looking to secure quick exponential gains will continue to turn to the highly volatile and illiquid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> market.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers as per the most widely used decentralized exchange (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">DEX</a>) <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x580e933d90091b9ce380740e3a4a39c67eb85b4c">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>KAP Games ($KAP)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Web3 game developer KAP Games native token ($KAP) has seen a stunning near 300% pump in the past 24 hours, making it <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x9625ce7753ace1fa1865a47aae2c5c2ce4418569">Uniswap’s</a> top-performing shitcoin.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x48200057593487b93311b03c845afda306a90e2a">DEXTools</a>, the token last had a market cap of $16.8 million, with nearly $900,000 in volumes having changed hands in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The token has close to 500 holders and over $200,000 in liquidity and two concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools’ security audit.</p>
<h2><strong>Satellite Doge-1 Mission (DOGE-1)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Satellite Doge-1 Mission (DOGE-1), a shitcoin that has sprung up in honor of Elon Musk’s space company SpaceX’s plans to launch a new satellite into space called Doge-1, has been pumping in recent days.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0xffe203b59393593965842439ce1e7d7c78109b46">Uniswap</a>, it was last up 200% in the past 24 hours, taking its market cap to around $2.4 million.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x4dad2532f1b6a8349ef0b7c08f4f4ac2d2870ef6">DEXTools</a>, the token has seen 24-hour trading volumes of around $1.1 million, has accumulated over 1,100 holders and has around $180,000 in locked liquidity.</p>
<p>The token has a very poor community trust rating on DEXTools of just 27% upvotes.</p>
<p>It also has three smart-contract security alerts, as per DEXTools’ smart-contract, so potential investors should be cautious.</p>

<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) just punched through $38,000 to hit new highs for the year, with a near-term retest of $40,000 looking increasingly likely.</p>
<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation was last trading around $37,800 and with gains of around 1.5% on the day.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of most US market participants given the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, trading volumes are still elevated at over $21.5 billion so far for the session, above Monday’s $20.8 billion and Thursday’s $14.2 billion, as per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD">Yahoo data</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> bulls have regained control of the market following a turbulent week that saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">Binance settle dual lawsuits with the US Department of Justice (DoJ)</a> and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by paying fines in excess of $7 billion, with ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao also being forced to step down and plead guilty to one offence (he may face a year in jail).</p>
<p>By the end of the trading week, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-says-binances-record-4-3b-settlement-removes-systemic-risk-calls-it-positive.htm">analysts had largely agreed that Binance’s settlement removes systemic risk</a> (i.e. the risk of the exchanges collapse) from the crypto market and should also boost the odds of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-updates-bitcoin-etf-prospectus-after-discussing-with-sec.htm">near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals from the SEC</a>, which could explain <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC’s</a> breakout to fresh highs for the year.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Next for Bitcoin (BTC)?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin’s latest push higher has seen it tease a breakout to the north of an ascending triangle structure it has been forming over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>These structures are characterized by an asset price consistently finding resistance at the same level ($38,000 in Bitcoin’s case), but price lows consistently getting higher, as bulls buy the dip with increasing enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Technicians often view the formation of such a structure as a bullish indicator that buying pressure is building up, and a bullish breakout is coming.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s latest push above $38,000, whilst short-lived, could be a sign that a more convincing push towards $40,000 and break above this ascending triangle pattern is soon coming.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136392" style="width: 1787px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136392" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1.png" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Chart / Source: TradingView" width="1787" height="720" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1.png 1787w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1-300x121.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1-1024x413.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1-768x309.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700849844-btc-1-1536x619.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1787px) 100vw, 1787px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136392" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin (BTC) Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>While Bitcoin did reach as high as the $38,400s earlier in the session, it remains too early to say the breakout is confirmed, given the quick dip back to the upper $37,000s.</p>
<p>Indeed, any bullish breakout for Bitcoin would need “approval” from US market participants who are largely absent on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders should closely monitor trading conditions on Monday when US markets reopen and the world’s largest liquidity source returns – a pump back above $38,000 amid high trading volumes would suggest US investors are aggressively buying into the bullish BTC story.</p>
<p>Traders should be aware that Bitcoin price risks remain very much titled to the upside – Binance’s settlement removes systemic market risk, spot Bitcoin ETF approvals seem close, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> in 2024 will soon reduce monthly sell pressure from miners and macro conditions have been trending in a bullish direction for Bitcoin recently, as US stocks rise and US bond yields dive on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-minutes-likely-anchor-careful-approach-policy-2023-11-21/">bets the Fed will start cutting rates in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of potential bullish narratives that could support the BTC price going into December, which is historically a strong month for Bitcoin anyway.</p>
<p>If everything plays out well (i.e. macro conditions keep improving and spot ETF approvals come in), a push towards 2022’s highs in the $48,000 region seems likely by early 2024.</p>

<p><i>Friday, November 24, 2023</i> – The Bitcoin price smashed through $38,000 door after BlackRock met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to talk about its ETF application as the odds on approval rise and new cryptocurrency the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> raises north of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token is the ideal investment vehicle for playing the exchange-traded fund (ETF) theme that is gripping the crypto market. Investors have poured $1,577,000 million into the ICO, currently priced at $0.0058. $BTCETF is at stage 5 of its 10-stage presale. </p>
<p>There are only three days to go before the price rises to $0.0060, although this stage could sell out sooner as there is only $500,000 to raise before stage 6 begins.</p>
<p>Although false starts on erroneous reports that a BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF had been approved and that the same asset manager was planning to issue a spot XRP ETF, were unwelcome reminders of the relative immaturity of the crypto market, it reminded everyone that the bulls are raring to go.</p>
<p>A meeting between BlackRock and the SEC earlier this week has also got the juices flowing, as Bitcoin trades as high as $38,250 today at an 18-month high. Then there was SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce who chimed in this week with more positive news flow, commenting, “&#8230;there is no reason for us to stand in the way of a spot bitcoin ETF.” </p>
<p>Add to that the $4.3 billion settlement of the criminal charges brought against Binance by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and erstwhile CEO CZ, and it feels to many like the digital asset sector is on the cusp of a new golden era, where regulators rule the roost and retail and institutional investors can trade easily and safely.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ETF Token is specially developed to ride the wave of ETF-induced Bitcoin FOMO</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As the number of spot Bitcoin ETF applications swells to 12, there are now ways of gaining exposure to the pre-launch excitement that doesn’t involve waiting for the applications to be approved: enter the Bitcoin ETF Token.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) has been specially developed to appeal to market participants who want to gain exposure to the spot Bitcoin ETF alpha returns story.</p>
<p>Running on the Ethereum blockchain, the $BTCETF Token has been fashioned in such a way as to benefit from each real-world milestone in the journey of the spot Bitcoin ETF from approval to launch.</p>
<p>A burn tax kicks in when the coin launches on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decreases by 1% as each designated milestone is reached. Running in parallel to that, there is a burn mechanism of up to 25% of the total supply in order to further bolster the deflationary scarcity of the coin. Every time a milestone is reached, the transaction tax is reduced by 1%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136379" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700848002-btcetf-2.png" alt="" width="512" height="129" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700848002-btcetf-2.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700848002-btcetf-2-300x76.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>These twin mechanisms mean that owners of the $BTCETF Token will have the most strongly aligned crypto portfolios with the spot Bitcoin ETF growth story.</p>
<p>Recent developments in the regulatory front, far from dampening spirits, have led to yet more optimism. Binance’s troubles signal to the rest of the market that the financial authorities in the US will no longer tolerate crypto exchanges operating outside of existing law.</p>
<p>At a stroke, the Department of Justice has signaled to the SEC and investors of all stripes that trading venues that in effect have been hives of possibly manipulative trading activity, despite denials, are facing extinction. Either exchanges register with the authorities and come into compliance, or they will be forced out of business.</p>
<p>It cannot be overstated how consequential this is for the future expansion prospects of the market. Going forward, and allied with the approval of an ETF, there will be an easy and regulated route for wealth managers and financial advisers to buy exposure to Bitcoin on behalf of their clients. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Buy Bitcoin ETF Token</a></p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETFs to become a $100 billion market says Bloomberg Intelligence</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the US, trillions of dollars of investment is directed by financial advisers on behalf of their clients. As such, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that it is only a matter of time before the spot Bitcoin ETF market is valued at $100 billion.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/spot-bitcoin-btc-etf-approval-seen-driving-money-managers-to-crypto">Bloomberg reports</a> that a number of managers and advisers it has spoken to have been receiving inquiries from their clients about spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>Jeff Janson of Florida-based Summit Wealth told Bloomberg, “I feel like we are now staring down the gun barrel of the SEC finally delivering approval,” Janson, whose firm manages about $550 million, said in an interview. “And my belief is that once you have access to it in that type of a wrapper, I think you’re going to have a significant amount of institutional-level interest.”  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Galaxy Digitals reports that it has fielded inquiries from 300 investment professionals asking about how to make allocations using a spot Bitcoin ETF vehicle.</p>
<p>Chuck Cumello, the CEO of Essex Financial Services in Connecticut, reinforces the point about the removal of trading friction, perceived or otherwise: “It would just be simple and easy to place a trade – to have it long in a client’s investment advisory account.”   </p>
<p>But if you are among the 99% of Americans who don’t have a financial adviser, then you might be more inclined to forgo paying a fee to such firms and instead make an investment in the Bitcoin ETF Token by simply connecting a funded crypto wallet to make your contribution.</p>

<h2>Is Tether the next shoe to drop… and another shot in the arm for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There could also be other shoes to drop after the Binance settlement, which will remove more gray areas from the marketplace. Investors hate uncertainty, so anything that removes it will be welcomed.</p>
<p>With that in mind, are the US authorities coming for Tether next? </p>
<p>If Binance was the top-dog exchange, Tether has been just as essential as the de facto settlement layer of the entire crypto trading system, in its role as the issuer of the most-used stablecoin. </p>
<p>For as long as crypto has been traded at serious volumes, USDT (Tether) has been the method for parking funds as an on- and off-ramp for entering and exiting crypto markets in a way that protects the value of funds not being actively traded. </p>
<p>Tether is backed 1:1 by cash or near-cash equivalents, but the extent of that backing has always been in dispute.</p>
<p>In October US Senator Cynthia Lummis said the DOJ needed to stop delaying with pressing charges against Binance and Tether, although she sees the SEC as the bad guy in all this, regulating through piecemeal enforcement actions. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SEC cannot continue ruling by enforcement. My statement on the Kraken lawsuit below: <a href="https://t.co/J3qhzU624N">pic.twitter.com/J3qhzU624N</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1726768494069354545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Well, the US government prosecutors have made their move with Binance, so is Tether next? </p>
<p>Tether has been able to get away with no official auditing of the assets backing its stablecoin. It is difficult to see how that position can be sustained. Also, issuing stablecoins is probably a business line that BlackRock, and others, would like to get into. </p>
<p>Could the US government be about to give BlackRock a helping hand in the same way that some claim they have done by getting Binance out of the picture?</p>
<p>Tether might want to do the smart and proactive thing and settle with the DOJ before they come knocking at its door.</p>
<p>Clearing up the ambiguities around the backing for the Tether stablecoin would see the removal of perhaps the last major regulatory uncertainty in the crypto markets, and, as with the demise of Binance, be a big plus for the healthy expansion of the crypto market into the mainstream. </p>
<p>It would be another major hurdle removed that’s standing in the way of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval and another indirect price booster for <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/">Bitcoin ETF Token</a>.</p>
<h2>Crypto YouTuber is “super bullish on $BTCETF” – buy today and earn 162% APY</h2>

$BTCETF tokens can be bought in presale today and <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/en/dashboard">staked to earn</a> an annual percentage yield (APY) of 162% at the time of writing. </p>
<p>There have been 164 million $BTCETF tokens deposited into the staking smart contract to date, in a testament to the popularity of this passive income route. Staking rewards are distributed in $BTCETF over a five-year period. Each ETH block produced generates a reward of 119 $BTCETF.</p>
<p>Crypto YouTuber Micheal Wrubel with 310,000 subscribers is <a href="https://youtu.be/-Kg6r3h7Ubs?si=F9gTFuQ2nOwxu6q1">super bullish on $BTCETF</a>, as he explains in his day-old video which has already amassed 21,000 views:</p>
<p>Austin Hilton with 235k subscribers on YouTube is another $BTCETF fan. He tells his audience that $BTCETF is <a href="https://youtu.be/xyKxJ5iotm4?si=k1nf_rqsVBb9vBT2">“like nothing you have ever seen,”</a> as he encourages viewers to find out more.</p>

<p>There is a price explosion coming for Bitcoin as a wall of money is about to flood into the markets thanks to the imminent spot Bitcoin ETF approval. </p>
<p>The new <a href="http://btcetftoken.com">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is one of the most attractive investment propositions in crypto today because it will directly benefit from the approval and launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF regardless of which of the 12 competing issuers wins the race.</p>

<p>Major blue-chip cryptocurrencies are trading with a positive bias on Friday despite a lack of trading volumes with US market participants away for the Thanksgiving holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) briefly hit fresh highs for the year above $38,000 and at current levels around $37,800 is currently trading up around 1.6% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Bitcoin bulls have noted that the cryptocurrency is probing a break above key resistance at $38,000 which could open the door to a swift move above $40,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ether</a> (ETH), meanwhile, recovered back to the north of $2,100, up 2.6% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The bullish bias could reflect optimism that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-us-guilty-plea-may-raise-complications-for-hong-kong-affiliates-crypto-license-application-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Binance’s recent settlement deal with US authorities</a> removes systemic risk to the market of a potential collapse of the exchange, as well as ongoing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/why-binance-and-cz-take-down-is-good-news-for-blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etfs-and-new-btcetf-token-thats-raised-1-4m.htm">optimism surrounding expected near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> and an improving macro backdrop.</p>
<p>Macro traders wills be monitoring US Core PCE Price Index Inflation figures, US ISM Manufacturing data and a speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell next week.</p>
<p>Recent US data has painted a picture of the economy cooling, leading markets to bet that the Fed’s rate hiking cycle is over and a cutting cycle is coming next year, despite still hawkish warnings from the central bank’s policymakers that further rate increases remain on the table.</p>
<p>While cryptocurrency markets could see big moves next week, volumes will remain low until US markets properly come back online.</p>
<p>Traders seeking quick exponential returns will thus continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets in the hunt for a quick profit.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/gainers">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>PEPEDAO ($PEPED)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A newly launched shitcoin called PEPEDAO ($PEPED), which appears to be attempting to masquerade as representing the decentralized Pepe Coin community, has seen a more than 8,000% pump since its launch earlier on Friday as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xce5a3d3a94edc6c758a882e49ffa9e4004a01603">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>$PEPED’s market cap was last around $700,000 amid just over $200,000 in 24-hour trading volumes, close to 300 holders and liquidity of around $250,000.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools’ smart contract security review, the token has one concerning aspect transfers are potentially pausable.</p>
<h2><strong>Bonsai3 ($SEED)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called Bonsai3 ($SEED) is pumping for a third straight day, having gained 45% in the past 24 hours as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x95d9e85a31ed4cfba8421488d295a25bc76b473f">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The token last had a market capitalization of around $3.43 million, close to $500,000 in locked liquidity and around 650 holders.</p>
<p>24-hour trading volumes were last at $700,000 suggesting interest in the token remains high.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools’ security audit, the token has a 4% buy and sell tax, as well as a number of other concerning aspects to its smart contract, so investors need to exercise caution.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<p>The surge in the meme coin’s price comes alongside a pump in recent weeks in the Solana (SOL) price amid a broader crypto market rally fuelled by optimism about institutional adoption with spot Bitcoin ETF approvals seemingly coming in the US very soon.</p>
<p>While BONK! is certainly a hot prospect right now, it’s far from the only meme coin attracting a lot of interest.</p>
<p>An up-and-coming meme coin called <a href="https://www.memekombat.io/">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK) has been generating huge hype thanks to its unique value proposition, given its token powers a fun platform that sits at the intersection of GameFi and GambleFi.</p>
<p>The token’s presale has already raised a whopping more than $2 million as top traders back the token.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Meme Kombat?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme Kombat is a web3 platform that blends together the world of crypto gaming and gambling with its exciting platform were users are able to bet on the outcomes of exciting battles between characters based on some of the crypto world’s most popular meme coins.</p>
<p>Given its strong appeal to meme coin investors and GameFi and GambleFi addicts, Meme Kombat is expected to have a wide appeal.</p>
<p>$MK is currently priced at $0.214, but will be rising 10% to $0.225 when the presale enters its next stage in just under 6 days.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MK</a> is now $0.214<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>Make sure you are ready for Kombat and have you <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MK</a> ready too! <a href="https://t.co/46vMGrXURU">pic.twitter.com/46vMGrXURU</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that while the site’s countdown shows that there are only just under seven days to go before the next price rise, the current stage could sell out much sooner than the time allocated if the $2.5 million mark is quickly hit.</p>
<p>In contrast to meme coins such as Pepe, Meme Kombat enables token holders to stake-to-earn to get a passive income stream.</p>
<p>Stakers earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of 466%. Such a high return is possible because the project has allocated 30% of token supply to staking and battle rewards.</p>
<p>Even better, presale buyers can choose to stake their coins immediately and start earning now.</p>
<p>There is a staking dashboard to show the real-time number of staked coins in the pool launching soon.</p>

<h2><strong>$MK the Next 100x Coin?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For degens focused on where to find the next 100x gem Meme Kombat has to be front and center. Put succinctly, Meme Kombat captures the latent value of arguably the top-valued sectors in crypto today – gaming and gambling.</p>
<p>Admittedly meme coins are all about virality and community engagement and have almost made it a badge of pride that they don’t actually have any utility.</p>
<p>There is of course value in networks of engaged individuals but as the market enters the next bull cycle, one feature of the maturing nature of the market is investors becoming more demanding in what they expect from a coin, and that includes memes coins.</p>
<p>Increasingly market participants want to buy into projects that are offering genuinely unique and potentially valuable use cases – there has to be a value differential.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat fits the bill perfectly. It not only hits on the two booming sectors of GameFi and GambleFi, it is also playing in the high-octane meme coin segment, where old and new money is sure to flow in powerful torrents as crypto winter recedes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t require much analysis to immediately see the value proposition in Meme Kombat and how it stacks up when compared to coins like Pepe.</p>

<p>Blue chip cryptocurrency markets are in consolidation mode amid thin trading volumes with US market participants away for the Thanksgiving holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) was last trading in the low $37,000, well within recent weekly ranges and roughly flat in the past 24 hours, while <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">Ether</a> (ETH) was last changing hands around $2,050, also within recent weekly ranges.</p>
<p>With the markets taking a breather on Thursday, traders have more time to mull over recent developments regarding Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market capitalization.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-sees-more-than-900-million-in-outflows-as-former-ceo-pleads-guilty.htm">Binance</a> recently settled criminal lawsuits with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by paying fines in excess of $7 billion while the exchange’s former CEO was forced to step down and plead guilty to charges levied against him personally.</p>
<p>The news was initially met with panic in the crypto market, but asset prices quickly recovered, with traders assessing the settlement to create more certainty for the market, with an existential risk to Binance as a company having now been removed.</p>
<p>Focus has shifted onto whether recent developments hurt or help the case for the approval of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/why-binance-and-cz-take-down-is-good-news-for-blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etfs-and-new-btcetf-token-thats-raised-1-4m.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Following reports earlier in the week that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-updates-bitcoin-etf-prospectus-after-discussing-with-sec.htm">US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working with digital asset manager Grayscale</a> on their own spot Bitcoin ETF application, optimism for near-term approvals is set to remain high.</p>
<p>Risks thus seem to remain tilted towards more Bitcoin price upside, with the cryptocurrency having formed a bullish ascending triangle structure in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A break above $38,000 would open the door to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-brace-for-breakout-towards-40000-as-this-bullish-technical-pattern-forms-where-next-for-the-btc-price.htm">swift move above $40,000</a>.</p>
<p>While the outlook for major cryptocurrencies is looking strong, trading looking to turn quick exponential profits will continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile shitcoin/meme coin markets.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best performers on the Ethereum blockchain, as per decentralized exchange <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>PowBlocks ($XPB)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Mining-focused token PowBlocks ($XPB) has seen an impressive more than 200% pump in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0xcb129aa11ceaa00da1a92d12e26bb776ef3c3628">Uniswap</a>, making it one of the top performing shitcoins of the day.</p>
<p>The token last had a market cap of around $2 million, with just over $300,000 in liquidity, close to 1,000 holders and 24-hour trading volumes of nearly $2 million, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x90695194aa10a7952df8aed6312b313c19866355">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The latest pump has seen the token hit a new all-time high, but investors should be cautious given a few concerning aspects to the token’s smart contract, as per the DEXTools security audit.</p>
<h2><strong>GameSwift ($GSWIFT)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Gaming token GameSwift ($GSWIFT) is another token seeing a big pump on Thursday, having rallied 80% in the past 24 hours to hit a new all-time high market cap of over $16 million, as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x580e933d90091b9ce380740e3a4a39c67eb85b4c">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>The token has seen impressive 24-hour trading volumes in the region of $1.5 million, has close to 13,000 holders and has liquidity of around $1.9 million, as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0x580e933d90091b9ce380740e3a4a39c67eb85b4c">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>The token also has zero concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per the DEXTools security audit, meaning the likelihood of it being scam are lessened.</p>
<h2><strong>Viridis Network ($VRD)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Viridis Network ($VRD), the token that powers the decentralized carbon market focused Ethereum layer-2 scaling blockchain of the same name, has pumped an impressive 80% in the past 24 hours as per <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/tokens/ethereum/0xf25304e75026e6a35fedca3b0889ae5c4d3c55d8">Uniswap</a>, making it one of the best performers of the day.</p>
<p>$VRD is just below all time highs and last had a market cap of just over $7 million, according to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd2a72bb93a5d474db747cfe66745834631a31153">DEXTools</a>, which also showed it has locked liquidity of around $350,000,  $1.23 million in 24-hour trading volumes and 1,250 holders.</p>
<p>The token has a number of concerning aspects to its token contract, however, so investors should be cautious.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools’ security audit, the token could be mintable, has a modifiable buy and sell tax (both currently at 4%) and a number of other concerning aspects to its contract.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>Those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>

<p>Blue-chip cryptocurrencies are pumping on Wednesday amid a market-wide relief rally as traders digest recent news relating to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>News broke on Tuesday that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bernstein-report-binance-will-remain-the-top-global-crypto-exchange-despite-doj-settlement.htm">Binance had reached deals with the US Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to settle to lawsuits</a> by paying fines in excess of $7 billion, sending Bitcoin (BTC) briefly as low as the $35,700s.</p>
<p>But the cryptocurrency has since rebounded around 4.5% on Wednesday, with some analysts noting that 1) the Binance news hasn’t triggered a dramatic rush to withdraw crypto from the platform, whose reserves continue to look strong and 2) that the deal increases the likelihood that the SEC approves <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-meets-with-grayscale-to-discuss-spot-bitcoin-etf-listing.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in the coming months.</p>
<p>Fears about Binance’s troubles with regulators and authorities in the US had been hanging over the crypto market head for months, and while a lawsuit with the SEC remains unsettled and outstanding, some analysts said that the latest settlement means less “FUD” (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in general for the market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">All crypto fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has just been liquidated. </p>
<p>When the market finds a bottom on this Binance news, all sources of FUD from the last two years will have been eliminated.</p>
<p>The market is currently panicking on news headlines which have &quot;guilty&quot; and crypto…</p>
<p>&mdash; Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) <a href="https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1727127851026072058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-says-binances-record-4-3b-settlement-removes-systemic-risk-calls-it-positive.htm">JP Morgan said that the Binance settlement removes &#8220;systemic risk&#8221;</a> from the crypto market, which is a positive.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has subsequently swung nearly $2,000 higher versus earlier lows and was last trading in the $37,600s, with bulls eyeing a potential break to the north of resistance around $38,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">Ether</a> (ETH), meanwhile, was last trading in the $2,030s, up around 4% in the past 24 hours as per CoinGecko.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> (XRP), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> (SOL) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a> (ADA) were all trading with gains of between 3-8% over the same time period.</p>
<p>Whilst sentiment in the broader crypto market is strong on Wednesday and risks are titled to more near-term upside for prices, risk-seeking traders looking to turn quick exponential profits will continue to turn to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets in the hunt for better trading opportunities.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top performing low-market capitalization shitcoins, as per DEXTools.</p>
<h2><strong>PEPEPE ($PEPEPE)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A new shitcoin called PEPEPE ($PEPEPE) is the top performer on <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x6b8a504556a40c17066b0535cc09635fc5e7e972">DEXTools</a> on Wednesday, having pumped nearly 33,000% since its launch earlier in the session.</p>
<p>The token last had a market cap of around $3.3 million and just under $200,000 in liquidity and close to 260 holders.</p>
<p>But many are suspicious it could be a scam, as evidenced in its 75% downvote rating as per the DEXTools’ community trust score.</p>
<p>Indeed, its price pump has been driven by a relatively modest $215,000 in trading volumes and DEXTools’ security audit reveals that transfers may be pausable.</p>
<h2><strong>Changpeng Zhao ($CZ)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/degens-ride-the-wave-massive-surge-in-cz-token-amid-binance-ceos-resignation.htm">A shitcoin named after ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao</a>, who was just ousted from the exchange as part of a historic $7 billion legal settlement between the crypto exchange and US regulators, is pumping on Wednesday.</p>
<p>$CZ is up another 2,200% on Wednesday and its market cap was last around $8.7 million, according to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xa18d5eceb5fe22ee3cc228fb9c32b65adcedfa13">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>Its market cap was last just over $8 million, with around $315,000 in 24-hour trading volume and over 2,350 holders.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency has seen impressive 24-hour trading volumes of around $10.5 million, but has two concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools.</p>
<h2><strong>snapcat ($SNAPCAT)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called snapcat ($SNAPCAT) has seen a stunning more than 2,600% rise in the last 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x55556946fbb38f1d5c82414ca7cd45406e46114d">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>Its market cap was last around $8 million, with around $314,000 in liquidity and around 550 holders.</p>
<p>The pump comes amid very low trading volumes, however, suggesting a few big sell orders could easily see it reverse.</p>
<p>The token’s smart contract also has three concerning aspects to it, DEXTools’ security audit reveals, so potential investors should tread cautiously.</p>

<p>Bitcoin bulls are bracing for another leg higher in the market and a potential challenge of the psychologically important $40,000 level in light of the recent formation of a bullish short-term technical pattern called an ascending triangle.</p>
<p>The BTC price was last in the $37,600s, having experienced some<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm"> intra-day chop on Monday on reports that the US Department of Justice and Binance</a> are nearing a multi-billion-dollar settlement to end a criminal investigation into the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>But with the macro trading environment a clear tailwind for crypto right now – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/futures-edge-higher-microsoft-shines-2023-11-20/">US stocks are rising</a> again and US government bond yields and the US dollar are falling on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/dollar-back-foot-focus-turns-fed-easing-2023-11-20/">bets the Fed will be cutting interest rates next year</a> – and amid ongoing optimism about <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-xs-bitcoin-etf-decision-delayed-by-sec-new-deadline-set-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals</a>, BTC price risks seems strongly tilted towards the upside in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin’s</a> ascending triangle formation compliments this short-term bullish view.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency has been supported by an uptrend going back to late October and found strong support at its 21DMA last week.</p>
<p>However, upside has so far been capped by resistance at the $38,000 level.</p>
<p>But multiple tests of this level mean the sellers (mostly investors taking profit in wake of recent gains) might finally be exhausted, setting the stage for another leg higher in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin’s</a> 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which indicates how overbought or oversold the market has become, has recently fallen back into neutral territory after signaling overbought conditions for a few weeks.</p>
<p>That suggests there is room for buying pressure to build up once again, suggesting a break above $38,000 could have legs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133934" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133934" style="width: 1787px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-133934" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509831-btc-price.png" alt="" width="1787" height="717" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509831-btc-price.png 1787w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509831-btc-price-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509831-btc-price-1024x411.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509831-btc-price-768x308.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509831-btc-price-1536x616.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1787px) 100vw, 1787px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133934" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin (BTC) Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>One potential on-chain signal that could push back against the bullish short-term narrative is that <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;c=native&amp;m=distribution.ExchangeNetPositionChange">BTC token inflows to exchanges</a> have picked up in recent weeks since Bitcoin pushed above $35,000, suggesting more profit-taking may lay ahead.</p>
<p>But those conditions were seen for much of February through to May and didn’t ultimately stop the BTC price from pushing higher.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Next for Bitcoin (BTC)?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If Bitcoin is to break convincingly above $38,000, the next natural target is a quick test of $40,000 for the first time since April 2022.</p>
<p>Once that key psychological level is broken, there aren’t any major technical hurdles before the 2022 highs at $48,200.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133935" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133935" style="width: 1787px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-133935" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509864-btc-price-2.png" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Chart" width="1787" height="717" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509864-btc-price-2.png 1787w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509864-btc-price-2-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509864-btc-price-2-1024x411.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509864-btc-price-2-768x308.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700509864-btc-price-2-1536x616.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1787px) 100vw, 1787px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133935" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin (BTC) Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>With macro seemingly about to turn into a major tailwind for Bitcoin, assuming US economic data continues to signal economic cooling and the room for near-term rate cuts, with spot Bitcoin ETF approvals close and with the Bitcoin inflation rate about to halve in April 2024, there are plenty of bullish narratives to support further near-term upside in the crypto market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to analysis by Matrixport, if Bitcoin is already up by over 100% at this stage of the year, there is a 71% chance that the cryptocurrency will finish the year at even higher levels, with year-end rallies averaging around 65%.</p>
<p>“Based on these statistics, bitcoin continues to offer upside potential, and a +65% year-end rally would lift prices back to $56,000,” Matrixport’s head of research Markus Thielen noted.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice (DoJ) is seeking a settlement of more than $4 billion from the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance as a proposed resolution to a yearlong investigation into the exchange, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/us-seeks-more-than-4-billion-from-binance-to-end-criminal-case#xj4y7vzkg">Bloomberg reported on Monday</a> citing people familiar with discussions.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets initially fell on the news but have since recovered.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped under $37,000, but has since recovered back above $37,500, while Binance-linked BNB (BNB) briefly dipped under $240 before pumping as high as the $260s.</p>
<p>As per the report, the DoJ and Binance could reach a settlement before the end of the month, though this settlement could reportedly include the prospect of Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhou facing criminal charges in the US.</p>
<p>An agreement would end the probe into Binance, which the DoJ accuses of engaging in money laundering, bank fraud and sanctions violations.</p>

<h2><strong>Crypto Market Chop Explained</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The cryptocurrency market’s choppy reaction to the Binance/DoJ headlines emphasizes just how sensitive the market is to news regarding the world’s dominant crypto exchange Binance.</p>
<p>Binance has so far accounted for around 37% of global spot crypto trading volumes this month, according to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/spot">data presented by The Block</a>.</p>
<p>Traders have long been fearful that Binance’s dominance is a major weak point for the crypto market, which could be seriously affected if something was to happen to the exchange like what happened to FTX just over one year ago.</p>
<p>Those fears became more acute in 2023 when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm">the SEC sued Binance</a> for allegedly operating as an unregistered securities exchange in the US, and on other charges of investor fraud, and when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-us-department-of-justice-considering-fraud-charges-against-binance-crypto-exchange.htm">news emerged that the US DoJ was looking to press serious charges against Binance</a>.</p>
<p>Binance has denied all accusations and always maintained that customer liabilities are more than adequately backed by reserve funds, staving off a potential “bank run” which was the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm">death sentence for FTX last year</a>.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency’s knee-jerk sell-off on the Binance/DoJ headlines emphasises how jittery the market is to this theme.</p>
<p>But if a resolution between Binance and the DoJ is soon reached, this is arguably a positive, as it means greater certainty for the firm, which probably explains the market’s quick rebound.</p>

<p>Crypto media website CoinDesk has just been acquired by cryptocurrency exchange Bullish in an undisclosed all cash deal, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/company-led-by-former-nyse-president-buys-crypto-news-site-coindesk-af3b5cc2">Wall Street Journal reported</a> on Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-bullish-applies-for-license-in-hong-kong-can-this-new-bitcoin-fork-list-on-the-exchange.htm">Bullish</a>, which is run by former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) President Tom Farley, said that the acquisition won’t impact the crypto news site’s current management team and that the news site will operate as an independent subsidiary.</p>
<p>“With its acclaimed editorial coverage, premier events and market-leading data and indices, CoinDesk continues to shape the global crypto and blockchain ecosystem,” Bullish CEO Tom Farley says in a statement.</p>
<p>“Bullish will immediately inject capital into several of CoinDesk’s most exciting growth initiatives which will power the launch of new services, events and products.”</p>
<p>CoinDesk’s transfer of ownership comes after a tumultuous period for the company and its former owner Digital Currency Group (DCG).</p>
<p>An award-winning report by CoinDesk just over one year ago on FTX’s questionable balance sheet was the catalyst for the cryptocurrency exchange’s sudden demise.</p>
<p>But this demise had a direct impact on DCG, who had funds in FTX via its lending subsidiary Genesis.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dcg-reaches-preliminary-agreement-with-genesis-creditors-offering-potential-70-90-recovery.htm">DCG and Genesis</a> both face a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-york-attorney-general-sues-gemini-trust-genesis-global-dcg-for-defrauding-customers.htm">lawsuit from the New York Attorney General’s office</a> over allegedly misleading investors.</p>
<p>Struggles at DCG led to it beginning to court potential buyers for CoinDesk back in January, and to CoinDesk having to lay off 16% of its workforce in August.</p>

<p>Ethereum (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, has pushed back to the north of the $2,000 per token mark on Monday, extending its gains since last week’s near-$1,900 lows to above 6%.</p>
<p>The rally comes as the broader crypto market enjoys tailwinds on Monday from a weakening US dollar on bets the Fed’s tightening cycle is over and amid optimism about accelerated crypto adoption in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pro-bitcoin-javier-milei-wins-argentina-presidential-elections.htm">South America in wake of Argentina’s election of pro-crypto/Bitcoin President Javier Milei</a>.</p>
<p>Ether bulls will be looking to see whether the cryptocurrency can this weak break to the north of a short-term downtrend that has been capping its price since earlier monthly highs in the $2,100s.</p>
<p>With major asset managers like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fidelity-follows-blackrock-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-where-next-for-ether-eth.htm">BlackRock and Fidelity moving to set up spot Ethereum ETFs</a>, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereums-deflation-rate-hits-new-yearly-highs-heres-where-eth-price-headed-next.htm">Ether supply back in deflation</a> thanks to a recent improvement in on-chain activity, and with the macro backdrop seemingly turning into more of a tailwind for crypto, Ether price predictions are likely to remain mostly bullish.</p>
<h2><strong>Price Prediction – Time to Buy Ether (ETH)?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ether price predictions turned substantially more bullish earlier this month when ETH vaulted to the north of a downtrend that had been in play since the April yearly highs.</p>
<p>The bulls have lost momentum in the last week and a half amid profit-taking following ETH’s failure to break above the yearly highs in the $2,100s, but should this level break in the weeks ahead, the cryptocurrency is set up for strong gains.</p>
<p>That’s because, above the $2,150 area, there aren’t any notable levels of resistance all the way until around $3,500.</p>
<p>If a crypto “Santa rally” really gets going into the end of 2023, traders could be looking at quick 70% gains in the months ahead.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133867" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133867" style="width: 1791px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-133867" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700501453-eth.png" alt="Ether (ETH) Chart" width="1791" height="717" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700501453-eth.png 1791w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700501453-eth-300x120.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700501453-eth-1024x410.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700501453-eth-768x307.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700501453-eth-1536x615.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1791px) 100vw, 1791px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133867" class="wp-caption-text">Ether (ETH) Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>That being said, now is probably a good time to buy ETH, even though the cryptocurrency is close to yearly highs.</p>
<p>Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain utilized by the Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">DeFi</a>), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-news/">NFT</a> and broader <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">web3</a> sectors and Ethereum scaling protocols like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-layer-2-arbitrum-sustains-growth-and-user-influx-following-arb-airdrop-total-assets-reach-577-billion-report.htm">Arbitrum</a>, Polygon and Optimism are helping the blockchain retain its dominance against upcoming layer-1 rivals like Avalanche and Solana.</p>
<p>With upgrades in the coming years likely to address Ethereum scaling problems, the blockchain is expected to experience significant further adoption.</p>
<p>That means Ether is a prime candidate to continue performing well during the upcoming crypto bull market that is arguably already well underway.</p>
<h2>Ether Alternative to Consider</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A fun new coin called Ether ETF Token ($ETHETF) is performing well alongside Ether and might be a good candidate to consider for risk-tolerant crypto investors looking to diversify their crypto holdings.</p>
<p>The token is designed to reward its holders based on news events relating to the upcoming expected approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the US.</p>
<p>The token was last up around 15% in the last 24 hours, as per DEXTools, with a market cap of less than $1 million, suggesting plenty of room for potential upside should more investors pile into the token.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the token has $440,000 in locked liquidity and no concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per the DEXTools security audit, so investors shouldn&#8217;t be too fearful that the token is a scam.</p>

<p>Asset management giant Fidelity just filed a 19b-4 with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to set up a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) called the Fidelity Ethereum Trust, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-files-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">just one day after BlackRock filed to set up the iShares Ethereum Trust</a>, its own spot Ethereum ETF.</p>
<p>The latest move to offer a spot Ethereum ETF to investors comes as major asset managers double down on bets that cryptocurrencies have a bright future, and that their new proposed crypto investment vehicles will gain quick approval in the US.</p>
<p>Both asset managers plus a dozen others filed to set up spot Bitcoin ETFs back in June, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-application-approvals-likely-by-january-10th-jpmorgan-argues-how-high-can-btc-price-pump-2024.htm">many analysts betting that these applications will gain approval as soon as January</a>.</p>
<p>Fidelity manages over $4.5 trillion in investor funds, whilst BlackRock manages over $8 trillion, making it the largest asset manager in the world.</p>
<p>Ether (ETH), the official name of the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network (though many also wrongly refer to the cryptocurrency itself as Ethereum), was relatively unmoved by the news of Fidelity&#8217;s approval.</p>
<p>ETH was last changing hands just above $1,950, having dipped over 4% this week as traders take profit in wake of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s recent failure to break above its yearly highs in the $2,100s.</p>
<h2>Where Next for Ether (ETH)?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite its recent pullback, ETH is still up an impressive 28% versus its October lows.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency has been a beneficiary of a broader market rally driven by 1) optimism about expected near-term spot Bitcoin ETFs and 2) an improvement in the macro backdrop as<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/traders-see-no-more-fed-rate-increases-cuts-start-may-2023-11-14/"> investors bet the Fed&#8217;s tightening cycle is over</a>, with US stock rallying and US bond yields and the dollar dumping this month.</p>
<p>More recently, ETH has been supported by the news that major asset managers are looking to set up their own spot Ethereum ETFs.</p>
<p>But this news hasn&#8217;t resulted in a lasting market pump.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ether&#8217;s 28% gains since mid-October look weak when compared to Bitcoin&#8217;s 45% gain over the same time period.</p>
<p>Ether&#8217;s continued underperformance is difficult to understand in wake of the recent improvement in on-chain activity that has turned the Ether supply deflationary once again, as shown in data presented by <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/dashboards/eth-core-on-chain?">Glassnode</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133216" style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-133216" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700262730-eth-deflation.png" alt="" width="645" height="671" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700262730-eth-deflation.png 645w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700262730-eth-deflation-288x300.png 288w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133216" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Glassnode</figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps investors are still worried about the poor demand that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/proshares-launches-six-ether-futures-etfs-expanding-crypto-etf-market.htm">recently launched Ether futures ETFs</a> attracted in the US, and assuming that this might translate into poor demand for spot Ethereum ETFs.</p>
<p>But with the outlook for the broader market looking up and Ether chart analysis looking bullish, Ether price risks are likely strongly tilted to the upside.</p>
<p>If Ether can break to the north of the hugely important support-turned-resistance $2,150 area, then the door is open (technically speaking) to a quick rally back towards the next major level around $3,600.</p>
