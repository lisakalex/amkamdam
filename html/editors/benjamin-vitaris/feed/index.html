<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite this year was tough for the cryptoverse, the industry is still very confident about the future and aims to grow by building things, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), CEO of <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a></b>, a major cryptocurrency exchange, stressed in an interview with Bloomberg. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c1/a183824cb7.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c1/a183824cb7.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5c1/a183824cb7.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5c1/a183824cb7.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5c1/a183824cb7.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5c1/a183824cb7.jpg 794w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Twitter</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;I think people in the industry are still very confident about the future. So, there&rsquo;s no worries about that,&rdquo; he said, adding that his company wants to &ldquo;kick 2019 with a bang.&rdquo;</p><p>According to CZ, cryptocurrency price is a &ldquo;very strong traction for speculators.&rdquo; However, he believes that the industry will &ldquo;grow with builders&rdquo; who create new applications, which will eventually lead to increased adoption.</p><p>&ldquo;There will always be speculation, which will cause the price to fluctuate &lt;&#8230;&gt; Last year, it fluctuated upwards too much, and now we are in a correction phase,&rdquo; CZ said. &ldquo;But the long-term industry is sustained by real applications and real use cases of cryptocurrency, and a lot of people are building. So, that&rsquo;s happening regardless where the price moves.&rdquo;</p><p>Also, the market conditions haven&rsquo;t changed Binance&rsquo;s strategy at all, according to CZ. In addition to its Singapore fiat-crypto exchange launched in September 2018, the company is planning to set up &ldquo;two or three in the next few months&rdquo;. Furthermore, CZ stated that in 2019 the exchange will roll out ten more fiat-crypto exchanges as well as the company&rsquo;s first decentralized exchange (DEX.) (The company released <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-makes-two-major-announcements-bnb-is-up-by-9-3026.htm">a sneak peek</a> of its DEX earlier in December.)</p><p>&ldquo;None of our plans changed. We are still pushing forward, very aggressively,&rdquo; he said. At the time of writing, the 24 hour trading volume on Binance stands at more than USD 1.1 billion.</p><p>CZ also commented on the government&rsquo;s role in the cryptocurrency space. The CEO urged for more clarity and regulation that would promote innovation.</p><p>When asked about his net worth, which was estimated to stand at around USD 2 billion in the beginning of 2018, CZ stated that he still holds all his assets in cryptocurrencies.</p><p>&ldquo;All my net worth is still in crypto, and you can look at the market, it&rsquo;s definitely down. But hey, it&rsquo;s just a year. The industry has survived situations like this before, and I&rsquo;m confident the same will happen again,&rdquo; CZ said.</p><p>This statement by CZ echoes words of Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a></b>, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, who said in June that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-s-happening-in-the-market-an-optimistic-and-pessimistic-2052.htm">people are needlessly worried about the dip</a>. </p><p>&#8220;I want to encourage you all to ignore the price of crypto and the headlines which will inevitably start to come up. Our job is to rise above that, finding our own intrinsic source of motivation, to come in and do our best work, regardless of what other people think,&#8221; Armstrong said in a motivational message to his team. <br>

However, this time the news was also confirmed by Church&rsquo;s Chicken Venezuela&rsquo;s General Manager Orlando Gustavo Navas:</p><p>&ldquo;The Dash Venezuela and Dash Core Group teams have been instrumental in helping us adapt our payment systems, staff training, and providing counsel on all essential internal and legal processes for this integration, helping us become a global pioneer franchise in terms of accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment method.&rdquo;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe width="560" height="405" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1fFsKo3ozo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Meanwhile, not everything was so smooth when director of media and PR of Dash, Mark Mason on December 7 tweeted that KFC is joining the group of Dash merchants in Venezuela. A few days later KFC Venezuela&rsquo;s CEO Antonio Sampayo denied this, adding that both companies have only discussed the possibility of accepting Dash. </p><p>Soon after, Dash apologized saying that &#8220;the message released was premature and reflected our optimism instead of current state of our discussions with KFC Venezuela.&#8221; </p><oembed url="https://twitter.com/dashmerchant/status/1072327769068052481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></oembed><p>In either case, Dash claims that more 4,400 merchants accept this cryptocurrency, while more than half of them are located in Venezuela alone.<br>

Then they can use it to buy more games,&rdquo; RobotCache CEO Lee Jacobson told Venture Beat. </p><p>While users will get back 25% of the original price (in tokens), publishers will be awarded 70% (compared with 95% after the first purchase) and RobotCache will take 5%. </p><p>As reported by <i>Cryptonews.com</i>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-video-games-will-drive-blockchain-adoption-2585.htm">video games are the reason to think that blockchains can gain mainstream</a> understanding, acceptance and adoption in the months to come.</p><p>By integrating some aspect of blockchain tech into their dynamics or game world, they&#8217;re familiarising the public with how distributed ledgers and crypto in general works. And in turn, this familiarity will create an increasing readiness to accept the application of blockchains to other areas beyond video games.</p>

Based on this methodology and its findings, BDCenter concluded that US, Russian, and Chinese traders represent almost 60% of the crypto traders on exchanges with the US leading with over 30%:</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c0/8ee819e569.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c0/8ee819e569.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5c0/8ee819e569.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5c0/8ee819e569.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5c0/8ee819e569.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5c0/8ee819e569.png 968w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: BDCenter</figcaption></figure><p>____</p><p>Also, the demographic data shows that the 25-34 age group has most traders (more than 37%), followed by young adults (18-24) with almost 18%. Furthermore, more than 70% of the traders are men with the exception for the crypto exchange exx.com (48%.)</p><p>Most crypto traders have already completed higher education, but a significant percentage of them are still involved in undergraduate or graduate programs. The most popular university degrees for traders include mathematical and economic studies.</p><p>Traders with no or minimal experience add up the largest group, followed by senior and junior crypto traders. Also, by monitoring user activity on exchanges, the researchers concluded that the average user spends approximately 10 minutes on the platform with the average retention rate being between 7 and 12 visits per month, viewing 4-13 currency pairs with the most popular ones being <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/">BCH</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/litecoin/">LTC</a>.</p><p>The researchers have also determined the common characteristics of cryptocurrency traders. According to them, the average trader studies or develops trading strategies; has an analytical mind and uses analytical tools; attends courses, webinars, or workshops on trading; has an understanding of investment products and services as well as showing a keen interest to asset management and the market. Furthermore, the researchers stated that top traders are able to use Python and R programming languages.</p>

While the agency admits that the level of privacy offered by the abovementioned digital currencies is &ldquo;desirable,&rdquo; the DHS has a keen interest in tracing the transactions of these coins to monitor potential illegal activities.</p><p>&ldquo;To that end, this proposal calls for solutions that enable law enforcement investigations to perform forensic analysis on blockchain transactions,&rdquo; the DHS states in the document.</p><p>According to the DHS, two examples of privacy coins are Monero and Zcash. However, new privacy-focused solutions can be developed. So, the federal agency has to develop a forensic analysis for these blockchains that will be applicable for newer blockchain applications too.</p><p>The DHS outlined three phases for privacy coin tracking. The first will involve deep analysis of different blockchains. During this phase, the agency seeks to identify the &ldquo;risks to privacy, security, and technology&rdquo; as well as developing a forensic analysis method to trace privacy-focused blockchains.</p><p>In the second phase, a prototype will be developed to test out the DHS&rsquo; privacy coin investigation methods, which was outlined in the first phase. After each test, the agency seeks to find ways to improve their newly developed investigation method.</p><p>The last phase will involve the agency&rsquo;s forensic methods going live. The DHS expects both the governmental and commercial use of its technique.</p><p>As the actual solicitation is expected to be released on December 19, 2018, interested parties will have a chance to contact the DHS with their proposals until December 18.</p><p>Meanwhile, last week, authorities in the US reminded that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/authorities-just-reminded-that-they-can-track-bitcoin-users-2997.htm">they can track Bitcoin users down</a>. Two Iranians who reportedly helped exchange Bitcoin ransom payments into Iranian rial on behalf of Iranian malicious cyber actors were caught as their Bitcoin addresses were identified by the US Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control, as reported.<br>

It&rsquo;s not the best service for private messaging as every single message is recorded on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> blockchain, which means that they are public and can never be modified or deleted.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c0/52f0284799.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c0/52f0284799.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5c0/52f0284799.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5c0/52f0284799.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5c0/52f0284799.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5c0/52f0284799.jpg 1252w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/vallefrias</figcaption></figure><p>This fun service isn&rsquo;t that revolutionary, as it has been possible to add messages on the Bitcoin blockchain since its inception. For example, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, included this message in the Genesis Block, or the first-ever block of Bitcoin: &#8220;The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.&#8221; Meanwhile, this year, <b>TD Ameritrade</b>, an online broker, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/there-s-an-ad-on-bitcoin-s-blockchain-for-ameritrade-1655.htm">planted their literal flag</a> on the Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain, effectively making an advertisement for themselves.</p><p>However, &ldquo;Blockchains are forever&rdquo; makes this much easier. Just type in your message, choose whether you want your message to show on the Bitcoin blockchain or testnet, choose your payment method (via the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a> or the regular Bitcoin payment), pay, and voil&aacute;! Your message is &ldquo;immortalized.&rdquo;</p><p>This is what people are sending into eternity:</p><figure style="max-width: 677px"><a href="https://blockchainsareforever.com/" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c0/52c7973dbf.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 677px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c0/52c7973dbf.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5c0/52c7973dbf.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5c0/52c7973dbf.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5c0/52c7973dbf.png 900w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It won&rsquo;t cost you a lot to try &ldquo;Blockchains are forever&rdquo; as sending one message is less than 5 US dollar cents. However, you are only allowed to send 80 characters in a single message. So, if you are planning to add a wall of text to the Bitcoin blockchain, be sure to stock up with BTC first.</p><p><i>Cryptonews.com</i> covered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-adoption-or-how-to-make-a-fake-whale-squirt-2162.htm">two similarly creative crypto projects</a> previously. The first one is Steem Whale, which allows you to make an artificial whale fountain squirt by sending the Steem cryptocurrency. </p><p>Another fun project is Satoshi&rsquo;s Place, a graffiti board to show the power and capabilities of the Lightning Network. There&rsquo;re one million pixels on the canvas with each costing 1 satoshi to paint. Even if you draw something large, it won&rsquo;t cost you a lot. But be aware: others can respray your art!</p><p>Hower, immutability of public blockchains is being used to send serious messages, also. As reported in April, activists have posted a student of <b>Peking University&#8217;s</b> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinese-metoo-activists-turn-to-blockchain-to-avoid-censorsh-1652.htm">#MeToo movement letter</a> on the Ethereum blockchain in an attempt to avoid government censorship.</p>

Kwon added that some cases might have gone undetected, so he estimates that the possible number of the hacks could be as high as 100.</p><p>According to the report, hackers send infected email attachments with malware, so they can take over control of a crypto user&rsquo;s device when the attachment is opened.</p><p>Most of the victims of the recent hacks were wealthy South Korean cryptocurrency users as hackers believe that they could steal &ldquo;billions&rdquo; from these targets, Choi said.</p><p>As mentioned, in the past, hackers were targeting crypto related institutions.</p><p>For example, earlier this year, North Korean hackers had reportedly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/n-korea-crypto-hack-threat-rising-again-experts-2418.htm">attacked</a> an unnamed South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. The attackers tried to breach the exchange four times, but every attempt was unsuccessful.</p><p>North Korea was also reportedly responsible for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/north-korea-s-elite-hacking-team-targets-crypto-users-1188.htm">compromising</a> 36,000 user accounts on the South Korean crypto exchange <b>Bithumb</b> and <b>Coinis&rsquo;</b> USD 2 million raid in 2017. </p><p>Furthermore, according to the IT security firm <b>McAfee</b>, North Korean hackers were behind the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/morning-news-n-korea-in-turkey-raid-japanese-regulator-crack-1367.htm">attack</a> on Turkey&rsquo;s financial industry and government organizations where the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities of Adobe Flash to inject malware to the victims&rsquo; computers.</p>

Moreover, another company, <b>Athena Bitcoin</b> that had set up the first crypto cash point in Argentina, has also stated that it expects to have a total of 30 machines in the country by the end of 2018.</p><p>However, it seems that the country won&rsquo;t see dozens of new Bitcoin ATMs anytime soon.</p><p>Odyssey Group has postponed its plans and now estimates to enter the market during the next six months, the Next Web reported, citing CEO Sebastian Ponceliz. According to the report, he claims that the reason for postponing Argentina&rsquo;s Bitcoin ATM upgrade is due to the central bank of the country and the organization&rsquo;s local market partners that allegedly asked the company to adjust &ldquo;all the legal and technical requirements&rdquo; that were &ldquo;demanded&rdquo; by the aforementioned parties.</p><p>However, the report stressed that the company has previously made multiple promises that have yet to come true. In September 2017, the subsidiary of the company, Octagon, planned to install 250 crypto ATMs in Buenos Aires by October. While in May 2018, Ponceliz announced that his company had reached an agreement with Argentina&rsquo;s central bank to roll out 4,000 machines. Moreover, in the same interview, the CEO claimed that 200 ATMs had been set up in the Latin American country. But that did not happen, according to Coin ATM Radar that shows only four working crypto cash points in the country, all installed by Athena.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French fintech company <b>Keplerk</b> has just made it possible for tobacco shop customers in France to buy bitcoins.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/683e026c0d.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/683e026c0d.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/683e026c0d.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/683e026c0d.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/683e026c0d.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/683e026c0d.jpg 1254w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/Brasil2</figcaption></figure><p>The initiative affects 24,000 tobacco shops in the country where bitcoins will be offered as vouchers, which can be cashed in via Keplerk&rsquo;s wallet. The company will take a 7% cut on every transaction as commission fees.</p><p>&ldquo;Tobacco shop owners are the best channel as they are trusted by customers, and they are used to sell vouchers such as credit for mobile phones,&rdquo; Adil Zakhar, Keplerk&rsquo;s director for strategy and development, was quoted as saying by Reuters.</p><p>According to the <b>Bank of France</b>, the monetary authority will not supervise Keplerk&rsquo;s project, but the institution has warned French citizens about the risks of buying cryptocurrencies.</p><p>&ldquo;Those are purely speculative assets and not currencies. Those who invest in bitcoin or other crypto-assets do it at their own risk,&rdquo; the central bank said on November 21, 2018.</p><p>Meanwhile, in March 2018, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/australians-to-purchase-btc-eth-across-1-200-newsstands-1320.htm">Cryptonews.com reported</a> a similar event in Australia. From that date, Aussie crypto enthusiasts are able to purchase bitcoin and ether at 1,200 newsstands in the Oceanic country. The adoption was facilitated by the Australian cryptocurrency exchange <b>Bitcoin.com.au</b>. </p><p>Also, in July 2017, the Austrian startup <b>BitPanda</b> has partnered with the country&rsquo;s postal service, the &Ouml;sterreichische Post, to offer cryptocurrency vouchers &#8211; including bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and dash &#8211; to the citizens of the European country. The coins are offered in denominations of 50, 100, and 500 EUR, which can be purchased in 10,400 branches of the <b>&Ouml;sterreichische Post</b> as well as in 1,300 postal partners of the organization.</p>

This is the first <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> blockchain-based game that has gone through Sony&rsquo;s rigid process of approval.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/408fec219e.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/408fec219e.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/408fec219e.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/408fec219e.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/408fec219e.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/408fec219e.jpg 1617w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Plague Hunters. Source: a video screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>Plague Hunters, the sequel to its forefather, the successful Plague Road, is developed by <b>Arcade Distillery</b>, a New York-based video game maker. Arcade Distillery is expected to release the game in Q1 2019.</p><p><b>The game teaser:</b></p><div class="video-object"><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlllyDW1LMM?wmode=transparent&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The game will use the freemium model, so it will be free to play with a chance for players to purchase in-game items. For this, Plague Hunters will have a built-in peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Players can use the marketplace to exchange their items with each other with having full ownership of the assets. The in-game assets will be non-fungible tokens, which you may know from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cryptokitties/">CryptoKitties</a>.</p><p>Despite that the marketplace will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, Plague Hunter will not feature blockchain-based gameplay. Instead, the gameplay was designed for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch, a gaming console, with Arcade Distillery exploring options to release the game for Xbox One and smartphones.</p><p>While the gameplay will be very similar to non-blockchain based games, users in Plague Hunter&rsquo;s ecosystem will have full ownership of every asset they receive, collect, or buy, as well as the scarcity of the in-game items will have provable scarcity. </p><p>Basing a video game on the blockchain is a creative way to introduce new people to cryptocurrencies as well as to attract crypto enthusiasts into blockchain gaming. </p><p>But Plague Hunter is not the only blockchain-based game that&rsquo;s to be released. Earlier in November, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>-backed card game Gods Unchained released its gameplay trailer. The game &#8211; which was inspired by popular titles like Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone &#8211; will also feature blockchain-based assets, but the gameplay will happen on the creator&#8217;s, <b>Fuel Games&rsquo;</b> servers.</p><p>Gods Unchained is soon going into private beta for stress testing the game, and in three months, the game&rsquo;s open beta will be released with the full launch coming thereafter.</p><div class="video-object"><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLvFIUKYbUc?wmode=transparent&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

The head of <b>Fundstrat Global Advisors</b>, a market analyst company, estimates that fair value for bitcoin would be roughly 2.2 times the new USD 7,000 break-even price, therefore Bitcoin should stand at around USD 15,000.</p><p>Less than a month ago, he <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-will-november-rain-bring-for-bitcoin-this-year-2804.htm">was convinced</a> that Bitcoin could still <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tom-lee-may-have-misspoke-a-little-bit-in-bitcoin-prediction-2180.htm">surpass USD 20,000</a> &#8211; even in spite of the almost year-long bear market. </p><p><b>Bitcoin price chart:</b></p><figure><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/2bd02c6a73.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/2bd02c6a73.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/2bd02c6a73.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/2bd02c6a73.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/2bd02c6a73.png 900w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The analyst also stressed that the recent drop in the market led to a renewed wave of pessimism: &ldquo;We believe the negative swing in sentiment is much worse than the fundamental implications&rdquo;.</p><p>However, according to Lee, a price recovery is possible. He believes that the wave of institutions (<b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bakkt/">Bakkt</a></b>, <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/fidelity-investments/">Fidelity</a></b>) &#8211; that are expected to enter the market at the end of 2018 &#8211; could bring Bitcoin bulls back. </p><p>Meanwhile, Sven Henrich, founder of <b>NorthmanTrader</b>, a market analysis firm, published this chart that compares Lee&#8217;s predictions and Bitcoin price:</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/2bda272efd.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/2bda272efd.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/2bda272efd.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/2bda272efd.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/2bda272efd.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>(Click on Henrich&#8217;s tweet to see the whole chart below.)</p><p>Henrich&rsquo;s followers on Twitter reacted: </p><oembed url="https://twitter.com/savvytrader2018/status/1063782132093513728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></oembed><p>Other members of the cryptoverse have also offered their opinion:</p><oembed url="https://twitter.com/driver95243/status/1063699704477900800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></oembed><p>Back in 2017, Lee stated that he believes &ldquo;Bitcoin is your best investment until the end of the year.&rdquo; According to him, people see Bitcoin as the older generations have been seeing gold in the 1980s: a hedge against fiat currencies. If Bitcoin captures the &#8220;5% of just the gold market, it&#8217;s USD 25,000. But 5% seems like an awfully small number. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s 10 or 15. Then bitcoin could easily be in the USD 100,000 range,&rdquo; he said back then.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After <b>Coinmine</b>, a <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a></b>, among other investors, backed crypto tech startup, introduced Coinmine One, a device capable of mining cryptocurrencies, it hit a wall of criticism due to the low mining profitability it offers. However, it might be only the beginning of the new wave of the crypto tech for the general public and another step towards the mass adoption.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/ea7b45b442.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/ea7b45b442.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5be/ea7b45b442.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5be/ea7b45b442.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5be/ea7b45b442.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5be/ea7b45b442.jpg 1729w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Coinmine</figcaption></figure><p>At this stage, the device might provide a hassle-free solution for people who seek to get into crypto mining and earn some coins on the way. Now it can mine cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum-classic/">Ethereum Classic</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zcash/">Zcash</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/monero/">Monero</a>. However, at the time when <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-mining_profitability.html">mining profitability is going down</a>, it might be not a good idea to buy a USD 799 device in order to make 2 dollars per month (also, there is a 5% fee.) (In comparison, the same device would have made around USD 200 in January this year, when the ether price stood at almost USD 1,400. Now the price stands at USD 178.) </p><p>Some people reacted: </p><oembed url="https://twitter.com/finchify/status/1062891364126547974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></oembed><p>Moreover, the company collects the mined coins and stores them on wallets powered by Coinmine&rsquo;s central servers.</p><p>However, the startup rushed to defend its product that starts shipping in December, by saying that &ldquo;this is not just a miner, but a general purpose crypto device that just happens to include a GPU [graphics processing unit] miner&rdquo; and adding that &ldquo;what you buy today will not be what you have in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>For starters, the company plans to add more coins that could be mined on this device. Also, they promise that two new features are coming &ldquo;soon.&rdquo;</p><p>According to their website, users will be able to send and receive payments on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/">Lightning Network</a>, earning routing fees in with their bitcoin. Furthermore, Coinmine stated that their users will also be able to participate in the Proof of Stake networks where they will be able to &ldquo;effortlessly&rdquo; stake cryptocurrency right from their mobile device. In this case, instead of using hardware to mine, users &ldquo;stake&rdquo; their currency to the validity of transactions. In return, they earn interest on the tokens they have staked.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/ea7d0b6462.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/ea7d0b6462.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5be/ea7d0b6462.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5be/ea7d0b6462.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5be/ea7d0b6462.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5be/ea7d0b6462.png 1020w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Coinmine</figcaption></figure><p>______</p><p>In either case, Coinmine is not the only company that is making crypto mining accessible for the general public. </p><p>For example, bitcoin mining rig manufacturer <b>Canaan Creative</b> has reportedly come up with a creative new way for ordinary people to mine bitcoins by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/your-tv-set-may-become-a-mining-rig-2374.htm">using their TV sets</a>.</p><p>Also, there is a heater that, when you turn it on, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/combine-mining-crypto-and-heating-with-a-smart-heater-1375.htm">passively mines your cryptocurrency</a> of choice while doing its original job in heating up the room.</p><p>Moreover, there&#8217;s a desktop app, <b>Honeyminer</b>, that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/this-app-is-a-new-hit-among-wannabe-miners-2320.htm">helps the average Joe</a> with a consumer-grade computer mine cryptocurrencies.</p>

The research shows that with appropriate design, Central bank digital currency could meet public policy goals, including financial inclusion, security and consumer protection; It could also provide what the private sector cannot: privacy in payments. </p><p>Meanwhile, in a recent <a href="https://www.omfif.org/media/5424806/btn_1118_web.pdf#utm_source=omfifbulletinpressrelease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opinion piece</a> published on the Bulletin, a monthly publication of the <b>Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum</b> (OMFIF), an independent think tank for central banking, economic policy and public investment, the IMF chief said that regulators and other participants of the financial market should be aware of the cryptocurrency-related dangers, also.</p><p>&ldquo;[Regulators] must protect consumers and investors against fraud and combat tax evasion, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. They must also protect the integrity and stability of the financial system,&rdquo; Lagarde said, stressing that the authorities &ldquo;must beware of stifling innovation that benefits the public.&rdquo;</p><p>Lagarde likes to emphasize the advantages of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. For example, in April, she was exploring some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/an-even-handed-approach-to-crypto-assets-1597.htm">potential benefits of cryptocurrencies</a>, stressing that &ldquo;answers are already starting to take shape.&rdquo;</p>

The exchange <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-exploring-cardano-basic-attention-token-stellar-zcash-and-0x-9e44f0eb823f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in July 2018</a> that it is &ldquo;exploring&rdquo; XLM along with some other coins. Since then, Coinbase has already listed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/0x/">0x</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/basic-attention-token/">BAT</a>, so the market estimated that it shouldn&rsquo;t be much time until Stellar Lumens can be traded on the company&rsquo;s platform. However, as the recent listings have shown, after the initial jump, price of a crypto asset tend to drop sharply a few days later.  </p><p>On the other hand, EOS has recently received criticism for being centralized. On November 9, 2018, Reddit user u/auti9003 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9vu7mb/eos_centralisation_in_action_arbitrator_rules_to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a thread</a> showcasing a screenshot that an EOS moderator has supposedly reversed a transaction after it has been confirmed. The case included a dispute, in which a perpetrator has allegedly acquired the private keys of a user and transacted a number of EOS coins without the owner&rsquo;s permission. According to the post, the &ldquo;arbitrator&rdquo; ruled that the coins in dispute should be returned to the original owner, despite that the transaction has been confirmed.</p><p>Moreover, <b>Whiteblock</b>, a blockchain testing company based in Los Angeles, recently said that one of the largest projects in the crypto space &ldquo;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/storm-is-coming-eos-is-not-a-blockchain-2862.htm">EOS is not a blockchain</a>, rather a distributed homogeneous database management system.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/otc/">over-the-counter (OTC)</a> market might be no less than the online reported volumes on CoinMarketCap, a popular cryptocurrency market data provider, according to Changpeng Zhao, CZ, the CEO of the major exchange <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a></b>.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/947f11afcd.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/947f11afcd.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5be/947f11afcd.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5be/947f11afcd.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5be/947f11afcd.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5be/947f11afcd.jpg 778w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Changpeng Zhao, CZ. Source: Twitter</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve heard is, the OTC market is at least as large as the online reported volumes, so there&rsquo;s at least 50% of volumes that&rsquo;s not been reported on CoinMarketCap. But we&rsquo;re not heavy into that business, so we don&rsquo;t know the real volumes,&rdquo; CZ said in an interview with CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crypto Trader.&rdquo; </p><p>At the time of writing, the 24 hour trading volume for top 5 largest cryptocurrencies stands at almost USD 7 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. </p><p>Supporting CZ&rsquo;s statement, an April 2018 <a href="https://research.tabbgroup.com/report/v16-013-crypto-trading-platforms-target-institutional-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> by the <b>Tabb Group</b>, the international research and consulting firm focused exclusively on capital markets, suggests that OTC trading accounted for a daily volume of USD 12 billion worth of BTC earlier this year. At the same time, over USD 5.1 billion of online trading was reported on CoinMarketCap.</p><p>CZ also responded to the decreasing trading volume on Binance (minus 32% in October compared to September). According to him, &ldquo;business goes okay&rdquo; despite the drop. Compared to January 2018, they now only have the tenth of January&rsquo;s trading volume. However, Binance is trading &ldquo;huge volumes&rdquo; (USD 521 million in the past 24 hours) compared to one or two years ago, the CEO said.</p><p>&ldquo;When there&rsquo;s no movement in price, people will trade less, so that&rsquo;s kind of understandable,&rdquo; CZ stated. &ldquo;The volume here is now great, and there have always been hundreds of exchanges in our space or even thousands of exchanges.&rdquo;</p><p>According to CZ, both new users and the amount of cryptocurrency Binance is holding is increasing steadily.</p><p>&ldquo;If you look at our core wallets, the amount of BTC we hold, we have just seen an increase in people depositing Bitcoins to our exchange, and the same thing [with] almost all the cryptocurrencies we hold,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>CZ added that Binance&rsquo;s increasing crypto deposits is a &ldquo;very good sign,&rdquo; indicating healthy behavior from the exchange&rsquo;s users.<br>
