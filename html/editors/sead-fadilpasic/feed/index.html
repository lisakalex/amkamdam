<h2>Crypto Execs Argue Bull Run Could Lead to $100,000 BTC in 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Executives in the crypto industry argue that we may be witnessing the start of a new bull run that could lead to all-time highs for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-nears-41000-amid-broader-crypto-rally.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> in 2024 &#8211; above $100,000.</p>
<p>Pascal Gauthier, CEO of hardware wallet maker <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ledger-and-fvckrender-launch-limited-edition-nano-x-more-collabs-coming.htm"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/04/bitcoin-price-at-100000-in-2024-crypto-execs-say-bull-run-has-begun.html">told</a> CNBC that it feels that 2023 &#8220;was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful&#8221; for 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p>Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets at crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indian-crypto-exchange-coindcx-lays-off-12-of-staff-citing-prolonged-bear-market-tds.htm"><strong>CoinDCX</strong></a>, commented that a number of market participants are expecting a bull run following the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-halts-btc-sales-remain-bullish-price-ahead-of-halving.htm">halving</a> next year, &#8220;but given the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">ETF</a> news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. That could cause a massive upward run in the price,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ayyar also warned that an all-out ETF rejection &#8220;could play havoc to this run as well, hence definitely something to be mindful of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last week, multinational bank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-zodia-integrates-ripple-owned-metacos-crypto-safekeeping.htm"><strong>Standard Chartered</strong></a> reiterated that bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of next year, driven by numerous ETF approvals.</p>
<p>Crypto financial services firm <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matrixport-doubles-down-45000-bitcoin-prediction-as-fomo-grips-crypto-market.htm"><strong>Matrixport</strong></a> also released a note last week projecting BTC would hit $63,140 by April and $125,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>David Marcus, CEO of Lightning Network infrastructure builder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-lightspark-ceo-david-marcus-envisions-bitcoin-as-global-payment-network.htm"><strong>Lightspark</strong></a>, told CNBC, &#8220;I think that once you get the speculative phase out of the way, which I think we’re almost done with, probably not yet completely done, then you can get real builders focusing on the technology and the problems that can solve in the world, rather than just having a giant digital casino for people to trade.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Spanish Police Arrest a Man for Working with ETH Dev in North Korea, Violating US Sanctions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spains-crypto-users-to-declare-digital-assets-on-foreign-platforms-as-tax-agency-updates-guidelines.htm">Spanish</a> police have arrested a Spaniard wanted by US officials for working with American crypto expert and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-layer-2-blast-closes-in-on-solana-after-reaching-600-million-tvl-in-10-days.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a> developer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/prosecutors-ethereum-foundation-knew-about-virgil-griffiths-north-korea-intentions.htm">Virgil Griffith</a> to provide cryptocurrency and blockchain technology services to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-korean-hackers-disguise-as-south-korean-govt-agencies-to-steal-cryptos-report.htm">North Korea</a>, thus violating US sanctions against the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/spanish-police-arrest-man-wanted-by-us-in-north-korean-crypto-case-/7380904.html">According</a> to VOA, the police said they had arrested Alejandro Cao de Benos (48) on Thursday. After appearing before a judge on Friday, Cao De Benos was released, pending the formal extradition process, which could take months to complete. He faces 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Justice Department</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-doj-seizes-9-million-in-usdt-from-cyber-scam-organization-tether-to-onboard-fbi.htm">DOJ</a>) indicted Cao de Benos and British citizen Christopher Emms (then 30) last April, accusing them of conspiring with Griffith to provide North Korea with training in the technology.</p>
<p>Griffith pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 63 months in prison. Emms remains at large.</p>
<h2>Bybit: Institutions Have Doubled Bitcoin Allocations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Institutional investors nearly doubled their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-space-force-member-proposes-bitcoins-pow-systems-in-cyberattack-prevention.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> holdings in the first three quarters of 2023, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/institutions-have-doubled-their-bitcoin-allocations-this-year-new-bybit-report-shows-302003220.html">according</a> to crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cftcs-request-for-coinbase-user-data-linked-to-bybit-investigation-whats-going-on.htm"><strong>Bybit&#8217;s</strong></a> new report, &#8220;Navigating Bull and Bear Markets — A Dive Into Asset Allocation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Institutional investors hold 45% in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-toniq-launches-first-ordinals-specific-nft-marketplace-built-on-bitcoin-l2-neobank-brighty-reveals-european-b2b-platform-brighty-business.htm">stablecoins</a>, 35% in bitcoin, and 15% in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-343038810-was-lost-to-hacks-and-fraud-in-november-a-15x-increase-from-october.htm">ethereum (ETH)</a>, emphasizing liquidity and strategic diversification.</p>
<p>The report further observed a decline in institutional interest in ETH. But upcoming market developments, like the rumored <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-files-spot-ether-etf-application.htm"><strong>BlackRock</strong> spot Ether ETF</a>, could shift the trend, it said.</p>
<p>Retail traders hold more stablecoins, the report found, suggesting a more cautious allocation to riskier assets compared to traditional finance norms.</p>
<p>Both retail and VIP traders show higher altcoin holdings than institutional investors. These, however, remain a minor part of total portfolios, indicating caution, perhaps as a result of the recent bear market, Bybit noted.</p>
<h2>Bitget Protection Fund Sees An All-Time High</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/illuvium-joins-blockchain-gaming-partnership-with-esports-powerhouse-team-liquid-more-news.htm"><strong>Bitget</strong></a> has released its Protection Fund Valuation Report for November 2023, including &#8220;an exciting all-time-high of $410 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With an average of over $400 million for the month, this was the highest value of the Protection fund since its launch,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/bitget-protection-fund-achieves-all-time-high-valuation-in-november-302004237.html">said</a>.</p>
<p>The highest value reported was $410.37 million (November 16), the lowest value was $389.36 million (November 1), and the average value was $401.31 million.</p>
<p>The Protection Fund is entirely self-funded, the exchange noted.</p>
<h2>Trezor Launches Education Program in Africa, Funds Bitcoineta Land Rover</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hardware wallet maker <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trezor-initiates-investigation-as-phishing-campaign-targets-crypto-hardware-wallet-users.htm"><strong>Trezor</strong></a> announced the launch of its education program, <strong>Trezor Academy</strong>, which will be rolled out in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-defi-can-bridge-the-forex-gap-in-africa-according-to-banking-ceo.htm">Africa</a>. Throughout 2024, the company plans to set up academies in more than ten new African countries to engage with and provide Bitcoin education for hundreds of local educators, the announcement <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/introducing-trezor-academy-bitcoineta-spreading-bitcoin-knowledge-where-it-matters-the-most-d68933c52a63">said</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of Trezor Academy follows a successful pilot program that took place throughout 2023 and saw the company and local influencers host events in Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi. They helped introduce attendees to the benefits of Bitcoin and the importance of self-custody.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative, Trezor is also funding Bitcoineta, a branded Land Rover that, in conjunction with <strong>Bitcoin Cowries</strong>, will tour the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The Bitcoineta road trip started on December 1 at the <strong>Africa Bitcoin Conference</strong>. Its progress will be shared via the official Bitcoineta X account.</p>
<p>The Bitcoineta vehicle is the fifth of its kind, with other educational road trips currently active in Central America, South America, Europe, and South Africa.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/amazon-drops-nft-bombshell-official-email-teases-digital-tokens-platform-gallery.htm">Amazon</a> Managed Blockchain</strong> (AMB) Access now supports the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm"><strong>Polygon</strong></a> proof-of-stake (PoS) mainnet and the Mumbai testnet in public preview.</p>
<p>AMB is a fully managed service that provides access to public and private blockchains. Polygon is a scaling solution leveraging the <strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine</strong> (EVM), known for higher transaction throughput and lower transaction fees. The blockchain is often used in building decentralized applications (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-hackers-stole-dollar141-billion-ytd-and-dollar222-million-in-october-google-cloud-launches-solana-network-dataset-on-bigquery.htm">dapps</a>) related to non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptopunks-and-bored-apes-dip-as-nft-500-index-falls-despite-crypto-rally.htm">NFTs</a>), Web3 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/illuvium-joins-blockchain-gaming-partnership-with-esports-powerhouse-team-liquid-more-news.htm">games</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/avax-soars-over-22-as-traditional-firms-increase-tokenization-efforts.htm">tokenization</a> use cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/amazon-managed-blockchain-access-adds-support-for-polygon-pos">According</a> to Polygon&#8217;s blog post,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[AMB] is adding support for Polygon PoS to offer developers a reliable, scalable and cost-efficient way to build Web3 applications.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The developer guide <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/latest/ambp-dg/what-is-service.html">adds</a> that AMB helps users build &#8220;resilient Web3 applications on the Polygon blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, it provides serverless and instant access to Polygon PoS without minimum cost. Access is free during the public preview, but standard <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (AWS) data transfer charges apply.</p>
<h2>Benefits for Developers, Consumer Brands, and Financial Institutions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AMB Access Polygon &#8220;caters to a variety of applications, from use cases calling for repeated and highly-available access to those with intermittent and unpredictable access,&#8221; Polygon said.</p>
<p>It noted that this access is beneficial for consumer brands, institutions, and developers alike.</p>
<p>Consumer brands, it said, can use AMB Access Polygon to offer NFTs through a loyalty system to reward customers.</p>
<p>Financial services institutions can utilize it to power digital asset offerings. These require <a href="https://nonamesecurity.com/learn/what-is-json-rpc/">JSON-RPC</a> application programming interface (API) for reading blockchain data and broadcasting users&#8217; signed transactions.</p>
<p>Finally, developers can use Polygon JSON-RPC APIs through &#8220;always-on endpoints that offer predictable pay-as-you-go pricing to build applications that interact with Polygon PoS.&#8221;</p>
<p>Web3 game developers can create NFTs, which players can then use in-game and/or exchange on marketplaces on Polygon PoS.</p>
<p>AMB Access Polygon offers developers benefits such as production-grade applications, faster time to market, and automatic scaling.</p>
<p>Additionally, with pay-per-request pricing, developers can save up to 80% in blockchain node spending compared to self-managed infrastructure, Polygon claims.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every day, developers are exploring more and more use cases for scalable and mainstream applications, utilizing Polygon PoS for reliability, quick transactions and low transaction fees. These use cases range from NFT marketplaces, loyalty rewards, real-world asset tokenization,… <a href="https://t.co/JtVuHwmAGf">pic.twitter.com/JtVuHwmAGf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1729357537873371391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Not The First Polygon-AWS Collaboration</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AWS support of Polygon PoS through AMB Access further streamlines the development of scalable and mainstream applications, the post said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“AWS keeps expanding its enterprise-ready Web3 infrastructure and developer-friendly tools that businesses require to provide fast, seamless and secure access to applications for Web3 native and mainstream consumers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the projects across industries that already use AMB Access Polygon include wallet-as-a-service provider <strong>Magic</strong>, indie game developer studio <strong>Mystic Moose</strong>, music distribution-focused company <strong>RecoChoku</strong>, and global fintech infrastructure provider for real-world assets and digital securities <strong>Oasis Pro</strong>.</p>
<p>However, this is not the two companies&#8217; first partnership.</p>
<p>AWS, Polygon Labs, and gaming venture capital firm <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/animoca-brands-invests-in-ton-play-becomes-largest-validator-on-ton-blockchain.htm"><strong>Animoca Brands</strong></a> announced a strategic collaboration in mid-November. The announced <strong>MoonRealm Express Accelerator</strong> aims to support Web3 builders around the world to accelerate Web3 products and solutions through Animoca Brands’ flagship project <strong>Mocaverse</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of MoonRealm Express Accelerator is to support aspiring builders by helping them to turn concepts into real-world solutions&#8221;, the announcement said.</p>
<p>Now, they have the addition of AMB Access Polygon.</p>

<h2>Illuvium Partners With Global Esports Powerhouse Team Liquid</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Blockchain-based gaming platform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-illuvium-going-to-zero-ilv-price-suffers-6-2-fall-as-strange-mining-token-steals-the-limelight.htm"><strong>Illuvium</strong></a> joined <a href="https://illuvium.io/news/illuvium-x-team-liquid">a blockchain partnership</a> with esports organization <strong>Team Liquid</strong> to explore and limit-test Illuvium&#8217;s new auto battler game<strong> Illuvium: Arena</strong>&#8216;s competitive modes. The integration will see eight Team Liquid streamers &#8211; specializing in Teamfight Tactics, Hearthstone, and League of Legends &#8211; play the new game.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re cooking up a co-hosted tournament that will be a magnet for competitive spirits from both our communities with a $100,000+ prize pool,&#8221; the announcement said.</p>
<p>Kieran Warwick, Co-founder and CEO of Illuvium, emphasised the goal to reshape perceptions of blockchain gaming: &#8220;Overcoming the scepticism around blockchain games is crucial, and the way forward is by delivering exceptional gaming experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>This collaboration is a milestone in showing that blockchain games, including those with NFTs, can offer engaging and deep gameplay experiences on par with traditional games, Warwick said.</p>
<p>Per the press release, Illuvium unveiled the Early Access release of their Auto Battler and Overworld game following a three-year development journey and a $60 million investment.</p>
<h2>Nansen Unveils Nansen 2, AI-Powered Features, and Investment Strategy Tools</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Popular blockchain data analytics platform <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-binance-saw-significant-outflows-since-cz-announcement-kucoin-launches-kucard-10101-art-reveals-sale-of-banksys-turf-war.htm">Nansen</a> </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1729440221430006019">announced</a> the launch of Nansen 2. It&#8217;s described as a significant upgrade to its tool suite. The free version of the suite now includes access to Nansen&#8217;s popular features along with selected Nansen 2 features.</p>
<p>Nansen 2 is a faster and smarter platform designed to change how investors use blockchain data, it said. The update brings upgrades to its existing features, especially its wallet and token analytics tools.</p>
<p>These enhancements improve functionality, offering users comprehensive insights into multichain perspectives of any wallet or entity. They also provide a deeper understanding of specific on-chain token movements.</p>
<p>The new features in Nansen 2 allow users to label <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-343038810-was-lost-to-hacks-and-fraud-in-november-a-15x-increase-from-october.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a> wallets automatically based on their own criteria. This allows them to quickly identify, track, and monitor wallet addresses. These features also provide a detailed view of the holdings and activity within the chosen addresses.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nansen 2 also incorporates AI more extensively, enhancing user experience, it said New features like Smart Search and Signals enable users to search for data and find relevant dashboards using natural language queries.</p>
<p>Signals also highlight unusual volume or activity changes across tokens and NFTs. In the future, it will provide personalized insights based on user preferences.</p>
<h2>Pimlico and Safe Advance Account Abstraction with Launch of ERC-4337 Module</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
ERC-4337 infrastructure provider Pimlico has integrated smart wallet infrastructure provider <strong>Safe&#8217;s </strong>accounts via Safe’s newly launched ERC-4337 module.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://safe.mirror.xyz/Fq5gRPRx1cDdkKREcU-PvObfHPja4RhnlBoVtqxzyVo">announcement</a>, by integrating Safe’s module, Pimlico enhanced its infrastructure offering and enabled its clients to build Ethereum-based products more seamlessly and with greater UX options.</p>
<p>The Ethereum standard ERC-4337 was deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in March 2023. Its aim is to usher in more user-friendly crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/this-is-how-you-protect-crypto-in-your-wallet-according-to-expert-mark-venables.htm">wallet</a> designs.</p>
<p>Safe’s module enables developers to turn the Safe smart account standard into an ERC-4337 smart account. Developers and users can easily opt in or opt out of ERC-4337 without changing the account.</p>
<p>Also, the module will allow non-Web3 developers to offer Web3 functionalities in their Web2 consumer applications easily. Appealing to both Web2 and Web3 developers, Safe said, &#8220;it marks the first smart contract module that will be used massively in production.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Safe&#8217;s early backing and investment in Pimlico, the crypto startup recently closed a $4.2 million seed funding round led by <strong>a16z crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>Trulioo customizable onboarding workflows provide intelligent routing that directs users to optimal data matching, heightened performance, and compliance.</p>
<p>Person Match has flexible identity verification workflows built on a foundation of micro and macro data sources. It delivers automated address verification that streamlines user onboarding and reduces the need for manual uploads, among other features.</p>

<p>The platform said that by integrating features such as <strong>WalletConnect</strong> and social logins, alongside a user-friendly interface, the app significantly lowers the barriers to entry into the Web3 space.</p>

<p>By launching on Arbitrum, DAOs can benefit from lower gas costs, allowing them to conserve DAO resources and drive increased voter turnout, it added.

These include <strong>Binance</strong>, <strong>Bybit</strong>, <strong>Ripple</strong>, <strong>Crypto.com</strong>, <strong>OKX</strong>, <strong>Huobi</strong>, and others.</p>
<p>Fasset CEO Mohammad Raafi Hossain commented that the license bolstered the company&#8217;s &#8220;focus on enabling people across emerging markets to access [&#8230;] digital assets.&#8221; He added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As one of the most progressive regulatory frameworks in the world, the VARA approval is a crucial link in our global licensing portfolio, connecting places like Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Turkey.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Headquartered in the UAE and Indonesia, Fasset is a digital asset investment platform for emerging markets.</p>
<p>Prior to the company’s establishment in 2019, its founding team had worked at the UAE Prime Minister’s Office across regulations for emerging technologies. Therefore, they started the initial conversations for crypto regulation early, they said.</p>
<p>Fasset says it offers real-life use cases facilitated through digital assets, underpinned by blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it prioritizes &#8220;secure and stable cryptocurrencies&#8221; such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-evaporating-and-traders-back-new-bitcoin-etf-token-with-more-than-2m-as-sellout-looms-and-sec-approval-bets-mount.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-343038810-was-lost-to-hacks-and-fraud-in-november-a-15x-increase-from-october.htm">ethereum (ETH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-issuer-paxos-receives-preliminary-nod-from-singapore-regulator.htm">stablecoins</a>, and tokenized commodities and precious metals.</p>
<p>To increase its accessibility, the firm collaborates with various corporate entities. This incudes telecos, digital banks, wallet providers, wealth managers, fintechs, and asset managers.</p>

<p>Crypto-friendly Swiss-based <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/seba-banks-hong-kong-branch-secures-full-license-for-crypto-services-from-sfc.htm"><strong>SEBA Bank AG</strong></a> has announced its new brand identity: <strong>AMINA Bank AG</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.seba.swiss/media-and-investors/">press release</a> shared with <em>Cryptonews</em>, the rebrand will not affect the bank’s current clients “other than encountering the new name.”</p>
<p>It stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“All operations will be business as usual across the board.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This rebrand marks a new chapter for this fully licensed Swiss crypto bank, it said.</p>
<p>The name ‘AMINA’ comes from the word ‘transamination.’ It means the transference of one compound to another. The bank said that the change represents “the transformation” of its clients’ financial future.</p>
<p>Explaining further, AMINA stated that the brand is driven by continuous change. It merges elements of traditional, digital, and crypto banking “to unlock new potential” for the clients.</p>
<p>AMINA Bank operates globally from its head office in Zug, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lugano-integrates-polygon-protocol-into-mylugano-payment-app-for-crypto-transactions.htm">Switzerland</a>. It has a branch office in Abu Dhabi and subsidiaries in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-chief-executive-expresses-willingness-to-cooperate-on-granting-more-powers-to-regulate-crypto-exchanges-report.htm">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-central-bank-chief-sees-no-future-for-private-crypto.htm">Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>The latter three will “subsequently” apply for a name change to align with Zug.</p>
<h2>Preparing for 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AMINA CEO Franz Bergmueller said that the company was proud of the group&#8217;s achievements under the name SEBA.</p>
<p>He commented that the new brand indicates a new era in the company’s growth and strategy. “We are a key player in crypto banking,” the CEO said, “and are here to define the future of finance.”</p>
<p>Bergmueller also briefly discussed what’s in the pipeline for AMINA in the coming year, saying that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“As we look forward to 2024, our ambition is to accelerate the growth of our strategic hubs in Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Abu Dhabi, and to continue our global expansion […]”</p></blockquote>
<p>AMINA was founded in April 2018. Its regulated hubs, said the announcement, offer fiat and crypto services to “progressive investors” – both traditional and crypto-native, be they individuals, corporates, or institutions.</p>
<p>In 2019, it received a Swiss banking and securities dealer license. The then-SEBA Bank became one of the first institutions regulated by the <strong>Financial Market Supervisory Authority</strong> (FINMA) to provide crypto banking services.</p>
<p>In November this year, SEBA Hong Kong <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/seba-banks-hong-kong-branch-secures-full-license-for-crypto-services-from-sfc.htm">received a full license</a> from the city’s <strong>Securities and Futures Commission</strong> (SFC). This regulatory approval enabled the bank to engage in a wide range of financial activities, including the handling and advisory of both digital and traditional assets.</p>
<p>The subsidiary CEO, Amy Yu, commented that “the region’s position at the forefront of finance, trading, and innovation has long been attractive to us, as servicing APAC clientele is an integral aspiration of the team’s DNA.”</p>
<p>Also in November, Switzerland’s fifth largest cantonal bank, <strong>St.Galler Kantonalbank</strong> (SGKB), partnered with SEBA to offer custody and trading services for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-crypto-gainers-today-on-dextools-mind-babyfroge-betrock.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-343038810-was-lost-to-hacks-and-fraud-in-november-a-15x-increase-from-october.htm">ethereum (ETH)</a>.</p>
<p>SGKB said that the service would initially be available to a select group of wealth-management clients. It plans to expand the offering to retail customers.</p>

<p>In a recent chat with <em>Cryptonews</em>, Michael Rubinelli, industry veteran and Chief Gaming Officer at Web3 ecosystem for gaming <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-play-earn-games-on-wax.htm">WAX</a></strong>, discussed how macroeconomic trends affect the gaming industry, what is happening in the gaming investment arena, and the positive future awaiting blockchain-based games.</p>
<h2>Gaming Industry is Not Insulated from Macroeconomic Trends</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Rubinelli stated that he may not be an expert on how global macroeconomic trends affect gaming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitfinexs-tokenized-bond-falls-short-of-investment-target-raises-only-1-5m-of-expected-10m.htm">investment</a>, but they “undoubtedly exert a considerable influence on the world of venture capital.”</p>
<p>He noted the reaction to the performance of major games like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-27-terraclassicusd-terra-axie-infinity.htm"><strong>Axie Infinity</strong></a>. Per Rubinelli, there was an initial overreaction to the success of such games.</p>
<p>Rubinelli argued that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“When a potential &#8216;Northstar&#8217; opportunity in a relatively unexplored market segment is identified, it often triggers a rush of investment driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO).”</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, many funding pitches revolved around the premise of being &#8216;like Axie, but better.&#8217; There is no need for a deep understanding of the underlying complexities, so this can be a persuasive strategy to secure investments. That’s especially the case in a rapidly trending sector.</p>
<p>As a result, “substantial amounts of capital” were given to projects that may not have undergone due diligence.</p>
<p>Rubinelli opined that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Unfortunately, the subsequent crypto-winter brought about a series of failures among gaming studios and broad investments in Web3, leading to a necessary correction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, a question arises, he said. Are we witnessing an overcorrection in the gaming investment landscape?</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a possibility,” Rubinelli said when talking to <em>Cryptonews</em> in late October.</p>
<p>He noted, however, that venture capitalists in general have been growing increasingly risk-averse.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Until a more robust and innovative Web3 approach/business is developed, a significant portion of capital may remain in reserve as investors seek more secure opportunities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/square-enixs-nft-game-symbiogenesis-sets-auction-dates-launches-december-21-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">gaming</a> industry is not insulated from the broader macroeconomic trends. The experiences with &#8216;hot&#8217; gaming investments serve as a valuable lesson, Rubinelli said.</p>
<p>Caution is a natural response to the recent market dynamics. But the executive opined that the industry will “adapt and continue to offer promising opportunities for investors as it matures and refines its investment models.”</p>
<h2>Blockchain Gaming Stands at Pivotal Crossroads</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per WAX’s Chief Gaming Officer, there is no doubt that we will continue to see the growth of “the harmonious coexistence of blockchain-enabled games alongside traditional non-Web3 titles” on popular platforms. This includes <strong>Google Play</strong>, <strong>the App Store</strong>, <strong>Epic Games Store</strong>, <strong>Humble Bundle</strong>, and eventually <strong>Steam</strong>, he said.</p>
<p>Looking into the future, Rubinelli stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I firmly believe that in the next 3 to 5 years, a substantial majority, exceeding 75%, of newly launched games will incorporate a mechanism enabling players to sell the digital assets they own.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Game publishers and developers must strike “a delicate balance” between generating sufficient revenue to sustain their operations and ensuring that players do not feel restricted by in-game purchases.</p>
<p>That said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The current landscape of blockchain gaming stands at a pivotal crossroads, on the cusp of achieving mainstream acceptance.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, a major challenge has been that non-game developers tried creating games that “essentially amounted to the gamification of decentralized finance websites.” It lacked the true essence of gaming, Rubinelli argued. This approach proved unsustainable and ineffective.</p>
<p>But 2021’s bull run brought a significant development.</p>
<p>Many renowned AAA game developers secured funding to create authentic gaming experiences where players could genuinely own assets acquired through purchase, in-game crafting, or other means.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to note here that producing a high-quality game typically requires 18 to 36 months of meticulous work, Rubinelli said.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are on the brink of witnessing the release of remarkable and enjoyable games that are set to revolutionize the blockchain gaming sphere.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This shift is instrumental in countering the prevailing skepticism and misconceptions surrounding Web3 gaming, Rubinelli added.</p>
<h2>Competing Not With Other Games, But With Daily Entertainment</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In mid-October, WAX’s dedicated gaming studio, <strong>Tyranno Studios</strong>, led by Rubinelli, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-brawlers-enters-fortnites-home-launches-on-epic-games-store-to-230-million-gamers-globally.htm">announced</a> that its blockchain-based, wrestling-themed non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm">NFT</a>) game <strong>Brawlers</strong> launched on the major digital distribution platform <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> — becoming available to more than 230 million PC gamers worldwide.</p>
<p>There are numerous benefits and no drawbacks of blockchain games featuring on traditional platforms, per Rubinelli.</p>
<p>Content acceptance, adoption, and consumption are fueled by distribution. Without omnipresent channels of distribution, none of that matters.</p>
<p>He added that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Achieving widespread adoption in the mass market hinges on effectively communicating the essence of the gaming experience to both our current and potential audience.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Brawlers&#8217;s primary objection is to position itself in a way that resonates with all players. It has to offer familiar elements within a game that&#8217;s “undeniably enjoyable.”</p>
<p>The team behind ‘Brawlers’ never considered itself in direct competition with other Web3 titles, said Rubinelli.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Instead, we see ourselves vying for attention not just against traditional games but also against the various entertainment options people have in their daily lives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This line of thinking made the team’s goal clear. They aim to ensure that players&#8217; time in the game feels like a well-justified choice.</p>
<p>“This, undoubtedly, is our most challenging endeavor,” Rubinelli admitted.</p>

<p>Neobank <strong>Canza Finance</strong>&#8216;s decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/de-fi-2-0-revolutionizing-socialfi-antivirus-secures-5-million-in-funding.htm">DeFi</a>) tech provides decentralized foreign exchange (FX) for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-matr1x-gaming-platform-raises-10-million-bybits-portfolio-margin-mode-gets-spot-trading-capabilities-mapmetrics-expands-to-peaq-blockchain.htm">African</a> currencies, its CEO and co-founder Pascal Ntsama IV said.</p>
<p>Canza website <a href="https://canza.io/about-us/">stresses</a> that access to financial services and products is &#8220;a massive challenge&#8221; for many millions of individuals globally.</p>
<p>Therefore, the neobank, which enables decentralized cross-border payments, leverages DeFi and digital assets to bridge the existing financial service gap in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Last year, Canza <a href="https://canza.io/2022/10/25/baki-robust-reliable-and-scalable-forex-service/">revealed</a> an addition to its services: <strong>Baki</strong>. It is a liquidity FX exchange for African currencies, aiming to transform African forex &#8220;with transparent currency swaps and zTokens.&#8221;</p>
<p>It said at the time that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key benefit Baki provides, and central to its architecture, is the ability to offer infinite liquidity at the official conversion rate. This is a significant pain point for any business trying to operate an intra-African trade network.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/africa-foreign-exchange-problems-solved-defi">Talking</a> to <em>Cointelegraph</em>, CEO Ntsama explained that many Africans have trouble accessing forex liquidity and currency swaps. This limits the use of US dollar-based services in the countries dependent on imports &#8211; creating space for DeFi.</p>
<h2>DeFi To The Rescue</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
DeFi &#8211; leveraging cryptocurrencies and blockchain &#8211; can relieve many of the continent&#8217;s pain points.</p>
<p>In the case of Canza, this is where Baki comes in.</p>
<p>When users exchange local fiat currencies, funds exit Africa, which results in dollar value inflation. <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/slippage/#:~:text=Slippage%20occurs%20when%20the%20execution,quick%20turns%20in%20certain%20trends.">Currency slippage</a> leads to increased costs. Baki, the CEO says, allows users to trade at official central bank prices and swap currencies without loss.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the agent assumes local currency risk in FX swaps, Baki reduces risks by swapping similar currencies at the official central bank rate, Ntsama said.</p>
<p>This then enables the agent to swap again with the least slippage when entering US dollar positions.</p>
<p>Ntsama also commented on Nigeria where the use of blockchain &#8211; even though approved &#8211; is yet to become widespread. Per the <em>Cointelegraph</em> report, &#8220;Ntsama said Baki is built to work with the current regulatory climate as it leverages existing user behaviors to tackle problems with blockchain technology.&#8221;</p>

<h2>African Hubs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
African countries are increasingly moving towards crypto and blockchain.</p>
<p>Canza, for example, aims to create a hub for businesses to participate in FX trades at a reduced cost.</p>
<p>Per a recent CNBC report, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-investor-mike-novogratz-expects-bitcoin-gold-and-silver-to-rally-as-fed-pivots.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> is on its way to becoming the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-set-disrupt-africas-85-billion-financial-system-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">currency of choice</a> for moving money between African countries. The report came three months after the inaugural <strong>Africa Bitcoin Conference</strong> in Ghana.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jack-dorseys-block-reports-strong-q3-earnings-profits-from-bitcoin-holdings-surge.htm">Jack Dorsey</a> spoke at the conference about how BTC had made up for money lost during an earlier street protest in Nigeria.</p>

<p>In early February 2023, the <strong>Ministry of Technology and Science</strong> of Zambia <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/zambia-experiments-with-technology-regulate-cryptocurrency-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">announced</a> that it &#8211; through the <strong>Security Exchange Commission</strong> and <strong>Bank of Zambia</strong> &#8211; was testing technology to regulate crypto as the country embarked on its mission to become a regional hub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cryptocurrency will be a driver for financial inclusion and a change maker for Zambia’s economy,&#8221; Minister Felix Mutati said.</p>
<p>In November, crypto payments giant <strong>Ripple</strong> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-collaborates-to-power-payments-corridors-between-africa-and-rest-of-the-world.htm">partnered</a> with fintech <strong>Onafriq</strong> to facilitate crypto-enabled cross-border payments between 27 African countries and markets around the world.</p>

<p>In an interview with <em>Cryptonews</em>, Mark Venables – an expert in crypto wallets and the founder of <a href="https://www.thecryptomerchant.com/"><strong>The Crypto Merchant</strong></a> – discussed the best practices to keep money safe in our crypto wallets, if and how often we should move our funds to another wallet, vulnerabilities of old and ‘aging’ wallets, how newer wallets improve safety, and what awaits us by the end of this decade in the digital pouch realm.</p>
<p>This is what he had to say.</p>
<h2>Be Proactive</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Venables argued that the cryptocurrency ecosystem security is an ongoing concern. He warned that there “are various vulnerabilities that users and developers should be aware of.”</p>
<p>These include, but are not limited to, well-known phishing attacks, malware and key loggers, social engineering attacks, centralized exchange risks, and smart contract vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Not all wallet users are the same, Venables suggested. Instead, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Users should tailor their security practices based on their specific needs and the type of wallet they are using.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, an absolute must in safeguarding one’s cryptoassets, he stressed, is adopting a proactive approach to security.</p>
<p>Users can’t put funds into a wallet and forget about it. Scammers are certainly not forgetting about your money and are constantly developing ways to get to it.</p>
<p>While tailoring safety practices is needed, there are also great general rules to follow.</p>
<p>It is essential that each person regularly updates security practices and makes sure that they are informed about both the current <em>and</em> emerging threats.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Venables says,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Education and awareness around potential risks and scams play a vital role in safeguarding digital assets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t experiment with services either – triple-check that they are reputable.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is always good to follow general cybersecurity principles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>implementing and maintaining strong passwords,</li>
<li>enabling two-factor authentication (2FA),</li>
<li>having secure backup and recovery,</li>
<li>using robust antivirus software,</li>
<li>regularly updating wallet and software versions,</li>
<li>implementing encryption measures,</li>
<li>keep cautious of phishing attempts.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this may feel daunting, especially to newcomers, but it’s all vital in helping you keep your funds.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, veteran users, while more experienced, are not immune to mistakes and/or scams.</p>
<h2>Frequent Transfers to New Wallets Introduce Risk</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Yes, users should occasionally move their money to a different wallet, but how often is not an easy question to answer.</p>
<p>Changing wallets too often may actually be detrimental.</p>
<p>Per the expert,</p>
<blockquote><p>“While occasional wallet migrations for security reasons are sensible, frequent transfers can also introduce risks, such as potential mistakes during the process or increased exposure to transaction fees.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The frequency depends on several factors, Venables says. There is no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
<p>These factors include the security of the current wallet, changes in wallet technology, lost or compromised private keys, inactive or abandoned wallets, and transition to newer tech.</p>
<p>The conclusion seems to be that once the above security steps have been followed, users should “carefully balance the need for security with the practicality and convenience of managing their funds.”</p>
<h2>Older Wallets Are Vulnerable, Newer Ones Are Not Foolproof</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The technology underpinning the wallet industry is evolving.</p>
<p>By the end of this decade, Venables said, we can expect several exciting advancements and trends in the new generation of crypto wallets.</p>
<p>These include enhanced security, improved user experience, cross-chain compatibility, refi integration, mobile dominance, decentralized wallets, improved recovery options, and the integration of new technologies as they emerge.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is the issue of the older wallets.</p>
<p>These digital purses can be at risk due to outdated software, weak encryption and key management, lack of 2FA – and even discontinued support.</p>
<p>All this makes them more susceptible to social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Newer wallets do provide significant improvements in security as they aim to address the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of older wallets. However, “no system can claim to be completely foolproof or immune to all risks,” Venables warned.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are still potential areas that remain unaddressed or pose ongoing challenges. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>user responsibility,</li>
<li>centralized exchanges,</li>
<li>human error,</li>
<li>emerging vulnerabilities,</li>
<li>supply chain attacks,</li>
<li>regulatory changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Crypto Merchant was founded in 2017 in the US by early crypto adopters, coders, miners, and investors who, as the website <a href="https://www.thecryptomerchant.com/pages/about-us-guarantee">states</a>, have “spent an unreasonable amount of time seeking out only the most secure products for your cryptoassets, so that you can buy and invest with confidence.”</p>
<p>The company offers various hardware wallets from several wallet makers, including <strong>Trezor</strong>, <strong>Ledger</strong>, <strong>Blockstream</strong>, <strong>KeepKey</strong>, and more, as well as bundle deals.</p>
<p>Therefore, another good safety measure is to get a hardware wallet, preferably via The Crypto Merchant, Venables concluded.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Toniq</strong>, a company building professional tools and services on the decentralized web, today announced the launch of the first Ordinals-specific marketplace built on a <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Bitcoin</a></strong> Layer 2. The press release describes Bioniq as &#8220;the world’s fastest Bitcoin-based non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm">NFT</a>) marketplace&#8221; on the blockchain and Web3 platform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/internet-computer/"><strong>Internet Computer</strong></a>. Bioniq has two objectives: facilitating a simple means of buying and selling Bitcoin NFTs and helping alleviate Bitcoin congestion, it said. Bitcoin fees have recently exceeded those of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/forbes-latest-under-30-list-data-will-be-listed-on-ethereum.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a> by a large margin, making BTC transactions significantly more expensive. Backed by crypto-focused VC firm <strong>Polychain Capital</strong>, Bioniq was designed to solve these issues, helping users to buy, sell, exchange, and auction their Bitcoin NFTs seamlessly. Bioniq offers a built-in wallet with smart wallet features, and it allows users to manage their private keys by leveraging <strong>Web3Auth</strong>, enabling log-in with <strong>Gmail</strong> accounts in a non-custodial way. In the future, the platform plans to expand its list of available services by introducing &#8216;Launchpad&#8217; that allows the release of reserved Ordinals, or tokens on ICP with the exclusive right to inscribe on BTC; &#8216;Earn&#8217; that allows using Ordinals as collateral to borrow crypto; &#8216;Super offers&#8217; that enable placing offers on any inscription on Bitcoin and notifying the recipient; and &#8216;Collection offers&#8217; to make an offer on any Ordinal in an entire collection.</li>

<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/regulation-user-trust-and-tech-constraints-stand-in-the-way-of-mass-crypto-banking-adoption-says-brightys-cto-nikolay-denisenko.htm"><strong>Brighty App</strong></a>, a Swiss neobank powered by Web3, announced its European business-to-business (B2B) platform <strong>Brighty Business</strong>. <a href="https://financefeeds.com/bridging-b2b-digital-transactions-brighty-app-launches-eu-payment-platform-amidst-2-1-trillion-market-growth-forecast/">Per</a> the press release, focused on digital banking and cryptocurrency payments, the platform was designed to streamline how businesses manage their financial operations and support the market’s ongoing evolution. Its key features include virtual and physical company-owned debit cards that employees can utilize; transactional risk-checking; cost-effective exchange, including OTC (over-the-counter) exchange; and a referral program for all B2B customers. The new platform also provides an opportunity to implement its application programming interface (API) system into clients’ platforms. Brighty App’s B2B platform has already seen engagement and positive feedback from different companies in its pilot testing phase. The company also plans a series of user experience (UX) interviews with customers, it said.</li>

Bitcoin Core developer and Mummolin co-founder Luke Dashjr said that &#8220;the role of mining pools must change for Bitcoin to exist as a truly decentralized currency.&#8221; OCEAN, he added, is &#8220;a new type of pool that enables miners to be truly miners again. We are launching as the most transparent pool and also the only non-custodial pool where miners are the recipients of new block rewards directly from Bitcoin.&#8221;</li>
<li>Crypto earning platform <strong>Coinchange</strong> raised $10 million to grow its services. Per the press release, the round was led by <strong>G1.VC</strong>, <strong>Spirit Blockchain</strong>, <strong>Good News Ventures</strong>, <strong>K2.CA</strong>, and <strong>Atoia Ventures</strong>, with additional participation from <strong>Mintfox</strong>. The funds will support the company in expanding its operations and scaling its team and products &#8220;to make a meaningful impact on the financial landscape, leveraging unrivaled Yield farming strategies in decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/de-fi-2-0-revolutionizing-socialfi-antivirus-secures-5-million-in-funding.htm">DeFi</a>) markets.&#8221; Through its integrated Earn API services, Coinchange enables businesses to offer customers the ability to earn yield on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-hong-kong-will-use-all-available-methods-to-fight-crypto-scams-americans-are-much-more-open-to-potential-of-crypto-than-brits.htm">stablecoins</a>. With all its assets managed on the chain, Coinchange doesn’t have to rely on centralized counterparties for custody, trading, or lending and, therefore, potentially introduce counterparty risk to clients, it said. In addition to its Earn API, the firm also operates regulated and compliant brokerage services in the US and Europe.</li>

<p>The United States <strong>Department of Justice</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-records-uptick-following-reports-of-potential-4-billion-settlement-with-the-doj.htm">DOJ</a>) has seized nearly $9 million worth of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gold-smugglers-in-nepal-caught-exchanging-33kg-of-gold-for-tether-usdt-stablecoin.htm">USDT</a> from an organization running pig butchering scams &#8211; with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-and-bitfinex-settle-dispute-will-share-information-under-foil-request-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm"><strong>Tether&#8217;s</strong></a> help.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cyber-scam-organization-disrupted-through-seizure-nearly-9m-crypto">According</a> to the press release, the authorities traced the funds to cryptocurrency addresses allegedly connected to an organization that swindled more than 70 victims via romance scams and crypto confidence scams.</p>
<p>It added that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The department would like to acknowledge Tether for its assistance in effectuating the transfer of these assets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tether <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-assists-the-us-doj-and-us-secret-service-in-criminal-investigations-and-victim-recovery/">confirmed</a> it &#8220;again helped law enforcement thwart the bad actors and aid their victims&#8217; recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tether has already onboarded the <strong>United States Secret Service</strong> (USSS) into its platform.</p>
<p>Now, it says, it will be working with the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI) to do the same.</p>
<p>US Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey commented that the seizure was the result of a collaboration between the DOJ and the USSS.</p>
<p>He said that Silicon Valley is &#8220;one of the world&#8217;s preeminent locations&#8221; for crypto firms. Therefore, the authorities will use &#8220;all tools at our disposal to bring justice to the victims of frauds and scams. Even when money and criminals are abroad, we will work with our partners to seize cyber criminals’ illegal proceeds,&#8221; Ramsey said.</p>
<h2>Pig Butchering and Chain Hopping</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
‘Pig butchering’ consists of scammers ‘fattening up’ their victims, commonly inexperienced investors, before ‘butchering’ them.</p>
<p>In other words, they make false promises, get victims to trust them, take as much money as they can, and then disappear.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, criminals in this case convinced victims to make crypto deposits in what they believed were investments with trusted firms and crypto exchanges.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In reality, the purported firms and cryptocurrency exchanges were non-existent trading platforms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Agents and analysts from the USSS traced the deposits. They found that the scammers laundered the money fast through &#8220;dozens&#8221; of crypto addresses.</p>
<p>Then, they exchanged the funds for &#8220;several&#8221; different cryptocurrencies &#8211; a money laundering technique known as &#8216;chain hopping&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These techniques are used to “layer” the proceeds of criminal activity into new cryptocurrency ecosystems, all to obfuscate the nature, source, control, and ownership of those proceeds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The USSS managed to link the seized funds to victim reports.</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division commented that this was a &#8220;significant seizure&#8221; that helped authorities disrupt &#8220;the financial infrastructure of an organized network of scammers who stole millions from victims across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>These international scammers, said Argentieri, trick ordinary investors through websites that promise investments would make them money. But they just steal victims&#8217; crypto and run.</p>
<p>Even if the current state of the crypto ecosystem &#8220;may seem like an ideal way to launder ill-gotten gains,&#8221; Argentieri warned, law enforcement &#8220;will continue to develop the expertise needed to follow the money and seize it back for victims.&#8221;</p>

Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said his administration would review relevant legislation, a day after lawmakers criticized the <strong>Securities and Futures Commission</strong> (SFC) over its handling of an unlicensed platform at the center of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-banxa-and-cardanos-yoroi-wallet-enable-in-app-fiat-on-off-ramping-bybit-reveals-personality-based-trading-nft-usdt-competition.htm">an alleged $19 million fraud</a>. &#8220;If any of our laws in this area need to be strengthened, or if the transparency of the information we release has room for improvement, we will actively consider it,&#8221; he said and added he&#8217;ll &#8220;ask the relevant bureaus and departments to move forward in these areas [&#8230;] I want to emphasise that we should use all the methods available to protect the interests of investors, as well as combat any platforms or websites that are unlicensed, illegal or have scam elements.&#8221;</li>
<li>Private digital coins &#8220;have miserably failed the test of money because they can’t keep value&#8221; and will eventually exit the monetary scene, according to the <strong>Monetary Authority of Singapore’s</strong> Managing Director Ravi Menon. Therefore, the future monetary system will be comprised of three key components: central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/100000-south-koreans-will-start-using-cbdc-next-year.htm">CBDCs</a>), tokenized bank liabilities, and &#8220;well-regulated&#8221; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-zealands-kiwi-dollar-pegged-stablecoin-nzdd-embarks-with-new-self-custody-wallet.htm">stablecoins</a>, the country&#8217;s central bank chief said, as the South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3243090/singapores-central-bank-chief-ravi-menon-sees-private-cryptocurrencies-failing-they-will-eventually">reported</a>. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/atletico-madrid-sues-exchange-over-44m-unpaid-sponsorship.htm">Singapore&#8217;s</a> regulators are moving toward a system of stablecoins that are fully backed by high-quality government securities or cash, allowing them to be used like narrow money, Menon said.</li>

<li style="text-align: left">Analysts from the global market intelligence agency <strong>Mintel</strong> <a href="https://www.mintel.com/financial-services-market-news/future-of-finance-impact-of-crypto-digital-payments/">found</a> that Americans are &#8220;much more open to the potential of cryptocurrency than Brits.&#8221; Their new report on attitudes towards crypto in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm">US</a> compared to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/48-countries-join-forces-to-combat-crypto-tax-evasion-starting-in-2027.htm">UK</a> says that around a third of surveyed US consumers are interested in using cryptocurrency for purchases, and 4 in 10 Americans are more interested in crypto than a year ago. Meanwhile, almost half of surveyed Brits are skeptical about crypto and do not think it will become a common payment method, while two-thirds say they do not understand it enough to use it. Furthermore, 4 in 5 Brits said they would only trust a financial product from a regulated financial provider. British customers of financial services are also more wary of where they put their money due to the recent cost of living crisis and are therefore avoiding untested industry challengers, the report said. Principal Analyst Adrian Reynolds argued that &#8220;digital and online payments may yet become a more permanent fixture in the world of personal finance, but it looks as if it will take a bit longer for the wider banking community to come around to the idea.&#8221;</li>

<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magic-eden-tests-nft-focused-cross-chain-wallet-in-beta-301998035.html">According</a> to the press release, this is a cross-chain self-custody software wallet created in partnership with crypto wallet company <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/exodus-records-solid-q2-with-124-million-revenue-crypto-wallets-making-comeback.htm"><strong>Exodus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It is &#8220;designed to give NFT collectors a faster and more seamless experience when collecting and trading NFTs across multiple chains,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Therefore, the wallet comes with instant cryptocurrency swaps between <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-asset-funds-record-346-million-inflows-as-assets-under-management-surge-past-45-3-billion.htm"><strong>Bitcoin</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-70-gains-in-30-days-outpaces-competitors-can-sol-keep-its-momentum.htm"><strong>Solana</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-asset-funds-record-346-million-inflows-as-assets-under-management-surge-past-45-3-billion.htm">Ethereum</a></strong>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-polygon-price-going-to-zero-matic-drops-15-as-this-novel-mining-project-secures-4-3-million-in-funding.htm"><strong>Polygon</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The company added that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Beta test will begin with a limited number of users and the desktop browser extension is expected to launch to the general public widely in early 2024.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The platform plans to reveal more information on the functionality and features early next year after the completion of the Beta testing.</p>
<h2>&#8216;First-Of-Its-Kind&#8217;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Magic Eden noted that its wallet is set to become &#8220;a game-changer&#8221; in the digital wallet world.</p>
<p>It said that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Magic Eden Wallet is the first digital wallet to be integrated directly with an NFT platform, enabling collectors to do more with their NFTs directly from within their wallet. A first-of-its-kind in the industry, Magic Eden takes an NFT-focused approach that emphasizes features and a wallet experience centered around a user&#8217;s digital collectibles.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides the simultaneous connection to multiple chains, the wallet features include portfolio tracking and management of all NFTs and collectibles across chains without switching between multiple wallets.</p>
<p>Additionally, it enables buying and selling with fiat, and access to decentralized applications (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dapp/">dapps</a>).</p>
<p>Users can manage and send Ordinals and BRC-20 with visibility into full transaction history, including pending transactions, it said.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magic-eden-wallet-beta/mkpegjkblkkefacfnmkajcjmabijhclg">According</a> to the web store description, payment methods include debit card, bank transfer, and <strong>Apple Pay</strong>. The wallet supports localized currency in select regions.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Jack Lu, CEO and Co-Founder of Magic Eden, argued that there is &#8220;too much friction when it comes to collecting NFTs across chains.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team wants to make this wallet the only one users need, Lu said. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to start testing our wallet in Beta and bring that NFT-focused thesis to the public market very soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier in November, Magic Eden announced <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/magic-eden-and-yuga-labs-unveil-ethereum-nft-marketplace-to-protect-creator-royalties.htm">a collaboration</a> on the Magic Eden Ethereum Marketplace with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/legal-action-threatened-over-eye-injuries-at-apefest-bored-ape-nft-holder-speaks-out.htm"><strong>Yuga Labs</strong></a>, the maker of the popular <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club</strong> collection. It would become the first major Ethereum marketplace with a contractual obligation to uphold creator royalties, the companies said.</p>
<p>A month earlier, the consortium of major companies <strong>OMA3</strong> (the Open Metaverse Alliance for Web3) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bored-apes-creator-yuga-labs-magic-eden-collaborate-fix-nft-royalties-problem-whats-going-on.htm">formed a working group</a> to find the best way to standardize creator royalties on NFT marketplaces. The group announced a &#8220;defense of NFT creator royalties, including the support of Magic Eden, Yuga Labs, <strong>Animoca Brands</strong>, and the rest of our fantastic membership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in February, Magic Eden <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-uk-goes-after-unregistered-crypto-atm-operators-s-korea-watching-the-ripple-sec-battle-silvergate-execs-investigated-by-law-firm-bitget-to-collaborate-on-cbdcs.htm">partnered</a> with Web3 infrastructure company <strong>MoonPay</strong> to enable users to easily purchase NFTs with a few clicks using payment rails familiar to them.</p>
<p>The press release said that Magic Eden has facilitated over $3 billion in transactional volume to date.</p>

Lawmakers on Monday called on the government to close a legal loophole that limited the SFC’s ability to respond to platforms that are unlicensed but not banned, allowing them to continue trading within an &#8220;unregulated vacuum.&#8221; Police on Saturday revealed they had received 88 reports from 131 people who said they had lost nearly HK$120 million.

<p>The Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/final-fantasy-publisher-square-enix-reveals-how-to-obtain-nfts-for-upcoming-game-symbiogenesis.htm"><strong>Square Enix</strong></a> has begun the character non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nike-rtfkt-nft-collections-generate-1-4-billion-in-trading-volume.htm">NFT</a>) auction for its game <strong>Symbiogenesis</strong>, less than a month before its launch.</p>
<p>The official website <a href="https://docs.symbiogenesis.app/docs/roadmap">shows</a> the game is scheduled for launch on December 21.</p>
<p>&#x200d;Once users log in to the game, an additional 400EXP will be added to the Daily Reward for holding the NFT Characters.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, be sure to hold on to these NFTs and have your <strong>MetaMask</strong> wallet and Discord account ready before starting the game,&#8221; the <strong>Final Fantasy </strong>series creator said.</p>
<p>As the launch of this <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Polygon</strong> NFT game approaches, Square Enix revealed auction details.</p>
<p>It will be held in three phases, <a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1728043137128436142">according</a> to the company&#8217;s tweet.</p>
<p>The first one starts today, November 27, and lasts until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Phase 2 is scheduled for November 30 until December 1. The third phase will follow on December 2, also lasting 24 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.symbiogenesis.app/docs/roadmap">According</a> to the website, the first phase is &#8216;Stakeholder Mint,&#8217; the second &#8216;Priority Mint,&#8217; and the third &#8216;AL Mint&#8217;.</p>
<p>Square Enix will launch only <a href="https://docs.symbiogenesis.app/docs/shopinfo">500 NFTs</a> for Chapter 1 of the game. Ten characters are allocated for the first phase, 90 for the second, and 400 for the third.</p>
<p>Users can bid only on one character in Phases 1 and 2. There are no limits in Phase 3.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the team announced additional perks for the bidders.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136651" style="width: 619px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1729075642359296381"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136651" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701083501-screenshot-2023-11-27-114813.png" alt="" width="619" height="425" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701083501-screenshot-2023-11-27-114813.png 619w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701083501-screenshot-2023-11-27-114813-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136651" class="wp-caption-text">Source: symbiogenesisPR / Twitter</figcaption></figure>
<p>As <em>Cryptonews</em> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/final-fantasy-publisher-square-enix-reveals-how-to-obtain-nfts-for-upcoming-game-symbiogenesis.htm">reported</a>, there is no public mint for Symbiogenesis. Users had to participate in the Allow List Entry Campaign to mint NFT Characters in any phase.</p>
<p>Also, the Phase 2 Priority Mint offers a chance to get characters for free, but becoming top in rank in the Campaign is necessary.</p>
<h2>Auction Rules</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As noted, the auction is open only to those who were selected for the Allow List during the Allow List Entry Campaign.</p>
<p>For Phases 1 and 2, bidders who are outbid and fall below second place will be eligible to bid on a different character.</p>
<p>Participants in Phase 2 are eligible for Phase 3, where they are allowed to bid on more than one character.</p>
<p>The mint price for all phases begins from 0 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-breaches-2000-resistance-time-to-buy.htm">ETH</a>. Bidding can be made in 0.01 ETH increments. Each bid will incur gas fees.</p>
<p>An English Auction will occur if other bidders are on the line. No midway cancellations are allowed for the bidder who is first in position.</p>
<p>If a bid is made within the final 5 minutes of a phase, the mint period for that character will be extended by an additional 5 minutes &#8220;to ensure a clearer final bidding process, as well to avoid potential confusion due to last-minute bids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winners must claim their NFT Characters by December 6. The gas fee for each claim is the responsibility of the user.</p>
<p>Additionally, participants who hold onto their NFT Characters and log into the game with the same wallet by December 28 will receive an extra 5 Replica Issue Points on December 29.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week in crypto: a lot! This a lot included Binance, CZ, Sam Altman, OpenAI, Kraken, Coinbase, lawsuits, banks, hacks…</p>
<p>First up: Binance! What a week for the exchange. Prosecutors were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-prosecutors-move-to-block-former-binance-ceo-cz-return-to-uae.htm">pressing a federal judge to prevent former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao from leaving the US</a> before his scheduled sentencing hearing, and then, CZ was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-cz-released-on-175-million-bond.htm">released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond after his guilty plea</a>, and as part of the settlement with the US DOJ, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">CZ resigned from Binance which agreed to pay a hefty $4.3 billion</a> in penalties. Binance wallets <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-wallets-move-approximately-4-billion-in-stablecoin-ahead-of-doj-settlement.htm">moved $3.9 billion worth of USDT</a> ahead of the settlement, CZ was reportedly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-still-worth-15-billion-despite-guilty-plea-forbes.htm">still worth $15 billion</a> despite pleading guilty to federal money laundering charges, and former Head of Regional Markets <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">Richard Teng took over as CEO</a>.</p>
<p>Per one report, Binance’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nansen-report-binances-total-asset-holdings-remain-stable-after-doj-settlement.htm">total asset holdings remained stable</a> after the DOJ settlement, another said the outflow was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptoquant-reports-decline-in-binances-bitcoin-reserves-as-retail-flow-shifts-to-coinbase.htm">shifting towards Coinbase</a>, JPMorgan said Binance’s settlement marked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-says-binances-record-4-3b-settlement-removes-systemic-risk-calls-it-positive.htm">a positive development for the company</a> and the broader cryptocurrency sector, Bernstein argued Binance will <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bernstein-report-binance-will-remain-the-top-global-crypto-exchange-despite-doj-settlement.htm">maintain its position as the dominant global exchange</a>, and Brian Armstrong stated the settlement is a chance for the industry <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-sees-binance-settlement-as-chance-for-industry-renewal.htm">to prioritize rule clarity to prevent regulators from slamming huge fines</a> on companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AltmanGate continued and became only weirder. Top management of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/openai-scrambles-to-prevent-staff-from-leaving-having-intense-discussions-report.htm">OpenAI was scrambling to “reunify” the organization</a> following the dramatic ousting of the co-founder Sam Altman, and WLD jumped amid the news that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoins-wld-gains-6-as-sam-altman-joins-microsoft-to-lead-its-new-ai-research-team.htm">Microsoft hired Altman and Greg Brockman</a>. But then a twist! Altman <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-altman-to-return-back-to-openai-whats-going-on.htm">will return back to run the company as the CEO</a> under a new board.</p>
<p>The US regulators weren’t done, though. The SEC came after Kraken again, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-faces-sec-charges-for-unlawful-crypto-trading-operations.htm">claiming securities law violations and internal control failures</a>, Jesse Powell called the US regulators <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm">masochists attacking America and extortionists chasing crypto companies</a> out of the country, and US Senator <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/senator-cynthia-lummis-slams-sec-for-its-ruling-by-enforcement-approach-following-kraken-lawsuit.htm">Cynthia Lummis slammed the SEC for its “ruling by enforcement” approach</a> following the Kraken lawsuit. Meanwhile, Coinbase again called on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-seeks-us-courts-assistance-to-compel-sec-on-crypto-rule-making.htm">the US justice system to persuade the SEC</a> to provide clear regulatory guidelines on crypto assets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contrasting with the crisis experienced by exchanges like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-linked-anthropic-declines-openais-merger-and-leadership-offer.htm"><strong>FTX</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-lists-new-solana-based-meme-coin-amidst-2500-price-surge-bull-market-officially-here.htm"><strong>Binance</strong></a> has demonstrated greater resilience in its net flows, <a href="https://blog.ccdata.io/the-aftermath-of-the-battle-between-binance-and-the-doj-83fd2e376e00">according</a> to digital asset data provider <strong>CCData</strong>. During the FTX crisis, Binance saw an outflow of close to $1 billion in BTC within one hour. Since the official US <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-sees-binance-settlement-as-chance-for-industry-renewal.htm"><strong>DOJ</strong></a> announcement on Tuesday, Binance saw outflows across major assets (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC) &#8211; an aggregated ~$800m of outflows across specified assets. “This comparison highlights the market&#8217;s perception of risk, potentially influenced by new compliance requirements imposed on Binance by the US government, offering some assurance to investors and reducing counterparty risk,” the report said. The speculation caused by pre-announcements created a significant spike in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-binance-saw-significant-outflows-since-cz-announcement-kucoin-launches-kucard-10101-art-reveals-sale-of-banksys-turf-war.htm">BNB’s</a> open interest (OI), with over $100m in OI added within a one day period. The current OI remains close to its highs, indicating further speculation on BNB, it concluded.</li>
<li>“The big trend we’re seeing is capital flowing out of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/usa/">US</a> and going predominantly global, and a lot of that has come to Asia,“ said Dmitry Lapidus, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/venture-capital-firm-coinfund-raises-158-million-to-drive-innovation-in-early-stage-crypto-and-ai-companies.htm"><strong>CoinFund</strong></a>&#8216;s newly-appointed senior liquid analyst based in Hong Kong, tasked with building out the firm’s presence in the region. New York-based crypto-focused venture capital (VC) firm CoinFund made this first hire in Hong Kong, aiming to expand in Asia, The South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3242218/us-crypto-vc-firm-coinfund-expands-asia-after-first-hire-hong-kong-clear-regulations-pull-factor">reported</a>. CoinFund is seeing more crypto trading and more crypto entrepreneurs coming from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/asia/">Asia</a>, where the firm is hoping to expand its reach, Lapidus said.</li>

Hence, it became the seventh company to apply formally and “the first major industry player to apply under a new legal regime aimed at transforming the city into a regional crypto hub,” The South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3242316/crypto-giant-okx-applies-hong-kong-licence-becoming-first-major-exchange-file-under-citys-virtual">reported</a>. It submitted the application on November 16, according to the <strong>Securities and Futures Commission</strong> (SFC) website. <strong>PantherTrade</strong>, an exchange with apparent ties to <strong>Futu Holdings</strong>, submitted its application the day before OKX, the report said.</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-us-treasury-sanctions-crypto-using-russian-money-launderer-northern-data-expects-loss-and-may-list-cloud-unit.htm"><strong>BingX</strong></a> announced the launch of its rebranding initiative. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/bingx-rebrands-to-forge-better-crypto-traders-301996711.html">According</a> to the press release, the exchange updated its visual identity to make the trading experience more intuitive and user-friendly. The revamped design simplifies its logo by smoothing the outline and removing internal shading, focusing on a cleaner and more direct aesthetic that aligns with users&#8217; trading goals, it said. Over the next few months, BingX will undergo a comprehensive visual transformation, including updates to its color palette and typography across mobile and desktop platforms.</li>

<p>Carl Erik Rinsch, the director of &#8220;47 Ronin,&#8221; allegedly used nearly $60 million &#8211; that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-netflix-crypto-scam-documentary-excites-but-also-razzle-dazzles.htm"><strong>Netflix</strong></a> had given him for a sci-fi series &#8211; to invest in the crypto and stock markets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/business/carl-rinsch-netflix-conquest.html">According</a> to The New York Times, Netflix gave the director more than $55 million, along with a near-total budgetary and creative freedom.</p>
<p>It never got a single finished episode back.</p>
<p>Instead, Rinsch reportedly used a large portion of the budget to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>He then went on to spend millions on cars, furniture, and designer clothing.</p>
<p>The report cited cast, crew members, emails, and court filings in a divorce case brought by Rinsch&#8217;s wife.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Red Flags&#8217;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Netflix battled other streaming giants for Rinsch&#8217;s new show called <em>Organic Intelligent</em>, which Netflix renamed to <em>Conquest</em>.</p>
<p>The company agreed to pay $61.2 million in several installments for the rights to the series.</p>
<p>But Netflix ignored several red flags, the report said. A major one is that Rinsch was still fighting <strong>30West</strong> and other early investors, which subsequently received $14 million of the $61 million from Netflix under a legal settlement.</p>
<p>In March 2020, Rinsch asked Netflix for more money. By that point, they had already spent $44.3 million and were reluctant to give more as Rinsch had missed several production milestones.</p>
<p>Still, to save the production, Netflix sent Rinsch’s production company $11 million. This brought the total to more than $55 million.</p>
<p>However, Rinsch’s behavior &#8220;grew erratic,&#8221; the NYT said. He claimed he had discovered Covid-19’s secret transmission mechanism and was able to predict lightning strikes and volcano eruptions.</p>
<h2>&#8216;God Bless Crypto&#8217;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Rinsch went on to spend the project funds on investments, many of which failed.</p>
<p>This included the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> index and shares of the biotech firm <strong>Gilead Sciences</strong>. He lost $5.9 million in weeks.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Netflix stopped funding <em>Conquest</em>. Rinsch, however, started using what remained of the $11 million Netflix had sent to bet on crypto.</p>
<p>He transferred more than $4 million to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-slams-sec-for-assault-on-america.htm"><strong>Kraken</strong></a> exchange and bought <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-1-billion-trading-volume-comes-in-are-whales-buying-the-dip.htm">dogecoin (DOGE)</a>.</p>
<p>This one paid off, said the NYT, stating that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When he liquidated his Dogecoin positions in May 2021, he had a balance of nearly $27 million.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rinsch wrote in an online chat with a Kraken representative: &#8220;Thank you and god bless crypto.&#8221;</p>
<p>He then bought five Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari, a Vacheron Constantin watch, high-end furniture, and designer clothing, totaling $8.7 million.</p>
<p>The legal team of Rinsch&#8217;s wife, Gabriela Rosés Bentancor, suggested in the divorce proceedings that the buying spree was designed to hide Rinsch’s crypto winnings.</p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Rinsch and Netflix are currently locked in a confidential arbitration proceeding, with a ruling expected soon.</p>
<p>Rinsch claims that Netflix breached their contract and owes him $14 million in damages.</p>
<p>He first argued that the cars and furniture were props for <em>Conquest</em>, bought with Netflix’s production money. But then, in his arbitration case, he said that the money spent was contractually his.</p>
<p>On its part, Netflix said any payments were contingent on the director hitting production milestones &#8211; which he had failed to do.</p>
<p>Thomas Cherian, a Netflix spokesman, told the NYT the company had provided substantial funding, but “after a lot of time and effort, it became clear that Mr. Rinsch was never going to complete the project he agreed to make, and so we wrote the project off.”</p>
<p>Rinsch declined to comment, the report said.</p>

Per the press release, the round <a href="https://twitter.com/MapleLeafCap/status/1727609233234112545">was led</a> by <strong>Folius Ventures</strong> and co-led by <strong>SevenX</strong>, with participation from <strong>ABCDE Capital</strong>, <strong>Find Satoshi Lab</strong>, <strong>Initiate Capital</strong>, and <strong>Jambo</strong>. Matr1x previously attracted financial backing from entities such as <strong>Hana Financial Group</strong>, <strong>Hashkey Capital</strong>, <strong>SevenX</strong>, and <strong>Amber Group</strong>. It is currently developing a trilogy that revolves around a narrative depicting the conflict between centralized and decentralized data entities, with an emphasis on data sovereignty and NFT transferability. It is also working on the upcoming mint of <strong>Kuku</strong>, Matr1x’s third NFT collection, which will serve as an NFT pass for governance access and revenue sharing of its creator economy, and upgradable battle pet for holders. &#8220;This raise comes during a time of hyper-growth and innovation at the company, following incredibly successful Alpha testing in August of this year, which saw 200,000 registrations, 100,000 downloads, 15,000 daily active users, with a 2-hour average session-time per day,&#8221; Matrix said.</li>

Per the announcement, the app will leverage <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-visas-ambitious-crypto-product-roadmap-bitgets-on-ramp-service-for-visa-mastercard-crypto-purchases-fractal-xrpl-partner-on-kycaml-aptos-labs-teams-up-with-ledger.htm">peaq</a> as part of its decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) powering a <strong>Google Maps</strong>-style service. MapMetrics will use peaq IDs, now compatible with Solana, for secure data authentication. They&#8217;re also creating a community voting mechanism for users to contribute to the navigation service by marking objects like speed cameras and validating their location with votes. Furthermore, peaq is expanding its Multi-Chain Machine IDs to support Solana, with earlier updates adding support for other major networks like <strong>Binance’s</strong> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-opbnb-becomes-2nd-most-popular-l2-per-dau-ripple-reveals-upgraded-ripple-payments-bitwala-relaunches-with-strigas-help.htm"><strong>BNB Chain</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/erc-4437-promised-an-ethereum-revolution-adoption-figures-tell-a-different-story.htm">Ethereum</a> Virtual Machine</strong>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-11-former-revolut-spotify-and-coinbase-leaders-unveil-zeal-wallet-ondo-finance-launches-tokenized-us-treasury-product-on-injective.htm"><strong>Cosmos</strong></a>.</li>

This novel approach limited the potential for margin reductions, the exchange said. Key advantages of spot integration into Portfolio Margin Mode include reduced margin requirements (by offsetting profits and losses between spot and derivatives positions, traders can potentially achieve lower overall margin requirements, enhancing capital efficiency) and seamless integration (spot positions integrate seamlessly into the Portfolio Margin Mode, allowing traders to manage their entire portfolio within a single platform.)</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitget-releases-position-grids-to-reshape-digital-asset-trading.htm"><strong>Bitget</strong></a> launched Arabic lingual support for eleven <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/middle-east/">Middle-Eastern</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/africa/">North African</a> countries accessible on its mobile application and website. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/bitget-introduces-arabic-support-for-crypto-trading-in-middle-east-and-north-african-countries-301996635.html">Per</a> the announcement, the lingual support for MENA-based users will provide smoother learning processes and communication to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Users can now trade cryptocurrencies in over 12 Middle Eastern currencies and over 590 tokens listed on Bitget. The language support extends to utilizing P2P, Earn, Futures, Copy-trading, and other features on the platform. Additionally, users in the Middle East will benefit from zero fees for buying and selling cryptocurrencies through Bitget P2P. This move aligns with the exchange providing support for fiat gateways in the Middle East region for seven currencies, including Dinars, Riyals, and Ouguiyas, it said.</li>
